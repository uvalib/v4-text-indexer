      <field name="fulltext">The Stage represents a Saloon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. MADDALEN. O wretched me! O dismal wedding day! Break fated heart, and rather to the tomb Let me be borne than to the bridal bed, Incestuous to my soul. Valdini's wife! Wife to the father of my lov'd Lorenzo!â The sworn accepted husband of my heart. What dire delusion drew me on to this? Knew I not well my uncle's ruthless mind? How could I hope, or on despair rely? O deadly apathy! O mortal hour, In which I put these gaudy trappings on, And gave my hand. This faithless hand, so oft' The glowing record of Lorenzo's passion, Is to his father pledg'd, for love, for faith, For all that ere I cherish'd for Lorenzo. Ah hapless son! son? mine? my lover mine! SCENE II. Maddalen and Lorenzo. MADDALEN. Ha! Lorenzo! LORENZO. You here! O Maddalen! MADDALEN. Leave me, go, go.â LORENZO. Ah rather on thy bier, Unhappy fair, would I have seen thee laid, Than with this bridal garnishing bedeck'd. MADDALEN. Despise, upbraid me; but in harsher terms, That I may learn to be your step-mother.â Recount my perjuries; recall the scenes, Where we in childhood, innocent and free, As th'infant Cupid on his bed of flowers, Lov'd without knowing Love. Or if you think, My fickle heart will scorn the baby-tale, Describe some transport of our warmer passion.â Paint the secluded bower where last we met, While all the mild and blushing western sky, Glow'd like the flame of Love's delightful torch, And my fond heart, first, felt thy bosom beat. LORENZO. O Maddalen, my ever dear adored. MADDALEN. Horror! avaunt! this is thy father's hand. SCENE III. LORENZO. In what strange chaos do I find myself? The film of flax is stronger in the flame, Than all my resolutions in her presence. Why stay I ling'ring and resolving still? To me she cannot be unmarried; never! Sure some fatality abhorred detains me; Some devil plotting for my better part. SCENE IV. Valdini and Lorenzo. VALDINI. Lorenzo! how is this? still sad, still thoughtful. Since first I told you I had fixt to marry, Your face has chang'd, and with a slighting eye You oft, too pettishly, have heard and noted, Those preparations, not extravagant, Which our condition claims for such events. And know you not the marriage is perform'd? LORENZO. I do, my Lord. VALDINI. Politeness might have taught, At least, to feign a joy for the occasion. I did expect a little more from you. 'Tis true I am your father.â LORENZO. O my Lord! VALDINI. And step-mother's are often bad enough; But you are not a child; and, as I hope, My wife has qualities that you may love. I have inform'd you, that, in early youth, My heart was pledg'd to Maddalena's mother, But victims, at the shrine of family pride, We both were sacrificed. I went, abroad, Soon after my espousal of your mother; Who, had she liv'd, might have redeem'd my heart. She died in giving birth to you. LORENZO. My Lord! VALDINI. Her ample dowery, great beyond my wants, With just economy for you I nursed; And now I come to render my account, With the full rights, estates, and moveables. I ever held them but as family trusts, Although they cost me all my youthful hopes. Think not the offspring of a second bed, Shall touch one tittle that to you belongs. LORENZO. O my good Lord! my truly noble father! You know me not. Of small import to me, Are these vile documents of ill-starr'd love. Keep them, and with them all that they convey, For some more happy progeny. VALDINI. My dear Lorenzo! you perplex me much. What is this grief that presses down your mind? 'Tis not my marriage then that vexes you? What mean you? speak? LORENZO. 'Tis now, alas, too late! SCENE V. Dutchess and Valdini. DUTCHESS. Joy! joy, my Lord! how does my Lady niece? But why alone? True lovers, fresh like you, Should be at other sport. Tut, musty parchments! Go; go and rustle silks. Where's my sweetheart? VALDINI. Whom? DUTCHESS. Don Lorenzo, my dear nephew now. O! how I long to tease the snappish dog, He used to turn on me so snarling. VALDINI. Why? DUTCHESS. I took such pleasure to disturb his wooing. VALDINI. Wooing! DUTCHESS. Desperate wooing. O he was mad! Mad as Leander, who across the sea Swam every night, while Ero, cunning toad, Stood at th'uncurtain'd window with a light, His polar star, the pharos of his port! But love, sweet love, makes conjurors of all. VALDINI. I never heard of Don Lorenzo's passion! DUTCHESS. No! How delightful! but the Duke is here; And he has grown so stern and sour of late, That I am scarcely free to breathe with him. I'll to the bride and feel her palpitations. SCENE VI. Duke and Valdini. DUKE. Bridegroom? VALDINI. Well! DUKE. Grave! with solemn parchments too! Strange occupation for your wedding-day.â My prattling Dutchess has been teasing? VALDINI. No. Her Grace is gaily hearted, and delights To catch the flying pleasures as they pass. But she has told me news. DUKE. I hope not bad? VALDINI. Not, certainly, as she appears to think. Has e'er your Grace heard of Lorenzo's passion? DUKE. Passion, my Lord! what passion? VALDINI. Love. DUKE. For whom? VALDINI. As yet I have not heard, but much I fearâ DUKE. 'Tis a conceit of her'sâgive it no heed. VALDINI. But I have seen my son thoughtful and sad. DUKE. (Fool that I was, not to prepare for this.) VALDINI. My Lord? DUKE. My Lord? VALDINI. I thought your Grace had spoken. DUKE. I said it must be some slight flame. With whom? VALDINI. I, rather, fear 'tis an unworthy charm, Something his reason blushes to disclose. And yet he is not one of that complexion. I know himâjust, high-minded and topful Of noble magnanimityâall that Becomes his birth and splendid expectation. DUKE. Such often err a little from the straight. VALDINI. True! but the errant ever show some glimpse Of livelier spirit than Lorenzo bears. A mild, a temperate virtue, meek but firm, Pervades his gen'rous nature. I am vext, And will to-morrow question him myself. DUKE. My wife was gossiping to tell you this. VALDINI. Not so, my Lord; 'twas in her sprightly way, And but for something, troubled and distress'd, Which I had noticed in Lorenzo's mind, I should have, lightly, pass'd her Grace's wit.â He has refused to take his mother's dower. DUKE. How? VALDINI. He has. DUKE. You then have offer'd it? VALDINI. All. DUKE. Money and Estates? VALDINI. Yes: all I possess'd. DUKE. How meant you then to keep your own degree? VALDINI. My pensions, recompence of faithful service, And the small relic that has still been spared, By a long line of wasteful prodigals, Make yet enough for a philosopher. DUKE. But for my neice? VALDINI. My wife, I trust, will learn On better ground to build her happiness, Than fleeting wealth affords. Your Grace knows well, How slight a tenure, in this changeful age, We hold for all that makes us what we are. DUKE. She had been better with your son. VALDINI. My Lord!â To-day, from you, I can take no offence. If wealth was all her aimâLorenzo's wealth, Doubtless, surpasses mine an hundred fold. DUKE. He too is young, her match in years. VALDINI. Well, well, Let all that pass, the marriage now is o'er. Your pardon, 'till I put these papers by. SCENE VII. DUKE. What have I done? Who could have fancied this? I thought the Count had been a man of sense! To live so long in the great world of courts; To deal and traffic with the bought and sold, And ever too with most renown'd success; And yet to talk like a romantic youth!â A very boy o'er his poetic scrawls, Could not have feign'd a wilder flight than this. O! how have I been so beside myself? To trust this fool of nature, and to give Him due and credence for the fame he bears: A fame obtain'd by fortune's accidents!â Dolt that I was, not to suspect his weakness. And I have sacrificed poor Maddalen! SCENE VIII. Dutchess and Duke. DUTCHESS. Fine work! fine work! a merry wedding-day! The bridgroom here, with parchments in his hand, Majestically grave: the bride, forlorn, There, with a handkerchief dejected sits, Wiping away her final virgin tears. Were she in process of a lewd divorce, Caught in the fact, she could not sob it more. DUKE. Your silly meddling and unruly tongue, Is ever breeding trouble. What is this, That you have loosely chattered to the Count? DUTCHESS. O! to be sure, all that mishaps in mine! I put the odious parchments in his hand, I put the dismal handkerchief in her's. DUKE. Woman! no more of this! Hear my firm will. Never again speak you that e'er between The Countess and her son, Lorenzo. Mark! DUTCHESS. Her son! DUKE. Ought pass'd but such as freely may, In mixt assembly, pass with laugh and freak Of youthful gaiety. Mind nothing more. DUTCHESS. O heart of me! I always thought no good Could come of their nocturnal whisperings. But lovers will be lovers, certain sure. DUKE. There is more hazard in your giddy head, Than in your foolish tongue. DUTCHESS. Good words my Lord. I'll be as silent as your ancestors, Ay, where they sit upon their monuments, In what concerns the honour of our house.â I'll to her instantly and tax her with 't. DUKE. Heav'ns and earth! the woman is possess'd! But here Lorenzo comes, let us be calm. DUTCHESS. In truth, a handsome portly youth to see; A pleasant vision to a lady's eye. SCENE IX. Lorenzo, Duke, and Dutchess. LORENZO. I thought the Count, my father, had been here. DUKE. He just has stepp'd into his closet. Well! And so, Lorenzo, you refuse to take Your mother's princely dower? DUTCHESS. Have I my ears? LORENZO. Doubtless, my Lord, 'tis much to your content. DUKE. Could I have but devined the Count'sâ LORENZO. No more! No more of that! What is done, is.â DUTCHESS. Poor youth! LORENZO. The fortune all shall yet be Maddalen'sâ Her children yet shall have their mother's price. DUTCHESS. Hark ye! some one of them may be your own. LORENZO. Ha! what malignant fiend predicts to thee? SCENE X. Duke and Lorenzo. DUKE. What said the Dutchess? LORENZO. Wretch! DUKE. How now? What's this? LORENZO. Yes, sordid wretch! Curs'd trafficker in hearts, When thou art damn'd, be it thy punishment To writhe in molten gold. DUKE. Sure he is mad! LORENZO. Had I but told my father, trusted him, His noble nature would have sav'd us all. O fatal diffidence! O deadly doubt! O hesitation that decides too late! DUKE. I can no longer, sir! brook this contempt. LORENZO. Contempt! no; abhorrence, triple accurs'd! The loathsome toad, with its foul speckled breast, Is less detestable than thou art, wretch! With thy crime-spotted soul. DUKE. Draw, draw, I say! LORENZO. Would'st thou to hell so soon? DUKE. Draw, villain! draw! LORENZO. Villain from thee!âVillain! put up thy sword. DUKE. I will, I will. LORENZO. Ay do: go use thy purse. SCENE XI. LORENZO. Here I am not myself: each petty word That bears allusion to my former state, Like the small spark that fires a magazine, With terrible combustion fills my breast.â To-morrowâyes, to-morrow, I will go. But if so soon, what will my father think? And yet, he must not know the painful cause. The sacrifice is made! Then let not me, By wild temerity, make worse the ill. No: but the rather, all that in me lies, Use for a happier aimâagain the Dutchess. SCENE XII. Dutchess and Lorenzo. DUTCHESS. Lorenzo! is the Duke gone hence, Lorenzo? LORENZO. Yes. Well? DUTCHESS. Come, come, we shall be friends again. LORENZO. (A garrulous good-hearted soul.) We shall.â Pardon my fury. DUTCHESS. Never speak of it. Between ourselves, the Duke's aâI know what. He is so gruff and turkish in his way, By Mary, Virgin, I am more his slave Than his true Dutchess, wedded by the hand. 'Tis all his doing, this dull wedding-day. LORENZO. Most true it is. DUTCHESS. No joke, no revelry. I might, as well, have come in weeds of woe, As in my jewels, and this gay brockade, Bought purposely. See this delightful flounce! My own device! No respite, day nor night, I gave th'embroid'rer till it was complete. Behold what it has come to! Heaven look to't! But solemn visages and wat'ry eyes, Are dismal omens on a wedding-day. And lo! the bride, dull as the moon eclips'd. SCENE XIII. Maddalen and Dutchess. MADDALEN. Your grace alone! DUTCHESS. No: here!âWhy, what is this? As I have soul in me, the world's depraved; All courtesy and gentle manners gone, And weddings held as sad obsequies. Here was I standing, as I thought I was; Holding a chat in pleasant negligence With Don Lorenzo. But, he, like a ghost, A vapoury ghost, has vanish'd into air.â Well! by my troth, I have good cause to fret. Snubb'd and brow-beaten when I would make mirth,â As little heeded as a cuckoo clock. I may, as well, at once, go say my prayers. MADDALEN. Truly, dear aunt, all inauspicious lowers. In vain, in vain, I would my heart controul, But still some dire tempestuous thought succeeds, And whirls me to despair. DUTCHESS. It is not wise To think so much, now that your knell is rung. MADDALEN. O hopeless me! it was, indeed, my knell. DUTCHESS. Go to, go to.âCatch not my words so sadly. You're not the first, as I could tell myself, That has been worried from her own true love. But thank your stars, since they would have it so, That you have got a husband, gracious, noble; A man, who, but to say the least of him, Is worth ten thousand dukes; and then his sonâ MADDALEN. Ah! name him not, let me forget him now. O idle wish, that only serves to bring His darling image warmer to my heart. DUTCHESS. Fye! These obstrep'rous fits become you ill. He was your lover: dangled here and there, Made piteous sonnets to your smiles and tears; Danc'd with you, laugh'd with you, and if 'twere known, Perhaps, a score or two of kisses stole. The world is old, and such things are not new: Come, pass them by, and think of other cheer.â I have got news that will content your heart. MADDALEN. Alas, to me, all tidings are alike. My part and int'rest in this world is done. DUTCHESS. Lorenzoâ MADDALEN. Dearest, ever worshipp'd, name, Be thou the word of courage to my soul, In the great enterprize that I have sworn. DUTCHESS. Tut, tut, niece! you displease me much.âNo more. You know his mother's wealth and large estates, Without restraint, were to his father given. MADDALEN. For them, I know that I was sold and doomed. DUTCHESS. Well! who could think, what the good count has done? Resign'd them all to him! MADDALEN. What! to Lorenzo? DUTCHESS. All! MADDALEN. Just, noble, father! Now what says the duke? What says the bargainer? My brain is fired. DUTCHESS. But not one florin will Lorenzo touch, So all is safe. What means this hideous laugh? Heav'ns! are ye sane? Why do ye glare at me? O! I am terrified.âNiece! Maddalen! O my sweet Maddalen! help!â MADDALEN. Hush! there's none.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Valdini and Lorenzo. VALDINI. I ask no more; convinc'd that this decision, Springs from just cause for manly resolution; That prudence also dictates to conceal. But when do you depart? LORENZO. To-morrow. VALDINI. How! So soon! to-morrow? LORENZO. Speedily, I mean. I should say, rather, in a day or two. VALDINI. Lorenzo! Is there danger in delay? LORENZO. My lord! VALDINI. Reserve: I cannot then approve, When evil falls, and you see all its scope, Trust to the native courage of your breast, And such auxiliar aid as chance may send To master the misfortune: trust yourself, And trust your destiny; for such begets, That self possession which endures the shock Of rough adversity, and lifts the man Above the waves and currents of the time. But when the matter hangs in dread, and may, By strength or enterprize, be yet repell'd, Then call your friends, take counsel, and take aid. LORENZO. But when the fear in our own frailty lies? VALDINI. ('Tis so.) LORENZO. (What have I said? he seems disturb'd.) VALDINI. The dutchess told me, in her merry way, That you have been in love. LORENZO. My lord! my lord! VALDINI. Be not alarm'd: why, there is nothing in't. A thing most natural. But love is blind, And leads his votaries, oft, far from virtue. You now repent your passion? LORENZO. Pity me. VALDINI. 'Twas then unworthy you? Her grace, I think, Told me as much. LORENZO. (He knows but half the truth.) No, no, my lord; 'twas a most worthy love: Youth, beauty, virtue, and illustrious birth; All that could charm the heart and eye of youth, And claim the favour of sedater age. VALDINI. But you were not approv'd? LORENZO. Approv'd! alas! O! with such ardour.â VALDINI. Then why hid from me? Who is the lady? LORENZO. Seek to know no more, For she is married. VALDINI. Now, I am content. Enough; go when you will. But some one comes. The duke! LORENZO. Let me retire? VALDINI. O poor Lorenzo! SCENE II. Duke and Valdini. DUKE. Your brow is somewhat clear'd. The morning cloud Has vanish'd, and your face begins to show The solar aspect of a blithe bridegroom. VALDINI. My heart is eas'd. Lorenzo has been here, And so disclosed the secret of his gloom, That I am prouder still of such a son. Come, now we'll to the bride, nor keep the dutchess In longer expectation of the cheer. DUKE. Softly, my lord; call your philosophy. The heat to-day, and flurry in her thoughts, The nat'ral offspring of her maiden fancies, Have, who can sift these frailties from the fair? Compell'd the bride to take some short repose. VALDINI. What! and not I inform'd! DUKE. O a mere trifle, Count, women still are women, weaker vessels; And we should lightly look upon their flaws. VALDINI. Is not a physician call'd? DUKE. Fye, my lord, The dutchess and her maids are worth a college In such a case.âWhat has Lorenzo said? VALDINI. He has confess'd all that I wish'd to know. DUKE. His passion! well, with whom is he in love? VALDINI. It was not fit, for me, to ask him more. DUKE. No! VALDINI. Certainly, for she is married. DUKE. What! VALDINI. It might, as I the matter understand, Disturb the happiness, or taint the honour Of some illustrious house; therefore, my son Conceals it wisely. He has well resolv'd To shun the danger, and to seek abroad, In the variety of other lands, Solace for his distressing heart-disease. DUKE. And when does he depart? Not soon, I hope? VALDINI. With all convenient speedâperhaps to-morrow. DUKE. I am amaz'd! So soon? VALDINI. Virtue resolv'd, Can never act too soon. The countess here! DUKE. (He goes abroadâpatience, patience, revenge.) SCENE III. Valdini, Maddalen, and Duke. VALDINI. You still seem pale, and deeply agitated. MADDALEN. O! my good lord, I cannot bear this long. VALDINI. Where is the dutchess? she is ill indeed. A doctor instantly! MADDALEN. My uncle here! Why does he go? stop him, my lord, stop! stop! DUKE. (All, all will out: her brain is surely craz'd.) VALDINI. This cumb'rous dress, oppresses you, I think. MADDALEN. Why did I ever put it on? Off! off! Ye hateful vanities, ye load my head. My wretched head will rest without your weight. DUKE. This is wild speech. VALDINI. My lord! what have you done? DUKE. What? I! VALDINI. This is a fever of the mind. DUKE. A doctor should be here. MADDALEN. O stop! VALDINI. My lord! DUKE. What mean you, count, by this impassion'd tone? There is no danger. VALDINI. No! DUKE. (Angels and Saints!) MADDALEN. What has the duke done that you dare him so? VALDINI. What has he done? DUKE. (She seems to check herself.) MADDALEN. What has he done? for shame to ask so rudely, When he has given me to be your wife. 'Tis true he never promised me your heart, Nor could he promise mine to you. VALDINI. My lord! MADDALEN. The dutchess has been telling me a tale,â A dismal tale, I never heard before,â That the mild image smiling in yon picture, Was my own mother. DUKE. A sad tale, ill-timed. VALDINI. I crave your grace a million, million pardons. DUKE. You did indeed confound me, count. The dutchess, Still heedless, prattles, and must be endured. VALDINI. Ah my dear Maddalen, you have my heart; And with it too, that fixt and firm esteem, Which younger lovers seldom know to give. DUKE. He is your husband. MADDALEN. Had he been my fatherâ VALDINI. Ah! why that sigh? I will be both to you, Husband and father. MADDALEN. Horrible! horrible! SCENE IV. DUKE. How shall I from this labyrinth escape? Ever unguarded, in some luckless hour My wife may blab. And still, my honest care, This love-sick damsel, like a maniac treats; And raves of guilt and victims. On the edge, The brink of shame I walk; yet I meant good. No: I was not bound to tell the countâNoâ That's clear and fair. And how knew I their love? I was no confident. Rumour; report; But never proof by eye nor ear, had I,â Letter nor lay; not even foolish sonnet. This I can swear; all this! but the countâwell?â The count may say, I should have told him. What? Could I repeat to him my wife's conceit: He could not think, that one of my repute Would stoop to that. Yet, he may call it trick. Trick! fraud! to study my own niece's good! Po! sentimental stuff: he is a man, And will not whine such poetry of passion. SCENE V. Duke and Dutchess. DUKE. Come here! hither, I say! O woman! woman! What craz'd infernal meddles with thy brain? The raven's bode and owlet's evil cry, Are happier heraldings than thy jay-chatter. DUTCHESS. Your own mis-deeds, my lord, throw not on me. I wash my hands; and pure at these my palms, Is my poor conscience of this day's ill work. DUKE. What mean you? Ha! you turn'd accuser too? DUTCHESS. My lord, unhand me, or I'll raise the house. DUKE. Alas! alas! we have been man and wife, Full thirty years; would you betray me now? DUTCHESS. My lord! my lord! you make me very sad. DUKE. I am bewitch'dâI am beside myself; To take the thing in this outrageous sense, And thus to sink before a sillyâHa! SCENE VI. Duke, Lorenzo, and Dutchess. DUKE. (Hell! hateful sight.) LORENZO. Wonders will never cease! What! has the duke been puling for his faults? Or has he found in you such charms renew'd, That he was aping lovers adoration? DUTCHESS. 'Twas frolic allâI so become this dress: My youth seems so renew'd. LORENZO. No fibs, good aunt. DUKE. She's like the eagles, Don Lorenzo. LORENZO. What! Does she too prey on the innocent lambs? (Now the poison searches.) DUTCHESS. Gentle, Lorenzo. What a day is this? LORENZO. It is a wedding-day! A wedding-day! Come, my lord duke, look blithe. What! uncle, uncle, uncle, ho! come laugh? Give us the cheer, give us the wedding-joy, You made the feast. Ah, bungling cook, To leave out all the joy. DUTCHESS. (He too is touch'd.) DUKE. Softly, Lorenzo. O! in pity spareâ LORENZO. And has it come to this? Drink thy own chalice. Such pity as was shown to me and mine, Thou greedy dotard, I will show to thee. When two young hearts lay bleeding at your feet, How did you spurn and tread upon their pain? But now, when heav'n's red hand of fire is forth, Opening to seize and dash thee to thy doom, Think'st thou that I should spare? Should justice mar? DUKE. Who feels no pity, yet remorse may sting. LORENZO. What do I hear? audacious driv'ler, hence. DUTCHESS. He is not made of stone; in love forbear! LORENZO. Love! Love it is that nerves me to this pitch; Loves barbs my taunts, goads me to wring his heart. DUKE. Opprobrious boy! what knew I of your love? LORENZO. Does the cur turn? DUKE. Where is the proof? Where is the evidence? produce! produce! See, here I stand, ready to meet your charge. LORENZO. What juggling devil, tempts my quicken'd sword? Let me look at thee? poor old man!âbegone. SCENE VII. Dutchess and Lorenzo. DUTCHESS. Oh! my full heart will burst.âFye on you, fye! Who could have thought that one so mild as you, As soft in manners, as the silky fur Upon the bosom of a playing kitten, Could have been like a raging tyger fierce? The tyger dam robb'd of her helpless young, Is less tempestuous. Out on you; shame!â But woe and sorrow, never to be cured, Can come of these deliriums. Fye! Lorenzo. LORENZO. 'Tis the last time. Now he has felt the scorch; My rage shall flame no more. Deep in my breast The low unquenchable consuming fire Of my peculiar grief, forever hid, Shall ne'er again molest. I leave him now, To the rous'd scorpions of his own regrets. SCENE VIII. DUTCHESS. Sure, sure no good can come of plots and plans, That a weak woman's simple jointless talk, So often brings to jeopardy. I cannot speak, but flash and there's a storm;â Live silent; or but to say, yea or nay,â I may as well go lay me down to die. I'm a repeater, by my maker made; And when I'm press'd, must tell how the time goes. But I can stay at homeâlie on a shelfâ See no oneânothing hearâsit like an abbess; I may as well, with hood and veil, at once, Go serve my God; and for this sprightly fan, Sigh to a fly-benastyed crucifix. Was it for this, that I was made a dutchess? SCENE IX. Valdini and Dutchess. VALDINI. The countess, more composed, requests your grace.â DUTCHESS. I'm going home, She's now a wedded wife, And on her own discretion must depend. She was a babe; a sprawling, squalling babe, When she was given to these arms of mine: I cherish'd her, I bred her from the bud, Till she was all the rose that you have seen. VALDINI. What has eclips'd your grace's gaiety? DUTCHESS. She was the pride and apple of my eye; And all my hope and wish'd for recompence, Was to behold her happy wedding-day; And be to some sweet imp of her's again, What I had been to her. But what has chanced! VALDINI. It may be as you wish'd. DUCTHESS. My heart was high, And all the court and town knew how it beat: There's not a mill'ners wench that has not heard. O! I shall be the trading stock of scandal, For thrice nine days, and more. VALDINI. Patience, be calm. DUTCHESS. I won't be patient. How, my lord, can you Bear all this too, nor grudge along with me? Me-thinks you have good cause. VALDINI. 'Twas accident; And 'twould have been as well, had it so pleas'd Your grace to-day, not to have troubled her; I would myself, have ta'en a fitter time And told her all. DUTCHESS. Who could foresee That, rapt'rous as a nymph poetical, She would have rav'd about her mother's doom; And with such heart-affecting wail exclaim'd, That she, herself, was your predestin'd daughter. VALDINI. It had been better, had she known it sooner. DUTCHESS. There you say truth; but such, forsooth, is rank. Our dignities, the honours of our blood, Claim these concealments. Taints, sins, and divorces! All must be stored to break our hearts at last. VALDINI. Alas! too trueâyour words have wisdom's weight. DUTCHESS. Had it pleased Heav'n t've made me but the dame Of some blithe burgher, round and sound at heart, Whom I, at will, might have ta'en by the arm, And gone well-welcomed to our joking neighbours; I had been happier than with all this pomp, Titles, and carriagesâbegraced vexations. But madam comes. SCENE X. Valdini, Maddalen, and Dutchess. VALDINI. Come in the turn of time. Her grace is here offended, much incensed, And you must pacify. MADDALEN. Oh! how unfit. There is a full and thick'ning sadness here, That nothing earthly can remove. DUTCHESS. There now! At it again! MADDALEN. Pity, and chide me not. In vain, in vain I strive to check my grief. The fatal courage that sustained me through The deathful ceremony, is no more. VALDINI. (Oh! oh! this sorrow is not new.) MADDALEN. My lord! VALDINI. A sudden pang across my temples shot. MADDALEN. Heav'n help us all! DUTCHESS. Amen! may well say I! VALDINI. 'Tis pastâ'twas momentaryâlet's be gay. DUTCHESS. My heart is changedâI have no mind for mirth. I could in some sad corner sit and cry. VALDINI. Where is the duke? Why, what dejects your grace? Where is the duke, I say? O! Maddalen, Why look you on me so amaz'd? MADDALEN. My lord! VALDINI. Well. Speak! MADDALEN. Call no one here! DUTCHESS. She frightens me. MADDALEN. Hear and record, ye regist'rers of heaven. To-day, I at the sacred altar knelt, A virgin pure, and took the marriage vow, To be to this high-honoured, virtuous man, A faithful wife. Again, I take the oath,â While in my heart revolves the tide of life; While sense can act and minister to thought, I will, even to the syllable, perform All my tremendous vow. Why call the duke? VALDINI. Alas! you, in this awful act, but show What I should ne'er have known, or known before. DUTCHESS. I'll to a nunnery, this very night. MADDALEN. Ha! where was I, not to have thought of that, Before my fatal vows. VALDINI. Within? help, help! SCENE XI. Valdini, Dutchess, Lorenzo and Maddalen. LORENZO. Now she revives. DUTCHESS. O my sweet Maddalen! 'Tis I, your poor old auntâknow you me not? Off cursed glitter, wrap of misery. Oh! better in a ragged blanket, driv'n From titled thresholds, weeping for a crumb, Than to have known what I have known to-day. What would you here, Lorenzo? MADDALEN. Gentle vision! LORENZO. O Maddalen! my lovely Maddalen! MADDALEN. I am thy mother, boy. VALDINI. It is Lorenzo!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. DUKE. He has departed; but the ruffians staunch Will hound his track, before the setting sun Has turn'd the mountain shadows from the vale, And will be posted in the olive wood: There let him bloody lie, gash'd to the heart.â He'd do as much for me. What had I done, To be so stabb'd by scorn; and like one curs'd, Shook o'er the crater of the fiery deep, And scourg'd with execrations? Do I not, By this revenge, draw on the taunted doom? For him, I may have over-reach'd myself, And cast my own eternal gem away! SCENE II. Valdini and Duke. VALDINI. Where is my son? Where has Lorenzo gone? DUKE. (Then it is done. He cannot me suspect.) VALDINI. What! dumb? Why do you press your downward face So with your clenched hand, and hang so shrunk, Crampt on the start? Sure there is guilt in thee!â And this dire marriage was compell'd and forc'd In the full knowledge of Lorenzo's passion! Answer me? DUKE. Yes: no. VALDINI. Yes! no! DUKE. ('Tis not so.) VALDINI. What is not so? Cannot your grace reply? DUKE. (It is not as I fear'd.) I'm better now. VALDINI. Old man, old man, retire to thy confessor. All is too plain. I ask to learn no more! Whither so fast? DUKE. To ride; to breathe the air. VALDINI. May Heav'n thy strange-timed errand speed. DUKE. Amen! SCENE III. VALDINI. Is there no cure? Are oaths of such firm knot, That nothing human ever may untie? What is an oath? A bond, a pact with God; In which the rights to our celestial part, Are lodged, in pawn with the eternal foe; Never to be redeem'd, but by the just Fulfilment of the bondâthe dreadful bond! But, may not Heav'n cancel and set us free; And by the trumpet sounding from the cloud Of threat'ning woe, command us from the path Of our sworn pilgrimage, to shun the storm?â Of this, who dare be judge? SCENE IV. Valdini and Dutchess. VALDINI. What means your grace, by this funereal garb?â We need no outward pageants to our grief. DUTCHESS. The ominous and fatal black of woe, Suits best the day and my dejected heart. All is awry, and sorrow comes to all. Sure some malignant planet rules the sky, And sheds distress and madness on the earth. I met the duke, as he prepared to mount,â The foot in stirrup, and the main in hand: I said, âGod help him,â piously, and pass'd. When fierce as any chain-broke bedlamite, He rush'd upon me; shook me by the throat; Call'd me a witch, to wear these weeds of death; And flung me from him, as a thing most vile. Then to his horse, and ere I found myself, Was through the portal like a peal of thunder. Where is he gone, my lord? VALDINI. I think not of him. Go where he will, he cannot harm me more. Oh! he has spill'd to me, the joy of life, And broke the cup. My poor Lorenzo too! And Maddalen! all share the self same doom. With what fell mineral is that man compounded? Who, to the altar of the golden Moloch, Can, smiling, see, the helpless victims bound! DUTCHESS. I wish that I were dead, and on my bier; Borne in the hearse, with all vain heraldry And chanting friars, to the mouldly vault; There to remain with grinning sculls alone, 'Till I shall hear the angel in the air, And rise, to be a cherub of the sky, With my sweet Maddalen; far, far above The bearded tyrants of this wicked world. VALDINI. If simple worth, a bosom without gall, And childlike innocence retain'd to age, Procure admission to the home of faith; Full many a proud and wordly wise afar, Shall gaze, astonish'd at thy bright ascending. What noise is that? a tumult fills the court! DUTCHESS. Heav'n be with us! SCENE V. Dutchess, Lorenzo, and Valdini. DUTCHESS. Ha! Lorenzo bloody! LORENZO. My lord, I think, it is, it is, not mortal.â I have been way-laid, but not to be robb'd. The gang struck at my life. VALDINI. Here, set him downâ Now is the dreadful curtain torn from all; Hie to the guardâhelp! help! call up the house. Retire, retire; quit this terrific scene, Ill-fated dame! He sinks, he falls, he dies. Oh my Lorenzo! Now he breathes again. SCENE VI. Maddalen, Valdini, and Lorenzo. MADDALEN. What wretch art thou, that with such outcry, fills This trembling house; marring the magic dreams Of my sweet med'cin'd sleep? Lorenzo! what! Hast thou been at it, and would be before me? Perfidious rogue! that could thy true love leave. I'll pinch thy cheeks for this. We'll go together, Though never, never to be man and wife, We yet can faithful die; lie in one grave; And free from incest, mingle dust with dust. LORENZO. My lord, take her away; her thoughts are wild. MADDALEN. Forbear! forbear! this should have been Lorenzo's. As I have sworn love! it cannot be thine. Oh! my good lord, my husband! priest-made husband.â What is't that I would say? VALDINI. Ill-fated fair. Come, gentle! let me lead thee to thy room? MADDALEN. Oh! fye bridegroom; look at that dying man! To think of bedding, in the teeth of death. Fye, fye, fye, fye. LORENZO. Oh! let me have some drink. VALDINI. Attendants! Water!âRise sweet Maddalen, Rise from thy knees, nor gaze upon him so. MADDALEN. What metamorphosis is working here? My lov'd Lorenzo, once so fresh and fair, Is vanishing away; and in his stead, A pale and glazy-eyed cadavre grows. SCENE VII. Dutchess, Maddalen, Valdini, and Lorenzo. DUTCHESS. I must come here. The chamber of grim death Is not so fearful as the specter'd fancies, That rise among my thoughts. The horses hoofs, Ringing upon the pavement of the court, Clank in my ears, like the black gibbet's chain; And e'en the silly creaking of a door, Sounds like the swinging of a murd'rer's bones. MADDALEN. Ha! my kind aunt; come here, come here, come here. Hush, hush,âthere's an elopement going on. Marriages are made in heav'n. We'll go there. In black! coffins and charnal vaults! dear aunt, What prompting spirit put you up to this? Lorenzo! look! her grace is ready for us. VALDINI. How feel you now, Lorenzo? LORENZO. Better, better.â Think you it was the duke that set them on? VALDINI. We'll see to it hereafter. LORENZO. Was it not strange, If they were robbers, first to think of murder? VALDINI. Most strange! but 'tis a day of prodigies! DUTCHESS. Oh! my dear Maddalen, pray thee, forbear. Thy thoughts are like the yellow falling leaves, That wildly rustle in the ev'ning gale, Dispers'd afar. Rude was the wintry blast, That so untimely smote my blooming tree. I thought to sit beneath the lovely shade, 'Tending young lambs, all in the setting sun: But now, it waves a wild phantastic head, And soon will lie, before the feller, low. Oh! turn from me, these pale heart-breaking eyes? Look at thy lover, bleeding on the floor. MADDALEN. Cheat me no more! Know I not my Lorenzo? Was't not enough to foist the old one on me? Think you, I always will submit to this; And take for him, that potsherd of a man? I hate the sight. By Cupid's dimpled smiles, The ghastly mimic apes Lorenzo's beauty. SCENE VIII. Duke, Valdini, Maddalen, Lorenzo and Dutchess. DUKE. My friend, my friend, what dire mischance is this? Our morning's error, time might have retrieved; Some other, fairer, won again his heart; And Cupid, with a rosy garland, bound The lion of your rage. VALDINI. Guards! seize the duke. DUKE. How now, my lord! VALDINI. Hence! hollow-sounding brass, The lion claims his prey.âBear him to jail. DUTCHESS. Forbear, Forbear. MADDALEN. Where am I? What are these? Did not the doctor give me medicine? I saw the count, the label'd phial pour, And serve the draught as I lay in my bed.â How came I here? Or, am I in a dream, And these but visions, metaphysical, Bred in my drugged sleep? This feels of stuff, My lord, your grace. They are corporeal too! To touch, as palpable as to the sight. But why the dutchess in these weeds of woe, The floor all bloody, and Lorenzo pale; And wherefore hold these felon-guards, the duke? My lord; I was, to-day, married to you! VALDINI. Alas! it has been so. MADDALEN. Explain me this? LORENZO. (Her reason brightens from the opiates fume, And she may know me yet, before I die.) VALDINI. Her black, was but a strange forerunning fancy. Lorenzo has been murderously stabb'd; And I suspect the duke. Take him away! MADDALEN. Yet, yet, my lord, let him remain. DUTCHESS. What would she? MADDALEN. I now begin to feel myself again. Lorenzo! how art thou? Courage, my love; All goes right well. The duke shall have his due. My lord, I'll be to you a faithful wife. Stay, my Lorenzo! gentle spirit, stay. SCENE IX. Duke, Valdini, Dutchess, and Lorenzo. DUKE. You shall repent this gross indignity! To charge a man of my exalted rank, With such opprobrious crime. Let him there, speak, And charge me if he dare? VALDINI. You shall have justice. 'Twould not be well for men of our degree, The sires and guardians of the public law, To higgle at the forefeit of such deeds. Your grace knew well, when you set on this work, What the great volumes of our country says. The whisper'd conference; the jingled bribe; The richer promise partially revealed; And more temptations in the darken'd rear, To bend the bloody panders to your will; Were witness that you knew. DUTCHESS. O my good lord! Let grey-hair'd pity plead for him and me? Heav'n, by old age, has serv'd its warrant on him, And soon the stern and grisly jailor, Death, Must lead him to the bar. What better judge Would you, my lord, for this great guilt, desire, Than he that, with a white and shining hand, Unlocks the clasps upon the book of life, And reads the doom of allâof all the world? LORENZO. Pardon, my lord, my father, let him fly. VALDINI. My noble boy, Oh! my Lorenzo dies. LORENZO. Oh! where is Maddalen? VALDINI. Where is she gone? Is there no help? Has yet no surgeon come? LORENZO. 'Twere all in vain. Let no one now approach. My light burns dim, for all the oil is out. DUKE. Ill-fated victim! pardon me thy blood? LORENZO. Raise him, my lord. I bear no malice hence. DUTCHESS. Come, rise? and let us stand apart and weep. To mourn is all we have to do in life. LORENZO. Oh! where is Maddalen? Oh, but once more.â VALDINI. She comes, she comes! The guards may now withdraw. SCENE X. Maddalen, Valdini, Lorenzo, Duke and Dutchess. MADDALEN. Ha! is he gone? VALDINI. No, Maddalen,âcome here; Support his head; it best becomes thy arm. LORENZO. Thanks, gentle father. MADDALEN. Sweet! how art thou now? Methinks the ray has parted from his eye. He breathes no more. Lorenzo is away! VALDINI. Rise, Maddalen; all now is past. What was My boy, isâ DUKE. Have I eyes, and see him weep? DUTCHESS. What is't that she is taking from her breast? Help! help! horror! horror! DUKE. (A double murder's mine!) VALDINI. O thou tremendous source of destiny! Restrain the devil madding in my bosom. Guards! guards within! your duty now perform. DUKE. I ask not now to live. Honour and fame, Ye tempt no more: titles and dignities, Ye mixt the posset, share the surfeit too. VALDINI. O wretched fair! had we not blood enough! Thou should'st have liv'd a sacred virgin wife, And never pleasure would I had with thee, But to bewail thy hapless lover's fate. MADDALEN. A little nearer yet Lorenzo's side, My noble wedded lord! All I could give, Honour, esteem, that loving of the mind, Which earthly natures bear for higher beings, Thy virtues had: the heart, the woman's love Was bred and twined with his that's silent here. Lay us together, where you wish to lie; And when the all-confusing hand of time Has done its part, may never herb nor flower, Spring from the barren and abortive spot. Come, my lord duke! look on your punishment. But life is ebbing, and the last low sands Are filt'ring in the glass. My gentle aunt, Give me your hand to kiss. We little thought, When I, beneath your fond maternal wing, Cower'd from the churl, to take farewell like this. Lorenzo! O Lorenzo! now we meet. Lucre nor priest shall never part us more. We go, dear shade, where no division's known, Nor other boundary than light and love. DUTCHESS. 'Twas thus her mother died. VALDINI. Come, come away. DUTCHESS. Oh! let me look upon her once again? Oh! Maddalen, that never more can smile; I took thee from thy dying mother's breast, A little baby, and to me you clung,â My heart was full, and I could only weep. Now thou art gone, and left me in thy stead, A bloody piece of lifeless church-yard clay. DUKE. Guards! to the prison! Bear me to the jail. DUTCHESS. I will go with thee too;âsit in thy cell, And think of Maddalen; but never speak. I'll take thy old grey head upon my lap; And when thou art asleep, I'll drop a tear; But, it will be for my sweet Maddalen. Amidst the tolling of the fatal bell, I'll join the psalm, but think of Maddalen: And when I see the axe gleam in the air, I'll close my eyes and go to Maddalen. DUKE. Give me thy hand. DUTCHESS. Farewell. DUKE. Oh, my lord. VALDINI. Stop! 'Tis meet that I should well consider this. Thy age, thy dignity, thy gentle wife, Put in petition and entreat respite.â My own particular wrongs I set aside; And you, ye victims, that lie silent here, What will the sacrifice avail to you? For you and for myself, Revenge is mute; But claims, with more than all the Grecian's art, Atonement for the direful public crime. His age! Age should have taught him as it came, That retribution sternly follows crime. The young in years, may for their errors plead, Impetuous blood, and reason's twilight dim. Years bear against him, and his dignity, Still feebler pleads; for in our titled sphere Of sordid metal, is the marriage ring. Now comes humanity to tug my heart; But, 'tis humanity that brings the charge. Guards, do your duty! let the law prevail. END.</field>
