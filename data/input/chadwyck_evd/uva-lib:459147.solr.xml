      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Trillo. Trillo. Hey Boyes!âNever did my Spirit chirp more chearfully since I had one. Here is work for Platonicks. Never did. Ladies, brave buxom Girles dispence at easier rates with their forfeited Honours. This were an excellent age for that Roman Carvilius to live in: who never lov'd any sheets worser then those his Wife lay in. Nor his Wife any lodging worse, then where her decrepit Consort slept in. Divorces are now as common, as scolding at Billingsgate. O Alimony, Alimony a Darling incomparably dearer, then a seere-icy Bed possest of the spirit of a dull unactive Husband! A fresh flowry Spring, and a chill frosty Winter never suit well together. He were a rare Justice in these times of Separation, who had the Ceremonial art to joyn Hearts together as well as Hands: but that Chymical Cement is above the Alchymy of his Office: or verge of his ministerial Charge.âHey day! who comes here? The very profest Smock-satyr, or Woman-hater in all Europe. One, who had he lived in that State or under that Zone, might have compared with any Swetnam in all the Albyon, Island. Scen. 2. Enter Timon; Siparius, and a Page. But sure he has some high design in hand, he pores so fixtly upon the ground, as on my life he has some swinging stuff for our fresh Dabrides, who have invested themselves in the Platonick Order: and retain courage enough to make an exchange of their old Consorts with their new Confidents and amorous pretenders.âLet us hear him, he mumbles so strangely, he must surely either disburthen self, or stifle his teeming Birth for want of timely delivery. Timon. Good, as I live wondrous good: this is the way to catch the old one. Be all things ready Siparius? Sip. How do you mean Sir? Tim. What a drolling bufflehead is this.âHe has been Book-holder to my Revels for decads of years, and the Cuckoldry Drone, as if he had slept in Triphonius cave, all his dayes, desires to know my meaning in the Track of his own Calling!âSir, shall I question you in your own Dialect? Be your Stage-curtains artificially drawn, and so covertly shrouded, as the squint-ey'd Groundling may not peep in to your discovery? Sipar. Leave that care to me Sir; it is my charge. Tim. But were our Bills poasted, that our House may be with a numerous Auditory stored; our Boxes by Ladies of quality and of the new dress croudingly furnished; our Galleries and Ground-front answerably to their Pay compleated? Sip. Assure your self Sir, nothing is a wanting; that may give way to the Poets improvement. Tim. Thou sayst well; this is indeed the Poets third day: and must raise his Pericranium deeply steep'd in Frontineack, a fair revenue for his rich Timonick Fancy; or he must take a long adue of the spirit of Sack and that noble Napry till the next Vintage.âBut Siparius. Sip. Your will Sir. Tim. Besure, that you hold not your Book at too much distance: the Actors, poor Lapwings, are but pen-feathred: and once out, out for ever. We had a time, indeed, and it was a golden time for a pregnant Fancy; when the Actor could imbellish his Author, and return a Pean to his Pen in every accent. But our great disaster at CannÃ¦, then which none ever more tragical to our Theatre, made a speedy dispatch of our rarest Roscio's, closing them joyntly in one Funeral Epilogue.âNow for you Boy, as you play the Chorus, so be mindful of your Hint. I know you to be a Wag by nature; and you must play the Waggish Actor. Page. I shall not sleep in my action Sir; if your line have so much life as to provoke a laughter; I shall not strangle the height of your Conceit with a dull gesture: nor weaken the weight of your Plot with too flat or unbecoming a deportment. Tim. Thou promisest fairly; go on. Trillo. And so does Timon too, or his judgement fails him.âWell, I will accoast him.âHealth to our stock of Stoical wit, ingenious Timon.âCome Sir, what brave Dramatick Piece has your running Mercury now upon the Loom? The Title of your new Play, Sir? Tim. Every Poast may sufficiently inform you: nay the Fame of the City cannot chuse but eccho it to you: so much is expected: neither shall you discover a Mouse peeping out of a Mountain, believe it. Trillo. No; nor a Monkey dancing his Trick-a-tee on a Rope, for want of strong Lines from the Poets pen. Tim. You are ith' right on't, Trillo; These Pigmies of mine shall not play the egregious Puppies in deluding an ignorant Rabble with the sad presentment of a Nulla fides spectanda feris, nec gratia victis. Corpora distendunt verubus assanda nefandis. roasted Savage. Trillo. Your Conceit is above the scale of admiration. âBut the Subject of your Invention, Sir, where may you lay your Scene: and what Name you bestow upon this long expected Comedy? Tim. My Scene, Trillo, is Tempora sunt Cuculi gratissima labilis anni; Cornua sunt sponsis tristia, LÃ¦ta Procis. Auson. Horn-Alley: the Name it bears, is Lady Alimony. The Subject I shall not preoccupate: Let the Fancies of my thirsty Auditory fall a working; if ever their small expence confined to three hours space were better recompensed; I will henceforth disclaim my Society with an happy Genius: and bestow the remainder of my time in catching Flyes with Domitian. Trillo. Excellent, Excellent. I am confident your acrimonious spirit will dis-curtain our Changeable-taffaty Ladies to an hair. Tim. Thou know'st my humour; and let me perish, if I do not pursue it. Thou hast heard no doubt, how I never found any branch more pleasingly fruitful, nor to my view more grateful, then when I found a Woman hanging on it: wishing heartily that all Trees in mine Orchard bore such fruit. Tril. If your wish had prov'd true, no doubt but your Orchard would have rendred you store of Medlers. âBut your hour, Sir, your hour. Tim. You know, Trillo, our Theatral time to a minute. One thing I must tell you; and you will attest it upon our Presentment: That never was any Stage, since the first erection of our ancient Roman Amphitheaters, with suitable Properties more accurately furnished: with choiser Musick more gracefully accommodated: nor by Boyes, though young, with more virile spirits presented. Tril. I'm already nouz'd in your Poetical Springe: and shall henceforth wish for your sake, that all Crop-ear'd Histriomastixes, who cannot endure a civil witty Comedy, but by his rackt exposition renders it down-right Drollery, may be doom'd to Ancyrus, and skip there amongst Satyrs, for his rough and severe censure. Tim. Parnassus is a debtor to thee Trillo for thy clear and serene opinon of the Muses and their individual Darling: of which Meniey, to imprint our Addresses all the better in your memory, our Stage presents ever the most lively and lovely fancy: âWhere th'Stage breaths Lines, Sceans, Subject, Action fit, âTh'Age must admire it, or it has no Wit. Tril. Yet I have heard Timon, that you were sometimes Stoical, and could not endure the noise of an Enterlude, but snuff at it as the Satyr did at the first sight of fire. Tim. All this is most authentically true: But shall I unbosom my self ingeniously to thee, my dear Trillo? As his hate to Woman made Eupolis eat Nettle pottage; so became I fired in my spirit: my experience of a Shrow drove me to turn the shrewd Comedian: and yet all our Boxes are stor'd with compleat Doxes: nay some, whose carriage gives life to this days action. Tril. May the Poets day prove fair and fortunate: full Audience and honest Door-keepers. I shall perchance rank my self amongst your Gallery-men. Tim. We shall hold our Labours incomparably heightned by the breath of such approved Judgements. Enter Messenger. Sir, here is a proud peremptory pragmatical Fellow newly come into our Tyring-room, who disturbs our preparation; vowing like a desperate Haxter, that he has express Command to seize upon all our Properties. Tim. The Devil he has; what furious Mercury might this be? Mes. Nay, Sir, I know not what he may be, but sure if he be what he seems to be, he can be no less then one of our City Hectors, but I hope your spirit will conjure him, and make him a Clinias.âHe speaks nothing less then braving Buff-leather Language: and has made all our Boyes so feverish, as if a Quotidian Ague had seiz'd on them. Tim. Sure it is one of our Trapanning Decoyes, sent forth for a Champion to defend those Ladies engaged honour, whom our Stage is this day to present: This shall not serve their turn.âCall him in; we will collar him. Tril. Hah-hah-hah! This will prove rare sport, to see how the Poets Genius will grapple with this Bandog. Scen. 3. Enter Haxter. Hax. Sir! Tim. Surly, Sir, your design! Hax. To ruine your Design, illicentiate Play-wright. Down with your Bills Sir. Tim. Your Bill cannot do it Sir. Hax. But my Commission shall Sir.âCan you read Sir? Tim. Yes Sir, and write too, else were I not fit for this imployment. He reads the Paper. Tril. With what a scurvy skrude look the Myrmidon eyes him?âHe will surely bastinado our Comedian out of his Laureat Periwig:âHold him tugg Poet, or thou runs thy Poetical Pinnace on a desperate shelf. Tim. What bugbear has your terrible Bladeship brought us here? A Mandat from one of our own society, to blanch the credit of our Comedy! You'r in a wrong Box, Sir, this will not do't, Hax. You dare not disobey it. Tim. Dare not! A word of high affront to a profest Parnassian: I dare exchange in pen with you and your penurious Poetasters Pike: and if your valour or his swell to that height or heat as it will admit no other cooler but a down-right scuffle, let wit perish and fall a wool-gathering, if with a chearful brow I leave not the precious Rills of Hippocrene, and wing my course for Campus Martius. Hax. Slid this MusÃ¦us is a Martiallist; and if I had not held him a feverish white liver'd staniel, that would never have encountred any but the seven sisters; that Knight of the Sun, who imploy'd me, should have done his errand himself: well, I would I were out of his clutches: The onely way then is to put on a clear face, lest I bring a storm upon my self.âVertuous Sir, what answer will your ingenuity be pleased to return by your most humble and obsequious vassal? Tim. Ho Sir; are you there with you Bears! How this Gargantua's spirit begins to thaw?âSirra, you Punto of valourâ Hax. I have indeed; puissant Sir, been in my time, rallied amongst those Blades: but it has been my scorn of late to ingage my Tuck upon unjust grounds. Tim. Tucca, thy valour is infinitely beholden to thy discretion.â But pray thee resolve me, art thou made known to the purport of thine errand? Hax. In part I am. Tim. And partly I will tell thee, this squirt squibbe, wherewith that pragmatical Monopolist Nasutius Neapolitanus has here imploy'd thee to obstruct our Action, shall be receiv'd and return'd with as much scorn, as it was sent us with spiteful impudence:âLet him come, if he like; he may trouble himself and his own impoverish'd patience: but we shall sleight him on our Stage, and tax him of frontless insolence. Hax. You shall do well Sir. Tim. Well or ill, Sir, we will do it.âPray tell me brave Spark, what Archias may this be, who takes thus upon him to excize the Revenues of our Theatral Pleasure to his purse? Be his monopolizing brains of such extent, as they have power to ingross all Inventions to his Coffer: all our Stage-action to his Exchequer? Hax. I would be loath to praise him too much, because your transcendent self prize him so littleâbut his Travels have highly improv'd his expression. Tim. We know it Don, and he knows it too, to his advantage. âBut no man knows the issue of his Travel better then Timon. It is true, he addrest his course for Malagasco: but for what end? to learn hard words; school himself in the Utopian tongue: and to close up all, he stickt not, Xerxes-like, to deface Bridges, in the ruines whereof poor Gentleman, he irreparably suffered. Hax. To my knowledge, be speaks no more then authentick truth: For I my self in my own proper person got a snap by a Neapolitan Ferret at the very same time. Ever since which hot Ãtnean service, my legs have been taught to pace Iambicks: and jadishly to enterfear upon any condition. This to himself. Tim. Thus much for your dispatch; onely this:âBe it your civility, valiant Don, to present my service to his Naked Savages; Monkeys, Babouns and Marmosites: advising withall your Master of the Bear-yard; that he henceforth content his hydroptick thoughts with his own Box-holders; and lest he lose by his out-landish Properties, be it his care to pick out some Doxes of his own, lest those She-sharks whom he has imploy'd upon that trading occasion, abuse his confidence. Hax. Your Commands, Sir, shall be observ'd with all punctuality. Tim. Do so brave Don, lest I call you to account, and return your wages with a Bastinado.âBut withall tell that Cockspur your magnificent MecÃ¦nas, that he keep at home, and distemper not our Stage with the fury of his visits: lest he be incountred by my little Tarriers, which will affright him more then all his Spanish Gipsies. Hax. Account me, invincible Sir, your most serviceable slave upon all interest.âWell, I have secur'd my crazie Bulk as well from a basting as ever mortal did. And if ever I be put on such desperate adventures again, let this weak raddish body of mine become stuck round with cloves, and be hung up for a gammon of Westphalia bacon to all uses and purposes. Exit. Tril. So! you have conjur'd down the spirit of one furious Haxter. Scen. 4. Tim. And just so must all our Tavern Tarmagons be us'd; or they'l Trapan you, as they did that old scarifide Fryer; whose bitter experiences furnish'd with ability enough to discover their carriage and his feverish distemper. Boy. Sir, all our Boxes are already stored and seated with the choicest and eminentst Damasella's that all Sivil can afford: Besides Sir, all our Galleries and Groundstands are long ago furnished: The Groundlings within the yard grow infinitely unruly. Tim. Go to Boy; this Plebeian incivility must not precipitate the course of our Action.âHow oft have they sounded? Boy. They'r upon the last sound; but our expectance of that great Count, whose desires are winged for us, foreslow our entry. Tim. These Comick Presentments may properly resemble our Comet Apparitions; where their first darting beget impressions of an affectionate wonder, or prophetick astonishment. The world I must confess, is a Ball racketed above the line and below into every hazard: but whimseys and careers challenge such influence over the Judgement of our gallant refined Wits; as their Fancies must be humoured, and their humours tickled, or they leave our rooms discontented. So as, the Comedians Garden must finde Lettice for all lips: or the disrelish'd Poet must be untruss'd, and paid home with a swinging censure.â This must be my fate, for I can expect no less from these Satyrical Madams; whose ticklish resentment of their injured honour will make them kick before they be gall'd: but Timon is arm'd Cap a Pe against all such feminine Assailants. They shall finde my Sceans more modest, then some of their actions have merited.âAnd I must tell thee one thing by the way my ingenious Trillo, that I never found more freedom in my spritely Genius, then in the ExtremÃ  necte nullam ScÃ¦nis jÃ¦liciorem reteri. Afran.very last night, when I set my period to this living Fancy. âBut time and conveniences of the Stage enjoyn me to leave thee.âMake choice of thy place, and expect the sequele. Tril. May your Acts live to a succeeding age, And th'Ladies Alimony enrich your Stage. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the third Sound. Prologue. Madams, you'r welcom; though our Poet shew A severe brow, it is not meant to you. Your Vertues like your Features, they are such, They neither can be priz'd nor prais'd too much: Lov'd and admir'd wheres'ever you are known, Scorning to mix Platonicks with your own: âSit with a pleasing silence, and take view Of Forms vermillion'd in another hue. Who make free Traffick of their Nuptial Bed, As if they had of Fancy surfeited: Who come not here to hear our Comick Sceans, But to compleat imaginary Dreams With realler Conceptions: if you minde them, âTheir New Loves stand before, Old Loves behinde them: And from that Prospect this Imprezza read. âRich Pearls shew best, when they'r set in lead. Such be your blameless Beauties, which comply With no Complexion but a Native dye, Apt for a Spousal hugg: and like rich Ore Admit one choice Impression, and no more. Those Faces onely merit our esteem, âSeem what they be, and be the same they seem. For they who Beauty cloathe with borrowed ayrs, May well disclaim them, being none of theirs. Here shall you see Nature adorn'd with skill, And if this do not please, sure nothing will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Scen. 1. Enter two Boyes. 1. Boy. Room, room for the Ladies of the New dress. 2. Boy. Thou stiles them rightly Tim; for they have plaid the snakes, and put off their old slough: New Broom sweeps clean: Frosty age and youth suit not well together. These Bonaroba's must sate their appetites with fresh Cates, or their sharp attractive stomacks will be quickly cloy'd. 1. Boy. True Nick; hadst thou known their nightly quartring as well as I have done, thou wouldst hold them rare Coyducks for retreving new game: and storing their Lobbies upon all adventures. 2. Boy. Why, Tim, art thou one of that Covy? 1. Boy. Let it suffice thee, Wag, I know all their Fagaries to an hair. I have not plaid such a Truant in my place; as to become their Pe De during all the time of their restraint: and not to attain the Principles of a Puny-Bolt: a faithful secret Pimp deserves his constant pay. 2. Boy. But in good sadness resolve me, were these dainty Dabrides ever in restraint? 1. Boy. As close coupt up, believe it, as any Parachito's ever were: onely they assum'd to their pretended aggrievances to exclaim against their hard fortunes, in being marcht with such impotent and defective Husbands. And now they have by long flickring and strong favourites got out oth' Cage: and wrought themselves into Alimony. 2. Boy. Uds so, will their dainty fingers tug in Alume work? 1. Boy. What an ignorant Puppy thou art? This is no Alume work, but such a calcinated Mettal, as it will run like Quicksilver over all their Husbands Demains: and in very short time make a quick dispatch of all his Long acre. 2. Boy. Trust me Tim, these be mad-mettal'd Girles: brave Braches to breed on. 1. Boy. What a wanton Monkey is this?âHee's but newly bred, and he can talk of Wenches breeding!âwell, thou wilt grow a Cock of th'game, if thy pen feathred youth mount to't:âBut silence, Wag, the She-Myrmidons are entering the stage: and I am prickt out for the Chorus. Scen. 2. Enter six Ladies fantastically habited; in a wanton and pleasant posture: passing over the stage, they are encountred by six amorous complemental Servants. Every one singling forth his Mistress, for discourse. 2. Boy. What humerous Tomboys be these? 1. Boy. The onely gallant Messalinas of our age. That Love-spotted Ermin, is Madam Fricase, a woman of a rampant spirit; a confident pretender to Language: and for the Latine, she makes her self as familiar with the breach of Priscians head, as if it were her Husbands. 2. Boy. Who is she that looks like a mouted Scale-drake? 1. Boy. That spit-fire is Madam Caveare, one whose assiduate trading brought age upon her before her time. But Art has taught her to supply furrowed Deformities with Ceruss Boxes: and to repair a decay'd Complexion with an Italian fucus. This with other fomentations have so enlivened her, as they render her no less active then if she at last Grass had but casten her Colts tooth. The next in rank is that mincing Madam Julippe, who would not bear a Childe for a world (though her endeavours be pregnant enough) for fear she should dis-feature the comeliness of her body. 2. Boy. Yet shee's a Medler. 1. Boy. A mellow one, and as ready to fall in Autumn upon all occasions. 2. Boy. What may that gaudy gugay Lady be, that throws such scornful looks upon our Galleries? 1. Boy. That's a brave Martial Millanoise: Semiramis never had a more imperious spirit: she styles her self Madam Jocolette; a jocund Girle on my word: and one that will not ingage her honour, nor barter in a light Commodity for nothing. She was a Tyrewoman at first in the Suburbs of Millan: but falling into an ebb of fortune, and hearing the quaint and various fancies of our Countrey Damasella's; she took upon her this adventure to improve her annual pension. Which she has by the dexterity of her wit and incomparable curiosity of art highly enlarg'd, and by this unexpected means: for it hapned, to give an addition to her future happiness, that one Sir Gregory Shapeless, a Mundungo's Monopolist, a paltry-penurious-pecking pinchgut, who had smook'd himself into a Mercenary title of Knightship, set his affection upon her soon after her arrival here; whom thou may imagine, Nick; to be no sooner woo'd then won. But scarcely were their marriage sheets warm; till her dissembled fancy, having no other bait but Lucre to feed it, grew cold. And the Mundungo Knight became pittifully Crest-faln: more in love with the World then his Italian Doxy. A divorce she sues and so happily pursues: as by the sollicitancy of her private Ingles, she became whole sharer in his trucking fortunes. Since which time, she pastures freely upon the Common without fear of Inclosure. 2. Boy. Why should she not? A barren ranging Doe having once leapt over her own Pale, may incroach, though not with security, upon any others Liberty. 1. Boy. That next her in rank and as right as my leg in her career, is Madam Medler, a cunning Civil Trader: who with much simpring secrecy, as one that would seem sparing in discovery of her Husbands Debility; calls her Sir Tristram Shorttool a good well-meaning man, and one that might content any woman under the Ãquinoctial Line, if Nature had measur'd him right. Whereas his sufficiency has been elsewhere tried: which his many Branches sprung from other stocks, may sufficiently witness; being Ciens of his own inoculating, and at his own proper charge for breeding. As for that Lady with the inflam'd face, Madam Tinder; her desires are so strong and inlarg'd; as that Torrid Zone where she sometimes planted, could not accomodate her supplies. âAnd let this serve thee, Nick, for a short Character of these Alimonial Ladies. 2. Boy. Those Platonick Servants of theirs are upon a strong debate with their amorous Mistresses. 1. Boy. But note my precious Wagge, how infinitely they seem tickeld with the Accounts which those Ladies return them of their Court-proceedings. 3. Scean. Florello. You over-glad me Madam Fricace with your select discourse, closing so fairly with our expected wishes. Caranto. No conceit Struck more on fancy then the tale you told me; 'Tis so attractive, Madam Caveare, It acts delight without a passive Object And forms an Embrio in the phantasy By Loves mysterious Spell: may Ida's Court Ne're see Caranto exercise his Revells If he neglect those ceremonial rites Which Love and Duty have oblig'd him to. âMay all the Orbs make Musick in their Motion And smile on our enjoyment. Palisado. Fair Julippe, Your choice has crown'd me; Nor shall track of time Raze out that Impreze with your free assent Has here ingraven: Palisado's zeal Shall merit your affection, if endeavours May mount to such a pitch, as they may cheer My hopes in retribution: Secrecy Or what may most suit with a Ladies honour Shall in this breast keep constant Century. Salibrand. If Salibrand fall short, may he be forc'd To sue his own Divorce.âDear Joculette May your estrangement from a loathed Bed Compleat your choice with a delightful change. Morisco. Balls, Treats, Reer-Banquets, Theatral Receipts To solace tedious hours, shall entertain My mellow Medler: and when Evning pleasure Shall with inlivening vigour summon more Duly-reserved Offices; which Love In her arrival, her desir'd repose, Shall pay his loyal tribute; onely due To Crowns and Nuptial Rites: or as pure times Make these divisions legal, to supply Defects by abler Farmers: which defrai'd Proves man to be himself: Ile vow no more, Onely give leave to your devoted servant Whose purest victim is a constant heart To make this tender good:âBefore I fail In acting your content, may youthful heat Disclaim its interest in me: and this spirit Active and spritely lose his native strength, Nay thaw it self to atoms, and resolve To Opick powder, juyce of Cucumber, Or what may shew most chillness in the blood. Tilly-vally. Like brave Platonick you profess much love, Which you ennamle with gilt promises, But my affection's conscious of no guilt Nor a rhetorick tincture: Some can speak, And call the heavens to record, when their fancy Meer Planet-struck, has fixt their influence On various Objects:âthis deludes poor Wenches, And makes them melt like Cerusse:âHeav'ns forgive them, I'm none of that light Leven: nor Florello, Caranto, Palisado, Salibrand, Nor you Morisco: moments of delight May prompt unmannag'd youth to damn'd protests And vows which they intend not: whereas, Madams, Your choice has made you happy in your change. This shall my dear affianc'd Tinder finde In her Embraces; and in those conclude Stoln waters be the sweetest. All. Excellent; Thou shalt be styl'd th'Platonick Pithias. Fricase. Our faith is not confirm'd by Oratory, If Man, he cannot falsifie his trust In offices of love: we leave our own For your injoyment; were there piety In making Love the Anvil of your treason? No, no; we shall not entertain a thought That may suggest suspicion: nor retain In our late widdow'd breasts a crime so foul As Jealousie: let our Cornuto's harbour That marrow-eating Fury.âDear Florello, Hold my exchanged Love compleat in thee. Caveare. Hold same opinion of thy Caveare, My best Caranto. Julippe. Treasure like esteem In thy Julippees choice, brave Palisado. Joculette. In Joculette, active Salibrand. Medler. Thy spriteliest Revels may they be reserv'd For thy endeered Medler, my Morisco. Tinder. So may thy hopes be crowned in thy Tinder, My valiant Tilly: and rest thus resolv'd, That th'tender tinder of my tride affection Shall ne're obscure its lustre, if neglect Extinguish not that heat. Tilly. May th'Frigid Zone Sooner contract my sinews. Morisco. And Loves Grove Become an Hermits Cell. Sal. And our Revels A sullen Stoick Dream. Palisado. And this exchange A period to our joys. Caranto. And our protests Affrighting shadows. Florello. Or what's worst of all, May those Contents which you expect from us Discover our defects: and make you wish Your Nuptial Beds untoucht. All. May all these fall And crush us with their grandeur. Ladies. Be it so. And if our levity disvalue vows, Or what may most oblige us; may like censure Impeach our perish'd honours. They retire. 1. Boy. âSo, the match Is clapt already up: they need no witness. 2. Boy. Trust me, they couple handsomly, as if they had been married after th'New fashion. 1. Boy. These need no dispensation: Fancy can act it without more adoe. A mad match soon shuffled up. 2. Boy. But what shuffling would there be, if any of these wanton Gossips should cry out before their time? 1. Boy. That cry, my dainty Wag, would be soon stifled. There be many wayes, as I have heard my old Granham say, who had been in her youth a Paracelsian Doctors Lemman, to impregnate a Birth, and by secret applications, apozems and cordials, not onely to facilitate but expedite their production. 2. Boy. And what of all this? 1. Boy. Why then Tim, the onely safe way for these gamesom Maquerella's is, to antidate their Conception before their separation: This has been an approved Receipt; and upon a long consult, found so and return'd authentick: Joy or Grief produce wondrous effects in humerous Ladies. 2. Boy. Thou art a cunning sifting Ningle for all rogueries. 4. Scean. Enter again the Ladies with their Platonick Confidents. 1. Boy. What! so soon return'd; upon my life there's some amorous design on foot either in displaying of the weakness of those Rams-heads whom they have deserted: or some Pasquil of light mirth, to ingratiate their late entertained Servants. 2. Boy. No Drollery for love sake: âFacetious fancies are the least profane. 1. Boy. That's a precious strain of modesty, Nick, make much on't: âLet's fasten our attentionsâThey are moving. Florello. Dear Madam Fricase, present those Sceans, Those love-attractive Sceans, your Noble self With these long injured Ladies tendred To your Prudential Senat. Fricase. Sure Florello You much mistake them; can you call them Sceans Which just complaints exhibit? true, they might, They might have prov'd to us and to our honours That lay at stake, and by spectators thought Highly engag'd, nay desperately expos'd To a Judicial sentence: a Decree Of fatal consequence. Caranto. But pregnant wits Stor'd with maturest judgement, polite tongues Calm'd an approaching storm. Palisado. Nay, made you gracious Before those rigid Consuls. Sal. For my part, I never knew a good face spoil a cause Though th'Bench were ne're so gravely antient: Nor ripe in years. Morisco. Beauty's a taking bait Which each fish nibbles at: this Appius felt, A reverend Sage, whom furrowed brow, loose lip, Strait line of life, a rough distemper'd cough, Aged Catarrhs, a shiver'd shell turn'd earth, where nought appear'd that might partake of man Save a weak breathing motion: yet could He Send forth light wandring eyes: and court Virginia With a dull admiration: so the Bard Describes his daring-doating appetite, Which he pursu'd, yet thought none durst discover: âAppius had silent tongue, but speaking eyes, âYet who sayes Appius loves Virginia, lyes. Tilly. Not I, I vow: let age attire it self, And in that garish habit fool his soul With fruitless wishes: what's all this to me? Pigmalion may with his incessant vows Sweetned with fancies incence seek t'enliven Motionless marble: but such statues render Icy content: Imagination may Make th'Image seem a Leda: yet the Swan Retains her feature and her nature too. âLet's leave these apprehensions; they suit better With shady then essentials favourites. âGood Madams, second our desires; let's hear How you were dealt withall. Florello. Our instancy Begs so much favour. Caranto. It will chear our spirits In the relation of your fair Proceedings. Mor. Where th'issue crown'd your suit with that success No Fates seem'd more propitious. Palisado. We must hav't; You know what longing means. Sal. Come, who begins? Ladies. Stay, Gallants, wing not your too speedy course With such Pegasian quickness, our consent Should go along: our interests are concern'd To perfect your desires. Florello. And we presume Your acquiescence will accomplish it; Our mutual loves close in that harmony, That though the ayrs of Musick still admit Their closure in Divisions, our joynt strings So sweetly tun'd, may run their Diapason Without a Discord. Fricase. By which sense we gather That we must prove your Fidlers; Florello. You mistake me: We hold you instruments; your fancies strings To actuate our motion with that fulness Arion ne're attain'd too. Ladies. We must yeild Or they will storm us. Fricase. Yet let our conditions Bring them within our lists.âWell, our surprize Must make you parties ith' discovery. All. For Loves sake how? Fricase. As thus; we stand at Bar T'express our grievances: and you must set Grave Censors or Examinates, to discuss The weight of our Complaints. All. Content; wee'l do't. Ladies. But do't exactly, or you spoil the plot. Caranto. Slid, doubt not Ladies, we have wit enough To frame Intergotaries, so you make answer, And with your quickness do not puzzle us. All. Advance, advance, let's mount and play the Consuls. The Confidents ascend the higher Seats, erected after the form of the Roman ExedrÃ¦'s: And the Ladies with Petitions in their hands standing at the Bar. 1. Boy. How will these dainty Dotrels act their parts? 2. Boy. Rarely no doubt; their Audience makes them confident. Scean. 5. Florello. Now fair Ladies, what wind has blown you hither? Fricase. The storm of our unsufferable wrongs Call unto you for Justice. Caranto. And your Beauties Injoyns our just assistance.âShew your griefs. 1. Boy. This is a Caranto-man with all my heart! must Beauty be his Land skip on the seat of Justice? 2. Boy. Pray thee give them line. Fricase. Should I discover my misfortunes, Consuls, They would enforce compassion even in strangers Who know not my Extraction.âMy descent Besides the Fortunes I deriv'd from them Who gave me Being, Breeding, with whats'ere Might compleat youth, or give imbellishment To Natures curious workmanship, was known To shine more graceful in the eye of fame Then to remain obscure: yet see my fate, My sad occurring fate! Florello. Express it Madam. Fricase. I married, Reverend Consul, and in that Lost both my freedom, fortune and my self. My former single sweet condition Cloaths that remembrance in a sable weed, Resolves mine eyes to Niobees, whose tears She feigns to weep, in resentment of her former estate. Might drop to marble, and erect an urn T'inhume my funeral spousals. Caranto. Alas poor Lady. 1. Boy. Pittiful Senatour, if he have not drunk some Coffie to keep him waking, he will questionless fall a-sleep or melt into tears before he delivers his sentence. Palisado. Whence sprung this stream of infelicity, Resolve us Madam? Fricase. From mine hapless match; A tender stripling, whose unmanly chin Had ne're known Razor, nor discover'd A youthful doun: yet his minority Was by ore-powring friends accounted fit To match with my maturer growth: But time Display'd their folly who injoyn'd me to't And my misfortune most: light was his brain But weaker far his strength to satisfie Those lawful Nuptial heats, which breath'd in us An active fire.âNow I appeal to you Judicious Consuls; 2. Boy. Hold there, Madam; under favour, these brave Senators you appeal to, are more for Execution then Judgement. Fricase. Could the patience Aside. Of Grissel, were she living, reap content In such enjoyments? Could she suffer youth Quickned with blooming fancy to expire And quench her heat with such an useless snuff? Florello. A match unsufferable. Caranto. Opposing Nature. Palisado. Nay, what in time would quite depopulate And make the World a Desert. Sal. Higher wrongs Cannot inflicted be on Woman kinde. Morisco. Nor meriting an heavier censure. Tilly. Nor, Aspersing more dishonour on that sex, That most endeared sex, to which we owe Our selves and fortunes: for should their choice Beauties Suffer a pillage by desertless hands, Forc'd to a loathed Bed, and made a prey To seered age, or to unripened youth, How soon might these imparallel'd Deities By fixing their affections on strange faces And their more graceful posture, which they valu'd Above their churlish consorts, become strangers To their due spousal rites: How soon ingage Their honour to th'Embraces of a Servant Of brave deportment, spritely eyes, neat limbs, A virile presence, and a countenance 'Twixt Ajax and Adonis; neither fierce Nor too effeminate: but mixt 'twixt both, âNeither too light to scorn, nor stern to loath? 'Twas this brought Troy to ruine: for had Helen Espous'd where she had lov'd, poor Menelaus Had ne're been branch'd, nor Troy reduc'd to flames, Nor Priam and his Hecuba the grounds Of sad-succeeding stories. 1. Boy. A gallant Consul, trust me; he has got by heart the Ballad of the Destruction of Troy to a syllable. Florello. Honour'd Colleague You shew your self both learn'd and eloquent. Madam, be pleas'd to solace discontent With a retir'd repose: we have discust And ballanced the grandeur of your wrongs In a judicious skale: and shall apply Proper Receipts to your aggrievances When we have heard the rest. 1. Boy. Receipts of their own application, I warrant thee. Caranto. Madam Caveare, You here appear as a Complainant too. Cave. And none more justly:âne're was woman matcht To such a stupid, sottish animal; One that's compos'd of Non-sense, and so weak In Masculine abilities, he ne're read The Wife of Bathes Tale, nor what thing might please A woman best:âmy Curtain Lectures have No influence on him.âI must confess He's simply honest; but what's that to me? He apprehends not what concerns a woman: Nor what may suit her quality in state And fit dimension. Caranto. A most unfitting Husband. Caveare. It was my parents caution I remember, But 'twas not my sad fate t'observe that Lesson, Never to fix my fancy on a person Who had no Sage in's pate: lest progeny of fools Should make my race unhappy: this has made My thoughts meer strangers to his weak embraces, Nor shall I e're affect him. Florello. Madam, no Law Would in the Spartan State enjoyn a Lady So nobly accomplish'd to confine Her fancy to such fury. Palisado. This objection Admits no long debate. Sal. Her rich deserts Adorn'd with such choice native faculties, And grac'd with art to make them more compleat, In humane reason should exempt her youth From such a servile yoak. Morisco. In antient times When wisdom guarded Senats; a Decree Confirm'd by publique Vote enacted was, That none should marry till he had observ'd Domestick discipline; and first to bear With a composed garb th'indignities Of a Zantippe, if his fortune were To cope with such a fury: and to calm Her passion with his patience:ânow grave Colleigues What comfort might this injured Lady drain In these puntileo's which import her state, From this insensate Sot? Tilly. Exchange his Bed And sue his Patent for the Fatuano: And to display him to his visitants In clearer colours; let this Motto be Ingraven on those walls deep-ach't with time: âDefective in his Head-piece here he lies, âObject of scorn to all surveying eyes. 2. Boy. So, poor scatter-brain, he has got his judgement already. Caranto. Praxatiles could ne're portray him better, Nor lodge his sconce more fitly.âYou may, Madam, Conceive how sensibly we feel your wounds, And with what promptness we shall expedite your long-expected cure. Palisado. Madam Julippe, You come next in rank; declare your griefs, And if our judgements hold them meriting Our just relief, we have compassionate hearts And powerful hands to vindicate your wrongs To th'utmost scruple. Julippe. If they weigh not heavy Let me incurre your censure.âPatriots, For I appeal to your judicious bosoms Where serious Justice has a residence Mixt with a pious pitty: I shall unravel The Clew of my misfortunes in small threeds Thin-spun as is the subtil Gothsemay. Deep wounds, like griefs, require contracted lines, Few words, long sighs, Accents that want express. First give me leave one beamling to bestow On my obscur'd, once glorious family. All. Madam proceed, Fame made it eminent. Julip. But now contemptive, by marrying one Who bears the shape of man, and that is all, A base-white-liver'd Coward: whose regard To his lost honour stamps him with that brand, That hateful stigma which humanity Scorns as the basest complice. Palisado. Style it Madam. Julip. Pusillanimity.âThat Ranter breaths not Who with his peekt Monchato's may not brave him, Baffle, nay baste him out of his possessions: His fortunes he esteems not, so his person May be secur'd from beating. All. Matchless Coward. Julip. Nor is this all; 'has sought t'ingage my Bed, My Nuptial Bed and honour, nay those sheets, Where I may safely vow, ne're man lay in Beside my husband. 2. Boy. Very like; But how many when he was not there? Aside. Florello. No misfortune worse Nor humor hateful to a virile spirit, Whereof your noble family partakes Then want of courage. Palisado. Tush, Sir, that's not all, Her line in time might grow degenerate And blanch the living memory of those From whence she came. Caveare. There's none who here appears Before you Conscript Consuls, but can give Store of evincing instances of this: For matching with Sir Jasper Simpleton An hair-brain'd puppy, most of all my brood Run like shell headed Lapwings in careers Just as their own supposed father did Simple Sir Jasper, whose small doze of sence Proportion'd their discretion.âTill a change Impregnated me more wisely. Fricase. So did I Suffer in my raw Puny Amadin; Though all my fears summ'd up their period, And in it crown'd my wishes for one Boy, Who while he lives, I think, will prove a Boy, I had by my young stripling: who can trace His fathers steps directly: all his games Wherein his lineal youth takes sole delight Are yert-point, nine pins, job-nut, or span counter, Or riding cock-horse, which, his Dad admires Smiling to see such horsemanship perform'd: Now I appeal to you, whose judgements are Maturely serious, if these tomboy tricks Might not perplex me and enforce me too To act what my affections prompt me do! Joculet. If one complain of the minority Of her thin-douny Consort: and you Madam Of his Simplicity whom you have chus'd, And you Julippe of his Cowardise, Whom with averseness you have made your spouse; What grounds of discontent may I conceive Unhappy Joculette, in my choice My nightly torture; whose Embraces be Worse then those snaky windings unto me Dipt in Medusa's Charms. Caranto. Unbare your wound. 2. Boy. Nay, let that be the least of your fears;âshee'l do that to an hair. Joculet. Know then judicious Consuls These arms are forc'd t'inwreath a shapeless mass Of all Deformity: a Bear unlickt, One whom Thersites that disfigur'd Greek So far excell'd in native Lineaments, Proportion, Feature, and Complexion, (All rare attractives to the eye of Love,) As amorous Narcissus in his prime Surpast the roughest Sylvan that the woods E're nurst or harbour'd: yet enjoyn'd am I To hug this Centaur: who appears to me A Prodigy in Nature. All. 'Tis a fate Exacts compassion: and deserves redress. Florello. Such a compleat and exquisite a beauty Accomplish'd in all partsâ Caranto. Nay qualifi'd With rarity of arts to make her sex With pious emulation to admire Her choice perfectionsâ Palisado. And all these obscur'd, Soil'd, sullied, perish'd by th'immeriting touch Of a mishapen Boorâ Sal. Such precious gems Set in ignoble mettals cannot chuse But much detract from th'native graceful lustre Which they retain'd by means of that base Ore Impals their Orient splendor.â Morisco. This is nothing To th'injury her linage may receive From his deformity. Tilly. I must confess That threatneth much of danger: yet I read not That Vulcans poult foot or his smutted look Blackned with Lemnian Sea-coal, brought the issue Be got by Venus, if he any got, To change their amorous physnomyâ Morisco. He may thank Mars for that active courtesie, or it had Disfigur'd much his spurious progeny. Florello. Well Madam, we compassionate your choice In your Sir Gregory Shapeless: and shall finde A quick receipt to cure your discontent With a new-molded and more pleasing feature Then your sad fate enjoys.âRepose, till we Have run through all your griefs, and felt your pulses. 2. Boy. For shame sake, no further my dainty Doctors. Aside. Florello. With th'symptoms or gradations as they stream In your desertless Sufferings; Paroxisms, Or what Extreams may most surprize your fancies: In these, our serious Judgements shall supply Such sov'raign Cordials: as you shall not need No use nor application of more helpe Then what we shall prepare: let this suffice, It rests in us to cure your maladies. âExcuse us Madam Medler, these debates Have kept us from discovery of your wrongs. Medler. Then which none more depressive:âwould you judge Th'Musician good that wants his Instrument: Or any Artizan who goes to work Without provision of a proper tool To manage that imployment?âModesty Bids me conceal the rest: my secret wants Require an active tongue: but womanhood Injoyns me silence. Morisco. 'Las I'm sensible Of her aggrievance ere her dialect Can give it breath or accent. Medler. But you say, And our experience has inform'd us too In that essential truth, that we must first Disclose our wounds, if we expect a cure: Let your impartial judgements then give eat To a distressed Ladies just complaint. In my first years, as now I am not old, My friends resolved, to supply a portion, Which my descent though good could not afford, To match my youth unto a man of age, Whose Nest was richly feather'd, stor'd of all But native vigour, which exprest it self As if all radical humour had been drencht In a chill shady bed of Cucumbers Before our Nuptial Night: oft had I begg'd With sighs and tears that this unequal match Might be diverted: but it might not be, The fulness of his fortunes winged them To consummate the match: this pleased them, But me displeas'd, whom it concerned most. Florello. The issue, Madam! Medler. None, nor ever shall With that seer suckless Kex. Morisco. Never was Lady So rarely beautifi'd, so highly wrong'd. Car. What flinty worldling were those friends of yours To value Fortunes more then your content? Palisado. To prostitute your honour to a clod Of mouldred earth? Sal. And in an icy bed To starve your blooming comforts? Tilly. This exceeds All spousall suffering, which preceding times In our Italian stories ever read Or in their sable Annals registred. Flor. Much of Sir Tristram Shorttool, so I think, Men call your Husband, have I ofttimes heard And his penurious humour: But your wrongs Were strangers to me, till your own relation Displaid their quality; which to allay, Nay, quite remove, transmit the care to us And our directions, to supply your wants. We should be just to all, but still retain A bosom pitty to the weaker sex; If we observ'd not this with tenderness, We should not merit this Judicial Seat Wheretoâ 1. Boy. These Dabrides rais'd you. Tilly. Now Madam Tinder your aggrieves are last. Tinder. But not the least: what woman could endure In spousal rights to have a stranger share In her enjoyments? or remain depriv'd Of her propriety by losing those Appropriate dues which Nature has ordain'd And sacred rites approv'd?âYou see I'm young, And youth expects that tribute which our sex May challenge by descent. All. Her Plea is good. Tinder. Would you not reverend Consuls hold it strange, To see a savage unconfined Bull, When th'Pasture's fruitful, and the milk-pail full, And all delights that might content a Beast, Range here and there: and break into those grounds Which are less fertil, and where neither shade Affords him umbrage, nor smooth-running Brooks Streams to allay his thirst: nay, where the grass Too strow for fodder, and too rank for pasture Would generate more fatal maladies Then a whole Colledge of State-Empyricks Or Countrey Farriers had art to cure? Florello. Such Bullocks, Madam, well deserve a baiting. Tilly. And beating too. Tinder. Yet this is my condition. For marrying one Sir Reuben Scattergood, A Person in appearance like enough And well-dispos'd for ought my watchful Eyes Could long discover: but his Father dead And his revenues by his Death swoln great, His Nuptial Bed he leaves: and entertains Such mercenary Prostitutes as fancy, His loose-exposed Fancy, lur'd him to. Caranto. Injurious Ribald. Palisado. Hateful Libertine. Tilly. Had she been old, or crook't, or any way Deform'd. Sal. Or ill-condition'd. Morisco. Or averse When he was active. Florello. Or run retrograde To his just pleasures: these might have abridg'd And weakned his affection: but when beauty, Composed temper and a graceful presence Cloth'd both with majesty and a sweet smile Of such attractive quality, as th'Adamant Cannot more vertually enforce its Object Then these impressive motives of content: He merits not the Title of a Man, Much less th'embraces of so choice a spouse, Who violates his faith; deceives her trust. Caranto. I am directly, Sir, of your opinion. Palisado. So I; Morisco. And I. All. So all of us concur, To make our Judgements more unanimous. Tinder. And to confirm't, may you be pleas'd to give Attention to a story I shall tell, As true as strange to manifest th'Affronts My Patience has endur'd, and to what height His Luxury ascended? All. Madam do, We shall lend ready Ears to your discourse. Tinder. It chanc'd one day, and ofttimes so it chanc'd, For doubtful thoughts have ever jealous eyes, That my suspicion had be got a fear, That my neglectful Husband had a kindeness, And more then usual, unto my Maid, A proper Maid, if so she might be call'd: Now to possess my self whether those grounds Whereon I built might just inducements be Of my late-hatched fears, I made pretence, (What is it Jealousie will not design?) To go from home: But this was no recede But a retire: for in the Ev'ning time When those two amorous pair expected least Such an unwelcome visit, I repair'd To a close Arbour set with Sycamours, The Tamarisk and sweet-breath'd Eglantine, That local Object which I fixt upon Not of my self, but by direction, Where I found out what I suspected long, Such want on dalliance as the Lemnian Smith Never discover'd more when he prepar'd His artful Net t'enwreath his Eriena Impal'd in Mars his arms. All. Could you contain Your passion in such Aretine a posture? Tinder. With much reluctancy I did indeed, Curbing my temper which was much enrag'd With this too milde expression:âFie for shame! âMinion Ile have none of this work, not I. âYou may when it it is offer'd you, said he. 1. Boy. Ha, ha, ha. This was a bold-fac'd Nigler, trust me Wag. Aside. Florello. Was't not enough for him t'enjoy his pleasure, But he must jear you too? Caranto. As if you were A Stale to his light dalliance? Palisado. Or a scorn to his embraces. Was her servile beauty Expos'd to sale, dishonour of her Sex To be compar'd to yours? Sal. Whose native splendour Without the help of Art, which makes complexion By borrow'd colours much unlike it self; May challenge a prerogative ith' rank Of our compleatest Features. Morisco. It seems strange How you could brook th'affront without revenge On that insulting Prostitute. Tillival. No doubt She would take hold of opportunity By th'foretop, and repair her pressing wrongs By private satisfactions, which works best When their Revenge seems sleeping and at rest. This Lady would not rate her worth so small As to forego both Use and Principal. 2. Boy. No; reverend Favourite, you will finde this Madam Spitfire of a keener mettal then so. She's right tinder: no sooner touch then take. Florello. Ladies, We've heard your different Complaints Forcing our just compassion and resolves To tender your condition and redress: What may the purport be of your Petition Relating to your grievances? All-Lad. A freedom From our dis-relish'd Beds. All-Plat. 'Tis granted you. Ladies. With Alimony to support our state In this division. Platon. Your suit is just, Should we oppose it, we might wrong out selves. 1. Boy. Very likely; for they mean to be made whole Sharers both in their Persons and Personal Estates:âThis is brave judicial Brocage. Aside. Florello. Speak Fellow Colleagues, Shall I limit them What we in Justice hold expedient For th'Alimonal Charge proportion'd them, And in what measure to supply their Wants? All. Do so Florello, we shall second it. Florello. Thus I conceive, these Ladies have resign'd Their title, property and interest, In whole and not in part which they enjoy'd In their defective Husbands.âWere't not just In lieu oth' whole which they have here disclaim'd That they should seize upon the Moity Of their Revenues whom they have here deserted As useless Instruments unto the State? Platon. A just proportion: Ladies. We submit to it. 2. Boy. And so ye may well, if your Husbands will yield to't. 1. Boy. These be nimble shavers Nick as well as sharers: they know how to cut large thongs out of other folks leather. Flor. This crowns our wishes, when with joynt consent We close our votes and render you content. Caranto. Dismount, dismount, let's exercise no more; They descend. These purple seats; their stories stand too high For our Ascent: Onely let's thus much know Whether our Parts were acted well or no. Ladies. Above expectance: singular in all, But best in your Conclusion. Fricase. You did well In your proportioning of our Alimony, Moulded to th'moity of their estates Whom we have justly left: but we had less Allotted us in more Authentick Courts. Palisado. That was not in our verge to regulate. Caveare. Nor skills it much: we have a competence Aspiring to Exceedings; and in this More blest because exempted from those bonds Which our long servitude inchain'd us to. Florello. Of Consuls then, which title we usurpt To chear your fancies, we shall now become Your Servants, Confidents or Favourites, Or how you please to style us:âwe are all Affianc'd yours: firm as the solid Rock In your reserved Councels and what may Hold correspondence with your interests, But soft and malleable as liquid amber In its resolving temper when delight Shall sport it in your bosom, and admit A sociable dalliance. Fricase. Your free discourse Grounded on former proofs of constancy Has so indeer'd me, I am wholly yours. Cav. Madam; we mean not you shall have it so; You've broke the ice, and we will trace your steps; Former experience has ingaged me To fix on my Caranto. Julippe. Palisado shall Injoy my love. Joculette. I for my Salibrand. Medler. Morisco mine. Tinder. Tinder shall Tilly's be. Tilly. Pure tender Tinder of affection, The new-blown Bloom that craves a native warmth To cherish its young growth shall not receive More solace from those Orient rayes which shine On its fresh-springing beauty, then your choice Shall in my dear embraces. Tinder. I shall try you. 1. Boy. Thus walks the poor Gentlemens Revenues to raise these Doxes Alimony: and thus runs their Alimony to feed these youngsters riot. Platon. Our joy's compleated:âSeal this joynt Conveyance With those ambrosiack signets of your lips. They kiss. âOne house did hold, one house shall hold us twain, âOnce did we kiss, and we will kiss again. 2. Boy. How Turtle-like they couple! Scen. 6. Upon these Platonicks private Parliance, Dalliance and Embraces of their Ladies; Enter Sir Amadin Puny; Sir Jasper Simpleton; Sir Arthur Heartless: Sir Gregory Shapeless; Sir Tristram Shorttool; Sir Reuben Scattergood: in a melancholly discontented mode; with their Hats over their eyes. Sir Amadin. Is this th'Platonick Law; all things in common? Sir Jasper. Must all forego their wives that are not wise? Sir Arthur. Or be divorc't because we dare not fight? Sir Greg. Or lose our Mates because we are not handsom? Sir Trist. Nay, 'cause we are not arm'd so well as others be, Forfeit our Consort and our Fortunes too? Sir Reuben. Yes, that's the plague on't,âlose a light-heel'd trull, That in my judgement's nothing: but to lose all Or Moity of that all, or any part at all For a poor nifling toy that's worse then nothing, 'Tis this that nettleth me.âI must confess Tinder that light-skirt with impetuous heat Sometimes pursu'd me, till that quenchless fire Burst into flames of boundless jealousie Which crost mine humour: for variety Relisht my pallat:âPhÅnix brains be rare But if our dishes had no other fare They would offend the stomach, and so sate it As grosser meats would give a better taste: Such was my surfet to a Marriage-bed. My Fortunes I prefer before her beauty, Or what may most content the appetite. Money will purchase wenches: but this want, This roguish thing call'd want makes wanton thoughts Look much unlike themselves: 'tis this white mettal Enliveneth spirits, knits our arteries Firm as Alcides: He that bindes himself Apprentice to his wife meerly for love, May he, pen-feather'd widgeon, forfeit's freedom With whatsoe're is dearest to the vogue Of his affections: she were a rare piece That could ingage me or oblige me hers With all those Ceremonial rites which Flamins use To Hymens honour: Beauty, still stay I, Will breed a surfeit, be it ne're so choice Nor eye-attractive: âI should chuse a Grave âBefore one Mistress all mine Interest have. O my Alimony, Alimony; this is the goad that onely prickels me! Platon. Those be your Husbands, Ladies;âhow pittifully they look? Ladies. Alas, poor Cuckolds. These Platonicks discover the Knights: and scornfully eye them. Knights. Ladies, we were sometimes your Husbands. Ladies. True, You were so; but your known defects have raz'd That style of Wedlock: and infranchis'd us From that tyrannick yoke.âWe'r now our own, Nor shall our Beds by you be henceforth known. Sir Amadin. What have I done? Fricase. Nothing, Sir Amadin; And that's sufficient to divide us two. Your puny years must grow in strength and sinews To prove you man before you can partake In my enjoyments: th'Court has so decreed, And by resentment of that injury Your blooming youth unripened for delight Has done to me your hapless Virgin Bride, Held fit to number me amongst these Ladies, All different sufferers; and for supportance, As every thing, you know, would gladly live, Allots us Alimony. Florello. So, his score's paid. Aside. Sir Jasper. Madam, look on Sir Jasper. Caveare. Honest Simpleton And so I will, just as the Fowler is wont On a catcht Dotrell; till your wasted brains Rise to more growth, I from my widdow'd Bed Will rise untoucht: these brests shall never give Their nursing teats unto a Brood of Fools. Caranto. So, good Sir Jasper, you've your Doom in Folio. Aside. Sir Arthur. Receive me dear Julippe. Julippe. For what end? Have you stoln from your Colours?âOh I hate A Coward worser then a Maidenhead Basely bestow'd;âthese Paphlagonian Birds, These Heartless Partridges shall never nestle Under my feathers: till your spirit revive And look like man, disclaim your interest And injur'd title in Julippe. Palisado. So; He must first learn to fight, e're she to love. (Aside. Joculette. What would Sir Gregory? Sir Greg. That you would love me. Jocul. No; you must cast your slough first: can you see Ought in your self worth loving: have you ever Since our unhappy meeting us'd a Glass, And not been startled in the sad perusal Of your affrightful Physnomy?âSir, hear me, And let me beg your patience if you hear, Ought may dis-relish you;âwhen th'Camel shall Transhape himself into a nimble Wesil Or such like active Creature: and this Bunch Which Nemesis has on your shoulders pitcht, This Bunch of Grapes I mean, shall levell'd be She lies her hand upon his Shoulders. And brought into proportion by a Press Equally squeezing, till it shall retain Adonis feature, I shall value you And hug you for my Consort: But till then Excuse my strangeness. Salibrand. So, his Cause is heard. He must unshape himself to gain her love. Medler. Sir Tristram Shorttool, have you ought to do In this pursuit of fancy? Sir Tristram. Something Madam. Med. But small to purpose: Sir Tristram you have been A man of Reading: and on Winter Nights You told me tales, for that was all you did, What strange adventures and what gallant acts Redoubted Knights did for their Ladies sakes, But what did you for Medler all the while? Did you e're toss a Pike, or brandish Blade For her dear sake?âGo to, I shall conceal, And with a modest bashful veil in-shroud What Sense bids me discover.âLet me Sir Advise you as a Friend; for other styles Relating to an Husband, I shall never Henceforth resent them; with a free comply: Love suits not well with your decrepit age; Let it be your chief care t'intend your health: Use Caudels, Cordials, Julips, Pectorals, Keep your Feet warm, binde up your nape oth' neck Close against chilling ayres, that you may live An old man long:âbut take especial care You button on your night-capâ Morisco. After th'new fashion (Aside. With his loave Ears without it. Medler. This is all; Onely your absence. Morisco. So good night Sir Tristram. (Aside. Sir Reuben. Sweet Madam Tinder. Sir Reuben offers to kiss her. Tinder. Keep your distance Sir; I love not to be toucht. Sir Reuben. Are you so hot My tender Tinder? Tinder. No Sir; look to the Clime Where you inhabit; there's the Torrid Zone. Tilly. Yea, there goes the hair away. (Aside. Sir Reuben. Can you not love? Tinder. Not One that loves so many. Sir Reuben. 'Las pretty Pear, Tinder. Pray Sir, hold off your hand; Truck with your low-priz'd Traders; I must tell you Mine honour's higher rated. Sir Reuben. Be it so; I wish you would disclaim your Alimony, With that indiff'rent touch as you do Love, You should not need a Dispensation, Madam, It should be granted unpetitioned. Tinder. I'm confident it would:ânor shall the coolness Of your affection, bring me to an ebbe Of favour with my self: Plant where you please, Ile henceforth scorn to hugg my own disease. Tilly. So, Sir Reuben's dispatcht; and like a Ranger may tappice where he likes. (Aside. Sir Reuben. But hark you Madam, what be these brave Blades That thus accouter you? are they your Platonicks, Hectors, or Champion-Haxters, Pimps or Paliards; Or your choice Cabinet-Confidents? Tinder. You may Exact accompt from them. Sir Reuben. No; but I will not; Long since I've heard a Proverb made me wise, And arm'd me Cap a pe 'gainst such accounts: âWhos'ere he be that tuggs with durty foes, âHe must be foil'd admit he win or lose. Tin. Shall I acquaint them with your Adage, Sir? Sir Reuben. Do if you please. Tinder. No Sir, I am too tender Of your indanger'd Honour.âShould a baffle Ingage your fame, and I the instrument It would disgust me. Sir Reuben. You are wondrous kinde. But pray you tell me, is this Favourite Or Turn-key of your Councel in the rank Of generous Hectors? I would be resolv'd For it concerns me. Tinder. Pray good Sir, as how? Sir Reuben. Since 'tis my fate, I would be branched nobly Lest mine adulterate Line degenerate And raze the ancient splendor of mine House, As many noble Families have done By mixing with inferiour Apple squires, Grooms, Pages, Ushers, which in time begot Such middle Wits in this our middle Region, None could distinguish them from Corydons, Nor well discover whence they might derive Their prime descent, unless it were by th'Crest Their Footmen wore: or what their Coach presented In it's reer quarter.âAll your Sir Reuben begs Aims mainly at your Honours priviledge, Which shielded I'm secure; and it is this, âLet choice hands meddle with your Tinder-box. Tinder. Make that your least of fears.âWee'l keep our fame, Amidst this freedom, still unblemished. Knights. So, we have all receiv'd their final Answers. Sir Reuben. Nor do I mean to draw up my Rejoynder. âHe who will lose his wits, or break his heart âFor such a Wench as will not take his part: âAnd will not shun what he may safely flye, âMay He a Bedlam or a Beggar dye.

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Scen. 1. Enter two Citizens. 1. Citizen. Is it for certain that the Dukes voyage holds for Salamanca? 2. Citizen. No doubt on't: his resolution is so firmly fixt, no motion can decline it. And if we may credit Fame, which seldom errs in all, though it exceed in many; never was Fleet more bravely rig'd, better prepar'd, nor with more Military strength furnish'd, nor more virile spirits accompanied, nor by more expert Commanders at any time since the Battel of Lepanto conducted. 1. Citizen. It was thought he would not personnally have ingaged himself in this adventure: but have deputed some experienc'd General for perfecting this grand design: and imposing a final period to an Action of such high consequence. 2. Citizen. 'Tis true; but those many aggrievances, aggravated with numerous Petitions presented by our Sivil Merchants, wrought such strong effects upon the sweet compassionate nature of the good Duke; as that endeared resentment which he retain'd upon those Merchants relation, touching the infinitely surcharging losses which they had suffered though the hostile Pyracy of the Salamancans, as he made a solemn Vow to ingage himself in their quarrel: and either revenge the injuries and indignities they had sustained, or seal his just desires with the sacrifice of his dearest life. 1. Citizen. Were the Merchant losses great? 2. Citizen. In Shipping infinite: and by Accomptants of approved trust, computed to many millions: for besides Vessels of lesser burthen in one Sea-voyage being driven by contrary winds upon the Coasts of Calabria, they lost at one time âthe Panther, Libard, Bugle, Antilope, Caracts of great and formidable sail: such as would have made their party good against all Assailants, had they not been dispers'd and weakned by violent tempests: Besides, the unexpected Herocane, which dash'd all the endeavours of the best Pilots that all their Fleet afforded: yet reduced to this strait and sad exigent, they found no Islander so compassionate as to pitty their deplorable Condition: but rather such as were ready to adde fresh affliction to their late suffering, by seizing on whatsoever remained estimable in their forelorn Vessels: and exposing them without the least remonstrance of humanity or civil hospitality to the mercy of the winds. This it was which winged the Duke to this Expedition: chusing, as report goes, the Revenge for his Ship of War, and that onely man of War, wherein he means to steer his course, return his errand and requite his Quarrel. 1. Citizen. The Duke's a Person of a gallant spirit. 2. Citizen. I dare affirm it Sir; that the State of Sivil was never with more prowess, prudence, nor Martial Policy at any time mannaged; which not onely his prosperous exploits abroad, then which none more successive: but likewise his vigilant care and, command at home may sufficiently manifest. For his late Declaration under his Great Seal has discovered the incompatable zeal he had of serving both Court and City: in commanding all such useless and incommodious Weeds, as Trapanners Tarpaulins, with all our abusively intitled Hectors, that they should by a peremptory day depart the City and Line of Communication in relation to the Court: since which time, they have resolved for want of better supplies to hazard the remainder of their broken Fortunes upon a desperate adventure for Tunis. 1. Citizen. In such glorious designs levelling at honour, they declare themselves really Hectors. Enter a Mariner. 2. Citizen. What news Segasto? Mariner. The Duke's upon his march: and near approaching. 1. Cit. How quick's his Spirit to redress our wrongs! Scen. 2. Trumpets and Kettle-drums sounding, with other Martial Musick usually observed in that Countrey. Enter Duke Eugenio, Officers and Souldiers; with Colours display'd. Duke. Thus far on our address: may prosperous gales Breath on our Sails: Sails on our just designs In vindicating of our Countreys fame Too long impair'd by suffring injuries; Till which redrest our Honour lies at stake And we made Aliens to our own estate. March on then bravely that it may appear âOur Courage can revenge as well as hear. They march over the Stage with Trumpets, Fifes, Drums and Colours. Manentibus Civibus. 1. Cit. This gallant resolve of the Duke pursu'd with such alacrity can never be sufficiently admir'd; and to ingage his Person too in so perillous adventureâ 2. Cit. And all this in vindication of the Merchants honour and their Interest. 1. Cit. Trust me, he appears bravely. 2. Cit. His disposition from his youth foretold What's manhood would assayâwhence comes this noise? Enter Boy. Boy. Room for our Bravo's, Cadets; they march along in ranks and fyles. Their pockets grow shallow, the Taverns and Ordinaries, they vow to be Infidels, so as they have inlisted themselves Souldiers of fortune. 1. Cit. These be those Trapanners, whom the Duke has proscribed, or I mistake it. Let us observe their posture. Scen. 3. Enter Captain, Tripanners, Terpaulins, with other Runnagado's orderly marching. And in the reer, Benhadad a Quaker. With Tobacco Pipes. 1. Tripan. Rouze Buckets and Tubbs.âHey for Tunis and Argiers. Captain. Keep your ranks my Comrades, and fight valiantly. 2. Tripan. What else Captain, we cheated before for nothing, and now having nothing we mean to fight for something. 3. Tripan. 'Slid Bullies, I think the Duke has done us a pleasure. 1. Tripan. Pray thee, how Boy? 3. Tripan. Ile tell thee, the short and long on't: Before, if any of us had been so valiant, as few of us were, as to borrow money on the High way, we were sometimes forc'd to repay it at the Gibbet: but the world is turn'd upside down; if we get it, we may keep it, and never answer for it. 1. Tripan. Hey Boy, art thou in that Lock?âBut noble Land prisado, let us have a Sea-Sonnet before we lanch forth in our Adventure Frigot. They say the Syrens love singing. Captain. Agreed Wags: but which shall we have? 1. Tripan. That old Catch of Tunis and Argiers; good Captain, it suits best with our voyage. Captain. To't then my Hectors; and keep your Close as you do your march. The Syrens will not relish you if you sing out a tune. The Sea-Song. Capt. To Tunis and to Argiers Boyes, Great is our want, small be our joyes; Let's then some voyage take in hand They joyn in the close. To get us means by Sea or Land. Come follow me my Boyes, come follow me, And if thou dye, I'le dye with thee. Hast thou a Wife? I have one too, And Children some as well as thou, Yet who can see his Brats to starve So long as he has strength to serve? Come follow me my Cubbs, come follow me, And if thou dye, I'le dye with thee. Methinks, my Boyes, I see the store He fixeth his eyes as upon Objects in a Landskip. Of precious Gems and golden Ore; Arabian Silks and Sables pure Would make an Haggard stoop to th'lure. Come follow me, &amp;c. No worthless minde e're honour sought, Let's fight as if we feared nought, If Bullets fly about our ears Let's laugh at death and banish fears. Come follow me, &amp;c. And if thou canst not live so stench But thou must needs enjoy thy Wench, If thou my Boy such pleasure crave A dainty Doxie thou shalt have. Come follow me, &amp;c. Courage my Sparks, my Knights oth' Sun, Let Sivil fame what we have done, Wee'd better ten times fight a Foe Then once for all to Tyburn go. Come follow me, &amp;c. Come let's away, mount, march away, This Calm portends a prosperous day, When we return it shall be said That by our voyage we are made. Come follow me, &amp;c. But if we ne're again return, Inclose our ashes in an urn, And with them spice a Wassal-Cup, And to Good Fellows drink it up. Come follow me, &amp;c. Which Health when it is gone about And stoutly set their foot unto't, No doubt they shall enrolled be Ith' Book of Fame as well as we. Come follow me spruce Sprigs, come follow me, And if thou fall I'le fall with thee. Enter a Rank of Tar-paulins, prest for the same Adventure; marching over the Stage: and joyning in the Catch. An Health Cup in the Leaders hand. Tar-paulin. When this Grand Health is gone about, Where you as stoutly stood unto't, Doubt not, you shall recorded be Ith' Book of Fame as well as we. March after me, &amp;c. And when this Bowl shall run so round Your Legs can stand upon no ground, Fear not, Brave Blades, but you shall be Sworn Brothers made as well as we. March after me, &amp;c, No other Obsequies we crave, Nor quaint Inscriptions on our Grave; A simple Shroud's a Souldiers share, Which if He want, he needs not care: March after me, &amp;c. Such vails are all we wish at last, Which if we want, the Care is past. This done, to think of us were just, Who drink not, yet as dry as dust: March after me, &amp;c. While you act what we did before, Discharge with Chalk the Hoastess Score, And if the Hussy challenge more, Charm th'maundring Gossip with your rore. March after me, wee'l frolick be, And if thou dye, Ile dye with thee. Scen. 4. Benhadad furiously accoasts them. Benhadad. I proclaim you all Edomites; Dragooners of Dagon; Ding-dongs of Dathan:âA generation of Vipers.â 1. Tripan. No, Father Berhadad, your gravity is mistaken grosly, we are rather A generation of Smoaking Tobacco. Pipers. 2. Tripan. Go to Holy Benhadad, stand you to your Calling as we to our Arms. Thou art for converting the Great Turk, and we for lining our Pockets with Tunis gold. Where if we get our design, hold to thy Principles, but no farther then thou canst maintain them; and we shall create thee our Houshold Chaplain. Enter Mariner. To Sea, to Sea; the Winds are prosperous. Captain. And may we prosper with them.âSo farewell Sivil and her dainty Doxes, All. Ran tan; hey for Tunis and Argiers. Exeunt, Colours displaid, with Fifes and Drums. 1. Cit. Such was the Dukes care to remove these Weeds, Whose fatal growth might choak maturer Seeds. 2. Cit. Good Governors wise Gard'ners imitate, These chear their Plants; those steer a planted State. Exeunt. Trillo from the high Gallery. I cannot, Gentlemen, contain my self; âTimon thy Genius has surpast it self; Thy Sceane is richly various:âpreaze on still, These Galleries applaud thy Comick skill. He takes his Seat again. Scen. 4. Enter Constable and Watch in rug Gowns, Bills and Dark Lanthorns. Constable. Come along with your horns, my Lads of metal. It was the Dukes pleasure before his departure, that we should be appointed the Sinks and Sentinels of the City, and that none should have ingress, egress or regress but by our especial authority and favour.âBut harm watch, harm catch; for my part since I crept into this office, I am woven into such a knot of good fellowship, as I can watch no more then a Dormouse: nay, I am verily perswaded if I hold Constable long, the Deputy of the Ward will return me one of the seven Sleepers. But let me advise you, my Birds of the Capital, that you walk not after my Example: be it your care to watch while I sleep. Many eyes are upon you; but my eyes grow heavy; my dayes society bids me take a nap. Watch. But one word, good Master, before you drop into your slumber: Report goes that there be Spirits that petroul familiarly in this Century; what shall we say to them, if they pass by? Constable. Bid them stand. Watch. But what if they either cannot or will not? Constable. Let them then take themselves to their heels: and thank God you are so well rid of them. Watch. One word more good Constable, and then good night.âBe these the Spirits that allure our Children with spice and trinckets to their Skippers, and so convey them to th'Barmoudes? Constable. In no wise Neighbours; these Spirits come from the Low Countreys: and though at the first sight very frightful, yet appearing unarm'd they become less fearful. 1. Watch. Nay, if these pretty Familiars come to our Guard naked, we shall prove hard enough for them. 2. Watch. Well, Neighbour Rugweed, let us not presume too far on our strength: These Spirits be a dangerous kinde of Whifflers: and like our Robin Good Fellows will play their Legerdemain tricks, scudding here and there in a trice: and nimbly snap you when least suspected. Scen. 5. Enter Gallerius Ghost. From the Cinnerian depth here am I come Leaving an Erra Pater in my Tomb, To take a view which of my Fellows be The thrivingst Artists in Astronomy. Rank one by one in Astrologick row, And dying see whom thou didst living know. (He makes his Figure. Mount gainful Crinon, for to thee we give, As thou deserv'st, the sole Prerogative: For thy divining lines have purchas'd more Then all our prime Professors got before. Jason won much at Colchos, but thy gain Has linkt thy shoulders in a Swedish Chain. Rich Divination! But what's knowledge worth, If People do not credit what's set forth? This was Omnia temporibus cecinit Cassandra futuris. QuÃ¦ venturÃ¦ suisâvix unquam credita Teueris. Melitus. Cassandra's loss: whom we allow And hold a Prophetess as true as thou; But not so well believ'd:âtake heed my Blade, Thy late Predictions cannot retrograde, And give thine erring Notions such a check, As they unlink that chain which decks thy neck. Signs sometimes change their influence we see, I wish the like Event befall not thee. The Golden Number and Saturnian line Have been propitious to thee all thy time: Thy Sayes held Oracles: thy Observations For Death, War, Weather held by forreign Nations As positive Maximes: yet one Critical point Will throw this artful Fabrick out a joynt. Dog dayes each year affords, if thou finde none, Thy Fortune's clearer far then any One. Let me then caution thee divining Crinon, Lest thy own Bosom prove thy treach'rous Sinon, Let not opinion make thy judgement erre, âThe Ev'ning Conquest crowns the Conqueror: Hope of reward or one victorious Field Is no firm ground for any one to build: âMay ill success cloath him with discontent, That ballanceth the cause by the event. Next him ascend Erigonus, whose Art Richly imbellish'd with a loyal Heart Will not permit thy thoughts to stoop so low As to pretend more then thy Notions know, Or can attain to: Thou hast ta'ne content With as much freedom under strait restraint. As Pibrack in his Paradox exprest, Inwardly cheer'd when outwardly distrest. I have much mus'd while thou converst with us Of the Gradations oth' Celestial House, Yet hadst none of thine own to shelter thee, This was an humour that transported me, To see a minde so large, and to discourse As if he had got Fortunatus purse. This caus'd me think that we did greatly err In holding thee a meer Astrologer, Though't be a sacred-secret Speculation And highly meriting our admiration: But rather some rare Stoick, well content With his estate how e're the World went. Yet when I saw thine artificial Scheme Exactly drawn, as none of more esteem, I wondred much how such choice Art could want, Unless the whole world were grown ignorant. I heard of late what I did never dream Thy farming life had drawn thee to a Team, Preferring th'Culture of an Husbandman Before a needful Astrologian, Who in this thankless Age may pine and dye Before he profit by Astronomy, For though I must confess an Artist can Contrive things better then another man, Yet when the task is done, He findes his pains Sought but to fill his belly with his brains. Is this the guerdon due to Liberal Arts T'admire the Head, and then to starve the Parts? Timely prevention thou discreetly us'd Before the fruits of Knowledge were abus'd. âWhen Learning has incurr'd a fearful damp, âTo save our Oyl, 'tis good to quench our Lamp. Rest then on thy injoyments, and receive What may preserve a Life, reserve a Grave. This with convenience may supply thy Store, And logde thee with content; what wouldst thou more? While He who thirsts for gold and does receive it, Pules like a Baby when he's forc'd to leave it. For you Liberius, I'd have you look For your improvement on your Table book; Where you shall find how you bore once a Name Both in the rank of Fortune and of Fame, But others rising to an higher merit Darkned that splendor which you did inherit, Or those mistakes which caus'd you erre so far As your late years have prov'd Canicular: To waste more paper I would never have you, For I'm resolv'd your Book will never save you, Nor you from it receive a benefit, Suppress then, Pray thee, thy leaf-falling Wit; Merlins Collections will not serve thy turn, Retire, retire, and slumber in mine Urn. Dotage has chill'd thy brain, in silence sleep, âHee's wise enough that can his Credit keep. For you Columba and rare Peregrine, It is your fate to nestle in a Clime Of disadvantage; wisdom bids you build Where you may dwell; and sowe in such a field Where you may reap the harvest you have sown, âArts unimprov'd are to no purpose shown. Those onely may be truly said to know Whose Knowledge payes their Countrey what they owe: And with the Bee, from labour never cease Till they have stor'd their Hives with sweet increase. Which thriving industry infus'd by nature In such a small Political a Creature, Might by a Native Modul render thee Conducts of Science in Astrology: Saltibus hir sutis haud spaitantur Apes.For the accounts it as a fruitless toil To brouze on Suckets in a barren soil. For you Alatus, mount with ayrie wing, And to your scatter'd Nest some feathers bring: Though popular esteem afford delight, It cannot satisfie the appetite. Fame is a painted meat and cannot feed, Nor sate the Stomack when it stands in need. This was mine own condition;âwhile I liv'd I to the highest pitch of Fame arriv'd; All the Rialto founded with my praise, Yet silence shrouded this within few dayes. For after some few Funeral tears were shed, My memory dy'd, before tears went to bed. Yea, in my life time, when my state grew low, My fame found none she would conduct me to: And let this caution thee;-though thou swell great In mens conceit this will not get thee melt: âThe onely means to raise friends, fame and store âIs to make Industry thy Providore. For Atro-Lucus, Serands they be such I would not touch them, lest I should too much Impeach their branded fames: one word for all, As their disgrace is great, their knowledge small: Let these DÃ¦monicks practise less in Black It will discolour all their Almanack. But this was not my Errand: I would know How Ladies with their Husband suit Below! Those frolick Girles I mean, and of none els, Who were induc'd by mine and Crinons Spells To chuse strange Bed-fellows:âPray tell me how, Mephistophilus appeares and resolves him. Dear Mephistophilus, those Wantons do. Meph. All out of joynt: they've left their Husbands bed. Gallerius. By this it seems they were not rightly wed; There was no Justice in't: for if there had, Should they break loose, they would be judged mad. âBut now mine hour approacheth, I must pass Down to that vault where late I lodged was. Fix Mephistophilus this on that Gate, That those who knew me may collect my Fate. Mephistophilus having fixed this Inscription on the Portal of the Gate, they descend. Inscription. The ASTRONOMICAL ANATOMY in a shadowed Physnomy; recommended to Posterity. Dissected and presented in the Empyrical Ghost of D. Nicholas Gallerius.âFacilis descensus Averni. Enter Watch distraughtedly letting fall their Lanthorns. Watch. Spirits, Spirits, Spirits. Enter Constable rubbing his eyes. Constable. Where, where, where? Watch. Here, there, and every where. Now in the Porters Lodge, then in the Ayr.â Constable. A foutra for such ranging Mawkins.âI'le tell you fellow Officers, for I have been since my weining sufficiently school'd in the Office of a Constable; that we have no Legislative power (do you mark me) to commit any Person be he never so notorious a Delinquent, if he fly, or as our Falconers say, mount up into th'Ayr; we are not bound to follow him, neither to attach nor commit him; and why sayes the Law? because it is not in our power to catch him. But if he strut in the street, you may command him to come before me the Constable, as I am the Representave Body of the Duke; or before your selves, being the Representave Body of your Constable: and if the Person so taken remain under safe Custody, and he fly, if you overtake him by speed of foot, or by help of the Belmans Mungrel, you may by the Law of Arms lay him by th'Heels. And so dismiss the Watch. Exeunt. Scen. 6. Enter Sir Amadin Puny, Sir Jasper Simpleton, Sir Arthur Heartless, Sir Gregory Shapeless, Sir Tristram Shorttool, Sir Reuben Scattergood. Sir Reub. Doubt nothing, my fellow-Knights of Hornsey; the Plot is so neatly and nimbly laid, as it cannot but hold stitch. All. But be the Favourites Suits got, Sir Reuben? Sir Reuben. They are brought to our Lodgings already. To try a Conclusion, I have most fortunately made their Pages our Coyes by the influence of a white Powder; which has wrought so powerfully on their tender pulse, as they have engaged themselves ours back and edge. âSunt muner a vincula servis. Sir Tristram. 'Tis true; but how shall we pursue this Project; that we may act to purpose, what your Ingenuity has contriv'd? Sir Reuben. Leave that to me; be it your care to follow my direction, and if I make not these Haxters as hateful to our Hussies, as ever they were to us who were their Husbands; set me up for a Jack-a-Lent, or a Shrove-Cock for every Boy to throw at. The Net is spread, and if they scape the nouze, they must have more eyes then their own to discover it. Sir Amadin. Excellent, excellent; I long till I be at work. Sir Reuben. It will admit no delay, Sir Amadin, I assure you. We have not over-watcht this night to no purpose: this very morning by times we must be fitted with our Properties: and with a scornful neglect pass by that Rendezvouz, where our gamesome Ladies expect their youthful Platonicks. Sir Gregory. Revenge to me's far sweeter then to live. All. Too't, too't, for loves sake let us too't. Sir Reuben. The Plot is laid with such industrious skill, If this take not, I do not know what will. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. Scen. 1. Enter Madam Fricase, Madam Caveare, Madam Julippe, Madam Joculette, Madam Medler, Madam Tinder. Madam Fricase. How tedious morns these be in our expectance Of what we tender most? Caveare. Credit me Madam, My Marriage day from th'rising Sun to Night Seem'd not so long, though it was long enough, As the slow-running course of this Morns visit. Julippe. Desires cannot endure protractive hours, The Poet has confirm'd our thoughts in this, Placing our Action far below our Wish: âSooner quenched is Loves fire âWith fruition then desire. Joculette. That Poet surely was neither Mantuan, Lucian, nor Claudian. Medler. No Sister; nor AlcÃ¦us, EubÃ¦us, nor Apuleius; but some cold-Cucumber spirited Zonocrates, who never knew actually how to hug his Mistress. Tinder. This is the hour and place. Fricase. It is so; and no doubt but our feather'd Favorites have over flown us. Scen. 2. Enter Vintress and Drawers. Vintress. What do you lack my Princely Beauties? Caveare. What your Sex cannot furnish us with; my dainty Dabrides. Did you entertain no Gallants lately? Vintress. Not any, Madam; but Gallants are men of their words; they will stand to their tackling upon occasion: will you be pleas'd Noble Ladies in their absence, to bestow your selves in a room: or to procreate your selves, take a turn in the Garden? Medler. Slid does she hold us for Andalisian Studs, that can breed by the ayr, or procreate of our selves? Fricase. Well, her meaning is good; we will accept her offer: and take a walk or a chearful repose at our pleasure: and in it let each of us for want of more real Objects, entertain an imaginary apprehension of their absent Lover. Knocking within. Drawer. Anon, Anon Sir;âquick, quick as Erebus, good Jeremy.âUds so, what a clattering they make? I verily think our old Titere Tews and Bugle Blews are come to Town, they keep such a damnable quarter. 2. Drawer. They knock as they were mad men in the Percullis;âquick, quick, more Attendants in the Unicorn. âThere goes none to the Anwarp. The Lion and the Roebuck have not one Drawer to attend them.âWho goes into the Ladies Garden? 1. Drawer. We shall have a brave Term, if we stir not our stumps better, Exeunt. Julip. Th'Elyzian Groves so richly beautefied, Deckt with the tufted verdure; watered With Christal Rills, and cloath'd above conceipt In native Diapry: may Emblems be Of this delicious Platform, where each sense May sate its quest with sweet satiety. Jocul. And th'edifying sense with melody. Voices of Nightingals Hark how that ev'ning quire of Nightingals Warble with shrillest notes, pricks at their brests, Dum Philomela canit, spinam sub pectore figit; Crimen ut incestus se meminisse dolet. Tereus incestuous Crime; as if't had been A fact inexpiable: wherein we doubt What we should do if were put unto't. This is a Garden sure of great frequent. Caveare. Lucullus nor the Roman Argentine Had ne're the like: nor with compleater beauties More gracefully imbellish'd: it might be Styl'd the Spring Garden for variety Of all delights: Balls, Treats, and choice Invites Addrest for amorous Parliance: and indeed To make the Bargain up:âyou know my meaning. Fricase. Thou art a dang'rous Beagle.âWhat say yon Ladies. In this perpetual Spring-like sweet retire To gratifie her court'sie and conduct Who tender'd these respects, let's have a Frolick; A Jovial Frolick till th'Platonicks come. Whom we must chide, and with some discontent Tax for their slowness. All. The motion's wondrous good, We all assent to't. Joculette. But in this assent Scatter such freedom as it may appear Our Fortunes be our own: and that no eye Of jealousie or parcimonious thrift Can bound our humour.âLets call up the Drawer. They ring the Bell. Enter Drawer. Your pleasures Madams. All. What hast within Boy? Drawer. Cakes, Creams, stew'd Prunes, Olivets, Tongues, Tarts, andâ Caveare. What else, you Jack of all Trades! Doth your Mistress take us, you nitty napry Rascal, for her Bordella's Blouses? Bring us here Pistachie Nuts, Strengthening Oringo Roots, Quince, Peach, and preserv'd Apricock With the Stones pendant to't. With such incentive and salacious Cates, As quicken hours, and sharpen appetite. Drawer. You shall, you shall Madam;âOn my life these be the Ladies of the New Dress; they'l never be satisfied. Exit. Caveare. Let us imagine our selves now to be planted in the Sparagus Garden; where if we want any thing, it is our own fault. A fair Alimony needs no pawn; it will discharge a Tavern Bill at any time. Scen. 3. Enter again the Vintress and Drawer with Wiue and Fruit. Vintress. How is it Noble Ladies?âYour Honours shall want no rarities that our Store-house may afford you. Caveare. A Glass of Muscadella for me. Here Madam Fricase, to Mounsieur Florello. Fricase. This Curt'sie, Madam, must not beget in you a forgetfulness of Caranto. Caveare. So nearly hee's embosom'd, you need not fear it. Julippe. Nectarella for me; here princely Joculette to your Salibrand. Joculette. Mean time remember loyal Palisado. Julippe. No Individual can be well forgot. Medler. MedÃ¦a shall be mine.âThis Madam Tinder to your Tilly Vally. Tinder. First to your own Morisco:âSo this Health's gone round. Fricase. Now when our throats are clear, let's joyn together In some choice Musical Air. All. Agreed, agreed; What shall we have? Fricase. What may enliven love, And feather fancy with Icarian Wings. All. We must be mounting then.âYour Subject, Madam. Fricase. Le Drollere Amaranto. All. Dainty Airs. And lines to suit them:âWe shall follow you. Song in various Airs. What shall we poor Ladies do, Matcht to Shallops without brains, Whose Demains are in grains, And their wits in madding veins, Stor'd with Neapolitan Mains? Give us spritely Sprigs of Manhood, None of these Swads nor airy Squibs, Who would fain do but cannot. Poor Ladies how we dwindle! They alter the ayr upon the close of every Stanza. Who can spin without a Spindle? Valor never learn'd to tremble, But in Cupids dalliance nimble. Little good does that stud with a Stallion, Fancies Alien, weakly joynted, Meanly manned, worse appointed, Who would do if he knew how, But alas he would but cannot. Penelope though she were chaste, Yet she bad her Spouse make haste, Lest by his sojourning long, She might chance to change her Song, And do her Ulysses wrong; What then may we who matched be With these Haggards madly manned, Who would gladly do but cannot? Shall our youthful hopes decline; Fade and perish in their Prime: And like forc'd Andromeda Estrang'd from Fancies Law! Shall we Wives and Widows be, Bound unto a Barren Tree? Ushers come and Aple-Squires To compleat our free desires: Platonicks there be store Fitly fram'd and train'd to man it. Bavin once set a fire Will not so soon expire; Let's never stay with such as they, Who gladly would but cannot. Shall we love, live and feel no heat. While our active Pulses beat? Shall we hug none of our own, But such as drop from th'Frigid Zone? Let's rather bid old Love adieu, And ith' Requests suit for some New Who have the heart to man it: Tell us not this nor tell us that, A Kid is better then a Cat, And though he show we know not what, He cannot. Fricase. As I'm a Virgin, Ladies, bravely perform'd; Once more Frontineack, and then a Walk. She drinks. This Wine wants Flavour, Sapor, Odour, Vigour; Taste it, dear Madam, 'tis as pall and flat As a seer Fly-flap. Drawer. Our last years Vintage, Madam, was but small. Caveare. It seems so by your measure: this would never Quicken the Spirit, nor inflame the Blood. One of the Ladies looking out, discovers their deserted Knights attired like their Favorites: with their Cloaks over their faces. Lady. They come, they come, they come. All. Let's entertain them with a joynt neglect. Scene. 4. As their Husbands pass along, they take occasion of discourse one with another. Knights. Let us pass by them with regardless scorn. Sir Reub. Pox on these over-acting Prostitutes, They interchange these Expresses as they pass by their Ladies room. They sate mine appetite. Sir Tristram. Fancy so fed Begets a Surfeit ere it gets to bed. Sir Gregory. E're I Platonick turn or Confident, Or an officious Servant to a Puss Whose honour lies at stake, let me become A scorn to my relations. Sir Arthur. Or when I Engage my person, like a profest Boult, To vindicate a Mistress, who for sale Would set her Soul at hazard; may my Grave Be in the Kennel: and the Scavinger The Pen-man of my Epitaph. Sir Jasper. Or I Embrace a Monkey for a mass of treasure. Sir Amad. May never doun seaze on this dounless chin, When I become an Usher to her sin. Sir Reuben. So; let them chaw of this:âour Scean is done, Wee'l leave the rest to their digestion: âWe must return those Adamits their Cloaths To make their visits in, or they'r lost men; But it were strange should they recruit again. Exeunt. Scen. 5. Fricase. How is it Ladies? Caveare. Sure, wee'r in a dream, Whence comes this strangeness? Julippe. From the too much freedom Of our affection: had we kept them still At a discreeter distance, we had plaid The wiser Falkners: and caus'd them stoup Unto our Lure with eager appetite. Fruits offer'd are least valu'd; got by stealth Or by surprize, they'r precious. Joculette. Shall we sleep With this affront? Medler. Our Spirits were remiss Should we not pay them home in their own Coin. Tinder. Let Tinder lose her Name, her Family, And Alimony which she values most. If Tilly suffer not for this disgrace. All. We vow the like: revenge may be excus'd, âFor Love resolves to Hate when 'tis abus'd. Exeunt. Scen. 6. The Favourites appear to their half bodies in their Shirts, in rooms above. Florello. Why; you whoorson Rogue; where's my suit? âAs I hope for mercy, I am half perswaded, that this sliphalter has pawn'd my Cloathes. Caranto. Nay; as our rooms be near, our fates are all alike. If my visit be admitted, I must present it naked. Joculette. When she sees her Salibrand so unmodiously accoutred, she will jeer him out of his Periwig, and render him an Adamite Cap a Pe. Palisado. Never were Servants without a Dress, less suitable to Ladies of the New dress. Salibrand. We shall be held for Sale-men, or Knights of the White Livery, if we encounter them thus habited. Morisco. Nay rather for Knights oth' Poast; who had forfeited their broak't Suits for want of swearing. Tilly. Nay, for Tumblers, Truckers, or Sculler-men: Plato in all his Commonweal had never such naked followers. (Their Pages bring their Clothes. Florello. Now, you hemp-strings, had you no time to nim us, but when we were upon our visits? Pages. Your Suits, Sir, were not without employment. They were seam-rent, and stood in need of stitching. All. Go to Rogues, you will never hang well together, till you be stitcht in an halter. Pages. Well, we got more clear gains by this shift, then you will by your visit. Aside. Caran. We trench too much upon these Ladies patience: Better too late then never; let us haste To crown their longing hopes with our attendance. Delayes in visits quicken our desires, And in their Objects kindle secret fires. Fastus in Antidotum frigoris, processit &amp; urget Insolitos motus, lepidÃ¦que Cupidinis astus, Vestibus amictus laccratis, alget &amp; ardet. Solin. They come down buttoning themselves. Flor. 'Tis high Meridian ! wee've lost the time Of our appointed treatment. Caranto. Let's contrive Some neat evasion covertly disguis'd To bear the face of truth. Salibrand. It would do well, Let's mould it as we go unto the Garden. Moris. 'Twere vain to call; they'r long ere this dismist. Palisado. And with incens'd spirits; which t'allay Were a Receipt worth purchase. Tilly. Th'wound's so green It must admit a Cure: Our confidence Prepares us best admittance:âgo along. Scen. 7. Enter the Alimony Ladies at the other door. Florello. How opportunely doth this season meet To give us freedom in our intercourse! Morisco. There is a secret influence, no doubt, Design'd to second us in our desires. They go towards their Ladies. Florello. Madam. Fricase. We were Mad dames indeed, should we give freedom to such injurious Favourite. Caranto. This is stormy language; I ever thought our late neglect would nettle them. Fricase. You can affront us, Sir, and with your wit Take a deep draught of Lethe and forget. Florello. Forget! Slid I did ne're affront you. Fricase. No; Nor with a scrude contemptuous look pass by us When we were at our Treat: and with a scorn Not onely sleight us, but impeach our fame. Florello. I call the Heav'ns to witness, never I. Fricase. Perfidious Wretch, this did I hear and see, And such Records cannot deluded be. Your Words, Sir, are registred. Florello. Pray, lets' hear them. Fricase. You begun first with what your ulcerous flesh, If I be not deceiv'd, infected is. The Favourites, as they appear'd to their half bodies in the preceding Sceane; so the deserted Knight become spectators of those publick affronts done them by their Ladies, onely presenting themselves, and so withdrawing. Husbands. Ha hah-hahâHow neatly be these Widgeons catcht in their own Springes! Trillo from the Gallery. Bravely continued, Timon, as I live. Each subtil strain deserves a Laurel sprig. Fricase. âPox on these over-acting Prostitutes They sate mine appetite. Caranto. What might I say That should dis-relish Madam Caveare? Caveare. You rant it bravely Sir; âFancy so fed âBegets a surfeit ere it gets to Bed. Julippe. You Palisado stand more resolute; âE're I Platonick turn or Confident, âOr an officious Servant to a Puss âWhose honour lies at stake, let me become âA scorn to my relations.

Nor would Sir Tilly be one hair behinde In scornful dereliction of our sex. âMay never doun seize on his dounless Chin âWhen He becomes an Usher to our sin. Florel. The Devil's a Witch, and hast impostur'd them. All., Platon. Do you believe all this? Ladies. As we do you Stains to true love and all society. Henceforth observe your distance as you tender Fame, Freedom, Life:âelse we do vow Revenge Shall dog you at the heels. (Exeunt. Florello. So, we are lost; We must go cast about for some New Ayry, For these be fledg'd and flown. Caranto. By this prevention I'le hate a Mistress of such rare invention. Palis. It seems their Spleans for picking quarels sought, In pressing what we neither spake nor thought. (Exeunt. Scen. 8. Enter two Sivil Merchants. 1. Merchant. Our Duke Eugenio is safe return'd Loaden with Trophies, Spoils and Victories. 2. Mer. Those Hectors too who lanched forth for Tunis: Have shown their valour: and inrich'd their Fortunes Which languish'd in despair before this voyage Above expectance: rich Rix Dollers are Sown like Pactolus sand: their pockets cramm'd With Indian Ore. 1. Merchant. What will not prowess do Where hope of honour, promise of reward, Or Countreys fame, th'attractiv'st lure of all, Give spirit to mens actions? 2. Merchant. This appears Instanc'd in them to life: for by their hazard Successfully compleated, Forrain Sails Ne're came so richly fraughted. 1. Merchant. It were well The rest of our stout Myrmidons, whose Courage Stands for the Wall, or in a Tavern quarrel, Or an Highways surprise; to raise a stock To feed their debaucht visits, were so imploy'd: It would secure our Commerce. 2. Merchant. This good Duke Will regulate no doubt, his State-affairs With that Composure, as no fruitless weed Shall promise to it self-long nourishment Within the Coast of Sivil.âWhat means this? A noise of Clarions, Surdons, Fifes, Plausulets within. Messenger. The Dukes approaching in triumphant state: Herald. Make clear the way, room for his Excellence.

Lies the fault there you Island Curre: nay, all the Parish will witness for me, that I was not barren before I met with you.âBarren Stichel! that shall not serve thy turn.âIn plain tearms Josalin, since Thou cannot content me one way, thou shalt another. Husband. What would my Duck have? Wife. What, my Drake, the Law will give me. Husband. Law! Wife. Yes you wizzard; I have already fed a glib-tongu'd Parret with a Coif on his head, that will trounce you. Husband. What have I done, my Malmsey? Wife. Nay, your doing nothing, you Dumplin, has brought you into this pickle: The short and the long on't is this, I will have Ale-mony. Husband. Alemony! what means my Chicken by that? Wife. I have been neither so long nor ill taught by my Betters, but I know the meaning of Alemony well enough. My Landslady Joculette. God bless her, is matcht to as handsome a frolick youngster as one can see on a Summers day: yet she dislikes him, and has recover'd a good stock of Alemony. I love to follow the example of my betters: Set your heart at rest Josalin, I must and will have Alemony. Husband. Thou shalt have any thing my Conny Cristobel, so thou wilt rest contented. Wife. Nay Husband, you know well, that I am forc'd many nights to go to rest weakly contented. But if I chance to trudge to Court; I mean to lie all open; you shall hear I intend not to lay leafs on my wounds: The Duke, I hear, is a merciful man; and will not suffer any of his poor Subjects to fall short of their due. Husband. Well, Girle, thou shalt finde me ready to appear before his Grace, at any time. Wife. You'l have a gracious bargain on't then doubtless. âTrust me Josalin, you will distemper all our Ladies at Court, if you push at the Gate with your Ramhorns. Husband. She's possest, sure. Wife. No, not yet; but I mean shortly to be possest of my Alemony; you shall play no more the sharking foist with me, you fumbling Fidler you.âI hope I have friends at Court, that will take Course that I may have my whole due; and then foutra for Josalin. (Exit. Husband. Well, the thought is tane; I see one must thank God for a Shrow as well as for a Sheep: though the Sheep have more wool on his back, and affords a more savoury repast at the board. Hanging and Wedding go by Destiny: and I hold the former to be the happier destiny of the twain: yet He that will practise the art of swinging in a Halter, either to please or cross a Shrows humour, let him hang like a Puppy without hope of pitty: and dye intestate to make his Wife heir on't: till some nimble Younker become his successor, and stumbling on his Grave, laugh at the Cuckoldly Slave. (Exit. Scen. 4. Enter the Cashier'd Confidents in a discontented posture. Florello. Summon'd to appear! for what?âWhat have we done! Caranto. Incens'd those humerous scornful Ladies. Thence rose the ground, I durst wager my Bever on't: They ought us a spite, and their Information has don't. Palisado. This falls pat on their resolves: for those disdainful Wenches in the heat of their Passion, vow'd joyntly that Revenge should kick up our heels. Salibrand. Our heels are not so short, though theirs be. Should they pursue this Information, it would dart highly on their dishonour. Morisco. Honour! what may that be in this age but an airy Title? These Bonarobas have not lost the art of ingratiating nor deluding their Servants. There be Chimneys enough at Court to convey their smoak. Beauty and Confidence keep strong Sentinels in Loves Army. They cannot want Sollicitors in a place of Liberty. Tilly. Let them hold to't: Their Complaints are but squibs in the Ayr. Such Whifflers are below my scorn, and beneath my spite. Let's bravely on: I should account his fate The worst of ills, that's foil'd by Womans hate. Florello. Yet 'twas Alcides heavy fate, and He Was stronger far then twenty such as we. (Exeunt. Scen. 5. Enter the Alimony Ladies. Fricase. Conveen'd to Court! some Mask, or princely Ball, I'le gage mine honour on't. We must be imploy'd, sisters. Caveare. I see well the Court can do nothing without our City Revellers. Trust me! I am with Childe till I get to't: but my desires are enlivened for a sight of my Lord especially. Joculette. Or your special Lord Madam. We smell your meaning. As I am vertuous, he deserves your smile or whatsoever may most indear him. I have known none at any time court Love with a more graceful nor accurate presence. He can be both seriously amorous: and amorously serious. Medler. Surely, Lady Joculette; you set him at a rate far above th'Market: you value him not as if you meant to sel. Joculette. No, nor buy neither: I have no property in such a rich penniworth. For if I had, I should wishâ Medler. I know what Madam. Joculette. Good now, thy conceipt. Medler. Shall I freely unbosome me? All. Pray thee, Madam, do Madam. Medler. You would wish that his puny Baker-legs had more Essex growth in them; for else they would make ill Butchers ware. Joculette. Thou art a shrude Wench, trust me. Tinder. Well Ladies, I know a new minted Lord, that can act the Spanish Don, with a peakt beard and a starcht look to an hair. Fricase. O Madam Tinder, I guess where you are: but he wants a little of your spirit: He can cringe and caress better then he dare fight: A Ladies honour might perish under such a feverish Champion. Caranto. For loves sake, let's make haste. Nothing will be done, till we come. Enter Cristobel with a Crutch. Cristobel. Good Madam Land-lady, take lame Cristobel, along with you; She means to have about for her Alemony. Joculette. We shall not want then for handsome Attendance. (Exeunt. Scen. 6. Enter Gentleman Usher. Give way,âmake present way for his Excellence and his Consuls. Enter Duke Eugenio and his Consuls. After them the deserted Knights; the Platonick Confidents; the Alimony Ladies; the Tunis ingagers. Duke. As we have view'd and clear'd our forreign coasts, Wee'r now to prune those wild luxurious Sprayes Which give impede unto this spreading Vine, Our flowry Sivel; whose succeeding Fame Acquir'd by Civil Discipline exacts Our care and yours, grave Counsellours of State. 'Tis not enough with Balms to close the skin And leave the wound t'exulcerate within; For He, whose care's to cure the Core without And searcheth not the bottom, spoils the Root. Let's first then look on Vices which put on The face of vertue; and where modesty (Meerly dissembled) cloath'd with taking Beauty Arms it self strongly 'gainst all Opposition: Nay, what retains ofttimes such influence On reverend Scarlet, as it darks the light Of Judgement; and makes Elders fix their eyes On rare-light Objects, which so strangely takes As they make Judges vices Advocates: But here's none such, I hope: Our State is free, And so our Patriots and State-Consuls bee. Complaints inform us, and we wondred much At th'first perusal, how a Feminine Nature So sweetly pleasing, should be so deprav'd. Fricase. What means the Duke? Caranto. I relish not th'discourse. Duke. Have we not here some Ladies oth' New-dress, So newly styl'd and in their Honour soil'd, Who have deserted whom they ought to love? Ladies. Is this the Court-Mask, and the Ball we look't for? (Aside. Duke. Be you those Ladies? Cristobel. I am one of them forsooth. Ladies. We are the same, so like your Excellence, And now redrest. Duke. We understand no less; Your Alimonies signed by our Court! Cristobel. They have not signed mine, if't please your Dukeship. Truly I am a very impudent lame Woman: and my Husband a feeble weak-doing man, your Grace must needs grant me Alemony. Duke. See what Examples, Ladies, you have given To simple Women!âI shall here propose Two tenders to your choice: either receive (And with a Conjugal Indeerment too) Your late deserted Husbands, or prepare Th'Remainder of your dayes to entertain A strict Monastick life: your Sentence's past, Chuse which you please. Joculette. I never shall endure A cloister'd life unless I had a Frier; Sir Gregory Shapeless shall be my Platonick. Medler. Rather then none, Ile take Sir Tristram Shorttool. Julippe. I for Sir Arthur Heartless. Caveare. I must put on my Night-gown for Sir Jasper Simpleton. Fricase. Sir Amadin Puny then must be my joy, Who will be still, I think, a Puny Boy. Tinder. Well, since we are to this condition grown, 'Tis better far to use our own then none. While I of youthful Favourites bereft Will live with Scattergood, if ought be left. Sir Reuben. Nay, Madam, but it were not amiss if you knew first, whether Scattergood will live with you or no. Release your Alimony, and I'le resign my right in your propriety: and in my widdow'd life mourn in sackâlo infinitely. Duke. This Juncto must be fixt on firmer grounds, Coolness of Fancy acts not on the Object, Which it pretends to love:âJoyn hearts to hands, And in this second Contract reunite What was so long divided: Love's a Cement Admits no other Allay but it self To work upon th'affiections:âbe it yours, (For virile spirits should be so demean'd,) With pleasing candor to remit what's past, And with milde glosses to interpret thus In their defence still to the better sense: âTheir frailties in your Ladies wrought these failings, âWhich pious pitty should commiserate âAnd seal it with Indulgence: Then intend âYour Office, Madams: which is to redeem âYour late-abused time: which may be deem'd âRichly recover'd being once redeem'd. Ladies. May all our actions close with discontent, When we oppose their humours. Knights. Say and hold; They salute &amp; take hands. And this Act of Oblivion shall be sign'd. Duke. This does content us highly: Powers above Makes Lovers breach renual of their love. Cristobel. And must Cristobel too pack home to her Husband without her Alemony? Duke. Or to thy death an aged Prioress. Cristobel. Nay, but by your good favour, Ile meddle with none of your Priorities; Ile rather go mumble a crust at home: and chuck my old Josalin. Duke. Nor is this all; our sentence must extend Unto those Ladies Favorites; whose hours Strangely debaucht, made spoil of womens honours. Ladies. We hate them worse then Hell. Favourites. Good your Grace; we are reclaim'd. Duke. That's but an ayry Note. When Practical, wee'l hold it Cordial. Mean time we do adjudge you to the Quarries; Where yon shall toil till a relation give Test of your reformation:âLook on those Tunis-ingagers, who were timely drawn From their Trapanning Course: and by their hazard Secur'd through valour, rais'd their ruin'd Fortunes Above Expectance: when your work is done, We shall finde like Adventurers for your spirits To graple with, and rear your blanch'd repute. Leave interceding, for we are resolv'd. Now Conscript Consuls, whose direction gives Life to our Laws: we cannot chuse but wonder How your impartial judgements should submit, As if they had been byassed, to grant These Alimonies to their loose demands. Sure such Decrees would not have relish'd well Your jealous Palats, had you so been us'd. âWives to desert your Beds; impeach your Fames, âIn Publick Courts discover your defects, âNay, to bely your weakness: and recover âFor all these scandals, Alimonious wayes âTo feed their boundless riot! Consul. They'r annull'd, Our Courts will not admit them. Duke. 'Tis well done, For Gentlemen t'engage their State and Fame, And Beds of Honour, were a jugling Game. So we dismiss you:âmay the Palms of Peace Crown Sivils State with safety and increase. Whereto when our reluctant actions give The least impede, may we no longer live. Exeunt omnes, Trumpets sounding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. You see our Ladies now are vanished, And gone, perchance, unto their Husbands Bed Convinc'd of guilt: where if they cannot tame Their loose desires, but still retain the Name Of Alimony Ladies; you shall hear, They will not forfeit what they hold so dear, Prohibited delights: and in that stain With blushless dalliance visit you again. Nor shall we build on these our confidence Who give less reins to Reason then to Sense: Yet for redemption of their Husbands Lands, Seal our Acquittance with your graceful hands.</field>
