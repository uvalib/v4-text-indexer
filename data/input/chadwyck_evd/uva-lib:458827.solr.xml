      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Would t'were a Custome that at all New-playes The Makers sat o'th, Stage, either with Bayes To haue their Workes Crownd, or beat? in with Hissing, Pied and bold Ideotes, durst not then sit Kissing A Muses cheeke: Shame would base Changelings weane, From Sucking the mellifluous Hypocrene: Who write as blinde-men shoote, by (Hap, not Ayme,) So, Fooles by lucky Throwing, oft win the Game. PhÅbus has many Bastards, True Sonnes sewe, I meane of those, whose quicke cleare-eyes can viewe. Poesies pure Essence, It being so diuine, That the Suns Fires, (euen when they brightest shine) Or Lightning, when most subtillie Ioue does spend it, May as soone be approchd, weyed, touchd, or compreh?ded. But tis with Poets now, as tis with Nations, Thil-fauouredst Vices, are the brauest Fashions. A Play whose Rudenes, Indians would abhorre, Ist fill a house with Fish wiues, Rare, They All Roare. It is not Praise is sought for (Now) but Pence, Tho dropd, from Greasie-apron Audience. Clapd may he bee with Thunder, that plucks Bayes, With such Foule Hands, &amp; with Squint-Eyes does gaze On Pallas Shield; not caring (so hee Gaines, A Cramd Third-Day, what Filth drops fr? his Braines. Let Those that loue Pans pipe, daunce still to Pan, They shall but get long Eares by it: Giue me That Man, Who when the Plague of an Impostumd Braynes (Breaking-out) infects a Theater, and hotly raignes, Killing the Hearers hearts, that the vast roomes Stand empty, like so many Dead-mens toombes, Can call the Banishd Auditor home, And tye His Eare (with golden chaines) to his Melody: Can draw with Adamantine Pen, (euen creatures Forg'de out of th'Hammer, on tiptoe, to Reach-vp, And (from Rare silence) clap their Brawny hands, T'Applaud, what their charmd soule scarce vnderstands. That Man giue mee; whose Brest fill'd by the Muses, With Raptures, Into a second, them infuses: Can giue an Actor, Sorrow, Rage, Ioy, Passion, Whilst hee againe (by selfe-same Agitation) Commands the Hearers, sometimes drawing out Teares, Then smiles, and fills them both with Hopes &amp; Feares. That Man giue mee: And to bee such-a-One, Our Poet (this day) striues, or to bee None: Lend not (Him) hands for Pittie, but for Merit, If he Please, hee's Crownd, if Not, his Fate must beare it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter (at the sound of hellish musick,) Pluto, and Charon. Plu. Ha! Cha. So. Plu. What so. Cha. Ile be thy slaue no longer. Plu. What slaue? Cha. Hels drudge, her Gally-slaue. I ha'wore, My flesh toth' bones, bones marrowles, at the Oaer Tugging to waft to'thy Stygian empire, Soules, Which (but for Charon) neuer had come in Sholes, Yet (swarmde they nere so,) them on shore I set, Hell gets by Charon, what does Charon get? Plu. His Fare. Char. Scuruy fare, ile first cry garlick. Plu. Doe: And make hel stinck, as that does hither. Cha. If I doe! Some like that smell, my boate to shore ile pull; Not worke a stroake more. Plu. How? Cha. Not touch a Scull. Plu. Why? Cha. I ha'no doings: Graues-end-barge has more, And caries as good as any are in hell; I feare th'infernall riuers are frozen or'e So few by water come: els the whores that dwell Next dore to hell, goe about: besides, tis thought, That men to find hell, now, new waies haue sought, As Spanirards did to the Indies. Pluto, mend My wages, or row thy selfe. Plu: Vgly, grumbling slaue, Haue I not raisde thy price? yet still do'st craue? Such bold braue beggers (heard off ner'e before Are thy fares now, they teach thee to beg more. Thy fare was (first) a halfe-peny, then the soules gaue thee A peny, then three-halfe-pence, we shall haue thee (As market-folkes on darth,) so damned-deere, Men will not come to hell, crying out th'are heere Worse racke then th'are in tauernes: why doest howle for mony? Cha: For mony: Ile haue ij.d. for each soule I ferry ouer; Im'e old, craz'd, Stiffe, and lam'de, That soule thats not worth ijd. wou'ld twere damb'd. Plu: Thou shalt not. Cha: I will haue it, or lye still, If Charon fill hell, hell shall Charon fill: For Ghosts now come not thronging to my boate, But drop by one and one in; none of note Are fares now: I had wont braue fellowes to ply, Who, (hack't and mangled) did in battailes dye. But now these gallants which doe walke hells Rowndes, Are fuller of diseases, than of woundes. If wounded any take my boate, they roare, Being stabd, either drunke, or slaine about some whore. Thats all the fight now. Prod: Charon. Within. Plu: Get thee gon: That call'd for. Prod: Charon. Cha: Ball not. Ile come anon. Hagges of hell gnaw thee with their fowle furd-gummes. Plu: Pluto, no wonder if so few hither comes? Cha. Why: Gingerly: See See, One of thine owne promooters, (with hawkes eyes, That should for prey be watching) here suoring lyes. Plu: With a mischife! cabind! a fury. Char. Ile Ferret out more. Ruffman comes vp, Furie Enters. Cha. Another: looke: dancing a baw'de on's knee. Enter Shackle-soule comes vp. Shack. I doe enquire if rich bawdes Carted bee On earth as well as poore ones: I sleepe not Pluto. Plu. Twist stronger-knotted whips, Ile wake you (slaues!) Cha. Two of thy Summers dead-drunke here too. Lur. Thou lyest. Prod. Charon. [Within.] Lurchall and another Spirit comes vp. Cha. I come: If I must worke, let these Thy Prentices, plye their occupation, T'vphold hells Kingdome, more must worke then one. Exit. Plu. Ha; Are there whipping-posts for such as dwell In Idlenes on Earth, and yet shall Hell (As if wee tooke bribes here too,) let such passe! Ile haue you rawde: Is not the world as t'was? Once mother of Rapes, Incests, and Sodomies, Atheisme, and Blasphemies, plump Boyes indeed. That suck'd (our Dams brest) is shee now barren? Ha! Is there a dearth of villaines? Omn. More now then euer? Plu. Is there such penurie of man-kinde Hell-houndes? You can lye snoring. Ruff. Each Land is full of Rake-hells. Shac. But sholes of Sharkes eate vp the Fish at Sea. Lur. Braue pitchy villaines there. Plu. Yet you playing here. Omn. No, No; most awefull Pluto. Plu. Were you good Hell-hounds, euery day should bee A Symon-and-Iude, to crowne our bord with Feasts A blacke-eyde-soules each minute: were you honest diuels Each officer in hell should haue at least, A brace of whores to his break-fast: aboue vs dwell, Diuells brauer and more subtill then in Hell. Omni. Weele fill thy pallace with them. Plu. Ile trye that: goe: Rufman, take instantly a Courtiers shape Of any country: choose thine owne disguize And returne swiftly. Ruf. Yes. Exit. Plu. Shackle-soule weare thou A Friers graue habit. Shac. Well. Exit. Plu. Grumshall walke thou In trebble-ruffes like a Merchant. Lur. So: tis don. Exit. Plu. The barres of our latigious Courts had wont To crack with thronging pleaders, whose lowde din Shooke the infernall hell, as if't had bin An earth-quake bursting from the deepe Abisse, Or els Ioues thunder, throwne at the head of Dis (The God of gold,) for hiding it below, Thereby to tempt churles hither. Nor did we know What a Vacation ment: continuall terme Fattend hels Lawyers, and shall so againe. Enter Rufman, Shackle-soule and Lurchall. Ruf. Here. Shac. Here. Lur. Command vs. Plu. Fly into the world: As y'are in shapes transformde be so in name, For men are out sides onely: be you the same; Hve thee to Naples, (Rufman), thou shalt finde A Prince there (newly crownde,) aptly inclinde To any bendings, least his youthfull browes Reach at Stars only, wey down his loftiest boughes With leaden plomets poison his best thoughts with tast Of things most sensuall; if the heart once wast The body feeles consumption; good or bad kings Breede Subiects like them: cleere streames flow from cleere springs. Turne therefore Naples to a puddle: with a ciuill Much promising face, and well oylde play the court diuell. Ruff. Ile doo't in brauery: if as deepe as hell, Thy large eares heare a Land curse me, my part's playd well. Plu: Fly Shackle-soule. Shac: Whither? Plu: To the Friery, Best-famde in Naples for strict orders: throw What nets thou seest can catch them: Amongst 'em sow Seedes of contention, or what euer sin They most abhor, sweate thou to bring that in. Shac: A wolfe in lambe skin leapes into the rout, Bell, booke, or candle cannot curse me out: Ile curse faster than they. Plu. Doe: Grumball. Lur. Here. Plu. Be thou a cittie-diuell, make thy hands Of Harpyes clawes, which being on courtiers l?ds Once fastend, ne'er let loose, the Merchant play, And on the Burse, see thou thy flag display. Of politicke banck-ruptisme: traine vp as many To fight vnder it, as thou canst, for now's not any That breake, (theile breake their necks first) if, beside Thou canst not through the whole citie meete with pride, Riot, lechery, enuy, Auarice, and such stuffe, Bring 'em all in coach'd, the gates are wide enough. The spirit of gold instruct thee: hence all. Omn. Fly. Plu. Stay, least you should want helpers at your calling Any diuels shall come, (Search hound, Tobacco spawling, Vpshorten, Suckland, Glitterbacke, or any Whom you shall neede to imploy, but call not many, The'rs but few good in hell. And stay, remember We all meete to heare how you prosper. Omn. Where? Plu. The Tree Blasted with Goblins, that about whose roote 5. Mandrakes growe, i'th Groue by Naples there, Meete there. Omn. Wee shall. Plu. Our blessings with you beare. Ruff. Dread king of Ghosts, weele plye our thrift so well, Thou shalt be forc'd to enlarge thy Iayle of Hell. Plu. Be quicke th'at best, let sawcy mortals know, How ere they sleepe, there's one wakes here below. Exeunt. Enter Alphonso (King of Naples) Crownde, wearing Robes Imperiall, Swordes of State, Maces, &amp;c. being borne before him, by Octauio Astolfo, (2. vnckles) Narcisso, Iouinelli, Brisco, (Counts) with others, Counte Spendola meeting them. Spen. One of those gallant Troupes went forth to meete Your admirde Mistris (Erminhild the faire) Hath left your Conuoy with her on the way. K. And brings glad newes of her being here (this day) Let Canons tell in Thunder her Arriuall, Flourish. When shee's at hand our selfe will meete her, Omn. On. Hee takes his Seate; All kneele. K. Pray rise; vntill about our browes were throwne, These sparkling beames, such adoration Was not bestowde on vs: whom does the knee Thus louely worship? this Idoll, (Gold) or mee? Indeed t'is the worlds Saynt, if that you adore, Goe, pray to your coffers. None to vs shall bow, Giue God your knees. Oct. Whose owne voice does allow That Subiects should to those who are Supreme, Bend, as to God, (all Kings being like to him) Ast. Thou wonder of thy time, Ile pay no more To thee of dutie than has bene before And euer shall be payd to those sit Hye. K. Pray mocke not mee with such Idolatry, Kings, Gods are, (I confesse) but Gods of clay, Brittle as you are, you as good as they, Onely in weight they differ, (this poore dram) Yet all but flesh and bloud; And such I am. If such, pray let mee eate, drinke, speake, and walke, Not look'd cleane through, with superstitious eyes, (Not star'de at like a Comete.) As you goe Or speake, or feede, (vn-wondered at) let mee so. Oct. Not Kings of Ceremonie. K. Vncle what then? Still are they Kings. Oct. But shew like common men. K. Good vncle know, no Sunne in this our Spheare, Shall rule but Wee, let others shine as cleare, In goodnes, None in greatnes shall. Ast. Blest raigne! The Golden worlde is molding new againe. K. All that I craue is this, and tis not newe, Pay vnto CÃ¦sar onely CÃ¦sars due. Oct. We owe thee loyall hearts, and those weele pay, Each minute (Mirrour of Kings.) Iou.

In name of heauen I charge thee to be gon. Shac. Well sir, the cold water of your counsell has laid the heate of my furie: he had met with his match, but I wil shoote off my anger, I will be gon, and why?

Ah wellada, I come to fill my pot, With water not with thee; thou art mis-begot. Else wouldst thou not lye there; what Orphans blood Hast thou suckt out, to make this golden flood? None drinke this well but I, how is it than Thou thus way-lay'st me, (theefe to the soule of man?) Would some poore wretch (by losse of law vndone) Had thee: goe doe him good: me canst thou none.

If I did hurt in that, how much harme doe Almanake makers, who lye coldly quiuering at it all the yeare long? I did doe nothing but stand staring at the man in the moone. Sub. And what good thoughts bred that within thee? Scu. This: I thought to my selfe, what a happy fellow that man in the moone was, to see so many fooles and knaues here below, and yet neuer to be troubled with 'em, nor meddle with 'em. Sub.

Thats he, &amp; theres your golden hire to charme him; Your fees ile treble, let but lusts flame be felt; The Alpine-snow at the sun's beames does melt, So let your beauties thaw his frozen Age, Musick first t'act an old Lecher, then a diuell on hells black Stage: Strike, strike your siluer strings: braue set of whores? At your striking vp, diuells dance, and all hell roares. Zany and Curtizans fall into a short dance, Sub. What sound offends mine eare? Soule of temptation? Enchanters I defie yee, get you gon; Ime blind to your enticements, from this I learne, At how deere rate the careles world does earne. That thing calld pleasure: how many soules doe fall? (Sold for a little guilt to daube this wall?) Hence with your witchcrafts, the sight of this driues hence, All thoughts besieging our voluptuous sence. Shac: Another baite, at this he will not bite. The Zany singes: Subprior holds his head downe as fast a sleepe. Zany.

Prettie, prettie wast: Sweete to be embracde: Prettie leg, Ã´ prettie foote, To beauties tree the roote, This is she shall doo'te, Or she shall doo't, or she shall doo't, she shall doo't, she shall doo't Kisse, kisse, play, play, come and dally, Tumble, tumble, tumble, in beauties valley. Shac. His soule is chaind in pleasures, bind it fast, If he breake your charmes, the strongest spell comes last. Eexit. All wake him. Sub.

The Diuelt in't then indeed: Much Labour, Art, and Wit, make vp a Play As it does a Ship, yet both are cast away, (When brauely they haue past the humorous Seas) At landing, What black fates curseth both these? Sayle it, or sinck it, now tis forth, and nere The Hauen at which it longs t'ariue: if there It suffers wrack, the spitefuller Rockes shoote forth, Yet non may bring it home lad? with much worth.
