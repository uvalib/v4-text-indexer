      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, (WRITTEN BY WILLIAM GRENVILLE GRAHAM, ESQ.) SPOKEN BY Mr. CONNOR. Whoe'er on ages past has wisely thought, And feels the moral by example taught, Has learnt that empire, built on crime, is vain, And short the date of guilty grandeur's reign. Behold, where traced on ancient story's page, Proud Carthage stands the wonder of her age, Beams o'er the world the splendor of her name, And grasps with mighty hand the scroll of fame; But sunk at last beneath her load of crimes, She fell, the blot, and beacon of her times. Next, 'mid the darkness of Barbaric night, Up rises Tunis, on the averted sight; The Moslem faith, with Moslem fierceness joined, Crushed the free soul, and chained the aspiring mind, Till, rous'd by pity for a suffering world, Imperial Charles his victor-flag unfurled; Poured on her blood-stained towers the storm of war, And dashed Haradin from his trophied car, From Christian captives snapp'd the galling chain, And gave them life and liberty again. But vainly were the bolts of slavery riven, And short the respite to our nature given; Europe once more beheld, with shuddering fear, The turbaned Corsair urge his wild career,â Saw the pale Crescent sweep the ocean-wave, No sword to avengeâno pitying arm to save; Till thou, my Country! in the love of right, Lent to the weeping world thy lion-might, Broke the dread withering spell of Freedom's sleep, And rolled thy thunders o'er the insulted deep. On this famed spot our Poet spreads the scene, And pictures times and things that once have been; His task this night to paint the Christian's fate, Galled by the fiend-like scourge of Moslem hate, To paint the struggle of that fateful hour, When man flings off the chains of guilty power; With storied truth he blends the tale of woe, And bids your tears for fancied sorrows flow, Claims your compassion for a wife's distress, And a sad father's exiled loneliness; Portrays the effects of passions unrefined, And the stern outlaw's waywardness of mind. If Nature's colours through his portraits shine, Your just applause will crown his proud design, And, on his heart, while former praises press, He dares again to hope a like success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Port of Tunis. Anselmo and Gonzaga, with other Christian slaves, discovered upon the beach, looking at a Tunisian galley entering the harbour. Ans. Behold! a pirate frigate thro' the port Comes, freighted with calamity. Methinks, Here, from the shore of Tunis, we behold it As, on hell's burning margin, the accursed Rise from their beds of pain, to gaze upon The newly damned, borne to the realm of woe. Gon. If crimes bring down the lightning, tell me, Tunis, Why dost thou stand unscathed? Ans. The wrath of Heaven, The vengeance of the world, will fall at last. Hast thou not felt the pulse of terror beat Swift thro' the pirate-city's trembling heart? Gon. For twice three years I have known captivity, And, till this hour, I never yet have breathed In labour's burning round. The whip has ceased To crackle in the air,âand cruelty Seems to forget her victims. Ans. Oh! Gonzaga, If misery were not an infidel, To every faith in mercy, I had deemed The pirates' fears give warrant to a fame, That, e'er my destiny had flung me here, Was rumoured wide thro' Europe. Gon. To your friend Impart the precious hope. Ans. It was reported, That Charles the Emperor had at last decreed To turn his eye of mercy to the slave;â He had trodden Gaul to earth, and all the nations Bowed at his feet, in reverenceâyet, 'twas said, He felt the laurels wreathed around his brow, Drip with the blood of Europe, and resolved In expiation of ambition's sin, To trample out the pirates from the world. But see, with hurried step, and wildered look, Our fellow captive comes. Gon. It is Manfredi. Enter Manfredi, who rushes precipitately to the front of the stage. Mon. Thou hast heard our invocation, thou hast heard The burning invocation nightly poured From twenty thousand hearts of human mould,â Thou hast heard the captive's cry? Gon. Say,âWhy is this? Why hast thou rush'd amongst us? thou art not A feather to be stirr'd by every breeze, Of little incident. Ans. Why are thine hands Thus locked in supplicationâwhy do tears Stand on thy quivering eye-lids? Speak, Manfredi,â Nothing but freedom. Man. Freedom! Aye! it is freedom That makes my soul mount in a flight of fire, âAnd rush into the presence of my God! âEternal Providence!âMy wife, my child! âJoy comes upon my desolated heart, âAs swift spring-tides return upon the bark, âLong stranded on the solitary beach, âO'erwhelming as they left it.âBut I mock you, âYour expectation achesââCharles has landed. Ans. Spain's mighty sovereign.â Man. Twenty leagues from Tunis His eagles roll along the desert wind. Upon the shores of Afric he has poured Twice thirty thousand warriors;âfrom behind A ruin'd colonnade, where I had crouch'd, I overheard a band of Janissaries, And learn'd the precious tidings.âYes, he comes, The glorious champion of humanity, To blot the shame of Europe,âto let fall The long-suspended vengeance, and to giveâ All. To give us liberty. Man. Yes! liberty! What! have you felt the shock, and are you wild, And are you rapt as I was? âMighty God,â Look down upon us!âNot in all the world, Where'er thy bright and infinite eye doth reach, Dost thou behold more burning hearts than ours Beat in thanksgiving to thee! Enter Montalto and Moors. [The Christian Slaves rise as he enters. Mont. You have started? Man. We prayed, and 'tis your wont, e'en to deny That comfort to the wretched. Mont. If it be (aside) The comfort of the wretched, many years Have roll'd their lengthening waves above my head, Since I have known it. Ah! (after a pause) I deem you are The Count Manfredi? Man. That was once my name.â Now I amâSlave. Mont. Strike off his chains! [The Moors remove his fetters. Begone! [The Christian Slaves and Moors retire. Man. How dare you trust a Christian with himself? Mont. As yesterday I pass'd along the beach, It chanced a ruffian smote you. I observed The knitted fortitude upon your front, And straight inquired your fortunes. I remembered Your father, in a better day, had been Sometime my fellow in the field, and was A gallant soldier, and a faithful man. Man. What marvellous chance in war's companionship Knit Mahomet's abhorrent votary, And an Italian noble? Mont. Onceâ Man. You are movedâ Mont. Our creeds were once alike. Man. You areâa renegade? Mont. Their own peculiar planets rise on all, And mine might have been happierâ'Tis enoughâ I have resolved to free you from the lash, And to transfer you to a gentler service.â You are henceforthâ Man. Your slave:âfull twenty times I have been bought and sold. I am sold again, And, what does it import me? It is to me, As to the floating corse, a change of tide,â From one rock it but welters to another. Mont. You see before you one, long deeply read In the large volumes of calamity, Who fondly seeks to mitigate his own By diminution of his fellow's woe.â I own I feel myself a desolate And heart-forsaken man. I want a friend. Man. A friend! Mont. Speak on,âwhat does thy smile denote? Is it the smile of scorn? What see you here, That can deserve your scorn? Man. Not in your face, For there, âin mould'ring faded characters,â I indistinctly read of truth and honour; But 'tis an epitaphâeven there I read That they are deadânay, do not frown, my lord,â âI was a nobleman, whose fame in arms âWas Naples' boast. I had a wife, my lord, âWho was enough for mortal happiness; âBut Heaven, unwearied in its blessing, gave âAnother print of beauty, in her child. âI was so blest, my very name had grown âInto a proverb of felicity. âMen wish'd to be as happy as Manfredi. âWell,âcrossing to Sicilia's sister-shore, âIn an unarmed bark, an African âSpread all his sails behind,âvainlyâbut why âRetrace the butchery?âon the galley's bench âThey bound me to the oar, till it became âAlmost incorporate with me.âOn my limbs âThey laid the flaying stripe, until I sank, âLifeless, beneath; then, back again with stripes âThey lash'd me into life. The gnawing chain âHas worn its iron-way into my body, âMy ankles fester in the short revulsion âOf the deep-eating fetter.ââLook you here! See slavery's livid impressâhere, on me,â [shews his arm. On me, who was a soldier, am a man! Your friend!âthe hue of Europe on your face! The turban on your head! Your friend! I see you, Haradin'sâthe red-brinded tyrant's slave.â Aye! I behold you when revenge, at last, Treads with a giant's steps to yonder towers.â âNay, start not, for I know it all.â I see you Leagued with these barbarous, cut-throat Africans, Confederate with these predestined damned; A pirate, and a renegade! Mont. What, hoa there? Dost thou dare to tell it me? Damnation! renegade! What, to my face! to dash the base affront Against my teeth! What, hoa there! Enter Moors, who seize Manfredi. Man. I perceive you have learn'd the mode of Africâcomeâpronounce The fate of him, who dares to tell you that, You oft, at midnight, whisper to yourself. Mon. Thou never shalt despise meâwell I deem Thou smilest to think, I will debase myself. Another had impaled thee for the taunt, And I could hurl theeâI will not permit My anger to o'ermaster me. I spare theeâ Thou shalt not scorn Montalto. [As he retires from the Stage. Man. Hold! Mont. Away! Man. Montalto! Mont. Yes! âthe cursed, but not the base,â The blighted, not the fallen;âI am Montalto, Riven by the lightning, yet not turn'd to ashes, That infamy should scatter me abroad, With its black breath of pestilenceâFarewell! Man. âI hold thee back by that accursed robe. I have heardâ Mont. You have heard my wrongs? [Stopping and turning back. Man. Who has not heard the ingratitude of Venice? âYou stood her senate's guide, and, in her councils, âArose her people's dauntless advocate. âYou nail'd down victory to her mast; before you, âHer foes were dash'd, as burst the billow's path âUpon her guardian mole;âthen, at the last, âHer leagued nobility conspired against you, âAnd, in requital for a thousand battles âWaged upon every sea, perfidious Venice âStamp'd shame upon her famous admiral, âAnd cast him from his country.â Mont. Was that all? Man. Traitor. Mont. Ha! traitor! that indeed was hardâ But traitor only fell upon mine ear, And found no echoes hereâleave meâ(to the Moorsâthey retire)âYou said You were a husband? Man. Yes! Mont. A father? Man. Yes! Mont. They slew my wife and childâa little night Was given me ere my exile,âone short night Given to a father's, and a husband's heart.â My ruin could not satisfy my foes, They thirsted for my blood.âMy only brother Stood at the head of the nobility, And, to secure my treasures, and my name, Decreed my death.âThe ruthless villains burst My palace-gates asunder. In the night I heard their loosen'd yells, and, with my sword, I threw myself before the tide of blood.â My wifeâmy child,âI fought for you in vain! They tore them from my claspâI can't go on.â Oh! I have long since lost the power to pray, I have still the right to curse! A poignard pierced me, I saw mine infant whirl'd amid the band Of howling murderersâI saw my brother Standing, like Cain, when he had struck the blow.â If I go on, the thought will madden me! The spectres will arise!âI have told enough.â Now, dost thou scorn Montalto? Man. With my tears.â Unhappy man! you lived!â Mon. Yes, for revenge!â My assassins deem'd me lifeless; but their steel Had miss'd the seat of beingâere the morn A faithful servant bore me to the shore.â And the first sound that smote my conscious ear, Told me that I was childless. I knelt down, And curs'd the mounting sunâYes, I blasphemed Against all opening nature. Man. Could you live? Mont. I flew to Tunisâgave myself to hell! Led on the Africans to victory, Amid that Adriatic, where so oft I had scatter'd half their naviesâI have turn'd The billows back, foul with Venetian gore, I have heard the shrieking of the murderers, As down they sank into the whelming wave.â Oh! Venice, thou has felt Montalto's arm,â I am lostâI am reveng'd!â Man. Ill-fated man! Mont. Thou sayest arightâI am, indeed, accurs'd, I am a lonely heart-abandoned man! âIndifference has spread upon my soul âLike a green stagnant lake, that never feels âThe stir of healthful motionâAll around me âIs a wild stony wilderness, in which âI find no kindred beingâwhen my blood âRan young, revenge and nature fir'd me stillâ âI leap'd o'er gulfs of crime, and, in the bound, âI threw away this horrid lethargy, âThat lays its death-cold surface o'er my soul. âOh! it was well, when, like the cataract, âFrom precipice to precipice I plunged; âBut I have reach'd the deep abyss at last, âAnd, there lie down in ice.ââWhen I beheld thee, A thought rose like a breeze,âan idle hopeâ Thou can'st not be my friendâfarewell! [He is about to retire. Man. Montalto! Mont. Wellâ Man. You have found a friend! Mont. Impossibleâ The shipwreck'd wretch in the unfathom'd deep, Flings not his anchor from the bursting bark, Nor, in perdition's gulf will I e'er seek A human hold again. Man. Hear me, Montalto! Mont. I understandâthou would'st have me twice a traitor. Hear me, and hope no more. Thou dost behold The Governor of Tunis. Man. You! the Governor Of these accursed towers! Mont. I am. Haradin Has left the city with his choicest troops, To give the Emperor battle, and to me, Tunis is now intrusted. Man. Montalto, there's a voice within my soul, Crying aloud,âthat thou art chosen for The glorious instrument of liberty! Not, at a time like this, shalt thou be found Confederate with villains to the last.â Thou hast sinned, but e'en thy failings shall be turn'd, Like clouds impurpled by the evening light, To deep, and radiant glory. One great deed Shall melt thy sins to brightness, and shall make thee A blessing, and a wonder in the world. Mont. I am trustedâyou insult me. Enter Kaled. Kal. Hail, my Lord! Mont. Kaled! this villain tracks the sea with blood.â You are return'd from piracy? Kal. I landed Upon the shore of western Italy;â At midnight gave a palace to the flame,â Slew half the habitants, and bore the rest In slavery back to Tunis. On with them, Lead them before the Governor. Mont. The sight Of miserable things delights me not. (To Manfredi) Come. Kal. Good, my Lord, you shall behold a prize, Bright as e'er crown'd a Corsair-brave exploit, Myself, amid the carnage, bore her off, As, shrieking with her child, she pierc'd the flames, And almost 'scap'd mine arm. Mont. Begone! Man. (Stopping him as he goes out.) I pray you, List to the harbinger of misery! Hark to that groan, Montalto! Stay, my lord, Stay and behold your fellow-men, Montalto, And ask yourself, if e'er a soldier's armâ Mont. (With violent emotion.) Oh, spare me! Man. Should have leagued itselfâ Mont. Forbear! Man. With rapine and with murderâSeeâthey comeâ Behold! (Some Slaves enter from the back of the stage.) Mont. Ha! Man. Look upon these wretched men,â Behold this human misery,âthen think, Think that these deeds of horror are your own. Mont. Mine! dost thou deem this arm was ever rais'd In ruffian piracy? Man. I see you here. Mont. Why dost thou push the arrow thro' my heart? 'Tis deep enough already. (He rushes out with Manfredi.) Kal. Get thee gone, Thou muttering renegade!âI do suspect me, The Christian lurks beneath the Moslem still. (Enter other Slaves,âSalerno.âBellamira, with her Child, and moving slowly from the back of the Stage.) On with the Christian dog! Bel. Look at the shuddering form, the wither'd face, The step of tottering weakness.âFrom his wounds Half of his life is pour'dâHe tries in vain To heave a cry for mercy. (Kaled turns to speak with a Moor.) They have turn'd Their baleful faces hence.âAlas! my father, What will become of us? To what dread fate Are we ordain'd?âWhat have we done for this? Sal. Thou may'st exclaim to HeavenâWhat have I done? But IâOh! Bellamira, I have drawn Thy ill-starr'd innocence down the deep gulf, Where guilt precipitates me. Bel. Oh! my father, What do I hear? Sal. Holdâhast thou then forgotten That I have charged thee never to embrace me? Thy touch is as a scorpion. Bel. Pardon me. I had forgotten the tremendous dictate, Which hath exiled me from a father's breast. But, at an hour like this, I deem'd I might Have fled into my home. When I am thrown e'en from a parent's arms, Where shall I look for succour?â(weeps.) Kal. (To a Moor.) Thou speakest sooth. Her beauty, in the hour of public fear, Will ne'er reward our perils; but, 'twere wise At once to rid us of this fainting wretch, With yon vile crawling lumber. These soft limbs, Ere I expose them to the mart of charms, Must bound again in lightness, and a bloom, Richer than glows in shells of eastern Ind, Shall spread upon that marble countenance. Thou to the market with the herdâmeanwhile, I'll bear her to the Harem.âYou must part. Bel. Hear me! I am a wretch, whose marriage torch Burn'd with funereal light, and the same year That saw the wife, beheld the widow too. Look up, my boy;âthe sorrow in thy face, Will shew thou art an orphan. Oh! Sir, this was enough to break a heart Much harder than mine own; but other griefs Were still in store for me. At dead of night You snatch'd me from my couchâwith ruthless hands You dragg'd me to the oceanâand, oh! misery, I am in Tunis! do not take away The only earthly arm that now protects me, Nor mercilessly rend the sinking plank From a poor ship-wreck'd creature's drowning grasp. Kal. What can yon dying, helpless thing avail thee? Bel. Would not the thunder-clap, if it had peal'd Upon a murderer's ear, affright the poignard From his uplifted hand? and is there not A reverence in the very name of father, Could thrill the ruffian's purpose? Sal. We must part:â And, tho' you wonder at it, Bellamira, Thank Heaven that we must part. I pray you, pirates, Grant me one precious moment, to reveal A dreadful secret, that has long remain'd Hid in the dark recesses of my soul. I ne'er again shall look upon her face, And 'tis the last occasion left me now, To speak a deed of horror. If, hereafter, Chance ever ransom me, for every word I'll pay you countless value. Kal. It is granted. Sal. Approach thee, Bellamira Bel. Ah! my father! Sal. I pray you, Bellamira, do not breathe That blighting word upon meâfor 'twill drive My fainting spirit from this burning lip, And what I have to speak will be for ever Buried within this charnel-house,âmy heart. List to me, BellamiraâOh! 'tis impossible, I cannot speak it. Bel. My appalled soul Is palpitating in the toil of fate. Sal. 'Tis the last time that thou canst ever hear me, And I would not permit thee to remain In ignorance of thy beingâBellamira, Tho' I am called Salerno, learn from me. 'Tis but a borrow'd nameâwhen first I reach'd The realm of Naples, I flung off mine own, Because 'twas stain'd with blood. Bel. With blood!âOh! Heaven, A murderer, and my father! Sal. Murderer! I am a murdererâbut not thy father! Sal. My passing spirit tremblesâ Bel. Ha! he faints! Sal. Thy father wasâ(Faints.) Bel. Speak,âthou art a murderer, And thou art not my father! and, thank God, Thank God, a murderer is not my father! Oh! thou hast never look'd upon my face As fathers on their children, and my heart Ne'er beat with nature to theeâHa! he faints! The secret lies in an unthrobbing heart.â Kal. Bear him from hence! Bel. Awake!â(to the Moors) forbear, forbear To whom shall I lift up the frenzied cry Of nature's helpless anguish? Speak! whose name Shall I invoke in miseryâSpeak, Salerno; His nameâa word is all I ask of thee. Kal. Behold your child! (Draws off her child the other way.) Bel. My child! another instant. (She rushes between her child and Salerno, and stops on a sudden, to look back at Salerno.) I'll breathe my soul into his lifeless body,â Awake, Salerno! 'wake! Speakâspeakâmy father? [The child is drawn off. Too wellâyou know what chord about the heart Will drag a desperate mother thro' the world. [Exit, following the child. Salerno borne off fainting.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Shores of Tunis.âVessel seen in the distance, preparing to sail from the Port. Enter Manfredi, followed by Anselmo, and Gonzaga, with other Slaves. Man. Are you resolv'd? Ans. Lead on. Gon. We follow you. All. We follow you to death or liberty. Man. I came to teach you this, because I knew It would rouse you to achievement. Fellow slaves, Montalto is the governor of Tunis, And, thro' the hardened mail, that twenty years Of guilt and misery laced about his breast, I have deeply struck remorse. Ans. Call him to Heaven, And we are free. Man. A still, but awful voice Cries in the desert of Montalto's heart, And bids his generous nature to the skies. âI'll ply the work of glory, and assail âThe fiend Despair, within him.â 'Tis his wont At even-tide, along the solemn shore Of the great deep to tread, and here he wills I meet him, âand accompany his walk âIn this, his hour of peace.ââI wait his coming, And listen for his foot-stepâlet us not Abuse the precious moment fortune lends; Spain can but ope the way to liberty, We must ourselves obtain it. Tunis still Expands her bulwarks to Haradin's flight: His towers will mock the batt'ring cannon's roar, And brave the Spaniard's siege. Ans. What shall be done? Man. The gates of Tunis must be closed against him. Gon. By whom? Man. By slaves, that wish for liberty, And know that death is freedom. Ans. But these chainsâ Man. Chains may be burst,â'tis fear that makes them adamantâ I have told you, that Haradin has not left Five hundred men to garrison the cityâ âAnd I, at least, am freeâthis arm could wrench âThe fetter from your limbs, and, with its fragments âMight we not crush the pirates? Ans. Holdâa turbanâ Man. Montalto?âNoâfrom Kaled's roof he comes,â We must disperse ourselvesâwill you be free? You are slavesâyou are in Tunisâare you men? Ans. Here is my hand. Gon. And mine,â All. And ours! Man. Before you, And in Heaven's face, I dedicate myself To this great deed of gloryâlook you there, Yon shallop, that prepares to give herself To ocean, after sun-set, late arrived From Genoa, to redeem a noble slave Re-purchased by his countryânow, attest meâ Hear while I swear, and thou, recording spirit, Enroll it in my fate,âbe witness, Heaven, Be witness, earth, that if before she sail The voice of freedom came and bade me fly To the embraces of my wife and child, I'll fling my freedom back.âIn this great cause I triumph or I perish. Ans. Hold Manfredi!â No slave could keep that oath. Man. Manfredi will. Away! away! here, in this very place, I'll seek some glorious means to rend your chains, And, like a loosened earthquake's midnight shock, We burst on slumbering Tunis. I have swornâ Will ye not swear? All. We swear! Man. âAttest it He, âWho, framing human nature, planted there âThe love, and right of freedom.â Stretch thine arm Out from thy dwelling-place above the stars, And be thou with us! With the cannon's roar, That Charles pours out upon the turbaned host, League thy almighty thunderâ As terrible a vengeance, as of old Fell on the accursed cities, fall from Heaven Down on the pirates' towers! No truce with them, Who ne'er kept faith,âno mercy for the merciless! Destruction, and not chastisement,âhurl! crush! Annihilate at onceâand, with a blow, Strike out the black pollution from the world. [Exeunt slaves. Enter a Moor, leading in Bellamira's child. Whose is the Christian boy? Moor. A captive woman's. As almost lifeless on a couch she lay, From the embracing closure of her arms I disentangled him; for Kaled mark'd, That, when she gazed upon him, her swollen breast Heaved with a fuller anguish. Man. Prithee, Moor, Let me look at the boy! Moor. I must begone, Else might her shriek pursue me when she wakes From sorrow's slumbering trance. [Exeunt Moor and Child. Man. Ye merciless villains! Ye ruthless riflers of the human heart! Yet ruthless as you are, I hardly know, If a more blighting curse should light upon you, Or the stone-bosom'd wretches, who, so long, Beheld your perpetrationâand away Turned from the shrieking of humanity, The statesman's ear of deafnessâEurope saw These horrors nor aveng'd them. Shame upon you, You purple-pall'd inheritors of empire, And your cold-blooded men of policy, Who, in their heartless conclaves coldly sat, And at these cruelties, with marble smiles Shrugg'd their state-loaded shoulders. Bellamira (without). Bel. Where is my child? Man. Ah! what a sound was there! Enter Bellamira. Bel. Where is my child? Hear! 'tis a mother cries.âThey plunder'd me, They robb'd my widow'd heartâthey tore him from me,â Hereâfrom my heartâthey tore himâha! Man. Do I wake? Merciful Providence! âYe Powers, that will âThis strange, distracting sight! âI do not dare to speak it, lest my breath âShould blow the charming vision from the air, âThat drops from heaven upon me.â Bel. My brain turns! âI'll lay my hands upon this dizzy sight, âAnd then it will begoneââNoâit is there,â 'Tis there againâmy husband! Man. Bellamira! [She falls on the ground. My wife! Oh! let me catch thee to myself, âTill soul and life, and all be deeply lost âIn the wild flood of rapture.â I have found thee, My darling brideâThe motherâHeaven and earth, My wife in TunisâBellamiraâYes, I hold her in my blasted sightâIn Tunis! My wife in Tunis! Enter Kaled and Moors. Kal. Dost thou dare to lay Thy miscreant touch upon a Moslem's slave? Man. She is my wife,âmy own espous'd love,â The gift of heav'n and earthâHa! do you tear her,â Do you thus rend her from me?âthus I burst, With lion-fury, thro' your ruffian grasp, And rush upon his throat! [In the struggle he is overpowered, and falls to the earth. Enter Montalto. Mont. Slaves, 'tis Montalto speaksâNo moreâ Manfrediâ [They let Manfredi go. Man. Leave me alone to horror and myself. Mont. âIt is Montalto, whom thou dost despise, âThat lifts his voice to call thee from the earth. âArise!â Man. Montaltoâoh! she is my wife! The child and mother on this horrid shore Are brought before my sight,ââThou, who hast turn'd âMy prayers to fellest curses, and hast granted âThat I should once again behold my wife,â âNow hear another prayer;âwith thy strong flash âHere blast us both to ashes!â [Falls back on the ground. Bel. It is gone! That face is gone from me! â'twas but a dreamâ âOh! let me sleep again; for, when I wake, âThat face is only pictured in my heart;â âSleep brings it to mine eyes!â Mont. Hark thee, Manfredi.â I ask'd your friendship, and you spurn'd me back,â You thought me wholly villainârise, Manfredi, And take her from a villain. Man. Do you mock me? My wife.â Bel. That voiceâthat voice! Mont. (Holding back Manfredi.) Hold! lest again The flickering spirit flyâ Bel. That voice! that voice!â There's but one voice like that in all the world.â Oh! I should feel it in my sepulchreâ Thrill in my mould'ring heart! âThat voiceâwhere is it? âWill it not come again upon my soul? âWill it not steep me in deliciousness? âOh! that was not a dreamâwhere is it? speak! [To Montalto. âYou are not like the fiends that haunt me here,â âPity my panting heart!âby Heaven, I saw him, âI saw him with these eyesâhe stood before meâ âMy arms had almost clasp'd him, and he fled,â âI could doubt all but thatâthat voiceâthat voice,â âOh! I can never doubt that voice!â Man. âMy wife!â Bel. âAgain it pour'd itself upon my heart! âIt is a living sound!âdeath never spoke âWith that celestial music.ââIt was there! I know that it was thereâoh! let me pass, And seek it thro' the world! Man. My wife! Bel. He lives! He lives! and on my breast!âmy circling arms Have clasped him to myself. I saw,âI heard,â Now I embrace him tooâoh! my dear husband. Man. Oh! I must press thee closer, or my heart Will leap out of my bosom. Bel. Oh! Manfredi,â I thought you dead, and that the ocean-wave Had been your rolling sepulchre. I have knelt Whole moonless nights upon the foaming shore, And madly supplicated every wave To throw thee from its bosom at my feet. It had been once a broken-hearted joy, To have wrapt thee in a shroud, and pressed away The brine-drop from thy locks I would have given, To fall upon thy corpse, the extended world.â But now I have thee warm with life again, Answering each beat of my exulting heart, Let me gaze long upon theeâoh! my lord! My treasure, life, and all! Man. My joy! my transport! My Bellamira! Mont. Bellamira! did I hear that sound, Or was it only my deserted heart? What didst thou say? For, as I am a wretch, Thou didstâby Heaven, thou didst! Man. Could I delay To throw myself before theeâbut thy gift Had drown'd the very gratitude it claim'd. Look up, my angel!âLook upon the man That gave thee back to me. Bel. Let me behold him! Man. There, Bellamira! (She rushes towards him; he advances, impelled by the power of her name. She falls at his feet, while he checks himself.) Mont. Where doth distraction bear thee?âFool! a word, An idle sound, can work thee into madness.â I see you wonder at me; but you know How much I have endur'dâa very name Hath power upon a childless father's heart;â And Bellamira wafts a thousand memories In its delicious painfulness.âMy child, That was thy name, my child!âAlas! Manfredi, I deem'd it was my child that stood before me. Bel. I owe much more than life itself to you,â And in the word, which can pour out the heart, The holiest word in nature's burning language, I'll speak my gratitudeâI willâI mustâ It cannot be chok'd hereâI'll call you father, And I will be your child. Mont. No moreâno more. You do not know what daggers you strike here.â No more of itâmy griefs cannot be cured. Manfredi, if I heard aright, your child Is in the walls of Tunis? Bel. Oh! they tore him, They mercilessly tore him from my arms. Sorrow at last had sobb'd itself to slumber, And in my bosom I had clasp'd my child; But, when I wak'd, and would have press'd him here, Oh! what a desolation! Man. I beheld, And did not know my child. Mont. Not know your child! By Heaven! if I had stood upon the grave That holds my buried infant, I had known That, underneath a part of me was laid. Oh! God! if by some wond'rous and blest chance My child had been preserv'd, and to my arms She came,âas thou didst now,âthere were a voiceâ But I forget myselfâI am a wretch, And I grow garrulous in misery! A father's and a mother's desolate hearts A yearning for a dear,âa living child, While I am counting o'er my wretchedness, And weigh my griefs as misers tell their gold.â Come,âI will lock them in an iron heart. Kaled, this woman's ransom shall be paid, [Exeunt Kaled and Moors. She is my slaveâdeliver to her arms The child you plunder'd from herâGo, Manfredi, Dispute him with each other. But, I charge you, Let it not be before me. Man. Look you here,â She cannot speak,âand I, MontaltoâHeaven, How could so bright a spirit fall from thee! Come, Bellamira, let us seek our child, And when we have embraced him, let us fall Entranced before his feet! Mont. GoâBellamira! Bel. God bless thee! [After a long and struggling pause, she falls weakly into Manfredi's arms, overcome by her emotion. He conducts her out. Mont. âBless me! if the golden gates âOf open'd Paradise were stretched as wide, âAs when the spirit of my murder'd child âRose in her mother's bosom to the skies, âThat blessing were thrown backâAnd yet 'tis sweet âTo hear thee say, âGod bless thee!âââBellamira, I will protect thee for thy very name. Why did I listen to Manfredi's voice? I was as dreary and as calm before, As ocean's frozen waste;âbut now the ice Breaks up in storms about me. âI enjoy'd âA grave-like peace, and seldom did my sin âSting me back into memory. The serpent âThat long lay twined around a stony heart, âGrew petrified at last, and, like the thing âIt clasp'd in folds of marble, stiffen'd there.â âNow it begins to stir, and I can feel âIts forked dart again re-animate âWith all its venomed life.â Remorseâremorse, Not penitence is left me,âit is done,â My part is ta'enâthese old, and iron sinews Are grown too rusty too be crook'd again.â The knot within the stripp'd and barkless pine, In the dried channel of a mountain torrent, Is not more indurated by the blast, Than this hard lump within me. [A trumpet is heard. Ha! that sound Hath waked me to myself, and chased away The terrible dreams of my disastrous past,â I am again Montalto.â Enter a Moor. Well? Moor. My lord, Our monarch's favoured leader, Amurath, Stands at the gates of Tunis, and demands Admission to your presence. Mont. Amurath! Lead him before meâAmurath! 'tis strange, My brother renegade, at such a time Should leave the camp of Afric! 'Tis himself,â I know him by that swift impassion'd step That shews the rushing of his torrent thought, And a perturbed heart. Enter Amurath. Amu. Hail! Ere the dawn I left the Moorish camp, while, from its tents Our myriads roll'd to battle. Mont. I had thought The bridegroom from the couch had sooner turn'd, Than Amurath had left the field of death. Amu. Haradin bids me here. At flush of day, E'en as he leap'd upon his froth-white steed, I dream'd, he cried, last night, the battle lost, And that Christian captives had arisen, And clos'd the gates of Tunis on my flight. This dream is born of likelihood.âAway! Swift to the cityâbid the governor, Soon as the tidings reach him, that our host Reels at the charge of SpainâWhy, how is this? Mont. Then massacre them all. Amu. Noâthou hast shot Thy shaft beyond the mark. Mont. Thou hast relieved me,â Oh! Amurath, no bloodâthank God, no blood! Amu. Behold the signet! Mont. It is the mark of empire. Amu. You are no more the governor of Tunis. Haradin bade me, if I saw thee shrink, To strip thee of thy delegated rule, And robe me with thine office. Mont. Let me learn What guilty virtue he suspects in me? What sacred trust is mark'd for other hands, Mine are not fitted for? Amu. Look at this roll: The chief among the captives must be slain;â Here are their names, whose fierce unbroken souls Might rouse their fellows into mutiny. The rest lie down in weight of heavier chains, Secure in their own baseness. Mont. Aye, he knew me, I thank him for it too.âWhat! coldly murder! When the pulse beats with cool and temperate throb, To grasp the knife, and pour out human blood From naked, outstretch'd, unresisting throats! Haradin knew me better.âI have driven His prows thro' waves of Europe's foaming blood, But I have never spilt the life of man In damn'd deliberation.âWell he knew I was not fit for butchery, and I thank him. Amu. Hide you the cowl beneath the turban's fold? Is this my fellow-renegade? And are you Like those that, with the purpose to be dead, Leap from a rock into the whelming ocean, And, as they sink, then plash among the waves, And fain would struggle back? Look you, weak man, You cannot climb the beetling steep again,â The hand of an archangel could not pluck thee, With all the weight of guilt upon thy soul, Up the smooth precipice. For me,âbe blood On him that bade me shed it. Yet I own, With a reluctant foot I had trod in gore, Had not mine eye glanced on the scroll of death, And lighted here.âBehold! Mont. (After looking at the scroll.) Manfredi!â Amu. What, You are acquainted with the wordâfrom Naples,â The Count Manfredi! Mont. Yes! the Count Manfrediâ Amu. I might have trusted mine own instinct hereâ Farewell! (going.) Mont. He is your friend, perchance,âI have known But little of your fortunes;âbut have heard That Naples gave you birthâhe is your friend, And when you found him in the list of death, You flew to save him? Amu. Save him! on his heart To lay the fangs of hate, and by the roots Tear up the poison'd bramble.âSave him! toâlook ye, With all the power of my concentered soul I execrate his name.âThe ambient air Wherein that sound is breathed, turns pestilence, And drops in venom here. The damned villain! Oh! for the huge constrictor's giant-fold, That I might clasp, and crushâWhere is he? Mont. Hold! Amu. I was in Algiers, and I did not know That destiny had brought him to my hate. Mont. You will not crush the foe beneath your foot? Amu. I have heard men say, revenge first drove thee here, And made thee what thou art. Mont. It was revenge. Amu. If thou did'st meet the man who wrong'd thee most, Or most had gall'd thee, for it is the same, Would'st thou forgive him? Mont. No;âfor he slew my child. Amu. And he,âhere he,âupon my frontâhere,âhere.â(strikes his brow.) I cannot bring it from my bursting throat,â But, shall I waste the airâand tell my wrongs? No! let me first revenge them! Mont. Amurath! Amu. Hark thee! I am almost tempted to mistrust Thy fealty to guiltâNoâI will yet Confide in thy despairâthou can'st not hopeâ I'll trust thee, for I trust myselfâlike me Thou art gone beyond the reach of penitence; Thou art swallow'd in perditionâthou art seal'dâ Recorded for damnationâHell would shout, And peal with laughter at a prayer of thine. Thou art a renegade! [Exit. Mont. I am still a man. [Exit, opposite side. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>

Bellamira! hear my cry, Hear me, or you are lost! I will preserve you! I have sworn it to myself.âWhere are you? hear me! Montalto callsâManfrediâBellamira! Ha! you are come at last!

The unrolling canvass pants before the wind, Yes, I will save you!âHence!âbegone!âaway! [He reclines in weakness on Manfredi's shoulder. The time is rushing on.âEnough to tell you That, in the port a vessel is prepar'd, Freighted with ransom'd slaves for Genoa, To wing her o'er the waters.âAs I pass'd, I heard the mariners' up-heaving cry, And hope came back to me.âI flew to save you, To send you hence for ever!

I cannot give you audienceâthe fresh breeze Has fill'd her swelling sailsâI must from hence, To bid her mariners ply their swift barge, And waft you from the beachâRemain you here,â And, soon as you behold the bark,âaway! Lose not a precious moment, and farewell! Bel. You must permit me to embrace your feet, To open all my burning bosom here, And wet the dust you tread on with my tears! You would not have me go with all the load Of untold gratitude upon my heartâ âNay then, I'll have your hand at least.ââ Mont. Farewell! I shall not see you more;âbut from the beach I will pursue the vessel, till her sail Melts in the circling skyâand you, perchance, Will stand upon the deck, and thence behold Amid the twilight's glimmering from afar, In moslem garb, a miserable man On the receding shore!âRemember me! [Exit. Bel. Yes, while I am a motherââStay, Montalto! âHe hurries from my sightâthe tower is pass'd, âAnd he is gone for ever! [Turning to Manfredi. âOh! Manfredi! Man. âWhat a dread sacrifice I am compell'd âTo offer up at honor's iron altar! Curse on these frantic lipsâto have thee here But for one mocking instant, and behold thee Rent from my clasping bosom! Oh! I have swornâ Bel. What hast thou sworn? Man. Not to depart from Tunis. Bel. Thou could'st not lift thy hand to yonder skies, And bid them bear a witness to an oath So rash, so cruel, and soâNo, Manfredi, Thou did'st not, could'st notâ'tis impossible! No, by thy truth thou did'st not. Man. Yonder rock âIs not more deeply rootedâBellamira,â The Christian slaves are leagu'd for liberty, And I am sworn to lead them! Bellamira, Thou must begone from me. Bel. Begone from thee! Man. Shall my name go dishonor'd to my child? What! lead them to the precipice, and then, When I had push'd them on the glorious leap, Shrink from the gulf! Honor, thy voice within me, Stern as it is, must be obey'd. Bel. Obey it. But there's another voice within meâhereâ It cries as loud, and it shall be obey'd. The despot, honor, in a hero's breast Holds not a rule more absolute than love, On his own throne, a woman's trembling heart. Man. What would'st thou do? Bel. âI am your wife! you seem âTo have forgotten that you are my husband.â I am your wife! and where's the seemlier place For me to bide, than where my husband stays? Thou dost not hope, that I will ever seek The place where thou art not. If a descending spirit from the star That lights the evening, dropp'd upon the earth, To waft me on his pinions into bliss, I would not go without thee! âNo, Manfredi, âHere is my shield, my mail, my citadel, âMy trust, my land of peaceâmy strengthâmy refuge. âHere will I stay for ever!â Man. Dost thou think, That while the lightning quivers o'er my head, I'll hold thee near to an accursed wretch, That the same flash may blast us both to ashes? Hark! 'tis the plashing of the rapid oar! Behold, thy safety comes! the barge approaches! Oh! When I swore if liberty itself Came smiling in my face I'd hurl it back, I little deemedâ Enter Sailors, in a boat. 1st Sailor. We come to waft you hence, Where the ship wheels impatient as the steed Ere the loose rein be given. I charge you, haste; The ocean-breeze is ruffling, and the mast Bends to the vigorous gale! Bel. Oh! my dear lord, I never will abandon you! Man. Know you, you are in Tunis,âin the place Of horrid perpetration, where no law Of earth, or heaven, can shield the helpless wretch From sensuality's ferocious arms? âHave I not started in the dead of night, âAnd deem'd it was the voices of the storm âThat had awakened me;âbut, when I listen'd âI knew the human shrieking!ââBellamira, I have seen the ruffian grasp of violation Off from the father rend the clinging child, And tear the daughter from the mother's arms;â And thouâthou, Bellamira,âthou, my wife!â Bel. Ha! (With horror.) Man. Look you thereâthere is Haradin's palace! There is the dome of infamy! Thereâthere The sensual monster pampers up his gorg'd And furious appetite, and finds a joy E'en in the shrieking of the frantic wretch The laughing villain immolates!âAnd thou,â âI cannot hold that thought within my brain,â âIt bursts at the black image!ââThus I clasp thee. Rather than trust thee here another moment I'll give thee to the whirlwind! (As he bears her to the boat, enter Kaled and Moors.) Kal. Seize the slave! (They seize him.) Bel. Before my faceâhere in my sight!âye powers That blast all human hopes, what bitter dregs Lie in the vials of calamity, Which I had almost drain'd?âYe turban'd slaves, How dare you lay your grasp upon the form Your lord had bidden free? Speak, by what right?â Kal. The word of Amurath. Man. What 'tis that Heaven Intends to do with such a wretch as I am, I will not ask.âI have only power to charge thee To give my dying wishânay, my commandâ Unloose me, villains! (He rushes up to her.) Yes, I will constrain thee!â I'll force thee to thy safety, Bellamira! Fly, fly from Tunis! Take her fellow Christians, Take her, preserve herâdrag her from the shore! (The Moors draw Manfredi from her). Bel. No, no, you shall not do it! Dost thou think That I will e'er abandon thee to death? âCrush'd be the vile, the base, and earth-born thought, âThat never crawl'd into a woman's heartâ âDo not despise my succourâI have got âMy tears, my supplicationsâI have got âThese arms to twine around Montalto's kneeâ âHe will protect thee stillâI know he will!â Misbelieving slaves, you shall repent the deed!â I'll hence, and bring him here, whose single breath Shall blow you from the world!âAnd see, he comes! It isâit is himself!âMy friend, my saviour! Montalto! Oh, Montalto! (As she rushes up, enter Amurath, who, in his impetuosity in rushing towards Manfredi, does not see her.) Amu. Have you got him? Villain! (Sees her.) What do I see? Man. Speak! who art thou? Thou call'st me villain, while my powerless arm Lies subjugate! Amu. It were too much for faithâ âIt is a vision, a mere dream of hate, âThat brings her to my presenceâLet me try âOne doubtful sense by the otherâI have touch'd her,â âBy every nerve that shivers o'er with joy, âAnd trembling owns the electric contact here, âIt is herself!ââOh! villain! hold my soul Bear him away!âThe dungeon! to the dungeon! Bel. You shall not tear him hence! By Heaven, you shall not! Man. Fly, Bellamira, fly! Amu. Away with him! Man. That look! let me behold thee once againâ He turns him from my sightâWhat art thou? speak! Oh! can it be! that faceâthat voiceâfly! fly! Distraction! fly! [Exeunt Moors and Manfredi. (As they bear him off,) Bel. Then, take me with him too! I must not be held back! unhand me, villains! Keep me not from his arms,âto the same dungeon, To the same grave,âthey bear him from my sight! Let loose thy dreadful grasp! living or deadâ Thy hand hath clench'd me with a demon's power, And stopp'd the circling blood.âOh, sir! have mercy! Amu. 'Twas rais'd so high from expectation's reach, It came not even within my wishâ'tis she! 'Tis she, herself! as beautiful as when She dawn'd upon me firstâas when she first Kindled Vesuvius in my burning breast! That form is still in undulating beauty, The master-piece of Nature's sculpturing hand! There are those eyes, whose rich and liquid lustre Feeds and rekindles the dead torch of love! There is the brow where beauty sits sublime Upon a throne of ivory!âThere is Bellamira! Manfredi's wife!âhis wife! it once was hell To think she was his wife,â'twas hell to love,â 'Tis rapture to revenge! Bel. Are you the man Whose word hath sent himâ Amu. To the grave! I am! Bel. The grave! the grave! what, murder him?âmy husband! Why would you kill him? why would you profane Your hands with innocence? What has he done? What crime has he committed? If for blood You feel the desert tiger's maddening thirst, Take mine! take mine! (after a pause) Ha! I have look'd upon him, And I have hope no moreâbefore one glance It wither'd in my breast! Amu. Where would'st thou go? Bel. Where I may find some human nature stillâ I go to find Montalto! let me pass. Amu. All here are dust before me! 'tis to me You must address your prayerâ Bel. And have I wrong'd you? Is mercy resident within your heart? He does not turn the adder's ear away, He listens to my cryâMy lordâmy lord,â Spare him, and Heaven, out of the book of sin, Will raze your every trespass! He is my husband! he is all to me! My life, and soul, and being,âHeaven and earthâ And mine own heart first chose him for mine own! 'Tis not the common link of duty, forg'd On cold obsequious form, that binds me to himâ I have enough of love within my breast To fill a hundred hearts! in gratitude Affection's fountain gush'dâhis gen'rous handâ Oh! I perceive you listen to my prayerâ He saved my honorâhear me for his life. He rent me from the grasp of violence,â He tore me from a villain! Amu. Ha! a villain! Bella. Yes! from a villainâHa! he starts, he shrinks Back from the thought of blood!âMy lord, my lord, I read the rising pity in your face,â The rigor of your purpose melts awayâ Your trembling form, and agitated lookâ Speak, it has touchedâ Amu. It touches me indeed! He sav'd you from a villainâI confess That you have stung my curiosity.â Who was this villain? Bel. âGive me back my husband. âThen, from a o'erfraught heart I will pour out âThe story of my gratitude!â Amu. âSubdue âThe palpitation of that heaving breast! âWho was this villain?ââYou perceive what power The tale hath wrought upon me; to complete The work of mercy here, speak on! this villain,â Who was this villain? Bel. One, that said he lov'd me, But whom I could not love; desperate he swore I must be his, and leagued with mountain bandits, He rush'd down from the Apennine, and seiz'd me.â Manfredi swift pursued the ruffian flight, And while I shriek'd for succour, and the hills Only gave back their echoes to my cry, He rush'd, and tore me from him. Amu. Well, what happen'd? Bel. His name was shorn of honorâand a brand Was struck upon his front. Amu. And it is here! [Strikes his brow. Bel. That face!âthat look!âSinano! Amu. Aye! Sinano! âHas memory eked the fatal word at last, âFrom the vile heap of nothings, where it seems, â'Twas cast to be forgotten.â Could the turban,â Could this vile garb then wrap me from myself? Hast found it then at lastâhast found at last, Amid the lumber of thy recollections, That I am, indeed, Sinano? Bel. Would to Heaven Thou wert a demon, that had ta'en his form, And not Sinano! for a fiend from hell Would only bear me to a bed of fire, Not to the couch of shame! Amu. I am Sinano! Once I abhorr'd the sound, and from myself I shrunk, as thou dost nowâand to mine ear My Moslem name was a familiar word; But now, I feel a transport while I tell thee I am Sinano! Bel. Pour down molten lead, But do not yell that most detested word In madness through my brain! It is himself! A demon would not look so terrible! It is himself! Earth, burst beneath my feet, Open thy gulfs around me, and at once I'll plunge from life, from infamy, and thee! Amu. Look here! Bel. I dare not look on thee again! Amu. Here, on this fest'ring browâhere was it struck, Indelible, eternal as the fire Blown by almighty wrath! oh! villain! villain! How shall I make thee feel, all thou hast driv'n In madness to my brain? I'll tread upon him! I'll trample him to hell! I have himâhere,â I have her too!âThere! there she is! Bel. No hope! no refuge left, where misery May rush from yon avenging villain's grasp! Amu. (Grasping her.) Did'st see me thrown down foaming on the earth; Did'st see the spurning foot upon my form? Did'st see me torn at noon, before the eye Of the collected rabbleâandâit choaks me! Did'st see it doneâwhile from their pestilent throats They shouted to my shame,âoh! tears of fire! Have I then got you stillâdid'st see all this? Thou didstâand 'twas for thee! Bel. For me! oh, no! I did not sin against theeâ'twas not I That plung'd thee in perditionâ'twas not I That struck the mark of shame upon thy browâ 'Twas the ferocious demon that possess'd thee! 'Twas thy own furious self that did it all! Where do you drag me? Save me, Christians, save me! Oh! save me! save me! (She rushes to the boat.) Frenzied that I was, I dash'd thy mercy back into thy face! Oh! plunge me in the whirling vortex down, But, save me from Sinano! Amu. Bellamira! (He drags her from the boat, to which she clings on her knees.) Bel. You may rend off my armsâhew down my limbs,â You shall not tear me hence! [She is pulled off, and grasps the child. My child! my child! Oh! save my child, at least! Amu. (To a Moor.) Here! Bel. Save my child! [He bears her off. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Sea-shore. Enter Montalto followed by a Moor. Moor. A christian slave with earnest supplication Begs to behold youâhis deep sunken eye Stream'd o'er with weeping prayer, and his clasp'd hands Were palsied in entreaty. Mont. Tell him then, That he must find a meeter time than this.â Until upon the waste I see the ship That bears two human creatures, for whose safety I have sworn unto myself, I cannot give An ear to other misery. Moor. He bade me Convey this pictured ivory to your hand, And said when you beheld it, it would win Admission to your sight! Mont. Let me behold him! Bring him before my face! [Exit Moor. By Heaven, it isâ It is the very picture I suspended Around my daughter's neck! It is the image of my murder'd wife! Perhaps it is some old and faithful servant, Who laid them decently within the grave, And comes to tell me where he buried them. Enter Salerno. Sal. âHe is alive!âbe blest the happy hour âThat loosens me from murder!âYes, he lives! âMontalto stands before me!â Mont. Speak, who art thou? Approach me nearer stillââfor these weak limbs âAre shaken with emotion, and I dare not âLet loose my trembling hold!â [Holding a pillar. The picture,âspeak! I hung it on the bosom of my child, Before she call'd me father! Sal. (Advancing to him.) Oh! my brother! Mont. What horror with an icy grasp lays hold On every pow'r within me? Mighty one, âWho keenly followest the track of blood,â Let all this trembling consciousness be true! Aye! let it be the murderer! Sal. Tread upon me! Lay thy profaning foot upon my head, But do not call me by the name of blood! Mont. At last thou hast given himâ At last thou hast given himâperfidious villain! A heavier damnation is upon thee Than ever rested on the front of Cainâ He slew not Abel's child.â Sal. Hear and forgive me.â Mont. Forgive theeâyesâif thou dost bring to me A child of thine as fairâas beautifulâ When I have stabb'd thine infant in thy face, Thenâthen will I forgive theeâmurdererâslave Rock-hearted traitorâto yon blasted rock I'll drag thee upâI'll catch thee in my arms, Then plunge with thee into the roaring ocean, Lay my strong clench upon thy choaking throat, Behold thee blacken under my gripe, Then sink with theeââto hell, and thereâha! ha! âThere see thee damn'd!ââ Sal. Hear me, my brother, hear meâ She lives!â Mont. Livesâlivesâwho lives! Sal. Your wondering eyes Gaze in misdoubting vacancy upon me. But, by the truth of hopeless misery,â Your Bellamira lives. Mont. What art thou? Let me look on you again. You would have murder'd meâthat was enoughâ For that I can forgive youâbut to mock meâ Ah! do not mock me nowâ Sal. When the false senate leagued against your life, Your wife and child were sparedârent from your arms Upon the tumult's torrent, they were swept Out from the palace gates; and thro' the city A rumour of their death was circled wideâ That none with me might afterwards dispute Your title and your treasuresâbut full soon I reap'd in misery what I sow'd in blood. The tide of public favour quickly left meâ Remorse came with adversityâI fled Proscrib'd from Venice; but, before mine exile, I sought your dying wife, and from her arms I took your Bellamira. Mont. Oh! my brother! My child! my child! She that has drawn from me Life, breath, and blood, and motion! Oh! my brother! (Falls at his feet.) Sal. Let me unknit the hands that should be rais'd Up to the heavens in cursesânot be turn'd In blessings round my knees.âArise, Montalto. Mont. You took my Bellamira!âOh, my brother! You have lifted up the grave-stone from my heart. She was aliveâgo onâand still she lives? Sal. A holy priest, to whom I humbly knelt For pardon of my sin, pronounc'd this sentence:â Thou hast slain a brotherâexpiate the sin By cherishing his daughter as thine own; Bear her for ever in thy blasted sight, And let her call thee father.âThen from Venice I bore her safe to Naples, where I chang'd My blood-mark'd name, and call'd myself Salerno. Mont. Ha! Bellamira! Sal. The harden'd gore dissolves upon my soul.â I heard your name among my fellow-captives, I sought you for forgiveness, and to tell youâ Mont. Where is my child?âunloose me from the tortureâ Where is my child? Sal. In Tunis. (A vessel appears sailing from the harbour.) Mont. It is herself! The ship! the ship! conduct me to the ship!â Ah! 'tis too late! they bear her from my arms! There!âit ploughs up the ocean!âholdâmy child! âIt fliesâit rushes o'er the ocean wasteâ âIt flies from me for ever!â Oh! for a voiceâ A voice should reach the limits of the world, To call her back!âMy child! my Bellamira! Who dares to stay me back? Sal. What hoa, there! help! Mont. âI'll plunge into the ocean.âI'll bestride âThe billow's foaming back, and it will bear me âIn triumph to her arms!ââWho dares to stay A father from his child? Christian slaves rush in. Sal. Lay hold of him,â Till the first shock of passion wastes itself From phrensy into tears! Mont. A little while; Stay yet a little whileââthy sail at least âHath heaven's white brightness for a father's eyes.â âStand still upon the wave.ââIt hears me not! Yon rugged, rugged promontory, like despair Hath closed it from my sight.âShe is gone for ever! Sal. If yonder bark conveys your daughter hence, Lift up the voice of joy! Mont. It had been sweet To pour a shower of tears upon my child! That had been sweet!âbut, oh! what right have I To ask it of the heavens?âShe lives!âMontalto, Thy daughter lives!âShe is not in the graveâ The worm is not at banquet on her cheekâ That's joy enough for thee! Sal. Upon the beach, These eyes beheld a dark, and turban'd man, Who bears strong semblance to the gloomy face Of the accurs'd Sinano!âWhere's the hand Could save her from that villain's grasp of shame? Mont. âDost dare to breathe itâdost dare to think it?â Montalto's child and shame!âmy scimitar Leaps from its sheathâHa! have I then forgotten The voice that late was like the thunder-clap, And shook the walls of Tunis, is as weak As a poor infant's cry? What had I done? Where had I rush'd?âI had call'd on you for succour.â You would have answer'dâRenegade! Sal. My brother! That name is thine no more!âThe self-same hour That wipes the imagin'd spot from off my soul, Shall strike the turban from Montalto's brow. Mont. âThus, thus, I rend it off!â If men should smile upon me, and exclaim Behold the wavering traitor!âI will cry, Behold a father too! Sal. The brave Manfredi has already leagued Our fellow-slaves for freedom!âIn the night, They rise, and rush upon the sleep of Tunis! The rest are chain'dâbut we who late arrivedâ Thrown on the beach, neglected, and despis'd, Are not yet cloth'd with fettersâwere we arm'd Mont. (Giving his scimitar to Salerno.) There! (To slaves), follow to my dwellingâyou will find A thousand weapons on the embattled wallsâ You shall have arms and liberty!âThe villain! âI'll rend the cup of gore from out his grasp,â I'll mar his feast of blood!âArm, fellow Christians, And save yourselves from carnage! All. Carnage! Enter Gonzaga. Mont. Speak on! Gon. The pirates seize twice fifty Christian slaves And mutter massacre! All. Vengeance! Gon. Manfredi, Whose arm, and word, could lead to libertyâ The brave Manfrediâ Mont. Is saved! Gon. This instant I beheld him borne Loaded with ponderous fettersâand his wifeâ Mont. His wife! Gon. Amid a ruffian's arms she shriek'dâ Mont. 'Tis false! â'tis false as Satan!â She is gone! My child is gone for ever. Gon. If the wife, Of Count Manfredi be a child of thineâ Mont. My Bellamira! Gon. Be the flash of heaven! Save her from Amurath! Sal. To arms! to arms! To freedom! to revenge! Mont. My child! my child! [Exeunt, Salerno, Slaves, and Montalto. SCENE II. The entrance to a Turkish Harem. Enter Sinano, bearing Bellamira in his arms. Bel. Where do you lead me? Sin. For a pulse like this, I thank thee, Mahometâconvenient prophet, Look down and envy me.â Bella. Where am I borne! Sin. Where should I bear thee? Ask thyself that question? I was not ever what I amâI saw thee, And the fierce wish was poison on my life, And, like the hot sirocco, fann'd my heart.â You did not love me, but you did not loathe me. Who was it taught you that? the very man For whom I bore abhorrence in my blood, Colleagued with Spainâhis faction trod me down And rose upon my ruinâbut he won theeâ That!âoh to see thee hisâthat drove me mad! I hired the bandits of the Apennines And rush'd to seize thee!âThen, The mark that struck my forehead pierc'd my mind, It made me villain!âWas there ever man Disgrace made not a villain? Who e'er lost The esteem of all the world, who kept his own? What need I tell thee more? The brand was hereâ The turban serv'd to wrap it from the world! My recompensing stars at last hath brought Your husband to my hateâyou to my love! And now you askâwhere do I lead you?âthere! Yonder's the bowerâ Bel. Of horror, and of shame! What! stain'd! profaned! degraded! Ignominy Clothed upon me like a sheet of death! To look upon the sun, and know myself To be the vilest wretch that it beholds! The immolation to ferocity, Dishonor's loathsome sacrifice!â âThe soil'd, the shamed, the trampled, cursed thing!ââ Am I to be that thing?âHave mercy on me! Sin. And who had mercy on me, when in vain I cried aloud, that they should tie my body Upon a faggot of slow-flaming fire, And spare the mark of contumely? Who then had mercy, when my voice of man Turn'd to a woman's shriekâwhen to my back They bound my frantic armsâand with my teeth, (What had I left?) like a madden'd wolf I crauch'd the red-hot steelâwho then had mercy? But do not think it is revenge to thee, That lights my bosom nowâthat I hoard up âLike burning charcoal in the furnace here!â For thee my early passion glows againâ âI love thee still, and will renounce for thee, âAll other joyless passion! From these bowers âI fling the faded wreaths of Eastern beauty,â And thou alone shalt blossom in my breast! Bel. Flourish in leprosy, and bloom in sin! Hold back thy blist'ring touchâlash me with vipers, And whip me thro' the world, but do not lay The hand of crime upon me!âGracious Heaven! Where do I standâhere! in the place of guilt! Here! on the threshold of my infamyâ And shall it be?âBy Heaven, it shall not be! I'll burst thro' adamant! or, on these bars I'll dash my desperate brains out! [She rushes to the door of the Harem, and in her endeavours to force it open, falls on her knees. Sin. It is in vain! Bel. Sinano, spare me! See me on my knees! Take not this vile advantage of your power! Pity a desolate and helpless creature! A wretch, whose fate hath thrown her on your mercy! I have beheld you kneel, and weep to meâ Behold me kneel, and see me weepâSinanoâ Villain! Oh, noâkind, merciful Sinano! Oh! kill me if you willâmy life! my life!â Sin. Nay, Bellamira! Bel. Life! Sinano, life! My life! but not my honor!âOh, Sinano! [In the struggle she seizes his dagger. Now, villain, I defy thee! Sin. Curse on my stars! Bel. Deaf as the adder, as the mark'd leopard fierce, And crueller than the hyena's laugh! Thou barbarous, pitiless, remorseless manâ Oh! no! not manânot manâbehold! and tremble! Sin. What! at a woman's arm! Bel. Yes! at a woman! In honor's cause, I here unsex my soul, Firm the strong purpose in my desperate heart, And brave thee while I grasp my safety here! Sin. And dost thou think I fear the shivering blade That shakes within thy gripe?âLet me behold thee! Come! grasp the steel with an heroic grace, Stand fearless in thy beauty!âLift aloft The gleaming whiteness of that polish'd arm! Let terror sit upon that kindling brow, Swell the bold lip, and from thine eye dart forth Fires, harmless as the lightning in the blue Of summer's evening sky! Bel. âStir one step!â Sin. I had not fear'd it in thy husband's hand. Bel. And learn, that if I do not fear to kill, I do not fear to die! think not thy heart The only one that I can pierceâthank Heaven There is another here. Sin. I fear that eye! Witness the power thou hast.â [Kneeling. Bel. Oh! I abhor thee! It is the very instinct of my nature, Entwin'd around the nicest life-string here, And running in the channels of my blood! Arise, and let me pass! Sin. What would'st thou do? Bel. Burst through the place of shame!âThe very air Breaths maculation on my soul! Arise! I ever deemed thee terrible, Sinano, I did not think thee baseâbut now I see All that thou art indeed!âOh! thou didst well To wreath the turban's fold around thy head, And hide the cicatrix of infamy! Thou branded villain, hence! Sin. Branded! perdition! Did I hear branded? Madness! yesâ'twas branded! 'Tis hot and furious as it were impressed This instant on my quivering flesh!âit burnsâ The turban like red iron clasps me round!â Off from my phrensied brow, and let me feel The freshness of the airâI dare not do it! The sun shall never look on it again! No human eye shall gaze upon my brow! [After looking at her for a long time. For thee who hastâVengeance! [Rushes out. Bel. What have I done? âI have pour'd fire upon him;ââhis last look Shot demons as he went!âbut, oh! he went, And hope, that fled affrighted from his glance, Comes back again upon me! let me fly! And seize occasion now!âThou who hast sent The poignard to my grasp, be with me still! And save me fromâ As she rushes outâEnter Sinano, dragging in Manfredi, attended by Guards. Sin. Behold! Man. My wife! Bel. My husband! Sin. Yes! husbandâwifeâSinano tooâgo onâ In rapturous replication let me hear The words beat on my heart!âBehold each other! Behold me too! the master of your fate! Manfredi, there's your wife! and, Bellamira, There is your husband too!âand look you hereâ Here is the branded forehead! and Sinanoâ Man. Better to hear the mandrake's shriek of death, Whose sound doth burst the charnel!âBetter see The king of fiends upon his throne of fire Amid the empire of the damn'd, than hear And see that frantic villain!ââBring me, quicklyâ âBring me your red-hot sheets of burning brass, âAnd clasp them here, till they have sucked away âThe liquid sight out from each eyeless socket! Or let me go, and, with a madman's hands, I'll dash the reeking globes upon the earth That shew me my dishonor. Bel. Do not think That I am yet unworthy of thy sight! Behold! Man. Thou art here! Bel. Behold! Man. (seeing the dagger) Art thouâ Bel. I am alive!âand could'st thou ever think, I had lived another instant, with the power Of death within my hand?ââEven, from his breast, âEven from the throne of crime, I drew it forth, âAnd now before thee lift it, with a hand âThat's brave enough to strike it to my heart! Sin. Bid her resign it! Bel. Was it then for this You brought him to my eyes? And dost thou think The man that conquered thee, is base enough To buy that thing, my life, with infamy? Fool! 'tis his sight that rouses all my soul, And wakes the lioness! his sightâpoor villain! What should I feel, if I before him stoodâ I am resolved upon it!âOh! Manfredi! Nothing but this can save me from my ruin, And if I cannot die within thine arms, At least, before thine eyes, I thus can give The last tremendous proof of truth to thee! Sinano rushes towards Manfredi, and places his scimitar to his breast. What would'st thou do? Sin. I'll hide it in his heart? Throw down the steel!âshe tremblesâBellamira! Bel. Oh! spare him! spare him! Man. Strike, Sinano, strike! I rise to meet the blow! strike! strike at once! Strike, villain, strike!âI scorn thee as I did When down I hurled thee frothing to the groundâ Trod on theeâbeat thy bosom to the dust!â Strike, bandit! Sin. Ha! Man. Strike, pirate! renegade! Strike, branded slave! Sin. I will! Bel. Hold! hold, Sinano! Sin. âMadness had almost driven me on the deed! âDown, demons, down!âBehold! 'tis but to push âMy arm a single inchâgive back the dagger! Bel. Only one momentâstay, Sinano, stay! Noâmerciless as thou art, thou dost but plan To win me to thy graspâthy grasp!âHear heaven! Hear, in the grave, thou who hast given me beingâ Throw off the sepulchre! Arise, my father! Enter Montalto. Start sheeted from the tomb!âHa! thou wilt save me! Thou art dropp'd from heaven to save me!âOh! Montalto! My hope, my friend, my refuge, and my God! Oh! save me! save me!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Dungeon. Manfredi is discovered bound to a Pillar upon one side of the Stage; Montalto to another, upon the opposite side; the intervening part occupied by Anselmo, and other Christian Slaves. Manfredi and Montalto appear haggard, and almost insensible of what is around them. Ans. This morn the hope of liberty arose, Bright as the sun amid the golden orient, And kindled up our souls with beams, that threw Their stretching radiance on futurity;â But now we darken back again to night, And, in the place of freedom, find out death. A Slave. But we are almost blest, when, in the scale Of human misery, our woes are weighed With yonder silent statues, that despair Seems to have touch'd to marble, âand designâ âAs monuments of her terrific power, âTo stand in her own dwelling-place.â Ans. His child Senseless was rent from his parental arms, Before the secret of her birth could reach Her phrensy-deafened ear. Man. That shriekâthat shriekâ Ans. No other sound is here, Save the dull booming of the heavy sea, That breaks against our dungeon. Man. Oh! that shriekâ She calls on me for succourâdo you hear her? And I am chain'dâmy wifeâmy wifeâmy wifeâ He suffocates her cry of agony.â And Iâ Ans. Forbearâthou desperate man, forbear! Man. Who art thou, that dost tell me to forbear? What right? what patent from calamity Hast thou to teach me patience? âSpeak, what sorrows âHave rained upon thy head?âthou art to die, âThou wilt rot within the earth;âbut will the foot âOf insult trample on thy sepulchre?â âWill the loud laugh of contumely pierce âDown to the bottoms of thy house of death, âAnd scarce away the worms about thy heart? âHast thou a wife in Tunis? patience! speak, âThou merciless teacher of forbearance! âWhat right hast thou to bid me not be mad? Fool! all thy sorrows, weighed with one of mine, Are but the mote in yonder moonlight beam Weighed with the massive earthâbut, harkee, sir, I'll bear with you, if you but find one man In the large multitudes of misery, Who dares to measure agony with mine. Mont. (Rising) Look here.â Enter Kaled and Moors. Kaled. Misbelievers, I am sent to teach you, That Spain has won the dayâHaradin flies, And fifty thousand corses strew the plain. Slaves. Oh, joy! thy tyrant falls! Ansel. Spain has prevailed! Kaled. The prophet from his votaries turns awayâ The scimitar is shatter'd, and the cross Waves in wide triumph o'er the wilderness. But you must die. Man. and Mon. Welcome! Kaled. The great Haradin Moats Tunis with your goreâthe victory That, dressed in glory, danced upon your hope, Is 'companied by deathâYou are chosen to be An immolation to security.â He had slain all your misbelieving herd, But that he deems your sever'd heads will smite The meaner crowd with terror, and freeze up The purple mire in their unthrobbing veins. Unloose them from the pillarsâto my trust The charge is given by Amurath, to lead you Forth from the dungeon to the sea-worn beach, And there, in presence of your fellow-slaves, To lift the scimitar. Man. Conduct me forth, And, as my head leaps from the sever'd trunk, The quiv'ring lips shall mutter thanks to thee. Kal. Before I bear you hence, hear what the law Of Mahomet proclaimsâmercy to him Who calls upon the prophetâchoose between Death or the Koran. All. (except Montalto.) Death! Kal. Then follow me. Mont. Hold! you forget me! Kal. Not upon thy head Their destiny hath fallen; for Amurath, Tho' thou hast lifted up thy impious hand Against the glass of majesty, remembers Thy service to the state, and, place of death, He wills captivity. Mont. Deny me death! âDeny its right to age,âto grief its cure, âThe broken-heart its resting-place. I charge thee, âKaled, I charge thee, hold! leave me to live, âAnd with a brain of lava, where despair âHath struck the horrid image of my child?ââ Hold, Kaled, hold! I have a right to death! More right than any wretch among them allâ What, will you bear him to the grave, and slap The sepulchre against me? Kal. Onâ Man. Montalto,â Mont. Away!âthou hast betray'd my child! Man. Betray'd her! Mont. Did I not bid thee flyâbegone.â Man. Farewell! [Exeunt Kaled and Slaves. Mont. âThey throw me back to lifeâthey leave me here, âLike a damn'd spirit on a burning rock,â ManfrediâKaled!âVillains! [He throws himself on the basis of pillar. Enter Bellamira with her child. Bel. I have reached The dungeon where he liesâI shall behold My husband ere he perishesâManfredi! Manfredi!âsilent as the sepulchre,â No answer, save the replicated murmur Of yonder vaulted chamber, that gives back My voice in its deep echoes.âAll around Is a wide waste of dungeonâhe is dead,â The horrid consciousness is in my heart,â He is already deadâManfredi!âha! (Montalto groans) A groan hath hopeâhath life in it (groans again.) Again! What do I see? a human form at last Hath come upon my sightâbeneath that robe What shivering trances shootâwhat agony Hath clenched those grappling hands? Mont. Oh, Bellamiraâ Bel. Ha! he calls upon me. Mont. Out, horrid thought! Oh madness! Bel. Hold! (discovers him) Montalto! Mont. What do I see? âI have heard that fiends are wont âTo robe themselves in fleshy lineaments, âOf the dead child of some abandoned man, âWhom heaven consigned to them before the grave. âBut thou art still so like my Bellamira.â A demon could not mock a face like thine. âThis hand was never underneath the earth, âIt is a living handâthe dew of death âHath not been shed on itâmyâ Bel. SpeakâMontalto, By what strange circumstance I see thee here. Montalto in the dungeon,âchains upon him! A thousand recollections faintly flit On my perplexed thoughtâbut I remember I flew to thee for help, and saw thee seized, When to the place of shameâ Mont. The place of shame! Bel. Thy face was on me, and I heard thee cry. Yes! I did hear thee wish me dead. Mont. Speak on! That I may know, if I should wish thee living. Bel. He spurned my tears, my phrensied supplication Seemed but to light his furyâOh! Montalto, I had no help but heaven! Mont. And heaven abandoned thee? Bel. No, heaven did not abandon me,âthe cry Of ruin came on his appalled earâ Frantic he sought the messenger of fate;â I sprung again with innocence, and seized My child amid the tumultâto the dungeon, Unmark'd by fear, with frantic steps I flewâ No ruffian hand was thrust against my path, The gates unfolded stoodâthe guards were fledâ I rush'd into the dungeon,âbut I foundâ Mont. Thy father! Bel. (Starting) Ha! Mont. (Kneeling) âThou Father of the world, âFor twenty years this heart hath never heav'd âDespair's black heap away, nor ever throbb'd âOne supplication to theeâbut the rock âHath burst at last within meâhere the fount âOf human nature gushesâI can weepâ âNature hath thawed the ice within my breast, âAnd tears are come at lastâMy child! my child! Bel. âYour child! She is at such a distance, that he cannot reach her with his arms. Mont. âMy Bellamira! to these armsâ âRush quickly to these arms.âWhere is my child? âI have not got thee yetâCurse on these chains âThat keep thee from my bosom!âBellamira, âHave mercy on me! Do not now deny âThe only joy that's left meâOnly once, âBut once against my heart! Bel. The sacred word Hath thrill'd thro' all my beingâOh, that face! Those trembling handsâthat face of streaming love! By the instinctive power within my heart, Whose life thus rushes to its source again, By nature, by almighty nature's power, Are you?âYou are my father! [Rushing into his arms. Mont. I amâ I have thee then against my wither'd breast,â My own, my beautiful, my darling childâ My all, my Bellamira! Bel. Oh! my father! Enter Sinano. Sin. Traitor! perfidious traitor! Bel. Ha! Sinano! Mont. Villain! she is my childâand he that arms Parental nature thro' the universe, Shall mate my arm, chain'd as it is, against thee. Bel. O save me from his grasp! Sin. Thou damn'd traitor! Thou recreant from hell, as well as heaven!â [A shout is heard. Hark! doth it reach thee? Mont. Yes! What is the sound? Stay nearer to my heartânay, nearer still. [To his daughter. Sin. Dost make a falsehood of thy very face? Did'st thou not free the Christians? Mont. Ha! Sin. Who was it That rent their bonds asunder, and let loose The hungry wolves upon us? Even now A Christian slave was seized, and with the rack We tore thy crime from out his bared heartâ Montalto was his groan. Mont. It was Montalto! Sin. Curse on the foolish lenity that spared Thy hairs of grey, and did not to the steel Give all the rabble herd! Mont. 'Twas I that did it. Sin. Die! Bel. Hold! he is my fatherâlet that word Fall on thee like the thunder! Sin. It is done! (He stabs Montalto, after a short struggle with Bellamira.) Bel. My father! [Falls upon him. Sin. (Flinging the dagger down.) I shall need thee now no more. Come thou, whose sweep of death hath often hew'd A chasm amid the phalanx, thou, at least, Tho' destiny desert me,âmy right arm And thou art left me still. [Draws his scimitar.âExit. Bel. And was I then Ordain'd for this at last? The self-same hour That shews the hidden fountain of my life, Hath redden'd it with blood.âThere, there it is,â That blood that gave me being. Mont. My dear child! Long lost, and found at last, but found too late. Bel. Why was I given the mystery of my birth? Oh! why this mockery, Heaven! Mont. The deadly steel Hath reached a mortal depthâ'Tis done with me, My fainting spirit journeys from the worldâ Oh! look upon me wellâmy child, my child! That look will stay with me beyond the grave; And now I charge thee, fly! Bel. What, fly from thee! No! here I am for everâOh! my father. I'll cling around thee, even in death itself, And thou shalt be entomb'd within mine arms. Mont. Fly, and preserve thy child. Bel. My childâoh, Heaven! Yes! I will save my child! [She rushes suddenly to the door of the prison with her child, then looks back, and seeing her father in agony, returns to him. Oh! my father! I never will abandon thee! arise, Arise; and fly with meâOff, chains, away! Can you resist a phrensied daughter's power? Thusâthus I pluck you from your marble hold, Thus rend you into pieces.âHa! the fiend. [Re-enter Sinano, bloody, with his turban off, the brand appearing in his forehead, his hair dishevelled, his scimitar broken.âA shout heard. Bel. The fiend comes back upon me. (She throws herself on her child. Sin. He has conquer'dâ My scimitar was shiver'd with the blow That fell upon my headâthe palace gates Are stormed with rushing myriadsââHe flies,â The villain cried, âhe fliesââbut 'twas revenge, Not fear, that wing'd my flightâThe blood hath shot A purple dizziness upon my sight. Ha! there it standsâand yet, Sinano, hold! I cannot kill the wretchâbut I can less Die unreveng'dâOh! for a scimitar. Sin. Aye! that is vengeance still.âThe child is sparedâ I could not tread upon that little worm; But I will throw him prostrate in the dustâ I'll make the villain kneel and ask for mercy, And my last look shall see a bending foeâ He shall kneel down, and beg him from my graspâ [He approaches Bellamira. Bel. What would'st thou do! hast thou not gorged thyself With blood enough alreadyâlook thee thereâ. Sin. You need not fear for him. Bel. Not fear for him? Doth not thy glaring eye,âthy bared front Interpret to a mother's frantic heart? Thou bid'st me not to fear, when I behold The brand, like hell's own impress, on thy brow.â Sin. (Feeling his head.) Ha! not here.â The turban cleftâthe mark of infamy, That, 'till this hour, no mortal eye hath seen, Glaring upon my frontâ'twas he, that did it!â Not satisfied with having stamp'd it here, He bares it to the world. [Bellamira falls on the child, so as to cover it on the earth. Bel. Now villain, strike,â Strike thro' a mother's bosom! Sin. Give him to me! [He tears the child from her. Bel. Oh! mercy, mercy!âHelp me, nature, help me! Sinano, spare my child!âbehold this breastâ It heaves, and pants for mercy! A mother's shriek hath pierced the savage heart Of the wild brute, and cannot reach to thine. A tyger would not touch himâmercy, mercy! I supplicate thee by a mother's pangs, I call thee by a parent's agonyâ By thy own mother' breast! Oh! helpâoh! help! [Manfredi, Salerno, and the other slaves rush inâManfredi recoils. Man. Almighty Heav'n! Sin. (Lifts up the child.) Behold! [Montalto, who, during the struggle, has risen upon his knees, and grasped the dagger which Sinano had thrown down. Mont. Die! [He stabs Sinano in the back, who falls dead, Bellamira catches the child in her arms. Mercy! mercy! [Dies. THE CURTAIN FALLS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. (WRITTEN BY A LADY,) SPOKEN BY MISS BRUNTON. 'Tis on a thankless errand I appear Before you, gentles!âWill you deign to hear? My orders are to smooth yon Critic's brow, To raise a smile hereâthere avert a row: Besides, all those who've slept the play throughout, Expect of me to hear what 'twas about. Yet lovelier looks, I see, rebuke th' intrusion, That mars so suddenly each sad illusion, And say, with eyes in which the tears still glisten, âNo Epilogue!âwho to such stuff can listen?ââ While others stickle for their rights,âwhile some Hold a gay Epilogue the sugar-plum, The taste of five black doses to o'ercome! To Tom, the groom, the stirrup-cup's more sweet Than all he gorg'd before of ale and meat; And yonder many a pretty Betty sits, Who, more than wages, values perquisites. You, ladies, know, how fond soe'er the letter, The lover's postscript speaks his feelings better. Nay, mark the well-taught Miss, whose matchless skill, Fixes each wondering eye in the quadrille, Or waltzing, in her vortex with her whirls Dukes, dandies, heroes, citizens, and earls! Alike to nature true,âshe, towards the close, Pokes her long-bridled headâturns in her toes,â Cries, âLet me stay, Mamma, for Country Bumpkin, And have, at last, one merry dance to jump in.â Already on my side, all those I name, The question's carried, and my right I claim, To plead the Poet's causeâBut who shall sway, This host of intellect, in dread array?â Here taste and feeling ambush'd on our flanks, There wit and critic lore, in serried ranks; Yonder, in phalanx, native judgment jamm'd, Compress'd like air, into the air-gun cramm'd! Yet, 'gainst these hostile bands thus rang'd tremendous, If we've but gain'd the passions, they'll befriend us. Acting as oil upon the raging sea, Or as you, ladies, vers'd in chemistry, Find acids neutralized by alkali. If here, for instance, purer taste should chide, With softer feelings in your breast allied, 'Twill efferversce a momentâand subside. Yonder, if cat-calls wake their shriller tone, 'Tis half for fun!ânay, 'tis but fair we own, If you can't hear our noise, you make your own. And here, when wit has dipp'd his lash in gall, A note,âa gesture on the heart will fallâ The scourge is dropp'd, and nature's tear has shone Beneath the brow where lower'd the critic-frown. While thus within your bosoms it appears, That we may set two parties by the ears; Why, let them fight it out, and, when they cool, The kindlier feelings, here, are sure to rule.</field>
