      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoke by Mr. Betterton. Do you not wonder, Sirs, in these poor Days, Poets should hope for Profit from their Plays? Dream of a full Third Day, nay, good sixth Night, (Especially considering how they Write.) But so it is; and thus I go to show it, Wo to us Players, every one turns Poet. All Write alike, and therefore every Brother, Free from all Envy, stands by one another; The live more peaceably than Bees, no doubt, Since not one drone of all is driven out. Our Author is so green, and young a thing, 'Tis hard if he can yet have lost his Sting! Those Boxes! He may beauteous Gardens call, Fair are the Flowers, and he sucks Sweets from all; Nor is he less oblig'd to Masks and Beaus, Who pay for Plays; even when they borrow Cloaths. On your united Favours he depends, And thinks you all his, and our House's Friends. Tho' you hate Blood-shed, out of pure good Nature, As Poets, Criticks, or as Fops hate Satyr. Be not to Day afraid to see us Bleed, But let for once, a Tragedy succeed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoke by Mrs. Bowman. Who of you all can guess a Poet's trouble, Which is in these Religious Days grown double? Once only smutty Jests could please the Town, But now (Heav'n help our Trade,) they'll not go down. Our Liberties this hard restraint infringes; For all our Authors are beside their Hinges. You Sparks, who knew the Story of this Play, Thought to have seen two Ravish'd Maids to day. But by our Bashful Youth one half is stifl'd, My Sister only (to my sorrow) rifl'd. Pray, tell me, Gentlemen, and tell me true, Might not I well have claim'd that kindness too? Maids may indeed in such a case Miscarry, But what are Rapes to us wise Folks that Marry? Thieves may bolt easily into open Houses, And Force will still excuse us to our Spouses. Stayâon my Conscience now, our Author knew, The way to please, was to save one for you. Pray, after such an Obligation, speak; Can you do too much for the Poet's sake? And yet he doubts the worst, and is asham'd Before-hand, of the Fate of being damn'd; Ease him, by your applause, of his suspicion, And think, one day it may be your Condition. For Fortune is her self a very Woman, And Human Chance to all alike is Common, Masks, Beaus, and Criticks, will be true to No Man.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE the City of Verulam, with the British Army Encamped under it, and the Romans at some distance. Enter Cassibelan, and Camilla. Cass. Mourn not, my Love, because the Roman Arms Have once more fill'd our Island with Alarms. By Heav'n, I rather thank their forward Care, Who with such readiness supply the War. Who let me every Day gain new Renown, To make the Beauty whom I love my own. Thou shalt the Center of my Wishes be, The Sum of my Desires is set in thee. Cam. Take all the Love a Lover e'er could claim, I own, my Charming Prince, an equal Flame. Let your Camilla all she feels confess, And glory that her Passion is not less. The tender'st Love of Woman-kind is due, When 'tis solicited, dear Youth, by you. Cass. O Words! to Charm an Angel from the Skyes, O lovely, loving Maid! thou Heaven of Joys! Let me run out, thus ravish'd, on the Foe, My Soul is rais'd, shall I not Conquer now? Encourag'd thus, o'erthrow the Roman Bands, Love guides my heart, and that shall guide my hands. Cam. Still let me lock you in my longing Arms, Gaze on you still; for ev'n your Fury Charms. Well might this Rage the Roman Legions fright, But what disheartens them, gives me delight: Such Love as mine, might ev'n Love's Goddess yield, For so look'd Mars in the PhlegrÃ¦an Field. Cass. Throw then thy snowy Arms about my Crest, And let me crush thy Beauties to my Breast: Thy Tenderness this Martial warmth inspires, Thy Softness kindles these transporting Fires. Thou first enflam'st me to the fiercest heat, And after Battel mak'st my Blood abate. Cam. Let others boast their Beauty, or their Youth, Or what is more, their Constancy, and Truth. Let Nature all her Richest Gifts bestow, And in full Tides let their smooth Fortunes flow; Heav'n shower upon them Blessings from above, Teach them (the greatest Blessing) how to Love. All these are yours, yet there's one Charm in store, Of wondrous Gallantry, which Merits more: In all your Words, your Actions, and your Meen, There's something more than Human to be seen. That Godlike Something has peculiar Charms, And that endears you to Camilla's Arms. Cass. Heaven! what a Spirit do thy Charms impart, Strength to my Arms, and Courage to my Heart. Thy Love is all my Spur, thy precious Smiles The purchase of my over-rated Toils: Let others Fight for Empire, or for Fame, And the vain hopes of an Immortal Name; I would not to the Field of Battel move, For any Recompence that's less than Love. Cam. What Woman might not such dear words subdue, To hear such Passion spoke by such as you? But see, the Queen, with all the Court appears, Her Royal Look Majestick Sorrow wears, Her Eyes dart Fires, and scorn to melt in Tears. Enter Boadicea, Venutia. Boad. Rome is not yet the Mistress of our Isle, Still Fortune sheds on us an equal Smile, Nor shrink we underneath the Warlike Toil. Let Earth submit to her Tyranick Sway, No Britain born, can servilely obey. Their Swords at liberty our Souldier wields, Draws as strong Bows, and lifts as pondrous Shields, Disputes as desperately the Bloody Fields. Cass. The Lust of Power has set proud Rome on flame, And Universal Empire is her aim; Her Warlike Eagles spread from Pole to Pole, Let Winds blow where they list, or Billows roll; Thro' Woods and Wilds they force unbeaten ways, Then steer more desperate Courses o'er the Seas. New Legions now are Landed on our Shores, And with fresh Troops relieve their shatter'd Powers; From Vanquish'd Gaul their Conquering Arms are led, And the Fam'd Decius Marches at their Head. Cam. Yet will those Conquerours act with prudent Care, And proffer Peace, e'er they proceed to War. Well do they know our Resolute Britain's Force, And think it best, to take the mildest Course. Reviewing what their Ancestors have done, They find they cannot boast of much they won. Here, the Great Julius met his first Defeat, Glad was that Godlike Victor to Retreat; Compell'd to own, when he forsook our Shores, No force on Earth could equal Rome's but ours. Boad. He the first Rudiments of Conquest lay'd, Then we were bravely fought with, now betray'd. He shew'd how far Ambitious Spirits dare, Bold were his Hopes, but his Pursuit was Fair. Now with mean Arts Rome props her falling Cause, CÃ¦sar degenerates from what CÃ¦sar was. Our dying Lord, ensnar'd by Nero's wiles, Won by false Friendship, and deceiv'd by smiles, Left him to be the Guard of us, and ours, Left him the Charge of all his Hostile Powers, His well-fill'd Armories, and Naval-Stores. To Rome's Rich Lot did all his Treasures fall, And faithless Rome has made a Prey of all. Cass. Is Britain of her former Fires bereft, Has she no Brave, no Gen'rous Spirits left? I find our Vengeance strugling for a vent, Shall Rome provoke? and shall not we resent? Let her make all the World besides her own, Nature has made us for our selves alone. She fix'd our Isle, cast the wide Seas around, Made the strong Fence, and shall not hands be found In Britain, to maintain the British bound? Boad. Prince, in your Valour I repose my Trust, Strong are our Armies, as our Cause is just. Alike in both, does your pleas'd Queen confide, And Righteous Gods will take the Righteous side. Then let the Romans like the Gyants rise, To fall, as they did, from revengeful Skyes. Cass. I hear their Trumpets sound the notes of Peace, Trumpets from within. As they draw near, the pleasing airs encrease. A Bloody Field was once my sole Delight, My Business, and my Pleasure was to Fight; 'Till your dear Beauties melted down my Heart, And your kind Pity took your Beauties part. Then was your Conquest absolute and free, And now my Pleasure in the Peace shall be, That I have leave to Love, Live, Die with thee. Enter Decius, Caska, Attended. Dec. To you, Great Princess, from Imperial Rome, Sent on a peaceful Embassy I come. With you alone, will our Dread Empress Treat, And freely to your Choice she leaves your Fate. All Nations else without Dispute Obey, And Homage, as her vanquish'd Vassals, pay. But from his Love to your dead Consort due, Our CÃ¦sar condescends to Terms with you. Bo. Well, was his Love, and well his friendship shown, Making those Realms, he swore to guard, his own: But we (if lawful Princes could) rebell'd, And secret Fraud with open Force repell'd. Survey our Fields, your slaughter'd Legions count, Learn to what numbers all your dead amount. When her repeated Losses Rome shall know, She will no more contemn, but court her Foe. Dec. The World's dread Master, Rome's Imperial Lord, His Souldiers ravage in your Realms, deplor'd; He knew not, while their Avarice urg'd them on To those injurious Wrongs, what Wrongs were done. Now Conscious of their guilt, I'm sent to sue For Peace; which never Roman us'd to do. See here, his awful, all-Commanding Hand, [Shows a Scroal of Parchment, subscribed, Nero CÃ¦sar. Sign'd to whatever Reason can demand. Here Peace, or War, upon your Voice depends; Think; and declare us either Foes or Friends. Bo. Such have our Sufferings been, Rome's Treachery such, You cannot grant, nor we demand too much: But on these Terms, we chiefly shall insist, First, let your numerous Forces be dismist; Your Garrisons from strong-Wall'd-Towns withdraw, No British Subject shall be kept in awe. We will have all Prerogatives restor'd, And Rome shall be our Ally, not our Lord. This yielded to, will make us some amends; Now 'tis in your decision, Foes or Friends? Dec. All this does Rome's indulgent Emperour yield, You Wish unbounded had an ample Field. Now, peaceably, let Rome's pleas'd Eagles fly, And sweep with noiseless Pinions through the Skye. Let Britain's waving Streamers all be furl'd, And Universal Rest brood o're the World. Let Winds forbear to rage, and Waves to roar, But curling Floods come dancing to the shore; Let all be Peace; for War is now no more. Bo. The sev'ring Clouds disclose a glorious Scene; Bright Sun-shine smiles on Britain once again, And all the Heavens around us look serene. Let us retire a while, our Terms to sign, Where CÃ¦sar's Hand has led the way to mine. Then let all Britain at her Bliss rejoice, And you, brave Prince, my lov'd Camilla's choice, to Cassib. Have now your grateful Boadicea's Voice. From your blest Bed let long Succession spring, And every Royal Heir prove such a King. Cass. Now Hymen light thy Torch, and hold it high, And scatter Sparks of Love about the Sky. This day all fears of future Wars removes, And all the rolling days to come, are Loves. [Exeunt. Re-enter Decius, Caska. Dec. O Caska! She's the same, the very same I saw before in Medway's silver Stream, And now the second sight revives my Flame. All-ravish't on the flow'ry Bank I stood, Viewing her Beauties through the liquid Flood: Which when the Chaste, and Charming Virgin knew, With trembling haste, all blushing, she withdrew, Shot thro' the stream, and vanish'd from my view. I might have known her then of Royal Race, For lovely Majesty and Heavenly grace, Shone bright in all the Features of her Face: But now, I know her better, to my Cost, And found again, I find her ever lost. What might not I have suffer'd by this Truce? Or what will my fantastick Fates produce? No Wars shall cease, no Souldier's Arm shall rest, If by this Peace my Rival should be blest, All Peace must fly from my distracted Breast. Cask. Is this the Woman then? I'm glad she's known. Be rul'd by me, she shall be still your own. Now shall your lingring Fever be remov'd, And you be what you were before you lov'd. When I have helpt to ease you of your pain, I'll turn your Soul, new form'd, for War again. Let not one rising doubt your Thoughts perplex, There are a thousand ways to win the Sex. Dec. She's too, oh! too far gone, too great a length, E're to be reach'd by Stratagem or Strength. Not all the dangers, of the bloodiest Field, (You know, my Friend) can make my Courage yield; Inur'd to Camps, in noise of Battels Nurst, Death in all Forms I've seen, and brav'd the worst, Nought but her loss, my settled Soul could move, Nor can I stoop to any God but Love. Fixt like a Rock, amidst a rapid Flood, Beat on all sides by Waves, unshook I stood; 'Till Love, did like resistless Lightning shoot, Run thro' and thro', and rend me to the Root. Cask. Suppress your Jealousy, your Rage abate, Nothing is got by this immoderate Heat. To gain your point, wrong measures you pursue, Which smooth deep Policy alone can do: In these Concerns we must with caution move, Less Artifice belongs to War than Love. Dec. See me, my Friend, as calm as Lovers sighs, Silently listning for your kind Advice. My Life, my Love, depend upon your Breath, Plott with dispatch, for all delay is Death. Cask. Far off, indeed, your present Hopes appear, Cassibelan believes his Bliss is near. But he, shall like some foolish Stripling run, Who thinks on the next Hill to seize the Sun; But when he climbs the Mountain he design'd, He sees his Errour; and that Prince shall find, Who thinks himself so near, how far he's left behind. Dec. Let them not meet, nearer than Pole to Pole; Distract their Loves, as they distract my Soul. Consult with Gods or Fiends; take any course, And try what may be done, by Fraud or Force. Rack your Invention for the speediest way, To drive their hopes; far as yon rolling Sea Divides their World from ours; if e're they join, All Heav'n meets in their Souls, all Hell in mine. Cask. War must proceed, and Peace must be supprest, Or you be never of your Wish possest. The Peace confirm'd, your Rival's Joys ensue, His Nuptials then are solemniz'd, and you Shall have your Mistress Married in your view. But bloody Fields, and Battels loud alarms, Will still detain him from her longing Arms. Dec. Speak on a little longer, quickly speak, O! tell me, what Evasions can we make, Or what Pretensions have we now to break? Cask. Since either side on every term agreed, No doubt the Peace will on their part proceed. Let us some new unthought of point suggest, Which will be certain to confound the rest: Demand your Mistress in your Colleague's Name, Absent, he cannot know he bears the blame, And that again will set us all on flame. Nay, to go farther yet; declare you come With this Commission from the Court of Rome. Say the great Bravery by Paulinus shown, Now fully to Imperial CÃ¦sar known, Makes him, by favour to the Britains led, Propose a Consul to Camilla's Bed, That by their Nuptials either Empire ty'd Firmly, for ever may remain Ally'd. Dec. Enough, the Queen, and all the Council's come, I'le throw the Dice, what ever be my doom. Thus far the War must favour my design To cross his Hopes, altho' it Crowns not mine. Enter Boadicea, Camilla, Venutia, Cassibelan. Bo. Britain and Rome are Friends from Pole to Pole, Winds waft the joyful News, and Waters roll. Let every Voice, where Seas and Shore extend, Aloud proclaim, that Rome is Britain's Friend. Let fearful Virgins sleep in quiet now, Let well-pleas'd Hinds with chearful labour Plow, And Peace be seen to sit on every Brow. Tides of full Joy swell high in every Breast, For the long harrass'd Earth is now at rest. Dec. Still, mighty Queen, does one great Point remain, And that not granted, all the rest are vain. To you, fair Princess, am I sent to move [to Camilla. For my brave Colleague, in the Cause of Love. Long has Paulinus sigh'd his silent Vow, But never would he make it known till now. CÃ¦sar declares himself his Souldier's Friend, And on these terms decrees your Wars shall end: By this Alliance will your Realms become Link'd to the Interest of Imperial Rome; So shall Hostility for ever cease, And Rome and Britain have eternal Peace. Cass. War! rather let it be eternal War; Let the whole World in endless Discord jar. Run out, my Souldiers, bid our Trumpets sound, Let in their Notes the Voice of Peace be drown'd: Bid every Britain hasten to his Arms, And rouze the nodding World with new Alarms. We'll dare the worst, whatever Heav'n prepares, Be Death or Conquest either ours, or theirs. Bo. Fir'd with a just Resentment and disdain, Britain shall never hear of Peace again. Not tho' your CÃ¦sar could command our Fate, Shall Boadicea condescend to treat. Would but my Daughter once her self resign, Tho' to an Emperour of the Roman Line! By Heav'n I'd use her as my deadliest Foe, Scarce should I use a faithless Roman so. Cass. Tell the bold Rival of my sacred Flame, Tell him, Cassibelan shall sound his Name Thro' all the embattell'd Squadrons, if he dare Catch at the Sound, and meet his Rival there. Dec. Britain, assure your self you shall be met, Now silence yours, and hear a Roman Threat. Those Swords are drawn, whose cruel Edge shall spare No Sex or Age, in the reviving War, Those Souldiers are incens'd, whose desperate Bands Dare act whatever Rage, and Lust commands. They'l set your Temples and their Gods on Fire, While Heav'n in vain sees the bold Flames aspire. Chaste Matrons, shall like common Strumpets burn, And Infants from the Breasts they suck, be torn. Your Virgins shall on Shrines their Rapes deplore, And pray to helpless Powers who suffer more. Too late you will repent this rash Retreat, Wish for these Articles again too late, When all your lofty Towers shall shine in Flames, Death Riot in your Streets, your Silver Thames Roll down into your Seas a purple Flood, And all your Chalky Cliffs look red with Blood. [Exeunt Decius, Caska. Cass. Thro' the wide World let War's loud Voice be sent, Let the sad Earth her dying Sons lament, And Nature sicken for the dire Event. And you Imperial, but regardless Powers, Who unconcern'd sit smileing in your Bowers, Let from your Hands the strugling Lightning fly, And toss your flaming Bolts about the Skye. Let all your Thunder speak your loud Applause, And Heav'n, and Earth, join with us in our Cause. Bo. Beyond my Sex my towring Spirit dares, Which shrinks not at the shrillest sound of Wars. We stand on Terms as good as Rome's, and ours Equal at least, if not exceed their Powers. And Poets, who shall write in sacred Rhimes, Our Actions to be read by future times; If they take care to learn what each has lost, Shall find that Rome has no great cause to boast. [Exeunt. Manet Venutia sola. Ven. Both sides with equal hopes for Arms prepare, I'm left alone, abandon'd to Despair. How hard, alas! is my unhappy Fate, Compell'd to love whom all my Nation hate? Duty, and Love, my doubtful Heart divide, Which, at a loss to choose, takes neither side. Britain must fall, if Conqu'ring Rome succeeds, If Britain prospers, my Paulinus bleeds: Why should I call him mine, who breaks the Vow He made me once, but makes my Sister now? My other Griefs could, while he lov'd, be born, But now I sink with his unlook'd for scorn: For tho' he should persist to use me ill, I find it in my Fate to love him still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE Changes to the Roman Camp. Enter Paulinus solus. Paul. Sure 'tis the best Estate when Mortals prove None of the Sweet or Bitter Draughts of Love; The Sweet can ravish the transported Soul, But still the bitter makes the larger Bowl. Let those that will in such a state remain, Share in no Pleasure, to partake no Pain; But I, above that dull indifference rais'd, Would live in Pain to be but sometimes pleas'd: For in the Bliss that Beauty can bestow, One hour of Joy outweighs an Age of Woe. Enter Fabian. Fab. I left, my noble Lord, our Arms Engag'd, And now the bloodiest War again is wag'd: Never did Romans greater Bravery show, Nor ever were receiv'd so well as now. Here British Troops, there Roman Legions yield, And drive by turns each other thro' the Field. Here Fierce Cassibelan, there Decius storms, While Fate attends them both, in all its Forms; Each Party Fights as certain of Success, Nor can their Losses make their Courage less. Conquest, or Death, each side alike pursues, And Victory still doubts which side into chuse. Paul. Let either side, as pleases Fate, prevail, Our Forces are too faint to turn the Scale: Spent with the Toils and long Fatigues they bore, They have not strength enough for suffering more: Here in the Camp a feeble Guard they lye, Forward they cannot move, yet will not Fly: And while my gallant Friend disputes the Field, All that oppose him must expect to yield. Fab. Were not your Fame, my Lord, already known, 'Twould grieve me if he Conquer'd all alone; For never did the Sun his Beams display, Or drive his Chariot in a nobler day: Young Decius, fir'd with over-boyling Blood, Chafes, Lion-like, to be so long withstood. Mad with delay, and raging to o'recome, He rails at Fortune for forsaking Rome: If e're he could of his Success despair, He doubts it now, and wishes you were there. Paul. Once could my Nature of her self excite My willing Soul, and warm me to the Fight; My Spirits of themselves cou'd fire my Frame, Needing no Foreign Breath to blow the Flame. But when Enchanting Love had made them droop, They wanted such a Friend to raise them up. Let to the Field our shatter'd Forces go, And ev'ry Son of Rome, tho' fainting, show A manly Face to the prevailing Foe. Save the dear Credit of the Roman Name, And in their Deaths, at least, secure her Fame. Fab. O doubt us not, my Lord, we shall subdue, Fortune and Victory are now in view, And they have waited all along for you. Love's Goddess too shall thus espouse your Cause, For vanquish'd Foes receive the Victor's Laws. Paul. Away, my Friend, and bid the Souldiers Arm, While I can keep my strugling Spirits warm. [Exit Fabian. Love, what a God art thou? no Power Divine Enjoys an Empire uncontroll'd like thine, O're Land, and Seas, extends thy boundless sway, And Kings on Earth, and Gods in Heav'n Obey. Do thou but lift aloft thy Sacred Brand, It aws the Lightning in the Thund'rer's Hand. Often have Gods descended from above, And laid aside their Heavenly Forms, to prove Joys worthy Gods, which nought can give, but Love. Thy Power is known in Camps, and midst Alarms, Thou mak'st the Souldier Languish in his Arms. In vain, our Drums and Trumpets take our parts, Their Voice may strike our Ears, but thine our Hearts. Against thy subtle Power, there's no defence, Nor would I, if I could, expel thee hence. I'll drag my Chains, nor covet to be free, Reign in Venutia, as you Reign in me. [Exit. Enter Decius, his Sword drawn. Dec. Fortune, which once a foreign Course begun, Returns within her Native Banks to run; She would not for a while her Channel know, But her disorder'd Streams glide smoothly now. The Britains are at last compell'd to yield, Yet fierce Cassibelan still keeps the Field. He saw us, in despight of all his Powers, Make the proud Queen, and both her Daughters ours. His Rage redoubled with the killing sight, Works him to wondrous Actions in the Fight. Mad at their loss, distracted with his Flame, He seeks to mend their Fate, or meet the same. Enter Caska, and Souldiers, forcing in Cassibelan. Cask. Press him more home, your blows more closely ply, Since he disdains submission, let him dye. Dec. Stand off, this must my single Conquest be, And Gods! I thank you, he's reserv'd for me. Turn hither, and begin a Nobler strife, And know, you Fight for something more than Life. Enter Fabian, and runs betwixt them. Fab. Hold, I conjure you, hold, your Rage suspend, And save your Foe, if you would save your Friend. [To Decius. Paulinus venturing for your sake too far, Shares the same Fortune with the Prince in War. Fate gives you this Occasion to Redeem Your gen'rous Colleague, by releasing him. Cass. Rather than so my Liberty regain, Contentedly I'll drag the weightiest Chain. Tho' I should live in shameful Bonds confin'd, I will not go, and leave my Love behind. Terms such as these, what Lover would embrace? To send his Rival to supply his place. So foolish an Exchange shall never be, Nor shall your Gen'ral be releas'd thro' me, If you would free him, set Camilla free. Dec. Her freedom is not in my power to grant, Concerns like those, will his Concurrence want. Tho' you may view him with a Rival's Eyes, Let not the smallest jealousie arise, His Virtue will secure the Charming Prize. Think on the way a Wise Man would pursue, The Romans want him, and the Britains you. Let each his former Station take, then treat Of Boadicea's, and her Daughter's Fate. Cass. StayâLet me first the Lovely Prisoners see, And know if they consent to set me free; I'll do what e'er the Captive Queen desires, Ex Cassib. and Fabian. And act as she Commands, and Love inspires. Dec. Here, Caska, let your Gen'ral's Sufferings end, Love shall be mine, since Fortune is my Friend. Go now, and send my Rival offâbut stay, Form some Design to stop him in the way, I would not have Paulinus here to day. Thus does the Plunder of a prosp'rous Field, All I could ask propitious Fortune yield. Since then I won her, with extreamest toil, What hinders, but I now partake the Spoil? By Heav'n, it shall be so, there lyes my Game, Yet will I softly first confess my Flame, With all the low submission Love can Claim; If Prayer should prove an ineffectual Course, Rather than fail, I'll seize on Heaven by force. With Manly Passion to possession move, And all the Joys in one blest minute prove, She would deny an Age of whining Love. [Exit. Re-enter Cassibelan leading in Boadicea, Camilla, Venutia following. Cass. Not all the spiteful Fates have Power to do Could move me, were they kind, or just to you. I should not at my own mischance repine, If your Misfortunes had not doubled mine. O! could I ever think your sight would be A Torment, as it grows, alas! to me, To Camilla. Now I have no way left to set you free. It calls the mounting blood into my face, And makes my troubled Spirits pant a-pace. Yet Heavn's my Witness, when I saw you seiz'd, To what transporting Rage my Soul was rais'd; Forward I rush'd with an impetuous Course, Provok'd to Deeds exceeding humane force. But our ill Fates my best Efforts withstood, For sure no Mortal opposition cou'd. Boad. All the Malignant Stars at last have shed Their venom down on my devoted head. Your vent'ring in the Fatal Field so far, Has put an end to our unhappy War. Did you but lead our yet remaining Powers, Had you your freedom, we might hope for ours. But Britain now, no gallant Chief can boast, In you, the Kingdom, and the Queen are lost. Cass. Fortune does here her utmost Malice show, I dare not now be free, I dare not go, And leave my lov'd Camilla with my Foe. If to my proffer'd Liberty I move, I send a Conquering Rival to my Love. Paulinus shares my Fate, shall I release, Or would you have the Roman fill my Place? First let me, in my Bonds resign my breath, And rather find my Liberty in Death. Cam. Doubt not, my Prince, my Constancy, and Truth, Once trust a Woman in her blooming youth. Have I not Sworn by all the Powers Divine, I never would to other Arms resign, Never be any Mortal Man's but thine? Shall I repeat again the frequent Vow, You must, I know you do believe me now. Go then, my Love, no Conquering Rival fear, He shall not gain another Conquest here. Go Lead again impatient Britain's Powers, And having got your Freedom, hasten ours. Cass. Guide of my Actions, Monarch of my Heart, Who only from your self can make me part. No Jealousies of you disturb my rest, But doubt of Gods, and Fortune, rack my Breast. I doubt the Roman Virtue quite forgot, I doubt, (Oh! my sick Soul) what doubt I not? A thousand dreadful shapes around me fall, Of thousand illsâand Lovers fear them all. Yet in despight of all my fears I'll go, Since you, O! Soul of Love! would have it so. I'll pay a blind Obedience, and be free, And live, if possible, a while from thee. Cam. Heav'n knows, unwillingly I send you hence, But oh! I cannot with our Fates dispence. The sad necessity your self may see, And you must part, my Prince, to rescue me. Such means for Bliss, to all Mankind are giv'n, Ordain'd to dye, e'er they arrive at Heav'n. My rising griefs work up to that excess, That Soul and Body severing, suffer less. But go, while I can bid you, for anon My hands will hold you, tho' I wish you gon. Go, and the Gods, in pity to our pain, Will surely let us meet in Bliss again. Cass. Oh! shut not up your Lips, nor lock your Tongue, My Soul for ever on their Sound had hung; On your dear looks my famish'd Eyes would dwell, A thousand things my faultring words would tell, I'd, talk and touch, and kiss, and thenâoh! then farewell; Another, and another last Embrace, [Embracing her. I'le print them on your lovely Lips apace, And spread ten thousand thousand o're your Face; Oh! turn not yet away, for now I go. [Boad. going to lead her off. When shall we meet again, ye Powers! that know, Oh! tell me, shall we meet, and when, and how? My Thoughts, like Waves, roll o're each other fast, The first confus'dly swallow'd by the last: My throbbing Heart beats thick, and something bodes I know not how, nor what; propitious Gods! If ever pangs like mine were felt above, From my wrack'd Soul my mortal Fears remove, [Ex. severally. Show your Compassion; and preserve my Love. Manet Venutia. Ven. It cannot sure be true, it cannot be, Paulinus should so soon abandon me; 'Till from himself I can his falsehood know, I will not, for my ease, conclude him so; But thenâOh Heaven! if he confessesâthen What Woman will believe a Man again? Our Sex is govern'd by severest Laws, Mutes only in our most important Cause: We walk like troubled Shades with silence Curst, And must not speak, 'till those we haunt, speak first. Stronger than Men's are all our mad Desires, And yet we struggle to suppress our Fires; In vain, alas! we think to keep them pent, While every look and action give them vent: Our Passion breaks through all the thin disguise, Our panting Heart speaks what our Tongue denys, The Love that tears our Breasts, will tremble at our Eyes. [Exit. The SCENE draws, and discovers Camilla asleep, asleep; she wakes, and comes forward. Cam. Where am I! or, oh Heav'n! where have I been? And what distracting Visions have I seen? Methoughts within some dark and dismal Grove, I lay lamenting my departed Love: Fierce Wolves howl'd loud, and Lyons roar'd-round, And Tygers bounded o're the Neighbouring ground. The savage Satyrs from the Woods advanc'd, And all about in Antick Measures danc'd; The sight of them my killing Fears increast, But Man came next more Savage than the rest; He seiz'd, and clasp'd me close, and sternly, swore That I should ease, at last, the Pangs he bore; He press'd and struggl'd hard, and I at length Must have surrendred to the Tyrant's strength; When, in compassion to my fearful Pains, The God of sleep loos'd his perplexing Chains. Enter Decius. Dec. Stay, charming Princess, stay; oh! do not flee, Turn, lovely, barbarous Beauty, turn, and see The wondrous force and rage of Love in me; 'Tis not a sudden Heat, or new-born Flame; From your first sight, long since, my Passion came. In Medway's Flood, you kindled my desires, And shot into my Soul resistless Fires; My Flames grow now too fierce, too wild to move In the known Tracks, or beaten Paths of Love. They scorn to go by just Degrees about, But break, at once, like hasty Lightning out. You look astonish't, and the strange surprize Rolls wildly in your lovely charming Eyes. You start, as from a Dream, and seem to take Time to consider if you're yet awake, While your amazement will not let you speak. Cam. Well may amazement seize a Captive Maid, By cruel Stars to faithless Foes betray'd, Nor know I whither your Discourse can tend, You spoke before in favour of your Friend; But know, that both so little I esteem, I scorn it equally from you or him. Grow as renown'd as CÃ¦sar in your Wars, Get your great Name enroll'd among the Stars, Ride on triumphant o're the Conquer'd Ball, Your being born a Roman ruins all. Dec. That more confirms your Power, and serves to show Love only could reduce a Roman Foe. To such a pitch my wing'd Affections soar, I love not now my Fame or Honour more; Your Sighs within your swellng Bosom keep, Dry up your Tears, for here you must not weep. I'le make your Liberty again your own, I'le seat you on Imperial Britain's Throne, Whence all around, your Royal Eyes shall see No Slave so proud to serve, as I should be. Cam. Tho' Liberty is all I wish or want, Of you, I will not ask, or take the grant: Know then, to show you your desires are vain, I loath your Person, and your Love disdain. Let Hounds and Fawns, let Wolves and Lambs be join'd Each Creature coupling with a different kind; Then by the same blind Change of Nature led, Let Britains with the barbarous Romans wed. Dec. Take heed, injurious Fair, and blow not up My Flames, already grown too fierce to stop; Rather with milder words my Pains asswage, Or Love rejected will convert to Rage: Now, by the Gods, I must, I will be blest, Those Beauties were ordain'd to be possest, [holding her. And you, who broke it, shall restore my rest. Cam. Pollute me not with your detested touch, [breaking from him. My Ears already have endur'd too much. Heaven will no farther let me be betray'd, But work some Miracle to save a Maid. I see dread Jove on high Olympus stand, And hear the Thunder grumbling in his Hand, Ready to hurle it on your impious Head, And if you dare to wrong me, dash you dead. Dec. Weak Fancies of some undigested Dream, Do what we will, the Gods are still the same; Stretch'd at their Ease within their blissful Bowers, They mind their Pleasures, and disturb not ours; But tho' they should on your behalf appear, They shall not force me from a Bliss so near, I love too well, too fiercely to forbear. Cam. Heav'n! I must let my just Resentments fall, They, but provoke him more, and ruin all. [Aside. If you would have your Passion understood, To show your Love, act as a Lover shou'd. Possession is the least and poorest part, Not worth your taking 'till you win the Heart; Then only is the Bliss entire and whole, When with the Body you enjoy the Soul. Long Services alone should that obtain, And not one hasty Love Confession, gain. With humble Looks, and awful Homage sue, With doubts, despairs, and deep distractions woo, Give me those proofs, and try what they may do. Dec. Believe I love, That I already have not snatch'd the Heav'n Within my reach, but waited 'till 'twere given: You see me strangely chang'd from what I was, A change which none but you could ever cause. In all my former Wars when Towns were won, And prostrate Beauties crouded up my way, My boundless Rage forbore to rifle none, Seizing on whom I pleas'd as lawful Prey, Scorn'd when enjoy'd, and cheaply cast away, Ambition govern'd all my life before, None of these tender Sentiments I knew, 'Till first I saw you in a happy Hour; When with my Eyes, fix'd upon yours, I drew The welcome Pain, and pleasing smart from you. Love started late, but fled with wondrous haste, Using his utmost speed to reach the Goal, On his stretch'd Wings he shot himself so fast, He sits enthron'd already in my Soul, Diffus'd as soon as enter'd, thro' the whole. Choose then, dear Charmer, choose the mildest Course, [Kneeling, Yield quickly, yield those Joys, my Heavenly fair; I cannot forfeit, and I would not force, Yield to this Love, to this submissive Prayer, And do not, do not drive me to despair. Thus let me take possession of your Charms, [rising and holding her. Thus trembling with the Transport grasp my Bliss, Thus fold your Beauties in my ravish'd Arms; Print on your balmy Lips this burning Kiss, Faint with an extasie of Joy like this. Cam. What shall I say to move the Tyrant's Soul? [Aside. [to him] O take the Kingdoms I was born to rule, Your Sway, let my revolted Subjects own, Seize on the Scepter, and ascend the Throne. Gladly I would the World's large Rule resign, And leave you all, leave but Honour mine. Dec. The World is not a Ransom for your Charms, Nor Men, nor Gods, shall snatch you from my Arms. Take Courage, Fair, dispel your Virgin Fears, And let my longing Lips drink up your Tears; With transport to your Ravisht Lover move, Crown both our Joys, and give a loose to Love, Thus let me pour my sighs upon your Breast, And softly lull my Feverish Soul to rest. Thus let me run your Beauties o're and o're, Enjoying all, yet still desiring more. [Embracing her. Cam. Change me to something, Heaven! deform'd and soul, Blot from my Face the Charms that fir'd his Soul. Give me the Monstrous Gorgon's dreadful Head, That I may look this fouler Monster dead: Make me as loathsome, and as hideous be, As much abhor'd by him as he's by me. Dec. O! still continue thus, relentless fair, Rack me with doubts, and drive me to despair; Sure if you wound so deeply with your scorn, Your kindness cannot be by Mortal born: O! still refuse to meet my fierce desires, My own are hot enough, suppress your Fires; And yet your lovely Cheeks begin to glow, And strugling warmth strikes outâwhy, let it now? Your yielding Heart, would to my Wish incline, Methinks I feel it beat, and leap at mine. Your panting Breast sends up your sighs apace, And soft Consent sits blushing on your Face: Love Dawns, and his resistless Fires arise, And now they lighten fast from both our Eyes; Ye Gods! if one must perish in the Fire, Let Semele be safe and Jove expire. Cam. Oh! that my Eyes like Basilisks could roll, And dart their pointed glances thro' thy Soul. Still will you, Cruel Heaven! your aid deny? Is it so hard to give me leave to dye? Gods! if you ever are concern'd to know, The barbarous Crimes done hourly here below, Exert your selves, and show your Justice now. Without distinction, let your Vengeance strike, Confounding Guilt and Innocence alike; Drive us on Precipices, Daggers, Flames, Dash'd against Rocks, or dround in rapid Streams, So either dies, 'tis all your Suppliant claims. Dec. Death! I shall trifle all the time away, Now my desires will brook no more delay. Who waits within? Hence with this foolish Maid, [Enter Sold. And see the Charge I gave you be obey'd. 'Tis your own fault, I take the roughest course. she kneels, and holds by him. Kneel not, rejected Love knows no remorse; Tear off her hold, and drag her hence by force. The Souldiers drag her along the Stage as she speaks. Cam. Oh! now, good Gods! now let your succour come, Gape Earth, gape wide, and hide me in your Womb; Fall Heav'n, and crush me with the pond'rous blow, O're my drown'd Coarse, let rolling Oceans flow. Forsake me Life, fly my detested Breath From my curs'd Lungs, give me some hold of Death. 'Tis done; I thank you, Gods, my Fears are o're; And Tyrant, I am now beyond your Power. Swoons, and is carried off in the Souldiers Arms. Dec. Away, she shall not long entrans'd remain, I'll quickly bring her back to Life again. My Soul is straining to the full delight, Gods! let me have this one, this charming Night; Put but my Pleasures out of Fortune's power, Then come whatever can, I've had my Hour. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Decius, Camilla. Cam. Look down, relentless Heav'n! look down, and see All that is greatly wretched, here in me. Winds cease to blow, and weeping Clouds to Rain, And ruffled Seas grow still and smooth again. Stars take their turns to glitter in the Skies, The Silver Moon, her Brothers place supplies, And the descending Sun again will rise. But an unhappy Virgin, once deflour'd, Can never have her rifl'd Wealth restor'd: No Remedy is known, no cure is found, When our wrong'd Honour has receiv'd a Wound: For ever lost, if once it suffers Wrack, Nor Men, nor Gods themselves, can give it back. Dec. Not wrack'd, but safe within the Port you ride, And harbour'd thus, may stem the strongest Tide. embracing her. By Heav'n, I love you better than before, The rich Enjoyment has enflam'd me more. Nothing my setled Passion can divert; You Conquer'd, and you keep my Captiv'd Heart: Devoutly will I still my Bliss pursue, And fix that happiness I found in you. Cam. Oh! what a wretched Creature am I now? And what a most Inhumane Villain thou? Where are your Bolts? ye Gods! long suffering Heav'n! Why are no Signs of your Resentment given? If any longer Vengeance is delay'd, And you refuse to right an injur'd Maid, Lewd Poets shall no more be thought prophane, But all their Scandals will Belief obtain: How you your selves have often acted Rapes, Often deceiv'd the Nymphs in sundry Shapes; Often debauch'd your Heav'n, and fill'd your Skies With Maiden shrieks, and rifl'd Virgins Cries. And now grown Conscious of your Crimes, your fear Keeps you from punishing this Monster here. Dec. In vain, you let your fruitless Passion rise, In vain, you hurl your Anger at the Skyes, Your unregarded Wrath moves no Replies. Turn hither, dear mistaken Charmer, turn, Behold, with what a constant Flame I burn, And 'till you are forsaken, cease to Mourn. In me repose your Cares, and do not grieve, For only I, who wrong'd you, can relieve; Lull in my Arms, your anxious Thoughts to rest, And seek to lose them on your Lover's Breast. Cam. Love cannot in that barbarous Bosom dwell, The Brand that fir'd thee, had its Fires from Hell. Nor is there one of all the Fiends below, So Monstrous, or so much a Fiend as thou. How shall I fly from my detested sight? How, since thou mad'st me loath it, shun the Light? I'le take no Food, but stop my stifl'd Breath, And find at last, some Path that leads to Death, Then, when I reach the dreadful Thund'rer's Throne, I'll make him hurl his sloathful Vengeance down. Dec. Thou shalt not yet go hence, tho' not the Fear Of either Earth, or Heav'n, detains thee here. I will not change my Bliss for theirs above, Yet theirs consists, like mine, in nought but Love. In making thee, their Art was at a stand, And if they would, they cannot mend their Hand. Cam. Talk this, but talk it to the troubled Sea, Or Winds that bear it on their Wings away. My Soul works high with Grief, as Waves with Wind, Shame and Confusion, Rage and Vengeance join'd, Roll like swol'n Seas in my Tempestuous Mind. Now Curse upon the Stars that rul'd my Birth, Curse on all impious Ravishers on Earth; On all Injurious Power a double Curse, Men, as they grow the greater, grow the worse. Curse on my Fate that will not set me free, Curse on my self, for wasting words with thee. Dec. The more Men speak, the more their words are lost, When most they show their Love, they suffer most. Nature design'd your Sex to be controll'd, Proud to the fawning, cringing to the bold. And since so much my proffer'd Love you slight, You teach me now to use a Conqu'rour's right. Love shall no more the sole Dictator be, But you shall act whatever I decree, And only live and die, as pleases me. Cam. Why liv'd I not, ye Gods! in such an Age, When Virtuous Maids endeavouring to escape, By their vain flight, the lustful Followers Rage, No longer able to out-run the Rape, Could, to preserve their Honour, lose their shape? Fair Daphne thus by youthful PhÅbus woo'd, Whom long she shun'd in an unequal Race, Finding her self at last too close pursu'd, Timely Transform'd, beguil'd the God's Embrace, Who clasp'd a Laurel in the Virgin's place. But since my harder Fortune could deny Such wondrous Succour to prevent my shame, Oh! yet relent, ye Gods! and let me die, Here let my Sufferings end, 'tis all I claim, Who cannot be more wretched than I am. Make me forget this my most mortal wrong, And that I ne're may wound you with my moan; Rob me of Thought, deprive me of a Tongue, Change me to stupid Trees, or senseless Stone, Contrive my quiet to secure your own. [Exit. Re-enter Caska. Cask. Love sits in Triumph on your ravish'd Brow, And Beauty waits on Fortune's Chariot now. In your glad Looks, immortal Pleasure's seen, Dawns at your Eyes, and dances through your Meen. You took the surest, and the speediest Course, For Women only wish and wait for Force. They dare not of themselves resign the Field, But strorm'd, like Frontier Towns, rejoice to yield. Dec. Yes, 'tis my Triumph now; her rifl'd Charms Are richer Spoils than e're I won in Arms: By all the Gods, she is beyond compare, Not of the Mould that other Women are. Joys after Joys in her possession roll, And Tides of springing Bliss beat fast upon the Soul. Heav'n seems to swim before the dazled sight, And Thought it self lies drown'd in deep delight. Cask. Since then you've run the mighty Pleasure o're: And she can give, and you desire no more; Since she has nothing new to raise your Flame, But all her Beauties will be still the same, Call your forgotten Glory to your aid, Turn back to War, and send away the Maid. Dec. Go, bid some God, lull'd in delight, on high, Forego his Pleasures, and forsake his Skye; Bid Jove, whom constant Cups of Nectar feast, Starve in full Banquets, and forbear to taste; And if the immortal Powers their Heav'n resign, Bid me, by their Example, forfeit mine. Cask. Yet such a Feast, at last, may dangerous prove, And you grow surfeited with too much Love. You've only tasted yet, the Sweets that swim, Round the deceitful Bowl's delicious brim; But if yon go too deep, and drink it up, Some Dreg at last, may poison all the Cup. Dec. If fearful Sea-men, when a prosp'rous gale, And flowing Tide invites them, will not sail; If then, they dare not unknown Worlds explore, And run to distant Climes for Golden Ore, They ought to languish in their Wants on Shore. Cask. But if rash Mad-men, when a troubled Sky, And swelling Seas presage a Tempest nigh, When raging Winds work roaring Ocean's high; If then they venture o're the tumbling Wave, And meet at last the Ruin which they brave; On them, the Justice of the Gods is shown, The Fault is not their Fortune's, but their own. Dec. No more, since only she can make me blest, Of her I am, and will remain possest; Let Gods repine, and Fortune do her worst, I will not be by ought, but Death, divorc't. From vengeful Foes I can my self defend, And have a Gift that will secure my Friend. Venutia to Paulinus I'le resign, And by Consent preserve Camilla mine. Both march in Love and War, triumphant home, And force the vanquish'd Queen to Peace with Rome. He comes, and in his Looks his Joys appear, Wild with his haste, to meet his Princess here. Enter Paulinus. Paul. My Decius, my Deliv'rer, oh! my Friend, Where shall my Praise and Thanks begin, or end? My Joys would altogether silence break, But Men speak least, where they have most to speak. Our Eager Words stand strugling on the Tongue, And push each other backwards in the Throng. Where much is due, still mute returns are shown, And Words are needless where the Soul is known. Dec. If any debt but mutual Friendship's due, 'Tis I, and only I who owe it you: You set me in the midst of danger free, And lost your Liberty, relieving me. Now Fortune, to the full, has Cround our Toils, And all her Charming Face is drest in Smiles. Britain is made to feel the Roman Powers, And both her Beauteous Heiresses are ours. Paul. Something unknown, struck with a strange surprise, And, deaden'd at the News, my flowing Joys; Doubt's hang upon me still, which won't remove, But doubts inseparably link'd to Love. Should my Venutia for her freedom pine, Can I have any Comfort left in mine? While but the Name of Captive she retains, I seem to bend beneath the weight of Chains. Dec. Methinks you should not to your Prisoner sue, Make her by Manly Love submit to you. Confine the little God in Fetters now, And let, for once, insulting Beauty bow. Let o're the strugling fair the Net be thrown, And seize, and keep the lovely Prize your own. Paul. That little God laughs at our feeble Power, The more withstood, he wounds us still the more. Men must with humble adoration move, That only works upon the Powers above, And that alone secures success in Love. I know the generous Decius will incline His Heart to favour the desires of mine. Their freedom to the Charming Pris'ners grant, Which, 'till restor'd them, I my self must want. Dec. What, will you then draw back, when Fortune stands Stretching her Blessings out with both her Hands? She is not often fond, and once refus'd, She will not be the second time abus'd. If presently not seiz'd, she does not stay, But flies, for ever, with disdain away. Snatch at her Favours while her Front's in view, If past you once, you will in vain pursue: Those Minutes she vouchsafes to smile, improve; She gave you Conquest, and she shows you Love. Paul. I'le take the blest occasion, she shall see, Her kindness shall not be abus'd by me. I'le go, and to my Love my homage pay, At her dear Feet her proffer'd Freedom lay, And show, that she still reigns, and I obey. Dec. You still are on your own destruction bent, But I must stop you in the steep descent. Our Wars are at a happy period now, And Britain must to Conqu'ring CÃ¦sar bow: By their Release, she would again revive, And their faint hopes would still be kept alive; The War again begun, will never cease, And now at pleasure we may make our Peace. Nor will your Love a better Fortune know, While they regard you as their mortal Foe, And the proud Queen rejects and treats you so. Paul. Then I have try'd too far, too far, I fear, The Friendship, which I thought like mine sincere. Had I been put, by you, to such a Test, I should not have refus'd the small request. Dec. Stretch it to any proof excepting this, I cannot grant, nor you demand amiss; In ought besides your boundless Interest use, This is the only thing I can refuse. Urge it no more, my Friend. Paul. Suppose it done, This very thing which you except alone, Suppose your Prisoner's freed. Dec. I'le not suppose, What in a Friend so base, and Monstrous shows, And know it was not in the power of Foes. Paul. 'Tis not your Foe has done it, they are free, And your Consent unquestion'd, freed by me. This single Tryal will your Truth assure, And 'tis not much for Friendship to endure. Dec. O Gods! should any other Man but he, Unpunish'd, tempt me to the last degree? Believe my Friendship now sincere and true, To show how much it makes me bear from you, One of the Sisters was my Mistress too. Paul. But not the same with mine? Dec. No, not the same, But one I love with as entire a Flame. Together you, your own, and mine, betray, And drive what both desire, at once away. Paul. They are not gone, not yet, but hither bent, They come, at my desire, for your Consent. When you the Charming mournful Beauties see, And are the Lover you pretend to be, You will prevent my Wish, and ask Consent of me. Cask. Furies and Hell! could ought that's worse befall? Now the storm rises that will wrack us all. How fatal may this Ominous meeting prove? [Aside. But, what could ever better come of Love? Plague seize 'em, choak them Pestilential Air; Hell swallow them, let them make mischief there. Had he took my Advice to let them go, All had been well; let Heav'n look to it now. Dec. Run, stop them, Caska,âstop them quickâbut stay, I'le haste, and send them with dispatch away. Their Liberty you need no longer fear, [Going out. They're free to go, come any whereâbut here. Paul. Hold, neither of you stirs; for I must see strugling with both. Venutia, e're my self will set her free. Dec. I'le send your Mistress to you; Love is grown So strong in me, so high the Flame is blown, gets loose, and is going out. It makes me fearful to behold my own. Paul. See! they are here already; at the view Of mine, methinks that I grow fearful too, Whom Custom should embolden more than you. Enter Boadicea, Camilla, Venutia, Fabian. Bo. Have our remorseless Fates, in all their Store, More Mischiefs still? or can we suffer more? Why come we hither? do your Hearts relent? Or can a Roman of his Crimes Repent? Rather, insultingly you go to tread On the sad Ruins which your selves have made. To spurn your wretched Prey, already torn, First show your Cruelty, and then your Scorn. Paul. Oh! stop not, why? speak, why are we accus'd? How have we guilty been, or you abus'd? Your looks and words run through me, and I feel Something fore-boding some unheard of ill. Your Sighs have shook my Heart, the drops that roll Down your swollen Breast, distill upon my Soul. Oh! stop not; once again unlock your Tongue, Produce the Villain, and proclaim your wrong. Why Reigns that Royal Sorrow on your Brow? Why do those Tears so prodigally flow? What is the cause of this so solemn Woe? Bo. Are our Inhuman Wrongs unknown to you? But sure they are, since you are injur'd too. We have no Wrongs, no Sufferings to deplore, But you, unhappy you, alone, have more; Your sharing in our Woes, your Fame secures, For all our Miseries are doubly yours. Paul. Oh, all ye Gods! rack me not thus with doubt, Let, quickly let the fatal Secret out. What impious Villain durst your Wrongs design? And how? Oh! tell me, are your Sufferings mine? Speak but his Name, pronounce it in a word, And you shall be reveng'd with Fire and Sword. Bo. Hear then; to raise your Fury far above All vulgar Rage; hear of your Ravish'd Love. Already Fir'd? Stay 'till my story end; Pointing to Decius. Stay 'till you know her Ravish'd by your Friend; There stands the Fiend, there let your Rage descend. Paul. My Mistress? [Drawing. Bo. Yes, your Mistress. Paul. And by this? Ravish'd by this Friend here? Bo. Yes, Roman, yes. Her whom he late demanded in thy Name, Her has he forc'd to quench his impious Flame, And drown'd her Honour in eternal Shame. Dec. You are not wrong'd, hold yet, and hear me speak, She raves, and I must clear her mad mistake. Caska enters with Souldiers, who thrust between them. Paul. Off, Slaves; you'l safer seize the Thund'rer's Hand, Advancing to discharge the flaming Brand. Dec. Go, somewhere else, your sawcy aid afford, Think you that I can fear a single Sword? From you, because you were my Friend, I'le bear This rude Assault; dispel your jealous fear, And drive away your doubts, if you will hear. Paul. Doubts? by the Gods despair, distraction, Death, Hell's kindled in me, and my pois'nous Breath, Shall blast and send thee to the Shades beneath. Ven. Hold, my lov'd Roman, if I've yet a part, [Thrusting between them. Or any power o're that disloyal Heart. Hold, I conjure you, my Paulinus, hold, And wait but 'till our Tragick Scene unfold. Paul. If you have any part? why don't you see, That all this Rage and Vengeance is for thee? Can you your self your barbarous Wrongs forgive? Can you desire your Ravisher should live? Ven. I suffer'd not the Rape, your much lov'd Life, Was my sole fear in this unequal strife. Cam. But Iâunhappy IâConfusionâShame, Suppress my Words, and choak me at the Name. [Swoons. Paul. Look to the Princess there? Oh! barbarous Man, What can repair thy Crimes? sure nothing can. What shall I call thee now? Oh! what can be A Title base, or foul enough for thee? Thou Fiend! Ven. Thou Monster Cam. [recovering] Ravisher. Paul. Barbarian. Bo. Roman. Paul. Survey your Ravish'd Love, and ruin'd Friend, And think, Oh! think, where can our Miseries end? Rome's glory now, no longer seems divine, And thou, to further this, this damn'd Design, Hast took no Name, oh! Gods no Nameâbut mine. Oh! this abhorr'd, this execrable deed, Will make our wounded Fame for ever Bleed; In all our Annals, thou shalt stand accurst, A second Tarquin, blacker than the first. Alive detested, unlamented dead, Mention'd with Curses, and with Horror read. Dec. I thank you; once my soft'ning Soul begun To melt, and ready Tears prepar'd to run: But thy Reproaches fire me with Disdain, And Indignation sets me right again. Because I wrong'd thee First, I First forgive, And since thou wert my Friend, I let thee live. Let when you will the Captive Women go, I have no farther Business with them now. Again I'll hunt them o'er the dusty Plain, And make them when I please my own again. Bo. Away, my wretched Daughters, let's away. [Exit. cum suis. My sickning Soul abhors a longer stay, Where the curst Scene of all our Sorrows lay. Paul. Yet 'ere, you go, the doubtful War suspend, Let the dire Hate of Rome and Britain end. I'll march the small Remainder of my Powers, And muster up my Troops to joyn with yours, Together, we may make the Villain bow, Who is too Strong, alas! for Justice now. With force united, crush and dash him Dead, And shoot at once our Vengeance on his Head. Bo. After our Sufferings Peace? No Roman, no; 'Till Stars forbear to shine, and Seas to flow, 'Till Billows cease to toss, when Tempest blow. 'Till Fire, and Water, Heaven, and Hell unite, And Day is swallowed in Eternal Night; Till all Things to their Dissolutions come; Britain, shall know no Peace with barbarous Rome, Oh! see us Heav'n! with mortal sufferings spent, (Kneeling) And let at last, your angry Powers relent. Behold us Earth, and say you never bore, Three Wretches, so Forlorn and lost before. Sure, when our Story in an After-Age Is represented on the Tragick Stage, No Savage Eyes their struggling Tears shall keep; But for our Woes the whole sad Audience weep. [Exit. cum suis. Paul. Hither I came with a transported Heart, Now, with a Soul quite sunk with Grief, depart. My Woes fall thick, and my distracted Breast, With a sad Load of deadly Sorrow prest, Never, oh! never must admit of Rest. My future Life, not the least Bliss shall boast, But mourn a luckless Love for ever lost. I thought to've found her full of laughing Joys, A Thousand Cupids dancing in her Eyes; But, oh! ye Gods! to my amazing Fears, I found those Eyes drown'd in a Flood of Tears; I thought but now, my Love might best be shown, Making her Liberty again her own. But this unthought of Chance, this, Headlong Fall Has worse, far worse than ever, ruin'd all. Thus, the wrack'd Mariner a while will strive, With all his Skill in swimming to survive: In hopes, like mine, of better Fate in store, Who, when he just has reach'd the wish'd for Shore, Stretching his Arms to fasten on the Coast, Is by some suddain Wave, dash'd back and lost. [Exit. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE changes to the City of Verulam. Enter Cassibelan, solus. Cass. The Morning flutters on the Mountain's Top, And Rising Faulcon-like, goes towering up. The smoaking Mists, and steaming Vapours, flie; And Stars, in stronger Light, grow dim and die. Small Streaks at first, the blushing Skies betray, Then rushes on a-pace the springing Day. And yet it lends us but a glimm'ring Light, Nor willingly succeeds the dismal Night. When Ghosts in screaming Swarms were seen to fly, When Tempests toss'd the troubled Ocean high, And Peals of Thunder tore the flaming Sky, I dream'd (the while I slept) of Murders, Rapes, A Thousand Horrours, in a Thousand Shapes. I saw, methoughts, my Love with ruffled Hair, Her Robes all torn her, panting Bosom bare; By Heav'n she comes, oh! my prophetick Fears, O welcome to my Soul; but why in Tears? [To Camilla entring. How came you hither; Speak, and ease my Pain, No Matter how; since you are here again. Cam. Clasp me not, Prince, with this so kind Embrace, Nor keep your Eyes fix'd on my shameful Face. Oh! give me not, this dear, fond welcome Home, Which you will grudge, when you know, how I come. Curse the vast Ransome I was forc'd to pay, And drive me from you with disdain away. Cass. I cannot grudge a Ransome you could give, One only; which you would not lose to live. I cannot think that Treasure ever giv'n: I know thee true, I know thee, chast as Heav'n. Cam. Heav'n may be forc'd; did not the Giants once Assault the Sky, and scale the Sacred Sconce? Think where I've been; oh! think, unhappy Prince, Since you return'd, think what I've suffer'd since. Betray'd to all the Wrongs a Maid can bear, Which you, unhappy, you who love me, share. Look on your self, poor Princeâbut oh! to see The greatest Wretch now living, look on me. To tell you more; ev'n injur'd Virtue's loth, One Hellish Act, one Fiend has ruin'd both. Cass. The Thunder grumbl'd long, before it fell, But now it drives me to the lowest Hell. Tho' Death to Miseries like mine is due, Yet I will live, my Love, to comfort you; Your Tears, within your swelling Eye-Lids keep; You wreck my Soul the more, the more you weep. Oh! keep those Gales, those Gusts of Sighs supprest, Repose your Sorrows in your Lover's Breast, Lull in my Arms, your anxious Cares to rest. Cam. Thou dearest, best of Lovers, loveliest Youth, How shall I recompence thy matchless Truth? I've been abus'd even to the last degree, Thou too hast been abus'd;âtho' not by me. Oh! should you think, that e'er my Soul agreed, Or e'er consented to the sinful Deed; That, that alas! would double all I bear, Drive me to Madness, plague me with despair, Plunge me in Hell, hotter than Fiends have there. Cass. By Heav'n I know you chaste, the Wrongs you bore, Serve only to endear you to me more. My Passion is the same; the same my Heart, Of which you have not lost the smallest Part. Rather with quicker Beatings, feel it move, And struggle to you with redoubled Love. I love You, by the Gods, to that excess, Which even no Love-sick Poet can express. Thou wert the dearest Health I had to boast, And Life, in losing thee, was almost lost. But since the Gods indulgently restore, And give thee back; I can but prize thee more, And strive to keep thee better than before. Cam. Sure this unimitable Goodness can Spring only from a God; oh more than Man! Here, in this Kiss, my Prince, receive my Soul, That still was thine, that still is pure, and whole Oh! hear me, hear me Gods! if e'er I prove Ingrateful to this World of wondrous Love; May I live ever branded with the Name, I dare not mention for the killing Shame. Cass. Gods! 'tis too much for Man, such Charms as thine, Have, as they merit, an effect Divine. While thro' thy Lips the murmuring Accents break, I listen with belief that Angels speak. Each Word with subtle Force a Passage gains, Runs thro' my Blood, and dances in my Veins. Speak, till I stop you with an eager Kiss, (Embracing) Your Tongue shou'd know no stopâbut thisâand this. Your Lips are still the same, my Heavenly Dear, I taste no Ravisher, no Roman here. Since thy transporting Sweets continue such, He got but littleâYet he got too much. I wou'd not lose one Look, one Touch of thee, Tho' still the Rapture was reserv'd for me. Cam. Revenge me, Prince, 'Tis all I live for now, Let sudden Vengeance strong Affection show. Gods! give the Villain to me; let him stand Within the reach of this remorseless Hand: I'd set him on the Rack, and see him ply'd With Fire and Sword, long tortur'd 'ere he dy'd. His Soul and Body at a Tread I'd crush, Spurn him, oh! spurn him; tear him, tear him thus. [Spurns the Ground, and tears her Hair. Cass. Forbear, thou injur'd Innocence, forbear, And leave your Vengeance to your Lover's Care. If Heaven is not of all its Gods bereft, Or if in Men there's any Valour left, I will revenge; let, quickly let me know The Villain's Name; 'tis all I stay for now. What need I ask? Paulinus? Cam. No: 'Twas he Who pitying our Misfortunes, set us free. But Decius:âcurse upon the Monster's Name, He wrought our Woes, and my eternal Shame. Cass. Enough: my violated Saint, adieu, I cannot loiter longer ev'n with you. Now from my Breast let all Remorse be fled, I'll wade thro' Blood, and trampling o'er the dead, Return in Triumph with the Villain's Head. Going out. Cam. Hold yetâthough you so nobly can forgive, Nay love me too; yet ought not I to live? I dare not trust my Fame to future Times So far as to survive the Monsters Crimes. See thisâye Gods! had this been mine before Drawing a Dagger. I had not been alive that fatal Hour, But put my self above the Conqueror's Power. Remember me, my Love, and now adieu, And in my Death believe me chastly true. Nay, come not near me; by my Wrongs I strike The sooner if you do. Cass. I'll do the like: [Drawing his Sword. By Heaven we'll go together; if you go, I'll second: By th'Gods, prevent your Blow. Live, or I die. [They throw down their Weapons, and run, and embrace. Cam. Hold, my dear Prince, to give, The greatest sign of Love; I'll live, I'll live. The wondrous force of Woman's Passion see, Since I, in rigid Vertue's spight, can be Content to live in Infamy with thee. Cass. Oh! Extasie of Love, oh! Heaven of bliss, All this thou art; and who wou'd part with this? In thy sweet Lips my ravish'd Soul I'll drown, Wash off the Roman taste, and leave my own. Cam. Take yet another Love; and now away; Our Vengeance will not let thee longer stay, But drives thee to begin the dreadful Day. Cass. (Embracing) Oh! thou hast fir'd me; all my Blood boils high; Thou temper'st me like Thunder in the Skie, Mak'st me too hot to hold, then let'st me flie. No longer, righteous Powers, your Aid refuse, Or give me, Gods! the Bolts you will not use. Lend me, ye Furies, your Infernal Brands; And wreath your Snakes round my revengeful Hands. In his curs'd Breast I'll kindle all your Hell; Revenge! Revenge!âFarewel, my Love, farewel. [Exit. Camilla sola. And canst thou weep, and let this Water fall? For Miseries, like thine, must this be all? No, let thy Griefs to raging Tempests rise, Burst thy swoll'n Breast with thy tumultuous Sighs, And roar for Vengeance to regardless Skies. Loose to the Winds toss thy dishevell'd Hair, [Throws abroad her Hair, and tears open her Clothes. Tear off thy Robes, thy woful Bosom bare, Seem what thou art, Distraction and Despair. Now rear thy Hand at Heaven, and curse thy Birth, Now grovel on the Ground, and grow to Earth. Throws her self down. Here lie-and rage, and rave, and weep, and howl; Show (if thou can'st) the Torture of thy Soul. The Dagger!âhave I got thee once again? This (if I durst) might ease my mortal Pain. But so a double Vengeance wou'd ensue, For my Cassibelan will perish too. O! wou'd I cou'd run madâmy Brain turns fastâ I feel it whirleâand shall run mad at last. Break my poor Heart, turn my distemper'd Brain, Start Eye-Balls from your Spheresâ And never let me see the Light again. Enter Boadicea. Bo. Poor Girl; what on the Ground? Lie still, my Child; Thy Looks, and all thy Words are justly wild. Lie still, and I will lie beside thee down, Contemplating on Earth, disdain a Crown. Alas! the proudest of us is a piece Of this vile Dirt; and where's the pride of this? Cam. True, Royal Mother, and unhappy I, Am viler than the Dust on which we lie. Here let me take the Measure for my Grave; 'Tis all I hope that I shall shortly have. Bo. Way to such Thoughts as these you shall not give: No Daughter, you shall be reveng'd, and live. Our Troops are by your furious Lover led, Who looks like Jove (when thundering) at their head. I came to find you, lest excess of Grief, Shou'd make you run to Death to meet Relief. I heard you moan; one while your Voice was faint, And softly murmur'd out your sad Complaint: Then rising to a bold and angry Strain, You spoke, as might express extremest Pain. Like troubl'd Seas your noble Rage wrought high, And mounting menac'd the relentless Sky. Gods! cruel Gods! Oh tell me! do you know These Suff'rings, do ye see this Pomp of Woe? Sure if you did, your Light'ning wou'd be driv'n To show the Justice of Offended Heav'n. But ye are Gods; and living at your Ease, You care not whether Earth has War or Peace. Cam. With all the Pains of Hell my Soul is torn, Opprest with Woes too mighty to be born, So high my Passion is, my Pangs so strong, That sure they cannot now continue long. The Tempest rages with so fierce a Blast, 'Tis grown too violent and hard to last. Bo. Oh! let me calm thy Sorrows with my Tears; Speak, say thou wilt not die, and ease my Fears. On thy wrack'd Breast, my much-wrong'd Child, I'll pour These gentle Drops, and this refreshing Show'r. Thus weeping o'er thee, with this falling Rain, Lull thy sad Griefs and lay the Storm again. Thus clasp thee to thy mournful Mother's Breast, And fold thee in these well-known Arms to rest. Cam. Fly; lest ye be infected with my Woe; For all that touches me, must needs be so. Both by the Gods and Fates I stand accurst; It was my Wrongs that made you wretched first. My Loss has made you poor, my fatal Fall Pull'd universal Ruine on us all. Bo. Once more, my Child, raise your sad Spirits up; Like Flow'rs, you are not faded, tho' you droop. Your Charms are still the same; the blushing Rose Tho' shrunk with Wet, next Sun-shine will disclose Her op'ning Sweets, and smiling, show she grows. Your Beauty flourishes in perfect Bloom, And happy Days roll on in haste to come: Your Wrongs your gen'rous Prince's Flame improve, And his Compassion has encreas'd his Love. Relenting Heav'n decrees your Suff'rings o'er, Doubles your Blessings for th'Abuse you bore; Shall one black Day dawn all the White in store. Enter Venutia Ven. The Priests are ready, and Arabian Gums Have scented all the Fane with rich Perfumes. By Sacred strokes the several Victims fell, And all the several Entrails boded well. Your Anger in your Royal Looks I see, And am afraid you are enrag'd at me. Bo. Yes, Rebel Daughter, yes, at last I know Your impious Love for our inveterate Foe: But by my just resentments, e'er you joyn With any Monster of the Roman Line; E'er Heaven or Earth shou'd see a Match like this, I'll take your Life, did I not hope for his. Rise, my Camilla, rise; the Druids wait, Scene draws, and discovers a Temple And now they open wide the Temple-gate. Prayers, Tears, and Sacrifice shall Heaven atone, Importunately prostrate at their Throne, With holy Force we'll pull their Vengeance down. The Scene draws, and discovers a Temple. The Queen, with the two Princesses go and kneel at the Altar, while two Druids sing the following Song. SONG. 1 Druid. Prepare our Altar, make it clean With Blood of Oxen newly slain. Burn our Incense, place it high, And let the grateful Perfumes flie In curling Smoak, and cloud the Skie. 2 Druid. Throw now the strugling Victim on, Press, press him hard, and keep him down: Pierce his Sides deep, and let them pour Into your Golden Bowls their Gore, 'Till they can shed, can bleed no more. 1 Druid. Now all kneel with me, kneel around, With Adoration kiss the Ground. Pray that the Gods at last wou'd bless Our British Armies with success, And all our cruel Wrongs redress. 2 Druid. See, see auspicious Flashes rise, Met with like Flashes from the Skies. (It Lightens) We offer'd in a lucky Hour, The thirsty Flames drink up the Gore, And now the Victim is no more. Chorus of both. Hark, hark, hark, hark, the Battle is begun, Now, now the Victors shout, the Fight is done, The Gods are pleas'd, and Conquest is our own. At the end of the Song an Eagle flies into the Temple, and flutters a while about the Flame of the Sacrifice; at last falls in, and is burnt. Bo. I thank you, Gods! for this auspicious Sign; So perish all our Foes: Oh! Powers Divine, If Royal Knees bow'd at your sacred Shrine. If a crown'd Head, wrack'd with unusual Cares Can move your Pity; if a Monarch's Pray'rs Can pierce the Roof of Heaven, and reach your Ears; If we are Types of you, not plac'd for Show, But truly your Vicegerents here below; No longer see your selves, ye Sacred Powers, Abus'd in us; your Strength despis'd in ours. Show that Revenge to Heaven alone belongs; Do Justice to your selves, and right our Wrongs. Cam. If, dreadful Gods! a ravish'd Virgin's Cries Have ever rais'd Compassion in your Skies; If injur'd Honour, and unhappy Love, Are the concerns of any Power above; Oh! now look down, behold a rifled Maid, Thus prostrate on your sacred Pavement laid, Thus groveling on the Ground, implore your Aid. See in my Tears my trembling Eye-Balls roll, And mark the sad Confusion of my Soul. See what a Wretch lies here, how full of Woe, My Miseries your Omniscience needs must know, And Justice punish him who made me so. Now shower your Vengeance on the Villain's Head, And with some dreadful Judgments dash him dead. Ven. If streaming Tears from Virgin's Eye-Lids rain'd Untouch'd by Villain's Hands, in Thought unstain'd; If such can make your stubborn Pity bow, And melt you to Compassion, show it now. Trumpets sound. Enter Cassibelan and Soldiers; Decius Prisoner. The Queen and her Daughters rise. Cass. 'Tis done; Heaven has at last its Justice shown, And Victory and Vengeance are our own. Our Fortunes equal with our Wishes rise, And Blessings fall profusely from the Skies. Never cou'd Britain Nobler Conquest boast; (Pointing to Decius. But this, this Captive Monster swells it most. Ha! Gods what ails my Love? haste, haste and save [Camilla swoons. Her Life, or you take back whate'er you gave. Bo. Away, my Soldiers, flie, And quickly make our wretched Prisoners die. This Moment let a Thousand Slaves expire; Tear them with Racks, ply them with Sword and Fire; Send them to Fiends beneath, and let them tell, There comes a greater Fiend than all in Hell. How fares my lov'd Camilla? Cass. Look, my Dear, See your Cassibelan secures you here. Wipe these faint Drops from your fair lovely Brow, Recal your fleeting Soul for Vengeance now. Look up; the Triumphs of our Justice see; Die not with him, but stay and live with me. The Scene draws, and discovers several Prisoners put to death by several sorts of Tortures. Behold, thou barbarous Wretch, those horrid Scenes, [To Dec. View theirs, and dread thy own approaching Pains. The Torments they endur'd were small and poor To those which thou art destin'd to endure. Sharp were their Deaths, but short, and quickly past, Thine shall for Hours, and Days, and Ages last. Then shall ten thousand Curses send thy Soul, Where Fiends in boyling Lakes of Sulphur roll, And Furies in Eternal Tortures howl. Dec. Talk not; but send me to the threatned Death, Life is not worth the waste of Roman Breath. Go, and prepare the Rack, the Sword, the Flame, With all the Cruelty Revenge can frame. Consult your bloodiest Ministers of Rage, And search the Records of the bloodiest Age. To make it crueller than Man can do, Consult exasperated Woman too. Such shall my Courage in my Suff'rings be, My Patience such, you shall astonish'd see How unconcern'd a Roman Soldier dares, Embrace his Fate whatever Form it wears. [Is led off. Bo. Here let the Triumphs of our Isle begin, This happy Day makes me once more a Queen. Our Vengeance sure, and Victory compleat; What greater Blessings cou'd we beg from Fate? Now, on our Foes, just Heav'n begins to frown, Thy Wrongs, Camilla, bring their Vengeance down. For ever, shall the Day by them be curs'd When with rash Hands thy Chastity was forc'd. From us the Anger of the Gods is fled, Thou turn'st it all on their devoted Head. Now, let the Joys of of Britain know no bound, But all our Hills, and Shoars, and Seas resound, And Winds upon their Wings, waft the glad Tidings round. Io! Britannia, be the general Cry, Io! Britannia, eccho to the Sky. [Exeunt. Manet Venutia sola. Ven. In what a maze of Fate, poor Mortals tread? Blind Wretches, by as blind a Fortune led. What have we suffer'd from malignant Powers? And how deplorable a State is ours? Some dawn of Comfort shines thro' all this Ill, To find my Dear Paulinus faithful still, Much from his Colleague's Guilt, my Sister bore; But had the Guilt been his; I'd suffer'd more. [Exit. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG. 1 Druid. Prepare our Altar, make it clean With Blood of Oxen newly slain. Burn our Incense, place it high, And let the grateful Perfumes flie In curling Smoak, and cloud the Skie. 2 Druid. Throw now the strugling Victim on, Press, press him hard, and keep him down: Pierce his Sides deep, and let them pour Into your Golden Bowls their Gore, 'Till they can shed, can bleed no more. 1 Druid. Now all kneel with me, kneel around, With Adoration kiss the Ground. Pray that the Gods at last wou'd bless Our British Armies with success, And all our cruel Wrongs redress. 2 Druid. See, see auspicious Flashes rise, Met with like Flashes from the Skies. (It Lightens) We offer'd in a lucky Hour, The thirsty Flames drink up the Gore, And now the Victim is no more. Chorus of both. Hark, hark, hark, hark, the Battle is begun, Now, now the Victors shout, the Fight is done, The Gods are pleas'd, and Conquest is our own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE changes to the Roman Camp. Enter Paulinus solus. Paul. With what a Load of Vengeance am I curst! Yet Fortune seems not to have done her worst. Venutia's Safety shows some dawn of Joy, But still a dismal Cloud o'er-casts my Sky. Her Sister's Suff'rings cut off all Relief, Nor can she now in Honor ease my Grief. Damn'd Villain!âbut the God's thy Crimes pursue, Thy Death must expiate themâif Death can do. The rolling Stone, or whirling Wheel wou'd be A Punishment too small, and light for thee. The much-wrong'd Britain's just Revenge prepare, What art thou here? exempted from thy Share? Then Heav'n is just by halves. [To Caska entring. Cask. Heav'n takes its due; So let it, wou'd but you do Justice too. Think what vast Matters on your Arms depend, And give not Fate the leisure to descend, But succour, as you ought, your dying Friend. Paul. Death, and Damnation, be his sudden Doom, Fiends tear him; Furies drag him to his Tomb. Of all Mankind wou'd you have me redeem The Monster? me relieve a Wretch like him? Who, in usurping my much injur'd Name, With all the basest Treach'ry Hell cou'd frame, Ruin'd my Love, and sully'd all my Fame. Cask. Mark who destroys your Fame, when you deny To fight; and tamely let your Colleague die; When you stand here, and see him meet his Doom; How will you answer that, to Fame, and Rome? Paul. Is it for you to ask? No Matter how, 'Tis CÃ¦sar only has the Right to know. Cask. Yet hear me; since your Honour cannot move, Think, and think quickly; who destroys your Love. For know, when Decius shall resign his Breath, That Hour you rashly yield him up to Death; Know that Cassibelan shall then be led The joyful Bridegroon to Venutia's Bed. Paul. Ha! What? and when? Cask. That Hour that Decius dies, Ruins all yours, and crowns the Prince's Joys. Paul. You rave; meer Riddles, Riddles. Cask. Trust your Fate; You'll find a sad Repentance come too late. Paul. Where is Camilla then? Cask. Why? dead; she play'd, The Roman, as became a ravish'd Maid. Her last Desires, forc'd the poor Prince to vow Love to her Sister, which he pays her now. The Queen, and Court, improve her dying Prayer, At onceâthe Funeral and the Nuptial Torch prepare, Lest Britain should be left without an Heir. Paul. Ha! sure it cannot be, it is not true; All must be false that ever comes from you. This may be falser than thy self. Cask. It may, Believe it not, nor go to fight, but stay, And with his Life, throw your own Love away. Death to a Roman is not such a Curse, But still the loss of Love is Millions worse. Paul. What shall I think? it may, or may not be; But if it is; Heav'ns! What becomes of me? Perhaps 'tis his Device, some Fetch from Hell, But who will venture where he loves so well? Cask. Nay, do not muse; resolve on something strait, You have not time to dally with your Fate. The Day wears fast, the rolling Hours ride Post, And Opportunity will soon be lost. Paul. Or true, or false, no Devil can design, Contrive, or lay a Plot to match with thine. Nothing till now, could jealous Thoughts suggest, Which your curst Engines kindle in my Breast, And rolling Wild-Fire-like destroy my Rest. March once more to the Field, ye Pow'rs Divine! [To the Soldiers. How hard and intricate a Task is mine? Compell'd at once by so perplex'd a Fate, To save the Maid I love, and Man I hate. [Exit with Soldiers. Manet Caska solus. Cask. When Honour, Interest, Hell and Vengeance fail'd, A Woman (as I knew she would) prevail'd. It could have been by nought but Woman done. Woman, who first brought all these Mischiefs on. Now, let all Plagues on Love-sick Fools be thrown, If any Plague is greater than their own. None with their Follies would their Thoughts perplex, If all, like me, could understand the Sex. False is their Grief, dissembl'd is their Joy; This Minute kind, and the next Moment coy. They slight, when woo'd; yet ev'n, tho' slighted, wooe; Fly when we follow, when we fly, pursue. Loose are their Thoughts, yet all their Words reserv'd; By their own Pride, their own Desires are starv'd. Their Faces and their Souls were form'd to cheat; Their Air, and Mien, and Actions are Deceit. Cast Pride and Baseness, Treachery and Shame Up in one Word, and Woman is the Name. [Exit Caska. Scene changes to the City. An Alarm. Enter Boadicea. Camilla with Soldiers. Bo. Our Armies move like Clouds beneath the Skies, At whose first Clash th'imprison'd Light'ning flies. Our Fields are cover'd with the Roman Pow'rs, And Stones from batt'ring Engines storm our Tow'rs, Abroad, the British Youth in Battle falls; At home, the thund'ring Rams o'erthrow the Walls. Sharp Javelins now come singing o'er the Plain, And mingling Troops the desp'rate Fight maintain. Fly, fly, my Soldiers, with a fresh Recruit, Where Britain faints beneath the fierce Dispute. [To the Soldiers. Rush with Reserves to every stagg'ring Troop; Drive with new force the broken Squadrons up. Sustain this single Day their dreadful Pow'r, And Rome shall never give us Battle more. Cam. Follow your God-like Leader to the Field, And throw your selves around him as a Shield. Let him not spur too fiercely thro' the War: Let not his Vengeance urge him on too far. Still where he strives to pierce, his Steps pursue, Watch all his Motions, keep him still in View, And fight for him as he has fought for you. With your own Lives his sacred Life redeem, Or you, and I, and all are lost in him. [Exeunt Soldiers. Bo. Once more, thus low, to you great Gods! I bow. Oh! see our Wars at their sad Upshot now. (kneeling. See all things here in wild Confusion hurl'd: See Britain grappling for her little World. Once more, relenting Heav'n! look down in Smiles, And bless once more these late-lov'd happy Isles. Now guide our Arms, ye Gods! direct our Sword; This joyful Day let Britain be restor'd; And save the Nation where you're most ador'd. Exit. Cam. Thus low, low as the Ground that gave me Birth (And oh, that I cou'd sink beneath the Earth:) (Kneeling. Thus low, I beg you, if the Fates design The Fall of Britain; still, ye Pow'rs Divine! Tho' you reject her Prayers, refuse not mine. I beg no Conquest in the Bloody Strife; No Crown, no Kingdom, but my Prince's Life. Save him, oh save him, 'midst those loud Alarms; Restore him living to these longing Arms: I'll force him with me to some peaceful Shore Where he shall hear the Sound of Wars no more. [Exit. The Alarm continues. Scene changes to a Prison. Enter Decius as from it. Dec. Hark! 'tis the wish'd for Clash of Roman Swords, The Noise of War some Hopes of Life affords. I'm glad once more to grasp thee; and depend On thee; 'tis thou must be my chiefest Friend. [To his Sword. I've knock'd my Fetters off, my Goaler slain, And am (methinks) all Roman once again. O! for some British Soldier now to slay, And in his Armour get unknown away. Ha! here comes one; turn, and your life resign, You could not fall by nobler hands than mine. Enter Caska in British Armour. Kill'd as he enters. Cask. Oh! Decius, what, what has thy rashness done? O! Death and Hell! I find my Life is gone. [Falls. What more cou'd my malignant Fortunes do, At once, with me, she sheds her Bane on you. Dec. O! curst, curst fatal Error, damn'd Decree Of spiteful Fates, to make you fall by me. [Kneeling by him Curse on my haste in making sure a Foe; Curse on my blindness that believ'd you so. If Heaven this one Advantage will resign, And spare your Life, I'll gladly offer mine. Why was this most unhappy Armour born? Why was this damn'd, this fatal Habit worn? Speak, and some Comfort to your Decius give, Say, have you any hopes? and can you live? Cask. Tis done, this hurry of a Life is past, And Death's cold Hand creeps o'er my Eye-Lids fast. Thus in a moment my Designs are crost, And all my brave ambitious Projects lost. Living I still deny'd; but dying prove That more than Human Wisdom rules above. [Dies. Dec. What can the Gods by this Mischance design? Or is thy Death the sad Presage of mine? Distractedly my Thoughts begin to roll, And something wondrous horrid, shocks my Soul. A guilty Conscience shoots its angry Sting; A guilty Conscience! is there such a thing? Yes Heaven! I feel my very Heart-strings bleed And wish undone that execrable Deed. From unhurt Skies our Crimes, like Darts rebound, And on the Wretch who shot them, turn the Wound. My Spirits faint, yet I will rouze them up, Death is the worst, Death cannot make me droop. Let them pursue Revenge with Fire and Blood, I'll perish as a Roman Soldier shou'd. Enter Cassibelan. Ha! art thou here? Of all Mankind I thought To shun thee. Cass. Thee of all Mankind I sought. The Gods and I have took the nicest time, For the severest Vengeance of thy Crime. Thy Tragedy might have been play'd before, But now so near relief, will spite thee more; As shipwrack'd Men, who perish close at Shore. Dec. Secure within my self unmov'd I stand, And never yet cou'd fear a single Hand: And yet I wou'd this Fight with thee decline, Not for the safety of my Life, but thine. I wrong'd thee; to requite it, let thee live; That Satisfaction's all I have to give. For tho' my Death shou'd from our Strife ensue, The Romans wou'd revenge it soon on you. Cass. Come all the Roman Legions, and in spite Of their loud Threats, I'll kill thee in their sight. And when they find that by my hand you fell: [Fight. Dec. falls. They'll say you ought not to have dy'd so well. Dec. Curse on my feeble and enervate Arm, It cou'd not strike with strength enough to harm; A sudden numbness on its Sinews seiz'd, And let my Rival wound me where he pleas'd. And yet with pleasure I resign my Breath, Since that has crown'd my Life which caus'd my Death. All her dear sweets were mine, the vast delight Seems still to dance before my swimming sight. I rifled all th'inestimable store, The longest Life could have bestow'd no more, And dying I rejoyce to leave you poor Dies. Cass. Oh! that thou shouldst so brave and nobly fall, Hadst thou a thousand Lives I'd have them all, All for my vast revenge, alas! too small. Thy blood had justly been on Scaffolds spilt, Thy End, as base, and barb'rous as thy Guilt. Honour forbids me to pursue my blow, And not in vain insult a breathless Foe. Ile think no moreâbut hasten to the Fight, Find out my Love, and perish in her sight. Pour on her balmy Lips my parting Breath, Look her all o'er, and clasp her close in Death. Sigh out my Soul upon her panting Breast, And with a Passion not to be exprest, Sink at her Feet into Eternal rest. Exit. Trumpets. Enter Paulinus, Fabian, Soldiers. Paul. Make haste, my Friend, and let the Slaughter cease, Thro' all the Streets proclaim a general Peace. Now tell them all our dismal Wars shall end, And Britain still be valu'd as a Friend. [Exit Fabian. Ha! what has Destiny had here to do? What, Decius? and his Favourite Caska too? Has Justice reach'd you both? Heaven heard my Vow, And in your Deaths compleats my Conquest now. This is the Palace sure, 'tis time to move, To crown my Fortune, and secure my Love. The Queen with both her Daughters appear above; the Queen with a Bowl in one Hand, and a Dagger in the other. Ha! there she stands; Heaven! what a dismal Scene? What can this pomp of solemn Mourning mean? What means that Dagger? oh! my bleeding Soul, What deadly Poison fills that Golden Bowl? Hither, dread Queen, your mournful Aspect bend, And speak, oh! speak, what Fate and you intend. Bo. In me the Roman Heroine shall be seen; What Fate and I intend, becomes a Queen. Like Gods, I liv'd, while Gods would let me reign, Rob'd of my Realms, they leave me Life in vain. The Blood of Monarchs, circles in their Crown, Thrones buoy them up, and once dethron'd, they drown. Sinking I still may choose a nobler Doom, Than to be led a Royal Slave to Rome. When the most wretched can resolve to die, Most of their Misery's over; here's to try. [Offers to drink. Paul. Hold, hold, dread Queen, and look with Pity down, Live, and I'll beg you to receive your Crown, And gladly make your Realms again, your own. Farther than ever, I'll extend your Sway, While Romans, shall like Native Slaves obey. Entire your vast Dominions I'll restore, Exalt your Crown, far higher than before, While CÃ¦sars Friendship makes your Greatness more. Bo. Such Restauration is my single due, Can you restore my Daughter's Honour too? Fate in that Case can no Relief afford, That Loss, alas! can never be restor'd. Paul. 'Tis done, look here, and see the Villain dead; Vengeance at last, reach'd his devoted Head. Pointing to Decius. His flowing Blood washes away her Stain, And she, who still was Pure, looks White again. Cam. Tell me what most my bleeding heart would move, To think of Life; can you restore my Love? If he is in the fatal Battle slain, All Offers else to make me live are vain. Paul. Thrice furiously he charg'd the Troops I led, Thrice I retir'd, to shun him, from their Head. I knew the Woes you felt, the Wrongs you bore, And would not in his Loss encrease the Score. But gave my Soldiers in our hottest Strife Strict Orders to preserve your Prince's Life. [Shout from within. Cam. What mean those Shouts? Infection seize the Breath, And rot the Tongues that sound my Lover's Death. Drink Mother, and defie Barbarian Power, Rome has prevail'd, and Britain is no more; Drink, for the Business of the War is done, Cassibelan, who led our Armies on, Cassibelan, my lov'd Cassibelan, is gone. Paul. stay I conjure you, I command you stay, I charge you, throw not thus your Lives away. Bo. In vain, mistaken Wretch, you threat'ning stand, Command a Queen, with Death at her command? Roman, I shall not yet my Power resign, Know, that I Reign, while this, or this is mine. Poison and Dagger. This makes a vanquish'd Queen, amidst her Woes, Laugh at the Spite of Fate, and Power of Foes. [Drinks. Paul. Run Soldiers, run, I'll strive to save my own, Batter the Bulwarks with your Bodies down, He that preserves her, has the British Crown. Bo. Hold; Boadicea all your Power defies, The Moment that you stir, Venutia dies. Sure I am more than Empress on a Throne, I rule your Fate together with my own. Now my Camilla pledge the Noble Draught, And drink as deep as ravish'd Virgins ought. Cam. Here's to those happy Seats, those blissful Cells, Where Virtue undisturb'd in Safety dwells; Where never Impious Ravisher has been, And never Barbarous Roman enter'd in. This Draught will make me swim in Bliss above, And send me where I soon shall meet my Love. [Drinks. Bo. Now do you drink, and hast with us to Bliss, [To Ven. Ha! do you start? take either this, or this, [Dagger or Poison. Drink with a chearful Look, and noble Mind, For by my Wrongs you shall not stay behind. Paul. Curse maze of Fate, what shall Paulinus do? Make haste, forlorn, lost Wretch, and perish too. She dies alass! if I but dare to stir, If not, she dies; why, die thou then with her. Draws his Sword and claps it to his Breast. Love, in thy Death, let this thy Comfort be, I will not live one Moment after thee. Ven. That wou'd indeed dispel my Fear, and Pain, Were we but well assur'd to meet again, But sure we shall; a Hundred Spirits tell, In Whispers that we shall; till then farewel. Paul. Farewel. She is going to drink, and he to fall on his Sword as Cassibelan enters above, his Breast bloody. Cass. What's here? oh my prophetick Soul! What have you done my Love? give me the Bowl. Takes the Bowl from Venutia Poison must help, my Wounds are slight, and few, Not deep enough to send me hence with you. I ran on Swords, lay'd sev'ral Romans dead, Courted my Death, but Death tho' courted fled. But all their cruel Mercy was in vain, While in thy Death, oh! Soul of Life, I'm slain. [Drinks. Bo. Now 'tis thy turn; nor can'st thou now repine, Goes to stab Ven. Our fleeting Souls must needs encourage thine. Cass. The Poison sure usurps your Reason's place, Wou'd you extinguish all the Royal Race? Snatching the Dagger. Were Britain of this Princely Fair bereft, What other Heiress have our Kingdoms left? Roman, this Gift my Gratitude shall prove, [To Paulinus. Since you wou'd give me Life, I'll give you Love. They all descend, and appear on the Stage. Paulinus addresses himself first to Cass. then to Venutia. Paul. To you, most gen'rous Prince, my Thanks are due, And all the Rapture of my Soul to you. I have you now, Thanks to propitious Fate, My Joys are full, and Vict'ry is compleat. Thou Crown of all my Toils, I shou'd not boast The Conquest of the World, if thou we'rt lost. A mutual Love is in your Looks confest; Soft Longings are in short-breath'd Sighs exprest, And murm'ring Words speak Virgin-Passion best. Cam. My only Love, in the black Vale of Death And gloomy Shades which we must pass beneath; Where nought but Ghosts appear before our View, I shall draw Courage from the Sight of you. Cass. Thou Life in Death, if ought in Heav'n above Excels the Bliss and Extasie of Love, Let Gods possess it, undisturb'd and free, And leave me any where possess'd of thee. Cam. My Soul is sick, and all on Fire my Breath; My dizzy Eyes begin to swim in Death. From thy dear Sight I must for ever fly; But do not, do not leave me till I dy. Cass. Nor then, by Heav'n, if Poyson will not do, With Wounds on Wounds I will your Flight pursue, O'ertake you quick, and be the Guide to you. Bo. Death clasps me with a cold, but close Embrace And chill, but heavy Damps o'erspread my Face. My fleeting Soul 'twixt two Extremes is lost, Now scorch'd with Fire, and now benumm'd with Frost. Yet in the midst of all my mortal Pain, Tho' raging Madness strives to tear my Brain, Honour forbids a Monarch to complain. These petty Kingdoms let the Romans share, If Heav'n is just, I have an Empire there. [Falls and dies. Cam. Poor Mother, art thou fall'n? Farewel, farewel: So in the Fight my faithless Hero fell. [Raving. For he, before he perish'd, grew unkind, And his poor Love no more possess'd his Mind. He call'd me false, and perjur'd, and forsworn, Call'd me a Name, oh Gods! that can't be born: Did you not hear him, Heav'n? Cass. Ye dreadful Pow'rs! How dismal and how hard a Fate is ours? Was there beyond her Death a greater Curse? Why speaks she those mad Words that made me worse? Look up, my dying Dear. Cam. Alas, my Love! My fleeting Soul had almost reach'd the Seat Which Fate has destin'd for its last Retreat: But thou hast call'd me from the dark Descent, And I made haste 'ere yet thy Voice was spent; While on thy Lips the fault'ring Accents hung, And the last Murmurs trembl'd on thy Tongue. Cass. Oh! be not so impatient to be gone; Hold but a little while, I'll lead thee on. My Soul, like Wrecks upon the swelling Main, Is now cast up, and now suck'd back again. Now from my Lips she takes a short Survey Of vast Eternity, repines to stay; But flutters with desire to fly away. Cam. Ha! what is this, I feel, some Hand unknown [Raving again. Has grip'd me fast, and strives to push me down. O! save me, gracious Gods! a Rape, a Rape! Is there no Way? none left me to escape? O! let some Miracle of Aid be giv'n; Unhand me DeciusâVillainâhelp me Heav'n! Now, now the lustful Monster has me fast; Heav'n, will you let his loath'd Embraces last? Gods! 'tis a doing now, 'tis done, 'tis past. I'll come when I can 'scape from him, I'll come, To tell you all the monstrous Crimes of Rome; And oh! to an amazing fearful Summ. Their barb'rous Rapes, Adult'ries, Murders mount I bring you, Righteous Gods! the dread Account. [Dies. Cass. Where art thou now my Love? and why become Kneeling by her, and leaning over her. Pale as a Ghost, and as a Statue dumb? Oh! whither is thy charming Spirit fled? Am I alive? and is Camilla dead? These Lips must speak no more; no more these Eyes Must open, nor this breathless Charmer rise. How beautiful, alas! does Death appear? How lovely looks that awful Tyrant here? Thus o'er thy Coarse for ever let me ly, Thus press thy Breasts, and in this Posture dy. Gape wide my Wounds, and bleed at ev'ry Vein; Mount Madness till you reach and wrack my Brain. What? will not all the Roman Weapons do? Nor that Addition of the Poyson too? Since the strong Soul maintains her lov'd Abode, Fate meant me sure immortal as a God. But this shall end me, were I all Divine: And thus I make my self for ever thine. Falls on his Sword, and dies with his Head on her Breast. Ven. Support me, Love; for at the dismal Sight, My Eyes, methinks, like theirs, are lost in Night. My Spirits shrink, and shiver at the View, And all the Life I've left, is now in you. Paul. 'Tis mournful, wondrous mournful, come my Love, From the sad Scene to that of Bliss remove. Lock'd in these Arms, learn to forget your Grief. And on this Breast seek Safety and Relief. Thus angry Gods have let their Vengeance fall With an impartial Justice on us all. Rome triumph'd still o'er Britain in distress: Britain, when prosp'rous, show'd her Mercy less. So high the Cruelty of both was driv'n, That both are punish'd by Offended Heav'n. Hence let successful Warriours learn to show A tender Pity to the prostrate Foe. Let those, on whom their Fortunes never frown, Relieve the Wretches that are trampl'd down: They who stand fast, still succour them who fall, Since Humane Chance is what attends us all.
