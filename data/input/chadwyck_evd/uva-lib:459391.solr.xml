      <field name="fulltext">[THE FIRSTE SCENE.] The Description of THE FIRSTE SCENE. On one side the hall towardes the lower end was discovered a cliffe of the sea done over in parte white accordinge to that of Virgill, lib. 5. Jam? adeo scopulos Syrenum advecta subibat Difficiles quondam multorum? ossibus albos. Upon yt were seated two Syrens as they are described by Hyginus &amp; Servius wt h their upper parts like woemen to the navell and the rest like a hen. One of theese at the firste discouery of the scene (a sea being done in perspective on one side the cliffe) began to singe this songe, beinge as lasciuious ?per to them &amp; beginninge as that of theirs in Hom. lib. ?. ??. ????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ??????. Steere hither, steere, your winged pines, All beaten mariners, Here lye Loves undiscovred mynes, A prey to passengers; Perfumes farre sweeter than the best Which make ye Phœnix urne and nest. Fear not your ships, Nor any to oppose you save our lips, But come on shore, Where no joy dyes till love hath gotten more. The last two lines were repeated as from a groue nere by a full Chorus, &amp; ye Syren about to sing againe, Triton (in all parts as Apollonius, lib. 4. Argonautis. shewes him) was seene interruptinge her thus: Triton. Leaue, leaue, alluring Syren, wt h thy song To hasten wt ye Fates would faine ?long: Your sweetest tunes but grones of Mandrakes be; He his owne traytore is yt heareth thee. Tethys commaunds, nor is it fit yt you Should ever glory you did him subdue By wyles whose pollicyes were never spread 'Till Flaming Troy gave light to haue ym read. Ulysses now furrowes ye liquid plaine Doubtfull of seeing Ithaca againe, For in his way more stops are thrust by time, Then in ye path where vertue comes to climbe: She yt wt h silver springs for ever fills The shady groues, sweet meddowes, and ye hills, From whose continuall store such pooles are fed As in ye land for seas are famosed. 'Tis she whose favoe to this Grecian tends And to remove his ruine Triton sends. Syren. But 'tis not Tethys, nor a greater powre, Cynthia, that rules the waues; scearce he (each howre) That weilds the thunderboltes, can thinges begun By mighty Circe (daughter to the Sun) Checke or controule; she yt by charmes can make The scalled fish to leaue the brinye lake, And on the seas walke as on land she were; She that can pull ye pale moone from her spheare, And at mid-day the worlds all glorious eye Muffle wt h cloudes in longe obscuritie; She that can cold December set on fire, And from the graue bodyes wt h life inspire; She that can cleaue the center, &amp; wt h ease A prospect make to our Antipodes; Whose mystique spelles haue fearfull thunders made, And forc't braue riuers to run retrograde. She wt hout stormes that sturdy oakes can tare And turne their rootes where late their curl'd toppes were. She that can wt h the winter solstice bringe All Flora's daintyes, Circe: bids me singe; And till some greater hand her power can staye, Who'ere commaunde, I none but her obaye. Triton. Then Nereus daughter thus you'le haue me telle. Syren. You maye. Triton. Thinke on her wrath. Siren. I shall. Triton! farewelle. Siren. Vaine was thy message, vaine her haste, for I Muste tune againe my wanton Melodye. Here she went on wt h her SONGE thus: For swellinge waues, our panting brestes Where neuer stormes arise Exchange; and be awhile our guestes: For starres gaze on our eyes. The compasse loue shall hourely singe, And as he goes aboute the ringe, We will not misse To telle each pointe he nameth wt h a kisse. CHORUS. Then come on shore, Where no ioye dyes till loue hath gotten more. At ye end of this songe Circe was seene upon the rocke, quaintly attyr'd, her haire loose about her shoulders, an Anadem of flowers on her head, wt h a wand in her hand, &amp; then makinge towardes the Syrens, cald them thence wt h this speech: Sirens, ynouk; cease; Circe hath prevayld, The Greeks wc h on ye dauncinge billowes sayld, About whose shippes a hundred Dolphins clunge Wrapt wt h the musicke of Ulysses tongue Haue wt h their guide by powrfull Circes hand Cast their hookd anchors on Æœa's strand. Yonde standes a hille crown'd wt h high wauinge trees Whose gallant toppes each neighb'ringe countrye sees, Under whose shade an hundred Syluans playe, Wt h Gaudy Nymphes farre fairer then ye daye; Where euerlastinge Springe wt h silver showres, Sweet roses doth encrease to grace our bowres; Where lauish Fflora prodigall in pride Spendes what might well enrich all earth beside, And to adorne this place shee loues so deare, Stays in some clymats scearcely halfe ye yeare. When would shee to the world indifferent bee, They should continuall Aprill haue as wee. Midway ye wood and from ye leueld lands A spatious yet a curious arbor standes, Wherein should Phœbus once to pry beginne, I would benight him 'ere he gette his inne, Or turne his steedes awrye, so drawe him on To burne all landes but this like Phaeton. Ulysses neare his mates by my stronge charmes Lyes there till my returne in sleepes soft armes: Then, Syrens, quickly wend we to the bowre To fitte their well-come, &amp; shew Circes powre. Siren. What all the elements doe owe to thee In their obedience is perform'd in mee. Circe. Circe drinkes not of Lethe: then awaye To helpe ye Nymphes who now begin their laye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Seconde Scene. While Circe was speakinge her first speech, &amp; at these words, ‘Yond standes a hill, &amp;c.’ a trauers was drawne at ye lower end of the hall, &amp; gaue way for the discouery of an artificiall wood so nere imitatinge nature yt I thinke had there been a grove like yt in ye open plaine, birds would have been faster drawne to that than to Zeuxis grapes. Ye trees stood at the climbinge of an hill, &amp; lefte at their feete a little plaine, wc h they circled like a crescente. In this space vpon hillockes were seen eight musitians in crimsen taffity robes wt h chaplets of lawrell on their heades their lutes by them, wc h beinge by them toucht as a warninge to ye Nymphes of ye wood, from amonge the trees was heard this songe....... The Songe in the Wood. What singe the sweete birdes in each grove? Nought but loue. What sound our Ecchos day and night? All delighte. What doth each wynd breath vs that fleetes? Endlesse sweets. Chorus. Is there a place on earth this Isle excelles, Or any Nymphes more happy liue than wee. When all our songes, our soundes, &amp; breathinges bee, That here all Loue, Delighte, and Sweetenes dwells. By this time Circe &amp; ye Syrens being come into ye wood, Vlysses was seene lyeing as asleepe, undr ye couverte of a fair tree, towards whom Circe coming bespake thus:— Circe. Yet holdes soft sleepe his course. Now Ithacus Aiax would offer Hecatombes to vs, And Iliums rauish'd wifes, &amp; childlesse sires, Wt h incense dym ye bright æthereall fires, To haue thee bounde in chaynes of sleepe as heere; But yt [those] mayst behold, &amp; knowe how deare Thou art to Circe, wt h my magicke deepe And powerfull verses thus I banish sleepe. The Charme. Sonne of Erebus &amp; Nighte, Hye away; and aime thy flighte, Where consorte none other fowle Than the batte &amp; sullen owle; Where upon thy lymber grasse Poppy &amp; Mandragoras Wt h like simples not a few Hange for euer droppes of dewe. Where flowes Lethe wt hout coyle Softly like a streame of oyle. Hye thee thither, gentle Sleepe: Wt h this Greeke no longer keepe. Thrice I charge thee by my wand, Thrice wt h Moly from my hand; Doe I to touch Vlysses eyes, And wt h the Jaspis: Then arise, Sagest Greeke........ Vlysses (as by ye power of Circe) awakinge thus began: Ulysses. ......Thou more than mortalle mayde Who when thou listes canst make (as if afraide) The mountaines tremble &amp; wt h terrour shake The seate of Dis; &amp; from Avernus lake Grim Hecate wt h all the Furyes bringe To worke reuenge; or to thy questioninge Disclose the secretes of th' infernall shades Or raise the ghostes yt walke the vnder-glades. To thee, whom all obey, Ulysses bendes, But may I aske (greate Circe) whereto tendes Thy neuer-failinge handes? Shall we be free? Or must thyne anger crush my mates and mee? Circe. Neyther, Laertes' sonne wt h winges of loue To thee, &amp; none but thee, my actions moue. My arte went wt h thee &amp; thou me mayst thanke In winninge Rhesus horses, e're they dranke Of Xanthus streame; &amp; when wt h human gore Cleare Hebrus channell was all stayned 'ore; When some braue Greekes, companions then wt h thee, Forgot their country through the Lotos tree; I tyn'd the firebrande that (beside thy flight) Left Polyphemus in eternall nighte; And lastly to Æœa brought thee on, Safe from the man-deuouring Læstrigon. This for Ulysses loue hath Circe done, And if to live wt h mee thou shalt be wonne; Aurora's hand shall neuer drawe awaye The sable vale yt hides ye gladsome daye. But we new pleasures will beginne to taste, And, better stille, those we enjoyed laste. To instance what I canne: Musicke, thy voyce, And of all those haue felt or wrath the choyce Appeare; and in a dance 'gin that delight Which wt h the minutes shall growe infinite. Here one attir'd like a woodman in all poyntes came forth of ye wood &amp; goeinge tow'ds ye stage sunge this songe, to call away ye firste Antimasque. Songe. Come yee whose hornes the cuckold weares, The whittoll too, wt h asses eares; Let the wolfe leaue howlinge, The Baboone his scowlinge, And Grillus hye Out of his stye. Though gruntinge, though barking, though brayeing, yee come, We'ele make yee daunce quiet and so send yee home. Nor ginne shall snare you Nor mastiue scare you, Nor learne the baboones trickes Nor Grillus scoffe From the hogge troughe, But turne againe vnto the thickes. Here's none ('tis hop'd) so foolish, scornes That any els should weare the hornes, Here's no curre wt h howlinge Nor an ape wt h scowlinge Shall mocke or moe At what you showe. In jumpinge, in skippinge, in turninge, or oughte You shall doe to please vs, how well or how noughte. If there be any Amonge this many, Whom such an humour steares, May he still lye, In Grillus' stye, Or weare for euer the Asses eares. While ye first staffe of this songe was singinge out of ye thickets on eythr side of ye passage came rushinge ye Antimasque, beinge such as by Circe were supposed to haue beene transformed (havinge ye mindes of men still) into theese shapes followinge: 2. wt h heartes, heades &amp; bodyes as Actæon is pictur'd. 2. like Midas wt h Asses eares. 2. like wolues as Lycaon is drawne. 2. like Baboons. Grillus (of whom Plutarche writes in his morralles) in ye shape of a hogge. These together dancinge an antike measure tow'rdes ye latter end of yt missd Grillus who was newly slipte away &amp; whilst they were at a stand wondringe what was become of him, the woodman stepte forth &amp; sunge this songe: Songe. Grillus is gone, belyke he hath hearde The dayry-maid knocke at ye trough in ye yearde: Through thicke &amp; thinne he wallowes And weighes nor depths nor shallowes. Harke how he whynes Run all 'e're he dines Then serue him a tricke For beinge so quicke, And lette him for all his paines Behold you turne cleane of His troughe, And spill all his wash and his graines. Wt h this ye Triplex of ye i r tune was plaid twice or thrice our, &amp; by turnes brought th? from ye stage; when ye woodman sung this othr staffe of ye last songe, &amp; then ran after them: And now 'tis wish'd yt all such as hee Were rooting wt h him at ye troughe or ye tree. Ffly, fly, from our pure fountaines, To the darke vales or the mountaines, Liste some one whines Wt h voyce like a swines, As angry yt none Wt h Grillus is gone, Or that he is lefte behinde. O let there be no staye In his waye, To hinder the boare from his kinde. Circe. How likes Ulysses this! Ulysses. ........Much like to one Who in a shipwracke being cast vpon The froathy shores, and safe beholdes his mates Equally cross'd by Neptune and the fates. You might as well haue ask'd how I would like A straine whose æquall Orpheus could not strike, Upon a harpe whose stringes none other be, Then of the harte of chaste Penelope. O let it be enough that thou in theese Hast made most wretched Laertiades: Let yet the sad chance of distressed Greekes Wt h other teares than Sorrowes dewe your cheekes! Most abiect basenesse hath enthral'd that breste Wc h laughs at men by misery oppreste. Circe. In this, as lyllies, or ye new-falne snowe Is Circe spotlesse yet, what though the bowe Wc h Iris bendes, appeareth to each sight In various hewes &amp; colours infinite? The learned knowe that in itselfe is free And light and shade make that varietye. Thinges farre off seene seeme not the same they are, Fame is not ever truth's Discouerer; For still where enuy meeteth a reporte Ill she makes worse, &amp; what is Good come shorte. In whatso'ere this land hath passiue beene Or she that here 'ore other raigneth Queene Let wise Ulysses judg. Some I confesse That tow'rds this Isle not long since did addresse Their stretched oares, no sooner landed were, But (carelesse of themselues) they heere &amp; there Fed on strange fruites, inuenominge their bloodes, And now like monsters range about the woods. If those thy mates were, yet is Circe free: For their misfortunes haue not byrth from mee Who in th' Apothecaries shoppe hath ta'ne (Whilst he is wantinge) that wc h breeds his bane, Should neuer blame the man who there had plac'd it But his owne folly urginge him to taste it. Vlysses. Æœas Queene and great Hyperions pride, Pardon misdoubtes; and we are satisfide. Circe. Swifter the lightninge comes not from aboue, Then doe our grants borne on the winges of Loue. And since what's past doth not Ulysses please, Call to a dance the fair Nereides, Wt h other Nymphes wc h doe in euery creeke, In woods, on plaines, on mountaines, symples seeke For powerfull Circe, and let in a songe Ecchos be aydinge that they may prolonge My now co?and to each place where they be, To bringe them hither all more speedilye. Presently in ye wood was heard a full musicke of lutes wc h descendinge to the stage had to them sung this followinge songe, the Ecchos being plac'd in seueral pt s of the passage. Songe. Circe bids you come awaye. Ecch: Come awaye, come awaye. From ye riuers, from the sea. Ecch: From the sea, from the sea. From the greene woods euery one. Ecch: Euery one, euery one. Of her maides be missinge none. Ecch: Missinge none, missinge none. No longer stay, except it bee to bringe A med'cine for loues stinge. That would excuse you &amp; be held more deare Then witte or Magicke, for both they are heere. Ecch: They are here, they are here. The Eccho had no sooner answered to y e last line of the songe, They are here, but the second Antimasque came in, being seuen Nymphs &amp; were thus attir'd: Fower in white taffita robes long tresses &amp; chaplets of flowers, herbs &amp; weeds on their heades w t h little wicker baskets in y e i r hands, neatly painted. These were supposed to be maids attending vpon Circe, &amp; usd in gatheringe simples for their mistresses enchantments.—(Pausanias in prioribus Eliacis.) Three in sea greene robes, greenish haire hanging loose w t h leaues of corrall &amp; shelles intermixte vpon it. These are by Ouid affirmed to helpe the Nymphes of Circe in their collections by throse: These hauinge danc'd a most curious measure to a softer tune then y e first Antimasque as most fitting returned as they came; the Nereides tow'rds y e cliffes &amp; ye other maides of Circe to y e woods &amp; plaines, after wc h Ulysses, thus: Ulysses. Fame addes not to thy ioyes, I see in this, But like a high &amp; stately Pyramis Growes least at farthest; now, faire Circe, grante Although the faire-hair'd Greeks do neuer vaunte, That they in measur'd paces ought haue done, But where the god of battailes ledd them on; Give leaue that (freed from sleepe) ye small remaine Of my companions on the under plaine May in a dance striue how to pleasure thee Eyther wt h skill or wt h varietye. Circe. Circe is pleas'd; Ulysses, take my wand And from their eyes each child of sleepe co?and; Whilst my choyce maides wt h their harmonious voyces (Whereat each byrd and dancinge springe reioyces) Charminge the windes when they contrary meete, Shall make their spirits as nimble as their feete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The THIRD SCENES Description. Circe wt h this speech deliueringe her wande to Ulysses rests on ye lower parte of ye hill, while he goeing up the hill &amp; striking ye trees wt h his wande, suddenly two greate gates flew open, makinge as it were a large glade through the wood, &amp; alonge ye glade a faire walke; two seeminge bricke walles on eyther side, over wc h the trees wantonly hunge; a great light (as ye Suns suddaine unmaskinge) being seene upon this discouery. At ye further end was descride an arbor, very curiously done, havinge one entrance under an architreave borne vp by two pillers wt h their chapters &amp; bases guilte; ye top of ye entrance beautifide wt h postures of Satyres, Wood-Nymphes, &amp; othe anticke worke; as also ye sides &amp; corners: the coveringe archwise interwove wt h boughes, ye backe of it girt round wt h a vine, &amp; artificially done vp in knottes towrds ye toppe; beyond it was a wood-scene in perspective, the fore part of it opening at Ulysses his approach, the maskers were discouered in severall seates leaninge as asleape. THEIR ATTIRE. Doublets of greene taffita, cut like oaken leaves, as upon cloth of siluer; their skirtes &amp; winges cut into leaues, deepe round hose of ye same, both lin'd wt h sprigge lace spangled; long white sylke stockings; greene pumps, &amp; roses done oue wt h syluer leaues; hattes of ye same stuffe, &amp; cut narrowe-brim'd, &amp; risinge smaller compasse at ye crowne, white wreath hatbandes, white plumes, egrettes wt h a greene fall, ruffe bands &amp; cuffes. Ulysses seuerally came &amp; touch't euery one of them wt h ye wand while this was sunge. Songe. Shake of sleepe, yee worthy knights, Though yee dreame of all delights; Shew that Venus doth resorte To the campe as well as courte By some well-timed measure, And on your gestures &amp; your paces Let the well-composed graces, Lokinge like, and parte wt h pleasure. By this ye knights beinge all risen from their seats were by Ulysses (ye loud musicke soundinge) brought to ye stage; and then to the violins danced their first measure aftewc h this songe brought them to the second: Songe. On &amp; imitate the Sun, Stay not to breath till you haue done: Earth doth thinke, as other where Do some woemen she doth beare: Those wifes whose husbands only threaten Are not lou'd like those are beaten. Then wt h your feete to suffringe moue her, For whilst you beate earth thus, you love her. Here they danc'd theire second measure, &amp; then this songe was sunge during wc h time they take out ye ladyes: Songe. Choose now amonge this fairest number, Upon whose brestes love would for euer slumber: Choose not amisse since you may where you wylle, Or blame yourselues for choosinge ille. Then doe not leaue, though ofte the musicke closes, Till lillyes in their cheekes be turn'd to roses. Chorus. And if it lay in Circes power, Your blisse might so perseuer, That those you choose but for an hower You should enioy for ever. The knights, wt h the ladyes dance here ye old measures, Galliards, Corantoes, the Braules, &amp;c. and then (havinge lead them againe to their places) danced their last measure; after wc h this songe called them awaye. Songe. Who but Tyme so hasty were To fly away &amp; leaue you here? Here where delight Might well allure A very Stoicke from this night To turne an Epicure. But since he calles away; and Time will soone repente, He staid not longer here, but ran to be more idly spente. ?????. Finis. The end.</field>
