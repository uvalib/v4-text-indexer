      <field name="fulltext">CATLIN'S INDIAN GALLERY. CERTIFICATES. Indian Portraits. I have seen Mr. Catlin's collection of Portraits of Indians, East of the Rocky Mountains, many of which were familiar to me, and painted in my presence: and as far as they have included Indians of my acquaintance, the likenesses are easily recognized, bearing the most striking resemblance to the originals, as well as faithful representations of their costumes. Gen. Wm. Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, St. Louis. I have examined Mr. Catlin's collection of the Upper Missouri Indians, to the Rocky Mountains, all of which I am acquainted with, and indeed most of them were painted when I was present, and I do not hesitate to pronounce them correct likenesses, and readily to be recognized. And I consider the costumes, as painted by him to be the only correct representations I have ever seen. John F. A. Sandford, U. S. S. Indian Agent for Mandans, Rickarces, Minatarees, Crows, Knisteneaux, Assinneboins, Blackfeet, &amp;c. Having examined Mr. Catlin's collection of Portraits of Indians of the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, I have no hesitation in pronouncing them, so far as I am acquainted with the individuals, to be the best I have ever seen, both as regards the expression of countenance and the exact and complete manner in which the costume has been painted by him. John L. Bean, S. Agent for Indian Affairs. I have been for many years past in familiar acquaintance with the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, and also with the Landscape and other Scenes represented in Mr. Catlin's collection, and it gives me great pleasure to assure the world that on looking them over, I found the likenesses of my old friends easily to be recognized, and his sketches of Manners and Customs to be pourtrayed with singular truth and correctness. J. Pilcher, Agent for Upper Missouri Indians. It gives me great pleasure in being enabled to add my name to the list of those who have spontaneously expressed their approbation of Mr. Catlin's collection of Indian Paintings. His collection of materials places it in his power to throw much light on the Indian character, and his portraits, so far as I have seen them, are drawn with great fidelity as to character and likeness. Henry Schoolcraft, Indian Agent for Wisconsin Territory. Having lived and dealt with the Black Feet Indians for five years past, I was enabled to recognize every one of the Portraits of those people, and of the Crows, also, which Mr. Catlin has in his collection, from the faithful likenesses they bore to the originals. St. Louis, 1835. J. E. Brazeau. Having spent 16 years in the continual acquaintance with the Indians of the several tribes of the Upper Missouri Indians. represented in Mr. Catlin's Gallery of Indian Paintings, I was enabled to judge of the correctness of the likenesses, and I instantly recognized every one of them, when I looked them over, from the striking resemblances they bore to the originals—so also, of the Landscapes on the Missouri. Honore Picotte. 1* The Portraits in the possession of Mr. Catlin of Pawnee-picts, Kioways, Camanches, Wecos and Osages, were painted by him from life, when on a tour to their country with the U. States Dragoons. The likenesses are good, very easily to be recognized, and the costumes faithfully represented. HENRY DODGE, Colonel of Dragoons. R. H. MASON, Major of Dragoons. D. HUNTER, Captains of Dragoons. D. PERKINS, M. DUNCAN, T. B. WHEELOCK, Lieut. Dragoons. We have seen Mr. Catlin's portraits of Indians east of the Rocky Mountains, many of which are familiar to us; the likenesses are easily recognized, bearing a strong resemblance to the originals, as well as a faithful representation of their costumes. Jno. Dougherty, Indian Agent. J. Gantt. November 27th, 1837. We hereby certify, that the portraits of the Grand Pawnees, Republican Pawnees, Pawnee Loups, Tappage Pawnees, Otoes, Omahaws and Missouries, which are in Mr. Catlin's Indian Gallery, were painted from life by Mr. Geo. Catlin, and that the individuals sat to him in the costumes precisely in which they are painted. Jno. Dougherty, Indian Agent for Pawnees, Omahaws, and Otoes. J. Gantt. New York, 1837. I have seen Mr. Catlin's collection of Indian Portraits, many of which were familiar to me, and painted in my presence at their own villages. I have speat the greater part of my life amongst the tribes and individuals he has represented, and I do not hesitate to pronounce them correct likenesses, and easily recognized; also his sketches of their manners and customs, I think, are excellent; and the landscape views on the Missouri and Mississippi, are correct representations.

      <field name="fulltext">LANDSCAPES, &amp; C. CERTIFCATES. Landscape Views on Missouri, Views of Indian Villages, &amp;c. &amp;c. The Landscapes above mentioned, I have seen, and although it has been thirty years since I travelled over that country, yet a considerable number of them I recognized as faithful representalious, and the remainder of them are so much in the peculiar character of that country as to seem entirely familiar to me. General Wm. Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs. The Landscape views on the Missouri. taken by my friend Mr. Catlin, are correct delineations of the scenery they profess to represent, as I am perfectly well acquainted with the country, having passed though it more than a dozen times. And further, I know that they were taken on the spot, from nature, as I was present when Mr. Catlin visited hat country. John F. A. Sandford, U. S. S. Indian Agent. It gives me great pleasure to be able to pronounce the "Landscape views" taken in the Upper Missouri, by Mr. Catlin, to be correct delineations of the scenery they profess to represent, and although I was not present when they were taken in the field, I was able to identify almost every one between St. Louis and the Grand Bend of the Missouri. John L. Bean, S. Agent of Indian Affairs. I have seen Mr. Catlin's collection of Indian Portraits, many of which were familiar to me, and painted in my presence, at their villages. I have spent the greater part of my life amongst the tribes and individuals he has represented, and I do not hesitate to pronounce them correct likenesses, and easily recognized; also his sketches of then manners and customs. I think, are excellent; and the landscape views on the Missouri and Mississippi, are correct representations. K. McKenzie, Of the Am. Fur Company, Mouth of Yellow Stone.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SPORTING SCENES. CERTIFICATES. Buffalo Hunts and Sports of Upper Missouri. The twelve paintings in Mr. Catlin's Gallery, representing the Buffalo Hunts, seemed to recall so familiarly to recollection, scenes which I have formerly witnessed in that country, that I cannot hesitate for a moment to give my entire approbation of the spirit and truth with which they are drawn. Gen. Wm. Clark, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, St. Louis. I have examined a series of paintings by Mr. Catlin, representing Indian Buffalo Hunts, Landscapes on the Missouri, &amp;c., and from an acquaintance of more than ten years with such scenes as are represented, I feel qualified to judge of them, and do unhesitatingly pronounce them both apt and natural representations. Wm. Gordon, Prov. S. Agent Indian Affairs, St. Louis. Having often been an actor in scenes similar to those represented in Mr. Catlin's paintings of Buffalo Hunts and other sports of the Missouri, I do not hesitate to give my unqualified approbation of the truth and spirit with which they are drawn. John F. A. Sanford, U. S. S. Indian Agent. 3* I have examined a series of paintings by Mr. Catlin, representing Indian Buffalo Hunts, and from an acquaintance of seventeen years with such scenes as are represented, I feel qualified to judge them, and take pleasure in saying, they are delineated strikingiy, and without exaggeration. J. Gantt. I have examined a series of paintings by Mr. Catlin, representing Indian Buffalo Hunts, Landscapes, &amp;c., and from an acquaintance of twenty-seven years with such scenes as are represented, I feel qualified to judge them, and do unhesitatingly pronounce them good and unexag gerated representations.

They have then passed the ordeal which entitles them to the name and reputation of warriors and braves, who can undergo anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CERTIFICATE. Religious Ceremonies of the Mandans. We hereby certify that we witnessed, in company with Mr. Catlin, in the Mandan Village, the ceremonies represented in the four paintings to which this certificate refers, and that he has therein faithfully represented those scenes as we saw them transacted, without any addition or exaggeration. J. Kip, Agent Amer. Fur Company. L. Crawford. Abraham Bogard. Mandan Village, July 20th, 1833.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">INDIAN CURIOSITIES. 495 A Crow Lodge, or Wigicam. A very splendid thing-brought from the foot of the Rocky Mountains twenty-five feet in height—made of buffalo skins, garnished and painted—the poles (30 in number) of pine, (cut in the Rocky Mountains) have been long in use, were pureliased with the lodge, and brought the whole distance. 496 An Indian Cradle, (wi-eehn-dow-een) for carrying the pappoose, beautifully garnished with porcupine quills. 497 Caman he Lauces, tweive and fourteen feet in length-blade of steel, made by the Spaniards of Mexico. 498 Twelve Calumets, or Pipes of Peace, used only at the ceretnony of peace making. 499 Eighty Ordinary Pipes, of various patterns, and of various materials. 500 A very great and valuable collection of Man and Women's Dresses. from the different tibes, garnished and fringed with scalp locks from their enemies' heads—Bows, Quivers, Spears, Shields, War Eagle and Raven Head Dresses, Necklaces, Mockasins, Belts, Pouches, War Clubs, Robes, Mantles, Tobacco Sacks, Wampum, Whistles, Rattles, Drums, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? The above is a hasty enumeration of the paintings and other articles in the Gallery, and the visitors will certainly be willing to make due allowance for the unfinished condition in which many of the paintings are exhibited—the author of these works has travelled, for seven years past, under peculiar privations and difficulties in procuring these sketches ; and his canvass has been carried the whole way with him, and the greater part of the paintings stand exactly in the same state as they were made in the villages of the different tribes. He, therefore, puts them up rather as fac similes of what he has seen, than as finished works of art, which require more time and more favorable circumstances to produce. He promises, however, to place them, in turn, upon his casel, and render them eventually more pleasing to the eye— and also, to give a more minute and complete description of them, and Indian manners and customs in general, in a work of two quarto volumes, which he will be ready to put forth to the world in a few weeks, entitled—"Catlin's Letters and Notes on the Manners and Customs of the North American Indians." ? The Certificates which are attached to the Portraits Landscapes, &amp;c., in the fore part of the Catalogue, are the voluntary approbations of gentlemen who have spent the greater part of their lives amongst those tribes, and know the most of them familiarly. In addition to these Certificates, nearly every portrait has inseparably attached to its back, an individual Cortificate, signed by Indian Agents, Officers of the Army, or other persons who were present when the picture was painted. The form of these Certificates is as follows:— No. 207. Blackfoot. pe-toh-pe-kiss, The Eagle Ribs. I hereby certify that this Portrait was painted from the life, at Fort Union, mouth of Yellow Stone — in the year 1832, by Geo. Catlin, and that the Indian sat in the costume in which it is painted. John F. A. Sanford, U. S. Indian Agent.</field>
