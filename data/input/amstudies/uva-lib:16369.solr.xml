TWO of the hunters Shannon &amp; Labuish returned having killed three Elk. Ordered a party to go in quest of the meat early tomorrow morning and the hunters to return and continue the chase. the Indians left us about 12 OClk. The root of the thistle, called by the natives Shan-ne-tah-que1 1 The shanataque or edible root of the thistle has been mentioned several times previously. It was Cirsium edule. For description of a specimen in the Lewis herbarium, as well as those of other plants collected west of the Rocky Mountains, see Meehan's "Plants of the Lewis and Clark Expedition," in Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia Proceedings, 1898, pp. 12–49, also pp. 291–315.—Ed. is [a] perpendicular fusiform and possesses from two to four radicles; is from 9 to 15 Inc[h]es in length and about the size [of] a mans thumb; the rhind somewhat rough and of a brown colour; the consistence when first taken from the earth is white and nearly as crisp as a carrot; when prepared for uce by the same process before discribed of the white bulb or pashshequo quawmash, it becomes black, and is more shugary than any f [r]uit or root that I have met with in uce among the natives; the sweet is precisely that of the sugar in flavor; this root is sometimes eaten also when first taken from the ground without any preperation, but in this way is vastly inferior, it delights most in a deep rich dry lome which has a good mixture of sand. the stem of this plant is simple ascending celindric and hisped. the root leaves yet possess their virdure and are about half grown of a plale green. the cauline leaf as well as the stem of the last season are now dead, but in rispect to it's form &amp;c it is simple, crenate, &amp; oblong, reather more obtuse at it's apex than at the base or insertion; it's margin armed with prickles while it's disks are hairy, it's insertion decurrent and position declining. the flower is also dry and mutilated. the pericarp seems much like that of the common thistle. it rises to the hight of from 3 to 4 feet.1 1 This and other descriptive matter in natural history, collected by the explorers during their stay at Fort Clatsop, may be found in vol. ii, chap. vii, of the Biddle text. That text disposes of the events from Jan. 22 to March 22 in two pages (146, 147) of chapter vi; the rest of the chapter is devoted to an account of the neighboring Indians,—Ed. [Clark:] Thursday [Tuesday] 21st of January 1806 Two of the hunters Shannon &amp; Labieche returned haveing killed three Elk, ordered a party to go in quest of the meat early tomorrow morning and the hunters to return and continue the chase. the indians left us about 12 oClock. The root of the thistle called by the nativs Chan-ne-tâk-que is pirpendicular and possesses from two to 4 radicles; is from 9 to 15 inches in length and is commonly about the Size of a mans thum the rhine Somewhat rough and of a brown colour; the consistence when first taken from the earth is white and nearly as crisp as a carrot, when prepared for use by the same process before discribed of the white bulb or pash she quo, qua-mosh, it becomes black and is more Sugary than any root I have met with among the nativs; the Sweet is prosisely that of the sugar in flavor, this root is Sometimes eaten when first taken from the ground without any preperation; in this way it is well tasted but soon weathers [withers] and becoms hard and insipped. it delights most in a deep rich moist lome which has a good mixture of Sand. The Stems of this plant is simple ascending celindric and hisped. the root leaves, posses[s] their virdu[r]e and are about half grown of a deep Green. the Cauline leaf as well as the stem of the last Season are now dead, but in respect to it's form &amp;c. it is simple crenated and oblong, rather more obtuce at it's opex than the base or insertion, it's margin armed with prickles while it's disks are hairy, its insertion decurrent and position declineing. the flower is also dry and mutilated the pericarp seems much like that of the common thistle it rises to the hight of from 3 to 4 feet. [Lewis:] Thursday (Wednesday) January 22nd. 1806. The party sent for the meat this morning returned with it in the Evening; it was in very inferior order, in short the animals were poor. Reubin Fields also remained with the other hunters Shannon &amp; Labuish our late supply of salt is out. we have not yet heared a sentence from the other two parties of hunter's who are below us towards Point Adams and the Praries. There are three species of fern in this neighbourhood the root one of which the nat[i]ves eat;1 1 Pteris aquilina lanuginosa.—C. V. Piper. this grows very abundant in the open uplands and praries where the latter are not sandy and consist of teep loose rich black lome. the root is horizontal sometimes a little deverging or obliquely descending, frequently dividing itself as it procedes into two equal branches and shooting up a number of stems; it lies about 4 Inc[h]es beneath the surface of the earth. the root is celindric, with few or no radicles and from the size of a goose quill to that of a man's finger; the center of the root is divided into two equal parts by a strong flat &amp; white ligament like a piece of thin tape on either side of this there is a white substance which when the root is roasted in the embers is much like wheat dough and not very unlike it in flavour, though it has also a pungency which becomes more visible after you have chewed it some little time; this pungency was disagreeable to me, but the natives eat it very voraciously and I have no doubt but it is a very nutricious food. the bark of the root is black, somewhat rough, thin and brittle, it easily seperates in flakes from the part which is eaten as dose also the internal liggament. this root perennil. in rich lands this plant rises to the hight of from 4 to five feet. the stem is smooth celindric, slightly groved on one side erect about half it's hight on the 2 first branches thence reclining backwards from the grooved side; it puts forth it's branches which are in reallyty long footstalks by pares from one side only and near the edges of the groove, these larger footstalks are also grooved cilindric and gradually tapering towards the extremity, puting forth alternate footstalks on either side of the grove near it's edge; these lesser footstalks the same in form as the first put forth from forty to fifty alternate pinate leaves which are sessile, horizontal, multipartite for half their length from the point of insertion and terminating in a long shaped apex, and are also revolute with the upper disk smoth and the lower slightly cottanny. these alternate leaves after proceeding half the length of the footstalks cease to be partite and assume the tongue like form altogether, this plant produces no flower or fruit whatever, is of a fine green colour in summer and a beautifull plant, the top is annual and is of course dead at present. [Clark:] Friday [Wednesday] 22nd. January 1806. The party Sent for the Meat this morning returned with it in the evening; it was in verry inferior order, in Short the animals were pore. Rieuben Field Shannon and Labiech remained in the woods to hunt. our late Supply of Salt is out. we have not heard a word of the other hunters who are below us towards point adams and the Praries. Some rain this day at intervales. There are three Species of fern in this neighbourhood the root one of which the nativs eate; that of which the nativs eate produce no flowers whatever or fruit of a fine green Colour and the top is annual, and in course dead at present. I observe no difference between the lickrice [licorice] of this countrey and that Common to maney parts of the United States where it is sometimes cultivated in our gardins. this plant delights in a deep lose sandy Soil; here it grows verry abundant and large; the nativs roste it in the embers and pound it Slightly with a Small Stick in order to make it Seperate more readily from the Strong liggaments which forms the Center of the root; this they discard and chew and Swallow the ballance of the root; this last is filled with a number of thin membrencies like network, too tough to be masticated and which I find it necessary also to discard. This root when roasted possesses an agreeable flavour not unlike the Sweet potato. The root of the thistle (described yesterday) after undergoing the process of Sweting or bakeing in a kiln is sometimes eaten with the train Oil also, at other times pounded fine and mixed with cold water, untill reduced to the consistancy of Gruel; in this way I think it verry agreeable. but the most Valuable of all their roots is foreign to this neighbourhood I mean the Wappetoe. The Wappetoe, or bulb of the Sagitifolia or common arrow head, which grows in great abundance in the marshey grounds of that butifull and fertile Vally on the Columbia commenceing just above the Quick sand River and extending downwards for about 70 Miles. this bulb forms a principal article of trafic between the inhabitents of the Vally and those of their neighbourhood or sea coast. [Lewis:] Friday (Thursday) January 23rd. 1806. This morning dispatched Howard and Warner to the Camp of the Salt-make[r]s for a supply of salt. The men of the garison are still busily employed in dressing Elk's skins for cloathing, they find great difficulty for the want of branes; we have not soap to supply the deficiency, nor can we procure ashes to make the lye; none of the pines which we use for fuel affords any ashes; extrawdinary as it may seem, the greene wood is consoomed without leaving the residium of a particle of ashes. The root of the rush 1 1 Equisetum telmateia.—C. V. Piper. used by the natives is a sollid bulb about one inch in length and usually as thick as a man's thumb, of an ovate form depressed on two or more sides, covered with a thin smothe black rind. the pulp is white brittle and easily masticated either raw or roasted the latter is the way in which it is most usually prepared for uce. this root is reather insipid in point of flavour, it grows in greatest abundance along the sea coast in the sandy grounds and is most used by the Killamucks and those inhabiting the coast. each root sends up one stock only which is annual, the root being perenniel. the bulb is attatched to the bottom of the caulis or stem by a firm small and strong radicle of about one Inch long; this radicle is mearly the prolongation of the caulis and decends perpendicularly; a little above the junction of this radicle with the caulis, the latter is surrounded in a whorl with a set of small radicles from 6 to 9 inches long which are obliquely descending. the caulis is celindric erect hollow and jointed, and is about the size or reather larger than the largest quill. it rises to the hight of 3 or 4 feet, not branching nor dose it either bear flower or seed that I can discover tho' I am far from denying that it dose so sometimes, but I have not been able to discover it. the stem is rough like the sand rush and is much like it when green or in it's succulent state. at each joint it puts out from twenty to thirty long lineal stellate or radiate &amp; horizontal leaves which surround the stem. above each joint about half an inch the stem is sheathed like the sand rush. [Clark:] Saturday [Thursday] 23rd. of January 1806 This morning dispatched Howard &amp; Werner to the Camp of the Salt makers for a Supply of Salt. the men of the garrison are still busily employed in dressing Elk Skins for Cloathing, they fine[d] great dificuelty for the want of branes; we have not Soap to Supply the deficiency, nor can we precure ashes to make the lye; none of the pine which we use for fuel afford any ashes; extrawdinary as it may Seem, the green wood is co[n]sumed without leaveing the risideum of a particle of ashes. The root of the rush used by the nativs is a solid bulb about one inch in length and usially as thick as a mans thumb, of an ovel form depressed on two or more Sides, covered with a thin black rine. the pulp is white brittle and easily masticated either raw or rosted, the latter is the way it is most commonly prepared for use. this root is reather insippid in point of flavour, it grows in the Greatest abundance along the Sea coast in the wet sandy grounds and is most used by the Kil á mox and those inhabiting the Sea coast. each root Sends up its Stalk which is annual, the root being perennial. the bulb is atached to the bottom of the Stem by a firm Small and strong radicle which is mearly the prolongation of the Stem which is hollow and jointed and is rather larger than the largest quill. it rises to the hight of 3 or 4 feet, not branching no[r] does it either bear flower or Seed that I could discover tho I am far from denying that it does so sometimes, and perhaps every year, but I have not been able to discover it, the Stem is rough like the Sand rush, and it's much like it when green, at each joint it puts out from 20 to 30 radiate [&amp; horizontal] leaves which Surrounds the Stem. above each joint about half an inch the Stem is Shethed like the Sand rush. The instruments used by the nativs in digging their roots is a Strong Stick of three feet and a half long Sharpened at the lower end and its upper inserted into a part of an Elks or buck's horn which Serves as a handle; standing transvirsely in the Stick. or it is in this form as thus ? A is the lower part which is a little hooked B is the upper part or handle of Horn. [Lewis:] Saturday (Friday) January 24th. 1806. Drewyer and Baptiest La Paage returned this morning in a large Canoe with Comowooll and six Clatsops. they brought two deer and the flesh of three Elk &amp; one Elk's skin, having given the flesh of one other Elk which they killed and three Elk's skins to the Indians as the price of their assistance in transporting the ballance of the meat to the Fort; these Elk and deer were killed near point Adams and the Indians carryed them on their backs about six miles, before the waves were sufficiently low to permit their being taken on board their canoes. the Indians remained with us all day.1 1 The Indians were barefooted, notwithstanding the snow on the ground; and the evening was so bad we permitted them to stay in the fort all night.—Gass (p. 262). The Indians witnissed Drewyer's shooting some of those Elk, which has given them a very exalted opinion of us as marksmen and the superior excellence of our rifles compared with their guns; this may probably be of service to us, as it will deter them from any acts of hostility if they have ever meditated any such. My Air-gun also astonishes them very much; they cannot comprehend it's shooting so often and without powder; and think that it is great medicine which comprehends every thing that is to them incomprehensible. I observe no difference between the liquorice of this country and that common to many parts of the United states where it is also sometimes cultivated in our gardens. this plant delights in a deep loose sandy soil; here it grows very abundant and large; the natives roast it in the embers and pound it slightly with a small stick in order to make it seperate more readily from the strong liggament which forms the center of the root; this the natives discard and chew and swallow the ballance of the root; this last is filled with a number of thin membrenacious lamela [like net work], too tough to be masticated and which I find it necessary also to discard. this root when roasted possesses an agreeable flavour not unlike the sweet pittaitoe. beside the small celindric root mentioned on the 20th. inst, they have also another about the same form size and appearance which they use much with the train oil, this root is usually boiled; to me it possesses a disagreeable bitterness. the top of this plant I have never yet seen.1 1 Lupinus littoralis, Dougl. See ante, vol. iii, p. 230, note.—Ed. The root of the thistle after undergoing the prossess of sweating or baking in a kiln is sometimes eaten with the train oil also, and at other time pounded fine and mixed with could water untill reduced to the consistency of sagamity2 2 The name given by the Algonquian tribes to a mush or gruel made by boiling pounded Indian corn—their most common method of preparing that grain.—Ed. or indian mush; in this way I think it very agreeable. but the most valuable of all their roots is foreign to this neighbourhood I mean the Wappetoe, or the bulb of the Sagitifolia or common arrow head, which grows in great abundance in the marshey grounds of that beatifully and firtile valley on the Columbia commencing just above the entrance of Quicksand River, and extending downwards for about 70 Miles. this bulb forms a principal article of traffic Heads of Clatsop Indians, by Clark—an old man, a young man, and a woman; and a child in process of having its head flattened. between the inhabitants of the valley and those of this neighbourhood or sea coast. The instrument used by the natives in diging their roots is a strong stick of 3 1/2 feet long sharpened at the lower end and it's upper inscerted into a part of an Elks or buck's horn which serves as a handle, standing transversely with the stick or it is in this form A the lower point, B the upper part or handle. [Clark:] Sunday [Friday] 24th. of January 1806 Drewyer and Bapteist laPage returned this morning in a large Canoe with Commowol and six Clatsops. they brought two Deer and three Elk and one elk Skin, haveing given the flesh of one other Elk they killed and three Elk skins to the Indians as the price of their assistance in transporting the ballance of the meat to the Fort; these Deer and Elk were killed near pt. Adams and those Indians Carried them on their Backs near 4 miles, before the waves were Sufficiently low to permit their being taken on board their canoes. The indians remain'd with us all day. The Clapsots witnessed Drewyers shooting some of those Elk, which has given them a very exolted opinion of us as marksmen and the Superior excellency of our rifles compared with their guns; this may probably be of service to us, as it will deter them from any acts of hostility if they have ever meditated any such. our air gun also astonishes them very much, they cannot comprehend its Shooting So often and without powder, and think that it is great medison which comprehends every thing that is to them incomprehensible. The nativs of this neighbourhood ware no further Covering than a light roabe, their feet legs &amp; every other part exposed to the frost Snow &amp; ice &amp;c. [Lewis:] Sunday (Saturday) January 25th. 1806. Comowooll and the Clatsops departed early this morning. At meridian Colter returned and repo[r]ted that his comrade hunter Willard had continued his hunt from point Adams towards the salt makers; and that they had killed only those two deer which the Indians brought yesterday. In the even ing Collins one of the saltmakers returned and reported that they had mad[e] about one bushel of salt &amp; that himself and that others had hunted from the salt camp for five days without killing any thing and they had been obliged to subsist on some whale which they procured from the natives. The native fruits and buries in uce among the Indians of this neighbourhood are a deep purple burry about the size of a small cherry called by them Shal-lun, a small pale red berrybv /&gt; called Sol'-me; the vineing or low Crambury [Cranberry], light brown bury reather larger and much the shape of a black haw; and a scarlet bury about the size of a small Chirry the plant called by the Canadin Engages of the N.W. sac a com mis produces this bury; this plant is so called from the circumstance of the Clerks of those trading companies carrying the leaves of this plant in a small bag for the purpose of smokeing of which they are excessively fond. the Indians call this burry[blank space in MS.] I have lately learned that the natives whome I have heretofore named as distinct nations, living on the sea coast S.E. of the Killamucks, are only bands of that numerous nation, which continues to extend itself much further on that coast than I have enumerated them, but of the particular appellations of those distant bands I have not yet been enabled to inform myself; their language also is somewhat different from the Clatsops Chinnooks and Cathlâhmâhs; but I have not yet obtained a vocabulary which I shall do the first oportunity which offers. [Clark:] Monday [Saturday] 25th. of January 1806 Commowol and the Clatsops departed early this morning. Colter returned and reported that his comrade hunter Willard had continued his hunt from Point Adams towards the Salt-makers; and that they had killed only those two deer which the indians brought yesterday; in the evening Collins one of the Saltmakers returned and reported that they had made about one bushel of Salt and that himself and two others had hunted from the Salt Camp for five days without killing any thing and they had been obliged to Subsist on Some whale which they purchased from the nativs. The native fruits and berries in use among the Indians of this neighbourhood are a Deep purple about the Size of a Small cherry called by them Shal lun, a Small pale red berry called Sol me; the Vineing or low brown berry, a light brown berry rather larger and much the Shape of a black haw; and a scarlet berry about the size of a Small Chirry the plant called by the Canadian Engages of the N.W. Sac a com mis produces this berry; this plant is so called from the circumstances of the Clerks of these tradeing Companies carrying the leaves of this plant in a Small bag for the purpose of Smokeing of which they are excessively fond the Indians Call this berry [blank space in MS.] [Lewis:] Monday (Sunday) January 26th. 1806. Werner and Howard who were sent for salt on the 23rd. have not yet returned, we are apprehensive that they have missed their way; neither of them are very good woodsmen, and this thick heavy timbered pine country added to the constant cloudy weather makes it difficult for even a good woodsman to steer for any considerable distance the course he wishes. we ordered Collins to return early in the morning and rejoin the salt makers, and gave him some small articles of merchandize to purchase provisions from the Indians, in the event of their still being unfortunate in the chase. The Shallun (see Feby. 8. 1806) or deep purple berry is in form much like the huckkleberry and terminates bluntly with a kind of cap or cover at the end like that fruit; they are attatched seperately to the sides of the boughs of the shrub by a very short stem hanging underneath the same and are frequently placed very near each other on the same bough; it is a full bearer. the berry is easily geathered as it seperates from the bough readily, while the leaf is strongly affixed. the shrub which produces this fruit rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet sometimes grows on the high lands but moste generally in the swampy or marshey grounds; it is an evergreen. the stem or trunk is from three to 10 Inches in circumference irregularly and much branched, seldom more than one steem proceding from the same root, tho' they are frequently associated very thickly. the bark is somewhat rough and of a redish brown colour. the wood is very firm and hard. the leaves are alternate declining and attatched by a short fotstalk to the two horizontal sides of the boughs; the form is a long oval, reather more accute towards its apex than at the point of insertion; it's margin slightly serrate, it's sides colapsing or partially foalding upwards or channelled; it is also thick firm [s]mothe and glossey, the upper surface of a fine deep green, while the under disk is of a pale or whiteish green. this shrub retains it's virdure very perfectly during the winter and is a beautifull shrub.1 1 For description of the true shallun see Feb. 8, post. This is Vaccinium ovatum, Pursh, not Amclanchier alnifolia (Coues, L. and C., iii, p. 828), which is not evergreen. —C. V. Piper. the natives either eat these berrys when ripe immediately from the bushes or dryed in the sun or by means of their sw[e]ating kilns; very frequently they pound them and bake them in large loaves of 10 or fifteen pounds; this bread keeps very well during one season and retains the moist jeucies of the fruit much better than by any other method of preservation. this bread is broken and stired in could water untill it be sufficiently thick and then eaten; in this way the natives most generally use it. [Clark:] Tuesday [Sunday] 26th. of January 1806 We order Collins to return early in the morning and join the Salt makers, and gave him Some Small articles of Merchendize to purchase Some provisions from the indians in the event of their Still being unfortunate in the chase. The (Shal-lun) or deep purple berry is in form much like the huckleberry and termonate bluntly with a kind of cap or cover at the end like that fruit; they are attached Seperately to the Sides of the boughs of the shrub by a very short Stem hanging under neath the same, and are frequently placed verry near each other on the Same bough it is a full bearer; the berry is easily gathered as it Seperates from the bough, readily, while the leaf is Strongly affixed. the Shrub which produces this fruit rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet sometimes grows on high land but most frequently in Swampey or marshey grounds; it is an ever green. the Stem or trunk is from 3 to 10 inches in circumferance irrigularly and much branched, seldom more than one Stem proceeding from the Same root, tho they are frequently associated very thickly. the bark is Somewhat rough and of a redish brown colour. the wood is very firm and hard. the leaves are alternate declining and attachd. by a Short f[o]otstalk to the two horozontal Sides of the bough's; the form is a long oval, reather more accute towards its apex that [than] at the point of insertion; it's sides partially folding upwards; or channeled, it is also thick Smothe and glossy, the upper surfice of a fine deep green, while the under disk is of a pale or whitish green. this shrub retains its verdure verry perfectly dureing the winter and is a butifull Shrub. the nativs either eate those berries ripe imediately from the bushes, or dried in the Sun or by means of the Swetting Kiln; verry frequently they pound them and bake them in large loaves of 10 or 15 pounds weight; this bread keeps verry well dureing one Season and retains the moist jouicies of the frute Much better than any other method of preperation. The bread is broken and Stured [stirred] in coald water untill it be Sufficiently thick and then eaten, in this way the nativ's most generally use it [Lewis:] Tuesday (Monday) January 27th. 1806. This morning Collins set out for the Salt works. in the evening Shannon returned and reported that himself and party had killed ten Elk. he left Labuche and R. fields with the Elk. two of those Elk he informed us were at the distance of nine miles from this place near the top of a mountain, that the rout by which they mus[t] be brought was at least four miles by land through a country almost inaccessible from the fallen timber, brush and sink-holes, which were now disgu[i]sed by the snow; we therefore concluded to relinquish those two Elk for the present, and ordered every man who could be speared from the fort to go early in the morning in surch of the other eight. Goodrich has recovered from the Louis Veneri [lues veneris] which he contracted from an amorous contact with a Chinnook damsel. I cured him as I did Gibson last winter by the uce of murcury. I cannot learn that the Indians have any simples which are sovereign specifics in the cure of this disease; and indeed I doubt very much whet[h]er any of them have any means of effecting a perfect cure. when once this disorder is contracted by them it continues with them during life; but always ends in dec[r]ipitude, death, or premature old age; tho' from the uce of certain simples together with their diet, they support this disorder with but little inconvenience for many years, and even enjoy a tolerable share of health; particularly so among the Chippeways who I believe to be better skilled in the uce of those simples than any nation of Savages in North America. The Chippeways use a decoction of the [root of the] Lobelia, and that of a species of sumac common to the Atlantic states and to this country near and on the Western side of the Rocky Mountains. this is the smallest species of the sumac, readily distinguished by it's winged rib, or common footstalk, which supports it's oppositely pinnate leaves. these decoctions are drank freely and without limitation. the same decoctions are used in cases of the gonnærea and are effecatious and sovereign. notwithstanding that this disorder dose exist among the Indians on the Columbia yet it is witnessed in but few individuals, at least the males who are always sufficiently exposed to the observations or inspection of the phisician. in my whole rout down this river I did not see more than two or three with the gonnærea and about double that number with the pox. The berry which the natives call Solme is the production of a plant about the size and much the shape of that common to the atlantic states which produces the berry commonly called Sollomon's seal berry. this berry also is attatched to the top of the stem in the same manner; and is of a globelar form, consisting of a thin soft pellicle which encloses a soft pulp inveloping from three to four seeds, white, firm, smothe, and in the form of a third or quarter of a globe, and large in proportion to the fruit or about the size of the seed of the common small grape. this berry when grown and unripe is not specked as that of the Solomon's Seal berry is; this last has only one globular smoth white firm seed in each berry. the Solme grows in the woodlands among the moss. and is an annual plant to all appearance.1 1 See ante, vol. iii, p. 221, note.—Ed. VOL. IV.—2 [Clark:] Wednesday [Monday] 27th January 1806 This morning Collins Set out to the Saltmakers Shannon returned and reported that himself and party had killed 10 Elk. he lef[t] Labiech &amp; R. Field with the Elk, two of those Elk he informed us was at the distance of 9 miles from this place near the top of a mountain, that the rout by which they must be brought was at least 5 miles by land thro' a countrey almost inexcessable, from the fallen timber brush, and Sink holes, which were now disguised by the Snow; we therefore concluded to relinquish those two Elks for the present, and ordered every man that could be speared from the Fort to go early in the morning in Serch of the other eight, which is at no great distance from the Ne tul river, on which we are. Goudrich has recovered from the louis veneri which he contracted from a amorous contact with a chinnook damsel. he was cured as Gibson was with Murcury by [blank space in MS.] I cannot lern that the Indians have any Simples sovereign specifics in the cure of this disease; indeed I doubt verry much whether any of them have any means of effecting a perfect cure. when once this disorder is contracted by them it continues with them dureing life; but always ends in dec[r]epitude, death; or premature old age; tho' from the use of certain simples together with their diet, they support this disorder with but little inconveniance for maney years, and even enjoy a tolerable Share of health; particularly So among the Chippeways who I beleive to be better Skilled in the use of those Simples than any nation of Indians in North America. The Chippaways use a decoction of the root of the Labelia, and that of a Species of sumac common to the Atlantic States and to this countrey near and on the western Side of the Rocky Mountains. This is the Smallest species of Sumake, readily distinguished by it's winged rib, or common foot stalks, which Supports it's oppositly pinnate leaves. these decoctions are drank freely and without limatation. the same decoctions are used also in cases of the Gonnarea and are effecatious and sovereign. Notwithstanding that this disorder does exist among the indians on the Columbia yet it is witnessed in but fiew individuals, high up the river, or at least the males who are always sufficiently exposed to the observation or inspection of the phisician. in my whole rout down this river I did not see more than two or three with Gonnarea and about double that number with the Pox. The berry which the nativs call Sol me is the production of a plant about the Size and much the Shape of that common to the atlantic States which produces the berry commonly called Sollomons Seal berry this berry is also attached to the top of the Stem in the Same manner; and is of a globular form consisting of a thin Soft [Pellicle] rine which encloses a Soft [Pellicle] pulp inveloping from 3 to 4 Seed, white firm, Smothe, and in the form of a third or a quarter of a Globe, and large in perportion to the fruit, or about the size of the seed of the common small grape. the berry when grown and unripe is not Specked as the Solomon's seal berry is; this last haveing only one Globaler smothe, ferm, white seed in each berry. the Sol me grows in the woodlands amonge the moss and on the high ridges. and is an annual plant to all appearance. [Lewis:] Wednesday (Tuesday) January 28th 1806. Drewyer and Baptiest La Page set out this morning on a hunting excurtion. about noon Howard and Werner returned with a supply of salt; the badness of the weather and the difficulty of the road had caused their delay. they inform us that the salt makers are still much straitened for provision, having killed two deer only in the last six days; and that there are no Elk in their neighbourhood. The party that were sent this morning up Netul river for the Elk returned in the evening with three of them only; the Elk had been killed just before the snow fell which had covered them and so altered the apparent face of the country that the hunters could not find the Elk which they had killed. the river on which Fort Clatsop stands we now call Ne-tul, this being the name by which the Clatsops call it. The Cranbury of this neighbourhood is precisely the same common to the U' States, and is the production of marshey or boggy grounds.1 1 The species from the mouth of the Columbia northward is Vaccinium oxycoccus intermedium, Gray. Commercially in the Seattle markets they are termed "Alaska cranberries," the supply coming largely from the Fraser River.—C. V. Piper. The light brown berry, is the fruit of a tree about the size shape and appearance in every rispect with that in the U. States called the wild crab apple;2 2 Pyrus rivularis, the Oregon crab-apple.—C. V. Piper. the leaf is also precisely the same as is also the bark in texture and colour. the berrys grow in clumps at the end of the small branches; each berry supported by a seperate stem, and as many as from 3 to 18 or 20 in a clump. the berry is ovate with one of it's extremities attatched to the peduncle, where it is in a small degre[e] concave like the insertion of the stem of the crab apple. I know not whether this fruit can properly be denominated a berry, it is a pulpy pericarp, the outer coat of which is in a thin smoth, tho' firm tough pillecle; the pericarp containing a membranous capsule with from three to four cells, each containing a seperate single seed in form and colour like that of the wild crab. The wood of this tree is excessively hard when seasoned. the natives make great uce of it to form their wedges with which they split their boards of pine for the purpose of building houses. these wedges they also employ in spliting their fire-wood and in hollowing out their canoes. I have seen the natives drive the wedges of this wood into solid dry pine which it cleft without fracturing or injuring the wedg[e] in the smallest degree. we have also found this wood usefull to us for ax handles as well as glutts or wedges. the native also have wedges made of the beams of the Elk's horns which appear to answer extremely well. this fruit is exceedingly assid, and resembles the flavor of the wild crab. [Clark:] Thursday (Tuesday) 28th. January 1806. Drewyer and Baptiest Lapage set out this morning on a hunting excurtion. about noon Howard &amp; Werner returned with a Supply of Salt; the badness of the weather and the dificuelty of the road had detained them. they informed us that the salt makers are still much stratened for provisions haveing killed two deer only in the last six days; and that there are no Elk in their neighbourhood. The party that was Sent up the Netul river for the Elk returned this evening with three of them only; the Elk had been killed just before the Snow fell which had covered them and so altered the apparant face of the countrey that the hunters could not find them. The River on which Fort Clatsop Stands we now call Netul, this being the name by which the Clatsops call it. The Cranberry of this neighbourhood is precisely the same common to the united states, and is the production of boggy or marshey grounds. The light-brown berry, is the fruit of a tree, about the Size Shape and appearance in every respect with that in the united States called the wild Crab apple; the leaf is also precisely the Same as is also the bark in textu[r]e and colour. the berry grows in clumps at the ends of the Smaller branches; each berry supported by a stem, and as maney as from 3 to 18 or 20 in a clump. the berry is oval with one of its extremities attatched to the peduncle, where it is in a Small degree concave like the insersion of the Stem of the Crab apple. I know not whether this fruit can properly be denomonated a berry, it is a pulpy pericarp, the outer coat of which is a thin smothe, capsule with from three to four cells, each containing a Seperate Single Seed in form and colour like that of the wild Crab apple The wood of this tree is excessively hard when seasoned. The Nativs make great use of it [to] form their wedges of which they Split their boards of Pine for the purpose of building houses. those wedges they employ in common with those formed of the Elks horn, in Splitting their fire wood and in hollowing out their canoes. I have seen the nativs drive the wedges of this wood into a solid dry pine which it cleft without fractureing [or] injuring the wedge in the smallest degree. we have also found this wood usefull to us for ax handles, as well as Glutts or wedges. The bark of this tree is chewed by our party in place of tobacco. The fruit is exceedingly ascid and resembles the flavor of the wild Crab. [Lewis:] Thursday (Wednesday) January 29th. 1806. Nothing worthy of notice occurred today. our fare is the flesh of lean elk boiled with pure water, and a little salt. the whale blubber which we have used very sparingly is now exhausted, on this food I do not feel strong, but enjoy the most perfect health; a keen appetite supplys in a great degree the want of more luxurious sauses or dishes, and still renders my ordinary meals not uninteresting to me, for I find myself sometimes enquiring of the cook whether dinner or breakfast is ready. The Sac a commis1 1 Sacacommis is the bearberry, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi.—C. V. Piper. is the growth of high dry situations, and invariably in a piney country or on it's borders. it is generally found in the open piney woodland as on the Western side of the Rocky mountain but in this neighbourhood we find it only in the praries or on their borders in the more open woodlands; a very rich soil is not absolutely necessary, as a meager one frequently produces it abundantly. the natives on this side of the Rocky mountains who can procure this berry invariably use it; to me it is a very tasteless and insippid fruit. this shrub is an evergreen, the leaves retain their virdure most perfectly through the winter even in the most rigid climate as on lake Winnipic. the root of this shrub puts forth a great number of stems which seperate near the surface of the ground; each stem from the size of a small quill of [to] that of a man's finger; these are much branched the branches forming an accute angle with the stem, and all more p[r]operly p[r]ocumbent than creeping, for altho' it sometimes puts forth radicles from the stem and branches which strike obliquely into the ground, these radicles are by no means general, equable in their distances from each other nor do they appear to be calculated to furnish nutriment to the plant but reather to hold the stem or branch in it's place. the bark is formed of several thin layers of a smoth thin brittle substance of a dark or redish brown colour easily seperated from the woody stem in flakes. the leaves with rispect to their position are scatered yet closely arranged near the extremities of the twigs particularly. the leaf is about 3/4 of an inch in length and about half that in width, is oval but obtusely pointed, absolutely entire, thick, smoth, firm, a deep green and slightly grooved. the leaf is supported by a small footstalk of proportionable length. the berry is attatched in an irregular and scattered manner to the small boughs among the leaves, tho' frequently closely arranged, but always supported by seperate short and small peduncles, the insertion of which p[r]oduces a slight concavity in the bury while it's opposite side is slightly convex; the form of the berry is a spheroid, the shorter diameter being in a line with the peduncle. this berry is a pericarp the outer coat of which is a thin firm tough pellicle, the inner part consists of a dry mealy powder of a yellowish white colour invelloping from four to six proportionably large hard light brown seeds each in the form of a section of a spheroid which figure they form when united, and are destitute of any membranous covering. the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet. the natives usually eat them without any preperation. the fruit ripens in september and remains on the bushes all winter. the frost appears to take no effect on it. these berries are sometimes geathered and hung in their lodges in bags where they dry without further trouble, for in their most succulent state they appear to be almost as dry as flour.

Nothing worthey of notice occurred to day. our fare is the flesh of lean Elk boiled with pure water and a little Salt. the whale blubber which we have used very Spearingly is now exhosted. on this food I do not feel Strong, but enjoy tolerable health. a keen appetite supplies in a great degree the want of more luxurious sauses or dishes, and Still renders my ordanary meals not uninteresting to me, for I find myself sometimes enquireing of the Cook whether dinner Supper or Brackfast is ready. indeed my appetite is but Seldom gratified, not even after I have eaten what I conceve a sufficency. Maney of the nativs of the Columbia were hats &amp; most commonly of a conic figure without a brim confined on the head by means of a String which passes under the chin and is attached to the two opposit sides of a secondary rim within the hat. the hat at top termonates in a pointed knob of a conic form, or in this Shape. these hats are made of the bark of Cedar and beargrass wrought with the fingers so closely that it casts the rain most effectually in the Shape which they give them for their own use or that just discribed, on these hats they work various figures of different colours, but most commonly only black and white are employed. these figures are faint representations of the whales, the Canoes, and the harpooners Strikeing them.

Nothing transpired today worthy of notice. we are agreeably disappointed in our fuel which is altogether green pine. we had supposed that it [would] burn but illy, but we have found that by spliting it that it burns very well. The dress of the Clatsops and others in this neighbourhood differs but little from that discribed of the skillutes; they never wear leggins or mockersons which the mildness of this climate I presume has rendered in a great measure unnecessary; and their being obliged to be frequently in the water also renders those articles of dress inconvenient. they wear a hat of a conic figure without a brim confined on the head by means of a stri[n]g which passes under the chin and is attatched to the two opsite sides of a secondary rim within the hat. the hat at top terminates in a pointed knob of a connic form also, or in this shape. these hats are made of the bark of cedar and beargrass 1 1 Beargrass is Xerophyllum tenax, Nutt.

Nothing transpired today worthy of notice. we are agreeably disapointed in our fuel which is altogether green pine. we had supposed that it burned badly, but we have found by splitting it burns very well. The dress of the Clatsops and others of the nativs in the neighbourhood differ but little from that described of the Skilutes and Waukiacums; they never ware legins or mockersons which the mildness of the climate I presume has rendered in a great measure unnecessary; and their being obliged to be frequently in the water also renders those articles of dress inconveniant. The Sac-a-commis is the groth of high dry situations, and invariably in a piney country or on its borders, it is Generally found in the open piney woodlands as on the Western side of the Rocky mountains but in this neighbourhood we find it in the praries or on the borders in the more open woodland's; a very rich soil is not absolutely necessary, as a meager one frequently produces it abundantly. the nativs on the West side of the Rocky Mountains who can precure this berry invariably use it; to me it is a very tasteless and insipid frute. This shrub is an evergreen, the leaves retain their virdu[r]e most perfectly throughout the winter even in the most rigid climate as on Lake Winnipic. the root of this shrub puts fo[r]th a great number of stems which seperate near the surface of the ground; each Stem from the size of a small quill, to that of a mans finger; these are much branched forming an accute angle with the stem, and all more properly procumbent than crossing; for altho' it sometimes puts forth radicles from the stems and branches which strike obliquely into the ground, those radicles are by no means general, equable in their distances from each other nor do they appear to be calculated to furnish nutriment to the plant but rather to hold the stem or branch in its place. the bark is formed of several thin layers of a Smothe thin brittle substance of a redish brown colour easily seperated from the woody stem in flakes. the leaves with respect to their position are scatter'd yet closely arranged near the extremities of the twigs particularly. the leaves are about 3/4 of an inch in length and about half that in width, is oval but obtusely pointed, absolutely entire, thick, smoth, firm, a deep green and slightly grooved. the leaf is supported by a small footstalk of preportionable length. the berry is attached in an irregular and scattered manner to the small boughs among the leaves, tho' frequently closely arranged, but always supported by a seperate short and small peduncles, the incersion of which produces a small concavity in the berry while its opposite side is slightly convex; the form of the berry is a spheroid, the shorter diameter being in a line with the peduncle or stem. this berry is a pericarp the outer coat of which is a thin firm tough pellicle, the inner part consists of dry mealy powder of a yellowish white colour invelloping from four to six propotionably large hard light brown seeds each in the form of section of a spheroid which figure they form when united, and are distitute of any membranous covering. the colour of this fruit is a fine scarlet. the nativs usually eat them without any preparation. the fruit ripens in September and remains on the bushes all winter. the frost appears to take no effects on it. these berries are sometimes gathered and hung in their houses in bags where they dry without further trouble, for in their succulent state they appear to be almost as dry as flour. [Lewis:] Saturday (Friday) January 31st. 1806. Sent a party of eight men up the river this morning to renew their surch for the Elk and also to hunt; they preceded but a few miles before they found the river so obstructed with ice that they were obliged to return. Joseph Fields arrived this evening, informed us that he had been hunting in company with Gibson and Willard for the last five days in order to obtain some meat for himself and the other Saltmakers, and that he had been unsuccessfull untill yesterday evening when he had fortunately killed two Elk, about six miles distant from this place and about 8 from the salt works; he left Gibson and Willard to dry the meat of these Elk and had come for the assistance of some men to carry the meat to the salt camp; for this purpose we ordered four men to accompany him early in the morning. discovered that Mc.Neal had the pox, gave him medecine. Charbono found a bird dead lying near the fort this morning and brought it to me I immediately recognized it to be of the same kind of that which I had seen in the Rocky mountains on the morning of the 20th of September last. this bird is about the size as near as may be of the robbin.1 1 Coues identifies this as the Oregon robin (Hesperocichla nævia).—Ed. it's contour also is precisely the same with that bird. it measures one foot 3 1/4 Inches from tip to tip of the wings when extended. 9 1/4 inches from the extremity of the beak to that of the tail. the tail is 3 3/4 inches in length, and composed of eleven feathers of the same length. The beak is smoth, black, convex and cultrated; one and 1/8 inches from the point to the opening of the chaps and 3/4 only uncovered with feathers; the upper chap exceeds the other a little in length. a few small black hairs garnish the [sides of the] base of the upper chap. the eye is of a uniform deep sea green or black, moderately large. it's legs feet and tallons are white; the legs are an inch and a 1/4 in length and smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the same length with the leg including the length of the tallon, which is 4 lines; the three remaining toes are 3/4 of an inch, each armed with proportionably long tallons. the toes are slightly imbricated. the tallons are curved and sharply pointed. The crown of the head from the beak back to the neck, the back of the head imbracing reather more than half the circumpherence of the neck, the back and tale, are of bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of the tale have a little dash of white near their tips not perceptible when the tail is foalded. a fine black forms the ground of the wings; two stripes of the same colour pass on either side of the head from the base of the beak along the side of the head to it's junction with the neck, and imbraces the eye to it's upper edge; a third stripe of the same colour 3/4 of an inch in width passes from the sides of the neck just above the butts of the wings across the croop in the form of a gorget. the throat or under part of the neck brest and belly is of a fine yellowish brick red. a narrow stripe of this colour also commences just above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the neck as far as the black stripe reaches before discribed, to which, it appears to answer as a border. the feathers which form the 1st. and second ranges of the coverts of the two joints of the wing next the body, are beautifully tiped with this brick red; as is also each large feather of the wing on the short side of it's plumage for 1/2 an inch in length commen[c]ing at the extremity of the feathers which form the first or main covert of the wing. this is a beatifull little bird. I have never heard it's note it appears to be silent. it feeds on berries, and I beleive is a rare bird even in this country, or at least this is the second time only that I have seen it. between the legs of this bird the feathers are white, and those which form the tuft underneath the tail are a mixture of white and a brick red.

[Clark:] Friday January 31st.. 1806 Sent a party of Eight men with the hunters to renew their serch for the Elk, and also to hunt; they proceeded but a fiew miles before they found the river so obstructed with ice that they were obliged to return. Jo. Field arrives this evening, informs us that he had been hunting in company with gibson and willard for the last four days in order to obtain some meat for himself and the other salt makers, and that he had been unsucksessfull untill yesterday evening when he had fortunately killed two Elk, about six miles distant from this place and about 8 from the salt works; he left gibson and willard to dry the meat of those Elk, and had come for assistance to carry the meat to the Salt Camp; for this purpose we ordered four men to accompany him early in the morning. discovered that McNeal had the pox, gave him medicine. Chabono found a bird dead lying near the Fort this morning and brought it in, I reconized it to be the same kind of that which I had seen in the Rocky Mountains at several different times. this bird is about the size as near as may be of the robin it's contour is also presisely the same with that bird. it measured one foot 3/4 inches from tip to tip of the wings when extended. 9 1/4 inches from the extremity of the beak to that of the tail. the tail is 3 3/4 inches in length, and composed of 11 feathers of the same length. The beak is smoth, black, convex and cultrated; 1 1/8 inchs from the point to the opening of the chaps and 3/4 only uncovered with feathers, the upper chap exceeds the other a little in length. a fiew small black hairs garnish the side of the upper chap. The Eye is of a uniform deep sea green or black, moderately large. it's legs feet and tallants are white; the legs are of 1 1/4 in length and smoth; four toes on each foot, of which that in front is the same length of the leg including the tallants, which is four lines; the 3 remaining toes are 3/4 of an inch, each armed with proportionably large tallons. the toes are slightly imbricated. the tallons are curved and sharply pointed. The crown of the head from the beak back to the neck imbracing rather more than half the circumphrence of the neck, the Back and tail is of a bluish dark brown; the two outer feathers of the tail have a little dash of white near the tips, not proceivable when the tail is foalded. a fine black forms the ground of the wings; two stripes of the same colour passes on either side of the Head from the base of the Back along the side of the head to it's junction with the neck, and embraces the eye to its upper edge; a third stripe of the same colour 3/4 of an inch in width passes from the side of the neck just above the buts of the wings across the croop in the form of a gorget. the throat or under part of the neck bust and belly is of a fine yellowish brick red. a narrow stripe of this colour also commences just above the center of each eye, and extends backwards to the Neck as far as the black spots reaches before discribed, to which it appears to answer as a border. the feathers which form the 1st. and second range of the coverts of the two joints of the wings next the body are butifully tiped with this Brick red; as is also each large feather of the wing on the short side of its plumage for 1/2 an inch in length comencing at the extremity of the feather which form the first or main covert of the wing. This is a butiful little bird. I have never herd its notes it appears to be silent. it feeds on berries, and I believe is a rare bird even in this country. between the legs of this bird the feathers are white, and those which form the tuft underneath the tail are a mixture of white and Brick red.1 1 Clark' s astronomical data, being merely transcripts of those in Lewis, are here omitted.—Ed. [Lewis:] Saturday February 1st. 1806. This morning a party of four men set out with Joseph Fields; Sergt. Gass with a party of five men again set out up the Netul river in surch of the Elk which had been killed some days since, and which could not be found in consequence of the snow. The Canoes of the natives inhabiting the lower portion of the Columbia River make their canoes remarkably neat light and well addapted for riding high waves. I have seen the natives near the coast riding waves in these canoes with safety and apparently without concern where I should have thought it impossible for any vessel of the same size to [have] lived a minute. they are built of whitecedar or Arborvita generally, but sometimes of the firr. they are cut out of a solid stick of timber, the gunwals at the upper edge foald over outwards and are about 5/8 of an inch thick and 4 or five broad, and stand horrizontally forming a kind of rim to the canoe to prevent the water beating into it. they are all furnished with more or less crossbars in proportion to the size of the canoe. these bars are round sticks about half the size of a man's arm, which are incerted through holes made in either side of the canoe just below the rim of the gunwall and are further secured with strings of waytape; these crossbars serve to lift and manage the canoe on land. when the natives land they invariably take their canoes on shore, unless they are heavily laden, and then even, if they remain all night, they discharge their loads and take the canoes on shore. some of the large canoes are upwards of 50 feet long and will carry from 8 to 10 thousand lbs. or from 20 to thirty persons and some of them particularly on the sea coast are waxed painted and ornimented with curious images at bough and Stern; those images sometimes rise to the hight of five feet; the pedestals on which these immages are fixed are sometimes cut out of the solid stick with the canoe, and the imagary is formed of seperate small peices of timber firmly united with tenants [tenons] and mo[r]tices without the assistance of a single spike of any kind. when the natives are engaged in navigating their canoes one sets in the stern and steers with a paddle the others set by pears and paddle over the gunwall next them, they all kneel in the bottom of the canoe and set on their feet. their paddles are of a uniform shape of which this is an imitation these paddles are made very thin and the middle of the blade is thick and hollowed out siddonly and made thin at the sides while [the] center forms a kind of rib. the blade occupys about one third of the length of the paddle which is usually from 4 1/2 to 5 feet. I have observed four forms of canoe[s] only in uce among the nations below the grand chatarac of this river they are as follow. this is the smallest size about 15 feet long and calculated for one or two persons, and are most common among the Cathlahmahs and Wâck-ki-a-cums among the marshey Islands. A the bow; B, the stern; these are from twenty to thirty five feet and from two 1/2 to 3 feet in the beam and about 2 feet in the hole; this canoe is common to all the nations below the grand rappids. it is here made deeper and shorter in proportion than they really are. the bowsprit from C, to D is brought to a sharp edge tapering gradually from the sides. This is the most common form of the canoe in uce among the Indians from the Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw inclusive to the Ocean and is usually about 30 or 35 feet long, and will carry from ten to twelve persons. 4. men are competent to carry them a considerable distance say a mile without resting. A is the end which they use as the bow, but which on first sight I took to be the stern C. D. is a comb cut [out] of the sollid stick with the canoe and projects from the center of the end of the canoe being about 1 inch thirck it's sides parallel and edge at C D. sharp. it is from 9 to 11 Inches in length and extends from the underpart of the bowsprit at A to the bottom of the canoe at D. the stern B. is mearly rounding and graduly ascending. 1.2.3. represents the rim of the gunwalls about 4 Inches wide, reather ascending as they recede from the canoe. 4.5.6.7.8. are the round holes through which the cross bars are inserted. This form of canoe we did not meet with untill we reached tidewater or below the grand rappids. from thence down it is common to all the nations but more particularly the Killamucks and others of the coast. these are the largest canoes. B. is the bow and comb. C. the stern and comb. their immages are representations of a great variety of grostesque figures, any of which might be safely worshiped without committing a breach of the commandments. They have but few axes among them, and the only tool usually imployed in felling the trees or forming the canoe, carving &amp;c is a chissel formed of an old file about an Inch or an Inch and a half broad. this chissel has sometimes a large block of wood for a handle; they grasp the chissel just b[e]low the block with the right hand holding the edge down while with the left they take hold of the top of the block and strike backhanded against the wood with the edge of the chissel. a person would suppose that the forming of a large canoe with an instrument like this was the work of several years; but these people make them in a few weeks. they prize their canoes very highly; we have been anxious to obtain some of them, for our journey up the river but have not been able to obtain one as yet from the natives in this neighbourhood. today we opened and examined all our ammunition, which had been secured in leaden canesters. we found twenty seven of the best rifle powder, 4 of common rifle, th[r]ee of glaized and one of the musqu[e]t powder in good order, perfectly as dry as when first put in the canesters, altho' the whole of it from various accedents has been for hours under the water. these cannesters contain four lbs. of powder each and 8 of lead. had it not have been for that happy expedient which I devised of securing the powder by means of the lead, we should not have had a single charge of powder at this time. three of the canesters which had been accedentally bruized and cracked, one [of] which was carelessly stoped, and a fifth that had been penetrated with a nail, were a little dammaged; these we gave to the men to make dry; however exclusive of those five we have an abundant stock to last us back; and we always take care to put a proportion of it in each canoe, to the end that should one can[o]e or more be lost we should still not be entirely bereft of ammunition, which is now our only hope for subsistence and defence in a rout of 4000 Miles through a country exclusively inhabited by savages. [Clark:] Saturday February 1st.. 1806 This morning a party of four men set out with Jo. Field; and Sergt Gass with a party of five men again set out up the Netul river in serch of the Elk which had been killed some days since and which could not be found in consequence of the snow. The Canoes of the nativs inhabitting the lower part of the Columbia River from the Long narrows down make their canoes remarkably neat light and well addapted for rideing high waves. I have seen the nativs near the coast rideing waves in these canoes in safty and appearantly without concern when I should [think] it impossible for any vessel of the same size to have lived or kept above water a minute. They are built of arborvitia or white Cedar generally, but sometimes of fir. they are cut out of a solid stick of timber, the Gunnals at the upper edge fold over outwards and are about 5/8 of an inch thick and 4 or 5 broad, and Stand out nearly Horizontially forming a kind of rim to the Canoe to prevent the water beating into it. they are all furnished with more or less cross bars agreeably to the size of the canoe, those bars are round sticks about 1 inch and 1/2 diameter which are atached to the iner side of the canoes a little below the rim on either side with thongs of cedar bark which is incerted through holes and made fast to the ends of the stick, which is made smaller than the other part of the stick to prevent the cord slipping off these crossbears serve to strengthen the canoe, and by which they lift and manage her on land. When the nativs land the[y] invariably take their canoes on Shore unless they are heavily ladined, and then even, if they remain all night, they discharge their loads and take the canoe on shore. Some of the large canoes are upwards of 50 feet long and will carry from 8 to 12 thousand lbs. or from 20 to 30 persons, and some of them particularly on the sea coast are waxed painted and ornimented with curious images on bow and stern; those images sometimes rise to the height of five feet; the pedestile on which these images are fixed, are sometimes cut out of the solid stick with the canoe, and the image is formed of separate pieces of timber firmly united with tenants and mortices without the appearance of a single spike or nail of any kind. when the nativs are engaged in navigating their canoes, one sets in the Stern and Stears with a paddle the others set by pars and paddle over their gunnals next them. They all kneel in the bottom of the canoe and set on their feet. their paddles are of an uniform shape which this is an imitation those paddles are made verry thin and the middle of the blade is thick and hollowed out suddenly, and made thin on the sides, the center forming a kind of ridge. the [handle] occupies about 1/3 of the length of the paddle which is usually 4 to 4 1/2 feet in length. I have observed five forms of Canoes only in use among the nativs below the Grand Cataract of this river. they are as follows. this is the smallest size about 15 feet long, and calculated for one [or] two men mearly to cross creeks, take over short portages to navigate the ponds and still water, and is mostly in use amongst the Clatsops and Chinnooks. this is the next smallest and from 16 to 20 feet long and calculated for two or 3 persons and are most common among the Wau-ki-â-cums and Cath-lâh-mâhs among the marshey Islands, near their villages A the bow; B the stern; those are from 20 to 40 feet in length and from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 feet in the beam and about 2 feet deep; this canoe is common to all the nations below the grand Rapids it [is] here made deeper and shorter in pertotion [proportion] than the canoe realy is, the bowsprit from C. to D. is brought to a sharp edge tapering gradually from the sides. This is the most common form of the canoe in use among the indians from the Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw inclusive to the Ocian and is commonly from about 30 to 35 feet long, and will carry from 10 to 12 persons. 4 men are competent to carry them a considerable distance say a mile without resting. A is the end the nativs use as the bow, but which on first sight I took to be the stern c. d. is a comb cut of the solid wood with the canoe, and projects from the center of the end of the canoe being about 1 inch thick, it's sides parallel and edge at c. d. sharp it is from 9 to 11 inches in debth and extends from the under part of the bowsprit at A to the bottom at d,. the stern B is nearly rounding and gradually assending. 1,2,3, represents the rim of the gunnals about 4 inches wide, reather ascending as they recede from the canoe, 4,5,6,7,8, are the holes through which the string pass to fasten the round pieces which pass crosswise the canoe to strengthen &amp; lift her. This form of a canoe we did not meet with untill we reached the tide water or below the Great Rapids. from thence down it is common to all the nations but more particularly the Kilamox and others of the coast. these are the largest Canoes, I measured one at the Kilamox village S S W of us which was [blank space in MS.] feet long &amp; [blank space in MS.] feet wide and [blank space in MS.] feet deep, and they are most commonly about that size. B. is the bow, and comb. C, the stern and comb. Their images are representations of a great variety of grotesque figures, any of which might be safely worshiped without commiting a breach of the commandments. They have but fiew axes among them, and the only tool usially employd in forming the canoe, carving &amp;c. is a chissel formed of an old file about an inch or 1 1/2 inchs broad, this chissel has sometimes a large block of wood for a handle; they grasp the chissel just below the block with the right hand holding the top of the block, and strikes backwards against the wood with the edge of the chissel. a person would suppose that forming a large canoe with an instrument like this was the work of several years; but those people make them in a fiew weeks. They prize their Canoes very highly; we have been anxious to obtain some of them, for our journey up the river but have not been able to obtain one as yet from the nativs in this neighbourhood. Today we opened and examined all our ammunition, which has been secured in leaden canistirs. we found twenty sevin of the best Rifle powder, 4 of common rifle, 3 of Glaize and one of Musquet powder in good order, perfectly as dry as when first put in the canisters, altho the whole of it from various accidince have been for hours under the water. these cannisters contain 4 pounds of powder each and 8 of Lead. had it not been for that happy expedient which Capt. Lewis devised of securing the powder by means of the Lead, we should have found great dificuelty in keeping dry powder untill this time; those cannisters which had been accidently brused and cracked, one which was carelessly stopped, and a fifth which had been penetrated with a nail; were wet and damaged; those we gave to the men to dry; however exclusive of those 5 we have an abundant stock to last us back; and we always take care to put a purpotion of it in each canoe, to the end that should one canoe or more be lost we should still not be entirely bereft of ammunition, which is now our only hopes for subsistance and defence in the rout of 4,000 miles through a country exclusively inhabited by Indians—many bands of which are Savage in every sense of the word. [Lewis:] Sunday February 2ed. 1806. Not any occurrence today worthy of notice; but all are pleased, that one month of the time which binds us to Fort Clatsop and which seperates us from our friends has now elapsed. one of the games of amusement and wrisk of the Indians of this neighbourhood like that of the Sosones consists in hiding in the hand some small article about the size of a bean; this they throw from one hand to the other with great dexterity accompanying their opperations with a particular song which seems to have been addapted to the game; when the individu[al] who holds the peice has amused himself sufficiently by exchanging it from one hand to the other, he hold out his hands for his compettitors to guess which hand contains the peice; if they hit on the ha[n]d which contains the peice they win the wager otherwise loose. the individual who holds the peice is a kind of banker and plays for a time being against all the others in the room; when he has lost all the property which he has to venture, or thinks proper at any time, he transfers the peice to some other who then also becoms banker. The Sosone and Minnetares &amp;c have a game of a singular kind but those divide themselves in two parties and play for a common wager to which each individual contributes to form the stock of his party. one of them holdes the peice and some one of the opposite party gesses which hand contains if he hits on the ha[n]d which contains it the peice is transferred to the opposite party and the victor counts one, if he misses the party still retain the peice and score one but the individual tran[s]fers the peice to some other of his own party; the game is set to any number they think proper, and like the natives of this quarter they always accompany their opperations with a particular song. the natives here have also another game which consists in bowling some small round peices about the size of Bacgammon men, between two small upright sticks placed a few inches asunder, but the principals of the game I have not learn[ed] not understanding their language sufficiently to obtain an explanation. their boys amuse themselves with their bows and arrows as those do of every Indian nation with which I am acquainted. these people are excessively fond of their games of risk and bet freely every species of property of which they are possessed. they have a smal dog which the[y] make usefull only in hunting the Elk. [Clark:] Sunday February 2nd. 1806. Not any occurrence to day worthy of notice; but all are pleased, that one month of the time which binds us to fort Clatsop, and which seperates us from our friends, has now alapsed. The games of amusements of the natives of the neighbourhood are Several, one of which is verry similar to one which the Sosone's &amp; Minnatare's are verry fond of and frequently play. they divide themselves into two parties and play for a common wager to which each individual contributes to form the stock of his party, one of them holdes the piece which is usually about the Size of a Bean, and some one of the oposit party gesses which hand contains, if he hits on the hand which contains it, the piece is transfered to the opposite party and the victor counts one, if he misses the party still retains the piece and scores one, but the individual transfers the piece to some one of his own party; the game is set to any number they think proper. they always accompany their opperations with a particular song. The amusements of the boys of all nations which I am acquainted with are generally the Bows and arrows. All nations of Indians with which I am acquainted are excessive fond of their games of risk, and bet away [every] species of property of which they are possessed. The nativs of this neighbourhood have a small Dog which they make usefull only in hunting the Elk. [Lewis:] Monday February 3rd. 1806. About three o'clock Drewyer [and] La Page, returned; Drewyer had killed seven Elk in the point below us, several miles distant but can be approached with in 3/4 of a mile with canoes by means of a small creek which discharges itself into the bay on this side of the Clatsop village direct Sergt. pryor to go in quest of the meat, the wind was so high that they were unable to set out untill a little before sunset, when they departed; at 10 P. M. they return excessively could and informed us that they could not make land on this side of the bay nor get into the creek in consequence of the tide being out and much lower than usual. we are apprehensive that the Clatsops who know where the meat is will rob us of a part if not the whole of it. at half after 4. P. M. Sergt. Gass returned with his party, they brought with them the flesh of four other Elk which the hunters had found, being a part of the ten which were killed up the Netul river the other day. he left R. Fields, Shannon and Labuish to continue the hunt and made an appointment to return to them on Friday. late in the evening the four men who had been sent to assist the salt-makers in transporting meat which they had killed to their camp, also returned, and brought with them all the salt which had been made, consisting of about one busshel only. with the means we have of boiling the salt water we find it a very tedious opperation, that of making salt, notwithstanding we keep the kettles boiling day and night. we calculate on three bushels lasting us from hence to our deposits of that article on the Missouri. [Clark:] Monday February 3rd 1806 About 3 oclock Drewyer &amp; LaPage returned. Drewyer had killed seven Elk in the point below us several miles distant, but can be approached within 3/4 of a mile with Canoes by means of a small Creak which discharges itself into the Bay, on this Sid[e] of the Clatsop Village. Directed Serjt. Pryor to go in quest of the meat, the winds was so high that they were unable to set out untill a little before sunset, when they departed; at 10 P. M. they returned excessively cold and informed us that they could not make land on this side of the bay or get into the creek in consequence of the tides being out and much lower than usial. we are apprehensive that the Clatsops knowing where the meat is, will rob us of a part if not the whole of it. at half after 4 P. M. Sergt. Gass returned with his party they brought with them the flesh of 4 other Elk which the hunters had found, being part of the 10 which were killed up the Netul river the other day. He left Ro. Field, Shannon &amp; Labiesh to continue the hunt, and made an appointment to return to them on friday. late in the evening the four men who had been sent to assist the saltmakers in transporting meat which they had killed to their camp also returned, and brought with them all the salt which had been made, consisting of about one bushel only. with the means we have of boiling the salt water we find it a very tegious opperation that of makeing salt, notwithstanding the kittles are kept boiling day and night, we calculate on three bushels lasting us from here to our deposit of that article on the Missouri. [Lewis:] Tuesday February 4th. 1806. Sergt. Pryor with a party of five men set out again in quest of the Elk which Drewyer had killed. Drewyer and La Page also returned to continue the chase in the same quarter. the Elk are in much better order in the point near the praries than they are in the woody country arround us or up the Netul. in the praries they feed on grass and rushes, considerable quantities of which are yet green and succule[n]t. in the woody country their food is huckle berry bushes, fern, and an evergreen shrub which resembles the lorel in some measure; the last constitutes the greater part of their food and grows abundantly through all the timbered country, particularly the hillsides and more broken parts of it.1 1 The sallal or shallun (Gaultheria shallon).—C. V. Piper. There are s[e]veral species of fir in this neighbourhood which I shall discribe as well as my slender botanicall skil wil enable me and for the convenience of comparison with each other shal number them. (N°. 1.) a species which grows to immence size; very commonly 27 feet in the girth six feet above the surface of the earth, and in several instances we have found them as much as 36 feet in the girth or 12 feet diameter perfectly solid and entire. they frequently rise to the hight of 230 feet, and one hundred and twenty or 30 of that hight without a limb. this timber is white and soft throughout and rives better than any other species which we have tryed. the bark shales off in irregula[r] rounded flakes and is of a redish brown colour particularly of the younger growth. the stem of this tree is simple branching, ascending, not very defuse, and proliferous. the leaf of this tree is acerose, 1/10th. of an Inh in width, and 3/4 of an Inch in length; is firm, stif and accuminate; they are triangular, a little declining, thickly scattered on all sides of the bough, but rispect the three uppersides only and are also sessile growing from little triangular pedestals of soft spungy elastic bark, at the junction of the boughs, the bud-scales continued to incircle their rispective twigs for several yea[r]s; at least three yea[r]s is common and I have counted as many as the growth of four years beyond these scales. this tree affords but little rosin. it's cone I have not yet had an opportunity to discover altho' I have sought it frequently; the trees of this kind which we have felled have had no cones on them.2 2 Picca sitchensis, not Abies nobilis as conjectured by Coues (L. and C. iii, p. 829). —C. V. Piper. February 4th. 1806. Observed Meridian Altitude of ?'s U. L. with Sextant by the direct observation 55.° 59.′ 15.″ Latitude deduced from this observation N. 46.° 10.′ 16.3″ By the mean of several observations found the error of the Sextant to be Subtractive —.° 5.′ 45.″ [Clark:] Tuesday February 4th 1806 Sergt. Pryor with a party of 5 men set out again in quest of the Elk which Drewyer had killed. Drewyer also returned to continue the chase in the same quarter. the Elk are in much better order in the point near the praries than they are in the woodey country around us or up the Netul. in the praries they feed on grass and rushes, which are yet green. in the woddey countrey their food is huckleberry bushes, fern, and the Shallon an evergreen shrub, which resembles the Lorel in some measure; the last constitutes the greater part of their food and grows abundant through all the timbered country, particularly the hill sides and more broken parts of it. There are several species of Fir in this neighbourhood which I shall describe as well as my botanicale skill will will enable me, and for the convenience of comparison with each other shall number them. (N°.1,) a species which grows to an emence size; verry commonly 27 feet in surcumferonce at 6 feet above the surface of the earth, and in several instances we have found them as much a[s] 36 feet in the girth, or 12 feet Diameter perfectly solid &amp; entire. they frequently rise to the hight of 230 feet; and 120 or 130 of that hight without a limb. this timber is white and soft throughout and rives better than any other species we have tried the bark shales off in aregular rounded flakes and is of a redish brown colour, particularly of the younger growth, the stem of this tree is simple branching, assending, not very defuse, and proliferous, the leaf of this tree is accerose 1/2 a line in width, and 3/4 of an inch in length; is firm stiff and accuminate; they are triangular little declineing, thickly scattered on all sides of the Bough, but respect the three upper sides only Growing from little triangular pedistals of soft spungy elastic bark. at the junction of these bough's, the bud-scales continue to incircle the respective twigs for several years; at least 3 years is common and I have counted as maney as the growth of 4 years beyond these scales. this tree affords but little rozin. it's cone I have not yet had an opportunity to discover altho' I have sought it frequently; the trees of this kind which we have fell'd have had no cones on them. [Lewis:] Wednesday February 5th. 1806. Late this evening one of the hunters fired his gun over the swamp of the Netul opposite to the fort and hooped. I sent sergt. Gass and a party of men over; the tide being in, they took advantage of a little creek which makes up in that direction nearly to the highlands, and in their way fortunately recovered our Indian Canoe, so long lost and much lamented. The Hunter proved to be Reubin Fields, who reported that he had killed six Elk on the East side of the Netul a little above us; and that yesterday he had heard Shannon and Labuishe fire six or seven shots after he had seperated from them and supposed that they had also killed several other Elk. Filds brought with him a phesant which differed but little from those common to the Atlantic States; it's brown is reather brighter and more of a redish tint. it has eighteen feathers in the tale of about six inches in length. this bird is also booted as low as the toes. the two tufts of long black feathers on each side of the neck most conspicuous in the male of those of the Atlantic states is also observable in every particular with this. Fir N°. 2 is next in dignity in point of size.1 1 Tsuga mertensiana, Carr (T. heterophylla, Raf.).—C. V. Piper. it is much the most common species, it may be sa[i]d to constitute at least one half of the timber in this neighbourhood. it appears to be of the spruse kind. it rises to the hight of 160 to 180 feet very commonly and is from 4 to 6 feet in diameter, very streight round and regularly tapering. the bark is thin of a dark colour, and much divided with small longitudinal intersticies; that of the boughs and young trees is somewhat smoth but not so much so as the balsom fir nor that of the white pine of our country. the wood is white throughout and reather soft but very tough, and difficult to rive. The trunk of this tree is a simple branching diffused stem and not proliferous as the pines &amp; firs usially are but like most other trees it puts forth buds from the sides of the small boughs as well as their extremities. the stem usually terminates in a very slender pointed top like the cedar. The leaves are petiolate, the footstalk small short and oppressed; acerose reather more than half a line in width and very unequal in length, the greatest length being little more than half an inch, while others intermixed on every part of the bough are not more than a 1/4 in length. flat with a small longitudinal channel in the upper disk which is of a deep green and glossey, while the u[n]der disk is of a whiteish green only; two ranked, obtusely pointed, soft and flexable. this tree affords but little rosin. the cone is remarkably small not larger than the end of a man's thumb soft, flexable and of an ovate form, produced at the ends of the small twigs. [Clark:] Wednesday February 5th 1806 Late this evening one of the hunters fired off his gun over the marsh of the Netul opposit to the fort &amp; hhoped [whooped]. we sent Sergt. Gass and a party of men over; the tide being in they took advantage of a little creek which makes up in that direction nearly to the high lands, and in their way fortunately recovered our Indian canoe so long lost and much lamented. The hunter provd, to be Reubin Field, who reported that he had killed six Elk on the East side of the Netul a little above us; and that he had parted with Shannon and Labiesh yesterday after he had herd them fire six or seven shot after he had seperated from them, and supposed that they had also killed several other Elk. Fields brought with him a Pheasant which differs but little from those common to the United States. Fur N°. 2. is next in dignity in point of size. it is much the most common species, it may be said to constitute one half of the timber of this neighbourhood. it appears to be of the spruce kind. it rises to the higth of 160 or 180 feet very commonly and is from 4 to 6 feet in diameter, very streight round and regularly tapering. the bark is thin of a dark colour, and much divided with small longitudinal interstices; that of the boughs and young trees are somewhat smoth but not so much so as the balsom fir, nor that of the white pine of our countrey. the wood is white throughout and rather soft but rather tough and dificuelt to rive. The trunk of this tree is simple branching, diffused stem and not proliferous as the pine and fir usially are, but like most other trees it puts fo[r]th buds from the sides of the small boughes as well as from their extremities. the stem usially terminate in a very slender pointed top like the Cedar. The leaves are petiolate, the footstalk small short and oppressed, acerose, reather more than 1/2 a line in width and very uneaqual in length, the greatest length being a little more than half an inch, while others intermixed on every part of the bough are not more than a 1/4 of an inch in length. flat with a small longitudinal channel in the upper disk which is of a Deep green and glossy, while the under disk is of a whitish green only; two ranked, obtusely pointed, soft and flexable. this tree affords but little rosin. the Cone is remarkably small, not larger than the end of a mans thumb soft, flexable and of an oval form, produced at the end of a small twig. [Lewis:] Thursday February 6th. 1806. Sent Sergts. Gass and Ordway this morning with R. Fields and a party of men to bring in the Elk which Fields had killed. Late in the evening Sergt. Pryor returned with the flesh of about 2 Elk and 4 skins the Indians having purloined the ballance of seven Elk which Drewyer killed the other day. I find that there are 2 vilages of Indians living on the N. side of the Columbia near the Marshey Islands who call themselves Wâch-kí-a-cum. these I have her[e]tofore Considered as Cath-lâh-mâhs. they speak the same language and are the same in every other rispect. N°. 3. A species of fir which one of my men informs me is precisely the same with that called the balsam fir of Canada.1 1 Abies grandis, the great white fir, not Thuya gigantea as identified by Coues.— C. V. Piper. it grows here to considerable size, being from 2 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter and rises to the hight of eighty or an hundred feet. it 's stem is simple branching, ascending and proliferous. it's leaves are sessile, acerose, one 1/8 of an inch in length and 1/16th. of an inch in width, thickly scattered on all sides of the twigs as far as the growth of four preceeding years and rispect the three undersides only the upper side being neglected and the under side but thinly furnished; gibbous, a little declining, obtusely pointed, soft flexible, and the upper disk longitudinally marked with a slight channel; this disk is of a glossy deep green, the under one green tho' paler and not glossy. this tree affords considerable quantities of a fine clear arromatic balsam in appearance and taste like the Canadian balsam. smal pustules filled with this balsam rise with a blister like appearance on the body of the tree and it's branches; the bark which covers these pustules is soft thin smoth and easily punctured. the bark of the tree generally is thin of a dark brown colour and reather smooth tho' not as much so as the white pine of our count[r]y. the wood is white and soft. (N°. 4) is a species of fir which in point of size is much that of N°. 2. the stem simple branching ascending and proliferous; the bark of a redish dark brown and thicker than that of N°. 3. it is divided with small longitudinal interstices, but these are not so much ramifyed as in species N°. 2. the leaves with rispect to their position in regard to each other is the same with the balsam fir, as is the leaf in every other rispect except that it not more than 2/3ds. the width and little more than half the length of the other, nor is it's upper disk of so deep a green nor so glossey. it affords no balsam and but little rosin. the wood also white soft and reather porus tho' tough.1 1 The fourth species is probably Tsuga mertensiana, the same as No. 1. Certainly it is not Abies grandis, as Coues has indicated.—C. V. Piper. N°. 5. is a species of fir which arrives to the size of N°.'s. 2 and 4, the stem simple branching, diffuse and proliferous. the bark thin, dark brown, much divided with small longitudinal interstices and sometimes scaleing off in thin rolling flakes. it affords but little rosin and the wood is redish white [2/3ds. of the diameter in the center, the ballance white,] somewhat porus and tough. the twigs are much longer and more slender than in either of the other species. the leaves [are acerose], 1/20th. of an inch in width, and an inch in length, sessile, inserted on all sides of the bough, streight, their extremities pointing obliquely toward the extremities of the bough and more thickly placed than in either of the other species; gibbous and flexable but more stif than any except N°. 1. and more blontly pointed than either of the other species; the upper disk has a small longitudinal channel and is of a deep green tho' not so glossy as the balsam fir, the under disk is of a pale green.1 1 Pseudotsuga taxifolia.—C. V. Piper. N°. 6 the white pine; or what is usually so called in Virginia. I see no difference between this and that of the mountains in Virginia; unless it be the uncommon length of cone of this found here, which are sometimes 16 or 18 inches in length and about 4 inches in circumpherence. I do not recollect those of virginia perfectly but it strikes me that they are not so long. this species is not common I have only seen it but in one instance since I have been in this neighbourhood which was on the border of Haley's bay on the N. side of the Columbia near the Ocean.2 2 Pinus monticola, not Pinus Lambertina.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Thursday February 6th. 1806 Sent Sergts Gass and party this morning with Ru Field to bring in the Elk which Field had killed. late in the evening Serjt. Pryor returned with the fl[e]sh of about 2 Elk and four skins the Indians haveing taken the ballance of seven Elk which Drewyer killed the other day. I find that those people will all steal. N°. 3 a species of fir, which one of my men inform me is presisely the same with that called the balsam fir of Canada. it grows here to considerable size, being from 2 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter and rises to the hight of 100 or 120 feet. it's stem is simple branching assending and proliferous. it's leaves are cessile, acerose, 1/8 of an inch in length and 1/l6 of an inch in width, thickly scattered on all sides of the twigs as far as the groth of four proceeding years, and respects the three undersides only, the upper side being neglected and the under side but thinly furnished; gibbous a little declineing, obtusely pointed, soft flexable, and the upper disk longitudinally marked with a slight channel; this disk is of a glossy deep green, the under one green tho paler and not glossy. this tree affords a considerable quantity of a fine clear arromatic Balsom in appearance and taste like the Canadian balsom, small pustuls filled with the balsom rise with a blister like appearance on the body of the tree and its branches; the bark which covers these pustules is soft thin smoth and easily punctured. the bark of the [tree] is generally thin of a dark brown colour and reather smooth tho' not as much so as the white pine of the U. States the wood is white and soft. N°. 4 a species of fir which in point of size is much that of N°. 2. the stem simple branching assending and proliferous; the bark of a redish dark brown and thicker than that of N°. 3. it is divided with small longitudinal interstices, but these are not so much ramefied as in the species N°. 2. the leaves with respect to their possition in reguard to each other is the same with the balsam fir, as is the leaf in every other respect than that, it is not more than 2/3ds. the width and little more than half the length of the other, nor is it's upper disk of so deep a green nor glossy. it affords no balsam, and but little rosin. the wood also white soft and reather porus tho' tough. N°. 5. is a species of fir which arives to the size of N°. 2, and N°. 4. the stem simple branching, diffuse and proliferous. the bark thin dark brown, much divided with small longitudinal interstices scaleing off in thin rolling flakes. it affords but little rosin and the wood is redish white 2/3ds. of the diamieter in the center the ballance white somewhat porus and tough. the twigs are much longer and more slender than in either of the other species. the leaves are acerous 1/20 of an inch in width, and an inch in length, sessile, inserted on all sides of the bough, streight, their extremities pointing obliquely towards the extremities of the bough and more thickly placed than in either of the other species; gibbous and flexable but more stiff than any except N°. 1 and more blontly pointed than either of the other species; the upper disk has a small longitudinal channel and is of a deep green tho' not so Glossy as the balsam fir, the under disk is of a pail green. N°. 6 the white pine; or what is usially so called in Virginia. I see no difference between this and that of the mountains in Virginia; unless it be the uncommon length of the cone of this found here, which are sometimes 16 or 18 inches in length, and about 4 inches in surcumfrance. I do not recollect those of Virginia, but it strikes me that they are not so long. this species is not common I have seen it only in three instances since I have been in this neighbourhood, I saw a few on Haleys bay on the North side of the Columbia River, a fiew scattering on the sea coast to the North on one of which I engraved my name, and some on the S S E side of Ecola Creek near the Kilâmox nation, at which place I saw the white &amp; red cedar. [Lewis:] Friday February 7th. 1806. This evening Sergt. Ordway and Wiser returned with a part of the meat which R. Fields had killed; the ballance of the party with Sergt. Gass remained in order to bring the ballance of the meat to the river at a point agreed on where the canoe is to meat them again tomorrow morning. This evening we had what I call an excellent supper it consisted of a marrowbone a piece and a brisket of boiled Elk that had the appearance of a little fat on it. this for Fort Clatsop is living in high stile. In this neighbourhood I observe the honeysuckle common in our country I first met with it on the waters of the Kooskooske near the Chopunnish nation, and again below the grand rappids In the Columbian Valley on tide-water.1 1 Undoubtedly Lonicera ciliosa, Poir., described as Caprifolium ciliosum by Pursh from specimens collected by Lewis on the Kooskooske. The plant is common west of the Cascades and in western Idaho.—C. V. Piper. The Elder also common to our country grows in great abundance in the rich woodlands on this side of the rocky Mountains; tho' it differs here in the colour of it's berry, this being of a pale sky blue while that of the U' States is a deep perple. The seven bark or nine bark as it is called in the U'States is also common in this quarter.2 2 The elder here mentioned is Sambucus glaucus, Nutt., the common species in the East being S. canadensis. There is another elder on the Pacific coast (S. leiosperma, Leit.); this is probably the one referred to in the "weather diary" for March 25, 1806. The "seven bark" is very probably Physocarpus opulifolius, Maxim., and not Spiræa douglasi (Coues, L. and C., iii, 835). Lewis refers to it again, Mar. 27 and Apr. 30. The latter was along the Touchet River, while June 6 and 10 it is noted at Camp Chopunnish and Weippe Prairie. In all of these places Physocarpus grows, and not Spiœa douglasi—though a similar spiræa (S. menziesii) occurs at Weippe. Physocarpus opulifolius is the only species west of the Cascades, but in eastern Washington and northern Idaho occurs another species as well (P. parvifolius, Nutt. = Opulaster malvaceus, Greene).—C. V. Piper. There is a species of huckleberry common to the piny lands from the commencement of the Columbian valley to the seacoast; it rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet. is a simple branching somewhat defuse stem; the main body or trunk is cilindric and of a dark brown, while the colateral branches are green smooth, squar, and put forth a number of alternate branches of the same colour and form from the two horizontal sides only. the fruit is a small deep perple berry which the natives inform us is very good. the leaf is thin of a pale green and small being 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8 in width; oval terminateing more accutely at the apex than near the insertion of the footstalk which is at the base; [veined, nearly] entire, serrate but so slightly so that it is scarcely perceptible; footstalk short and there position with rispect to each other is alternate and two ranked, proceeding from the horizontal sides of the bough only.1 1 Vaccinium membranaceum, Dougl. The berries of this are gathered in large quantities by the Indians east of the Cascade mountains.—C. V. Piper. The small pox has distroyed a great number of the natives in this quarter. it prevailed about 4 years since among the Clatsops and destroy[ed] several hundred of them, four of their chiefs fell victyms to it's ravages. those Clatsops are deposited in their canoes on the bay a few miles below us. I think the late ravages of the small pox may well account for the number of remains of vilages which we find deserted on the river and Sea coast in this quarter. [Clark:] Friday February 7th. 1806 This evening Serjt. Ordway and Wiser returned with a part of the meat which R. Field had killed; the balance of the Party with Serjt. Gass remained in order to bring the ballance of the meat to the river at a point agreed on, where the canoe is to meet them again tomorrow morning. This evening we had what I call an excellent supper it consisted of a marrowbone, a piece of brisket of boiled Elk that had the appearance of a little fat on it. this for Fort Clatsop is liveing in high stile, and in fact fiesting. In this neighbourhood I observe the honeysuckle common in the U States, I first met with it on the waters of the Kooskooske near the Chopunnish Nation, and again below the grand rapids in the Columbian Vally on tide water. The Elder also common to our countrey grows in great abundance in the rich woodland on this side of the rocky mountains, tho it differs here in the colour of its berry, this being of a pale sky blue while that of the U. States is a deep purple. The seven or nine bark as it is called in the U. States is also common in this quarter. There is a species of huckkleberry common to the piney lands from the commencement of the Columbian Vally to the sea coast; it rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet, is a simple branching, somewhat defused stem; the main body or trunk is cilindric branches are green smothe squar, and put forth a number of alternet branches of the same colour and form from the two horizontal sides only. the frute is a small deep purple berry which the nativs inform us is very good, the leaf is thin of a pale green and small being 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8 in width; oval terminating more accoutely at the apex, than near the insersion of the footstalk which is at the base vened nearly entire; footstalks short and their position in respect to each other is alternate and too ranked, proceeding from the horizontal side of the bough only. The Small pox had distroyed a great number of the nativs in this quarter. it provailed about 4 or 5 yrs. sin[c]e among the Clatsops, and distroy'd several hundreds of them, four of their Chiefs fell a victym to it's ravages. these Clatsops are Deposited in their canoes on the bay a fiew miles below us. I think the late ravages of the small pox, may well account for the number of remains of Villages which I saw on my rout to the Kilamox in several places. [Lewis:] Saturday February 8th. 1806. Sent Sergt. Ordway and two men this morning to join the party with Sergt. Gass and bring the ballance of R. Field's Elk. in the evening they returned with the ballance of the flesh of five Elk, that of one of them having become tainted and unfit for uce. late in the evening Sergt. Pryor returned with Shannon Labuish and his party down the Netul. they brought with them the flesh of 4 Elk which those two hunters had killed. we have both dined and suped on Elk's tongues and marrow bones. I have discovered that the shrub and fruit discribed on the 26th of January is not that which the Indians call the Shal-lon, but that is such as is there discribed, and the berry is estemed and used by the natives as there mentioned except that [it] is not like the shallon, baked in large loaves, but is simply dryed in the sun for winter uce, when they either eat them in thir dryed state or boil them in water. The Shallon is the production of a shrub which I have heretofore taken to be a speceis of loral and mentioned as abounding in this neighbourhood and that the Elk fed much on it's leaves.1 1 Gualtheria shallon.—Ed. it generally rises to the hight of 3 feet but not unusually attains to that of 5 feet. it grows very thick and is from the size of a goos quill to that of a man's thumb, celindric, the bark of the older or larger part of the stock is of a redish brown colour while that of the younger branches and succulent shoots are red where most exposed to the sun and green elsewhere. the stem is simple branching reclining, and partially fluxouse [flexuous], or at least the smaler stocks or such parts of them and the boughs as produce the leaves, take a different direction at the insertion of every petiole. the leaf is oval four &amp; 3/4 inches in length and 2 1/2 in width. petiolate, the petiole short only 3/8th. of an inch in length, celindric with a slight channel on it's upper side where it is generally red; undivided or entire, slightly serrate, the apex termineating in an accute point; the upper disk of a glossey deep green, the under disk of a pale green; veined. the leaves are also alternate and two ranked. the root is horizontal puting forth perpendicular radicles. this shrub is an evergreen. the fruit is a deep perple berry about the size of a buck short or common black cherry, of an ovate form tho reather more bluntly pointed, than at the insertion of the peduncle; at this extremity, the thin coloured membranous pellicle, which forms the surface of the pericarp, is divided into five accute angular points, which meet in the center, and contains a soft pulp of the same colour invelloping a great number of small brown kidney formed seeds. each berry is supported by a seperate celindric peduncle of half an inch in length; these to the number of ten or twelve issue from a common peduncle or footstalk which is fuxouse [flexuous] and forms the termination of the twig of the present years growth; each peduncle supporting a berry is furnished with one oblong bracte placed at it's insertion on the common foot-[stalk] which when the fruit is ripe withers with the peduncle. [Clark:] Saturday February 8th. 1806 Sent Serjt. Ordway and two men this morning to joint the party with Serjt. Gass, and bring the ballance of R. Field's Elk. in the evening they returned with the ballance of the flesh of five Elk, that of one of them having become tainted and unfit for use. late in the evening Serjt. Pryor returned with Shannon Labieshe and his party down the Netul. they brought with them the flesh of 4 Elk which those two hunters had killed. we have both Dined and suped on Elks tongues and marrowbones, a great Luxury for Fort Clatsop. The Shallon is a production of shrub which I have taken heretofore to be a species of Loral and mentioned as abounding in this neighbourhood, and that the Elk feed much on its leaves, it generally rises to the hight of 3 feet, and not unusially attain to that of 5 feet, it grows very thick and is from the size of that of a goose quil to that of a mans thumb, celendric. the bark of the older or larger part of the stalk is of a redish brown colour whilst that of the younger branches &amp; succulent shoots are red when most exposed to the Sun and green elsewhere. the stem is simple branching, reclineing and partially f[l]uxouse, or at least the smaller stalks or such parts of them and their boughs which produce the leaves, take a different direction at the insertion of every petiole. A, A, the leaves as they grow from the stalk B.B.B the stalk between each leaf. The leaf is oval 4 and 3/4 inches in length, and 2 and a half in width. petiolate, the potiale short only 3/8 of an inch in length cilindric with a slight channel on Its upper side where it is generally red; undevided, or entire, slightly serrate, the apex termonating in an accute point; the upper disk of a glossy green, the under disk of a pail green, veined, the leaves are also alternate and two ranked. the root is horozontal, putting fo[r]th pirpendicular radicles. This shrub is an evergreen. the frute is a deep purple berry about the size of a buck shot or common black cherry, of an ovale form, thô reather more bluntly pointed than at the insertion of the peduncle, at the extremity, the thin coloured membranus pellicle, which forms the surfice of the paricarp, is divided into 4 angu [l]ar points, which meet at the center, and contains a soft pulp of the same colour invelloping a great number of small brown kidney formed seeds, each berry is supported by a seperate celindric peduncle of half an inch in length, these to the number of 10 or 12 issue from a common peduncle of [or] footstalk which forms the termination of the twig of the present years groth; each peduncle supporting a berry is furnished with one oblong bracte placed at It's insertion on the common footstalk, which when the frute is ripe withers with the peduncle. [Lewis:] Sunday February 9th. 1806. This morning Collins and Wiser set out on a hunting excurtion; the[y] took our Indian canoe and passed the NetuI a little above us. In the evening Drewyer returned; had killed nothing but one beaver. he saw one black bear, which is the only one which has been seen in this neighbourhood since our arrival; the Indians inform us that they are abundant but are now in their holes. in the marshey ground frequently overflown by the tides there grows a species of fir which I take to be the same N°. 5. which it resembles in every particular except that it is more defusely branched and not so large, being seldom more than 30 feet high and 18 inches or 2 feet in diameter; it's being more defusely branched may proceed from it's open situation seldom growing very close. the cone is 2 1/2 Inches in length and 3 3/4 in it's greatest circumference, which is near it's base, and from which it tapers regularly to a point. it is formed of imbricated scales of a bluntly rounded form, thin not very firm and smoth. a thin leaf is inserted into the pith of the cone, which overlays the center of and extends 1/2 an inch beyond the point of each scale. the form of this leaf is somewhat thus. over laying one of the imbricated scales.1 1 Probably the same as No. 5, Pseudotsuga taxifolia.—Ed. The stem of the black alder of this country before mentioned as arriving to great size, is simply branching and defuse. the bark is smooth of a light colour with wh[i]te coloured spreading spots or blotches, resembling much that of the beech. the leaf fructification &amp;c is precisely that of the common alder of our country. these trees grow seperately from different roots and not in clusters or clumps as those of the Atlantic states.2 2 Alnus oregana, Nutt. This is the same as Alnus rubra, Bong.—an untenable name. This is the only alder on the lower Columbia.—C. V. Piper. fearing that our meat would spoil we set six men to jurking it. [Clark:] Sunday February 9th 1806 This morning Collins and Wiser set out on a hunting excurtion; in the evening Drewyer returned; had Killed nothing but one Beaver. he saw one black Bear, which is the only one which has been seen in the neighbourhood since our arrival. the Indians inform us that they are abundant but are now in their holes. In the marshey grounds frequently overflown by the tides there grows a species of fir which I took to be the same of N°. 5. from examonation I find it a distinct species of fir. it is more perfusely branched. This tree seldom rises to a greater hight than 35 or 40 feet and is from 2 to 4 feet in Diamieter; the Bark the same with that of N°. 1. only reather more rugid. the leaf is acerose, 2/10 of an inch in width and 3/4 in length, they are firm stiff and somewhat accuminated, ending in a short pointed hard tendril, gibbous thickly scattered on all sides of the bough as respects the 3 upper sides only; those which have their insertion on the under side incline sidewise with their points upwards giveing the leaf the shape of a sythe. the others are perpindicular or pointing upwards, growing as in N°. 1. from small triangular pedestals of a soft spungy elastic bark. the under disk of these leaves or that which grows nearest to the Base of the bough is of a dark glossy green, while the upper or opposit side is of a whitish pale green; in this respect differing from almost all leaves. The boughs retain their leaves as far back as almost to the sixth year's groth. the peculiarity of the budscales observed in N°. 1. is obsd in this species. The cone is 3 1/2 Inches in length, and 3 in circumfrance, of an ovale figure being thickest in the middle and tapering and terminateing in two obtuce points. it composes several flexable, thin, obtusely pointed smoth and redish brown imbricated scales. each scale covering two small winged seed and being itself covered in the center by a small thin inferior scale accutely pointed. The Cone is some what of this figure. they proceed from the sides as well as the extremities of the bough, but in the former case allways at or near the commencement of some one years groth which in some instances are as far back as the third year. The stem of the Black Alder of this country before mentioned as ariveing at great size, is simple branching and defuse, the bark is smoth of a light colour with white coloured spredding spots or blotches, resembling much that of beech. the leaf is procisely that of the common alder of the United States or Virginia. those trees grow seperately from different roots and not in clusters or clumps, as those of the atlantic States, casts its foliage about the Ist of December. Fearing that our meat would spoil we set six men to jurking it today which they are obliged to perform in a house under shelter from the repeated rains. [Lewis:] Monday February 10th. 1806. Drewyer visited his traps today but caught no beaver. Collins and Wiser returned had killed no Elk. Willard arrived late in the evening from the Saltworks, had cut his knee very badly with his tommahawk. he had killed four Elk not far from the Salt works the day before yesterday, which he had butch[er]ed and took a part of the meat to camp, but having cut his knee was unable to be longer ucefull at the works and had returned. he informed us that Bratton was very unwell, and that Gibson was so sick that he could not set up or walk alone and had desired him to ask us to have him brought to the Fort. Coalter also returned this evening. continue the operation of drying our meat. There is a tree common to the Columbia river below the entrance of cataract river which in it's appearance when divested of it's foliage, much resembles the white ash; the appearance of the wood and bark is also that of the ash. it's stem is simple branching and diffuse. the leaf is petiolate, plane, scattered, palmate lobate, divided by four deep sinuses; the lobes are repand, or terminate in from 3 to 5 accute angular points, while their margins are indented with irregular and somewhat circular incissures. the petiole is celendric smooth and 7 inches long. the leaf 8 inches in length and 12 in bredth. this tree is frequently 3 feet in diameter and rises to 40 or 50 feet high. the fruit is a winged seed somewhate like the maple. in the same part of the country there is also another growth which resembles the white maple in it's appearance, only that it is by no means so large; seldom being more than from 6 to 9 inches in diamater, and from 15 to 20 feet high; they frequently grow in clusters as if from the same bed of roots spreading and leaning outwards. the twigs are long and slender, the stems simple branching. the bark smooth and in colour resembling that of the white maple. the leaf is petiolate, plane, scattered nearly circular, with it's margin cut with accute angular incissures of an inch in length and from six to 8 in number the accute angular points formed by which incissures are crenate, or cut with small accute angular incissures. or in this form. it is three inches in length, and 4 in width. the petiole celindric smooth and one and a 1/4 inches long. the fruit or flower not known.1 1 These are both maples—Acer macrophyllum, and A. circinatum, respectively— C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Monday February 10th.. 1806 Collins and Wiser returned without killing any Elk. Willard arrived late this evening from the Salt Camp, he had cut his knee very badly with his tomahawk. he had killed four Elk not far from the Salt Camp, the day before yesterday, which he had butchered and took a part of the meat to the Camp, but haveing cut his Knee was unable to be longer servisable at the works &amp; had returned. he informed us that Bratten was very unwell, and that Gibson was so sick that he could not set up or walk alone, and had desired him to ask us to have him brought to the Fort. Colter also returnd. this evening, continue the opperation of dryin our meat. There is a tree common to the Columbia river below the enterance of cataract River which in it's appearance when divested of it's folage, much resembles the white ash; the appearance of the wood and bark is also that of the ash. it's stem is simple. branching and diffuse. the lief is petiolate, plane, scattered palmate lobate, divided by four deep sinusus; the lobes are repand or terminate in from 3 to 5 accute angular points, while their margins are indented with irregular and somewhat circular incissures. the petiole is celindric smoth and 7 inches long. the leaf 8 inches in length and 12 in bredth. this tree is frequently 2 &amp; 3 feet in diamieter, and rises to 50 or 60 feet high. the froot is a winged seed somewhat like the maple. In the same part of the country there is also another groth, which resembles the white maple in its appearance, only that it is by no means so large, seldom being more than from 6 to 9 inches in diamieter, and from 20 to 30 feet high; they frequently grow in clusters as if from the same bed or root, spreading or leaning outwards, the twigs are long and slender, the stems simple branching, the bark smoth and in colour resembles that of the white maple. the leaf is petiolate, plain, scattered nearly circular, with its margin cut with accute ang[u]lar incissures of an inch in length arid from 6 to 8 in number, the accute angular points formed, by which incissures, are crenate, or cut with small angular incissures or in this form it is 3 inches in length, and 4 in width, the petiole is cilendric smoth and 1 1/4 inches long. the froot or flour I have not as yet found out &amp;c [Lewis:] Tuesday February 11th. 1806. This morning Sergt. Gass Reubin Fields and Thompson passed the Netul opposite to us on a hunting expedition. sent Sergt. Pryor with a party of four men to bring Gibson to the fort. also sent Colter and Wiser to the Salt works to carry on the business with Joseph Fields; as Bratton had been sick we desired him to return to the Fort also if he thought proper; ho[we]ver in the event of his not coming Wiser was directed to return. There is a shrub which grows commonly in this neighbourhood which is precisely the same with that in Virginia sometimes called the quill-wood. also another which grows near the water in somewhat moist grounds &amp; rises to the hight of 5 or 6 feet with a large, peteolate spreading, plane, crenate and somewhat woolly leaf like the rose raspberry. it is much branched the bark of a redish brown colour and is covered with a number of short hooked thorns which renders it extreemly disagreeable to pass among; it dose no[t] cast it's foliage untill about the 1st of December.1 1 The first of these is probably the quillwood or mountain holly, described more at length by Lewis, Feb. 12. The second appears to be the raspberry, Rubus leucodermis or hesperius.—Ed. this is also the case with the black alder. The[re] is also found in this neighbourhood an evergreen shrub which I take to be another variety of the Shallun and that discribed under that name in mistake on the 26th. of January. this shrub rises to the hight of from four to five feet, the stem simple branching, defuse and much branched. the bark is of a redish dark brown, that of the mane stem is somewhat rough while that of the boughs is smooth. the leaves are petiolate the petiole 1/10 of an inch long; oblong, obtuse at the apex and accute angular at the insertion of the petiole; 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8th. in width; convex, somewhat revolute, serrate, smoth and of a paler green than the evergreens usually are. they are also opposite and ascending. the fruit is a small deep perple berry like the common huckleberry of a pleasent flavor. they are s[e]perately scattered &amp; attatched to the small boughs by short peduncles. the natives eat this berry when ripe but seldom collect it in such quantities as to dry it for winter uce. [Clark:] Tuesday February 11th.. 1806 This morning Serjt. Gass R. Field and J. Thompson passed the Netul opposit to us on a hunting expedition. Sent Serjeant Natl. Pryor with 4 men in a canoe to bring gibson to the Fort. also sent Colter &amp; P. Wiser to the salt works to carry on the business with Jos. Field; as bratton is also sick we directed that he should return to the fort if he continued unwell; There is Shrub which grows commonly in this neighbourhood which grows on the steep sides of the hills and also in low moist grounds, and rise to the hight of 5 or 6 feet with a large peteolate, spreading plain crenate and somewhat woolly leaf like the rose raspberry. it is much branched the bark of a redish brown colour and is covered with a number of short hooked thorns which renders it extreamly disagreeable to pass among, it does not cast its foliage untill about the 1st. of December. There is a Species of bryor which is common in this neighbourhood of a green colour which grows most abundant in the rich dry lands near the water courses, but is also found in small quantities in the piney lands at a distance from the water courses in the former situations the stem is frequently the size of a mans finger and rise perpendicularly to the hight of 4 or 5 feet when it descends in an arch and becomes procumbent or rests on some neighbouring plant or srubs; it is simple unbranched and celindric; in the latter situation it is much smaller, and usially procumbent. the stem is armed with sharp and hooked bryors. the leaf Is peteolate, ternate and resembles in shape and appearance that of the purple Raspberry common to the atlantic states. The frute is a berry resembling the Blackberry in every respect and is eaten when ripe and much esteemed by the nativs but is not dryed for winters consumption. in the Countrey about the enterance of the quick sand river I first discovered this bryor, it grows so abundantly in the fertile Vally of Columbia and on the Islands in that part of the river, that the Countrey near the river is almost impenistrable in maney places. This green Bryor retains its leaf or foliage and verdue untill late in December. The Briory bush with a wide leaf is also one of its ascosiates. [Lewis:] Wednesday February 12th. 1806. This morning we were visited by a Clatsop man who brought with him three dogs as a remuneration for the Elk which himself and nation had stolen from us some little time since, however the dogs took the alarm and ran off; we suffered him to remain in the fort all night. There are two species of ever green shrubs which I first met with at the grand rappids of the Columbia and which I have since found in this neighbourhood also; they grow in rich dry ground not far usually from some watercourse. the roots of both species are creeping and celindric. the stem of the 1st. is from a foot to 18 inches high and as large as a goosqu[i]ll; it is simple unbranc[h]ed and erect.1 1 Probably Berberis aquifolium, Pursh.—C. V. Piper. it's leaves are cauline, compound and spreading. the leafets are jointed and oppositely pinnate, 3 pare &amp; terminating in one, sessile, widest at the base and tapering to an accuminated point, an inch and a quarter the greatest width, and 3 inches &amp; a 1/4 in length. each point of their crenate margins armed with a subulate thorn or spine and are from 13 to 17 in number. they are also veined, glossey, carinated and wrinkled; their points obliquely pointing towards the extremity of the common footstalk. The stem of the 2nd. is procumbent abo[u]t the size of the former, jointed and unbranched. it's leaves are cauline, compound and oppositely pinnate; the rib from 14 to 16 inches long celindric and smooth. the leafets 2 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide. greatest width 1/2 inch from their base, to which they are regularly rounded, and from the same point tapering to an accute apex, w[h]ich is mostly, but not invariably tirminated with a small subulate thorn.1 1 Berberis nervosa, Pursh. This is commonly known as "Oregon grape." Lewis collected specimens of both these types.—C. V. Piper. they are jointed and oppositely pinnate, consisting of 6 pare and terminating in one, sessile serrate, or like the teeth of a whipsaw, each point terminating in a small subulate spine, being from 25 to 27 in number; veined, smooth, plane and of a deep green, their points tending obliquely towards the extremity of the rib or common footstalk. I do not know the fruit or flower of either. the Ist resembles the plant common to many parts of the U'States called the mountain holley. [Clark:] Wednesday February 12th.. 1806. This morning we were visited by a Clatsop man who brought with him three dogs as a remuneration for the Elk which himself and Nation had stolen from us some little time sence, however the dogs took the alarm and ran off; we suffered him to remain in the fort all night. There are two species of evergreen shrubs. This is the leaf of one. which I first met with at the grand rapids of the Columbia River, and which I have sence found in this neighbourhood also; they usually grow in rich dry ground not far from some watercourse. the roots of both species are creeping and celindric. the stem of the first (as above) is from a foot to 18 inches high and as large as a goose quil; it is simple and erect. its leaves are cauline, and spredding. the leaf[l]its are jointed &amp; oppositly poinnate 3 par Ind termonateing in one, cessile widest at the base and tapering to an accuminated point, an inch and 1/4 the greatest width, &amp; 3 1/4 inches in length. each point of their crenate margins armed with a thorn or spine, and are from 13 to 17 in number. they are also veined, glossy, crinated and wrinkled; their points obliquely pointing towards the extremity of the common footstalk. The stem of the 2nd. is procumbent about the size of the former, jointed and umbracated. its leaves are cauline, compound and oppositly pointed; the rib from 14 to 16 inches long celendric and smooth the leaf[l]its 2 1/2 inches long and 1 inch wide. the greatest width 1/2 inch from their base which they are regularly rounded, and from the same point tapering to an accute apex, which is mostly but not entirely termonated with a small subulate thorn. they are jointed and oppositly pointed, consisting of 6 par and termonateing in one (in this form.) sessile, ser rate, or like the teeth of a whipsaw, each point terminating in a small subulate spine, being from 25 to 27 in numbr; veined, smoth, plane and of a deep green, their points tending obliquely towards the extremity of the rib or common footstalk. I do not know the frute or flower of either. the Ist resembles a plant common to maney parts of the United States called the Mountain Holly. [Lewis:] Thursday February 13th. 1806. The Clatsop left us this morning at 11. A.M. not any thing transpired during the day worthy of notice. yesterday we completed the operation of drying the meat, and think we have a sufficient stock to last us this month. the Indians inform us that we shall have great abundance of a small fish in March which from their discription must be the herring. these people have also informed us that one More who sometimes touches at this place and trades with the natives of this coast, had on board of his vessel three Cows, and that when he left them he continued his course along the N.W. coast. I think this strong circumstancial proof that there is a stettlement of white persons at Nootka sound or some point to the N.W. of us on the coast.1 1 See vol. iii, p. 327, note, ante.—Ed. There is a species of bryer which is common in this neighbourhood of a green colour which grows most abundant in the rich dry lands near the watercourses, but is also found in small quantities in the piny lands at a distance from the watercourses in the former situation the stem is frequently the size of a man's finger and rises perpendicularly to the hight of 4 or 5 feet when it decends in an arch and becomes procumbent or rests on some neighbouring plants or shrubs; it is simple unbranched and celindric; in the latter situation it is much smaller and usually procumbent. the stem is armed with sharp and hooked bryers. the leaf is peteolate ternate and resembles in shape and appearance that of the perple raspberry common to the Atlantic states. the fruit is a berry resembling the black berry in every rispect and is eaten when ripe and much esteemed by the natives but is not dryed for winter consumption. in the country about the entrance of the quicksand river I first discovered this bryer. it groows so abundantly in the fertile valley of Columbia and the Islands in that part of the river that the country near the river is almost impenitrable in many places. the briary bush with a wide leaf is also one of it's ascociates. the green bryer retains it's foliage and verdure untill late in December.2 2 This is Rubus macropetalus, Dougl., mentioned again Mar. 25, 1806.—C. V. Piper. There are also two species of firn which are common to this country beside that formerly discribed of which the natives eat the roots. these from their disparity in point of size I shall designate the large and small firn. both species continue green all winter. The large firn, rises to the [height] of 3 or four feet the stem is a common footstalk or rib which proceeds immediatly from the radix w[h]ich is somewhat flat on two sides about the size of a man's arm and covered with innumerable black coarce capillary radicles which issue from every pa[r]t of it's surface; one of those roots or a collected bed of them will send fourth from twenty to forty of those common footstalks all of which decline or bend outwards from the common center. these ribs are cylindric and marked longitudinally their whole length with a groove or channel on their upper side. on either side of this grove a little below it's edge, the leafets are inserted, being shortly petiolate for about 2/3ds. of the length of the middle rib commencing at the bottom and from thence to the extremity sessile. the rib is terminated by a single undivided lanceolate gagged [jagged] leafet. the leafets are lanceolate, from 2 to 4 Inches in length gagged and have a small accute angular projection on the upper edge near the base where it is spuar [square] on the side which has the projection and obliquely cut at the base on the other side of the rib of the leafet. or which will give a better idea in this form. the upper surface is Smooth and of a deep green the under disk of a pale green and covered with a brown bubersence [pubescence] of a woolly appearance particularly near the cent[r]al fiber or rib. these leafets are alternately pinnate, they are in number from 110 to 140; shortest at the two extremities of the common footstalk and longest in the center, graduly lengthening and deminishing as they succeed each other.1 1 This may be Aspidium spinulosum, a specimen of which Lewis brought back from Fort Clatsop, but is probably A. munitum (see Coues, L. and C iii, p. 838).—C. V. Piper. The small firn also rises with a common footstalk from the radix and are from four to eight in number. about 8 inches long; the central rib marked with a slight longitudinal groove throughout it's whole length. the leafets are oppositely pinnate about 1/3rd. of the length of the common footstalk from the bottom and thence alternately pinnate; the footstalk terminating in a simple undivided nearly entire lanceolate leafet. the leafets are oblong, obtuse, convex absolutely entire, marked on the upper disk with a slight longitudinal groove in place of the central rib, smooth and of a deep green. near the upper extremity these leafets are decursively pinnate as are also those of the large firn.1 1 Lomaria spicant, without much doubt. Lewis brought back a specimen of this plant from Fort Clatsop.—C. V. Piper. The grasses of this neighbourhood are generally coa[r]se harsh and sedge-like, and grow in large tufts. there is none except in the open grounds. near the coast on the tops of some of the untimbered hills there is a finer and softer species which resembles much the green swoard. the salt marshes also produce a coarse grass, Bull rushes and the Cattail flagg. of the two last the natives make great use in preparing their mats bags &amp;c. [Clark:] Tuesday February 13th 1806 The Clatsop left us this morning at 11 A. M. not anything transpired during the day worthy of notice. yesterday we completed the opperation of drying the meat, and think we have a sufficient stock to last us this month. the Indians inform us that we shall have great abundance of small fish in March, which from the discription must be the Herring. Those people have also informed us that one Moore who sometimes touches at this place and traded with the nativs of this coast, had on board his ship 3 Cows, and that when he left them he continued his course along the N W. coast. I think this (if those cows were not Coats [Goats] ) strong circumstantial proof that their is a settlement of white persons at Nootka Sound or some place to the N W of us on the coast. There are also two species of firn which are common to this Countrey besides that before mentioned of which the nativs eate the roots. these two from their disparity in point of size I shall distinguish the large and small firn. both species continue green all winter. The large fern, rise to the hight of 3 or 4 feet, the stem is a common footstalk or rib which proceeds immediately from the radix which is somewhat flat on two sides about the size of a man's arm and covered with innumerable black coarse capillary radicles which issue from every part of its surface; one of these roots or a collected bead of them will send forth from 20 to 40 of those common footstalks all of which decline or bend outwards from the common center. those ribs are cylindric and marked longitudinally their whole length with a groove or channel on their upper side. on either side of the groove a little below its edge, the leafets are inserted, being partly petiolate for about 2/3ds. of the length of the middle rib, commenceing at the bottom and from thence to the extremity sessile. the rib is termonated by a single undivided lanceolate gagged leafet. the leafets are lanceolate, from 2 to 4 inches in length gagged and have a small accute angular projection and obliquely cut at the base on either side of the rib of the leafet. upper surface is smooth and of a deep green, the under disk of a pale Green and covered with a brown substance of a woolly appearance particularly near the center fiber or rib these leafets are alternately pointed they are in number from 110 to 140; shortest at the two extremities of the common foot-stalk and longest in the center, gradually length[en]ing and diminishing as they suckceed each other. The small firn also rises with a common footstalk from the radix and are from 4 to 8 in number, about 8 inches long; the central rib marked with a slight longitudinal groove throughout it's whole length. the leafets are oppositly pinnate about 1/3 of the length of the common footstalk from the bottom and thence alternately pinnate; the footstalk termonating in a simple undivided nearly entire lanceolate leafet. the leafets are oblong, obtuse, convex absolutely entire, marked on the upper disk with a slight longitudinal gro[o]ve in place of the central rib, smooth and of a deep green; near the upper extremity those lefets are decurscivily pinnate as are also those of the larg firn. The Grass's of this neighbourhood are generally coarse harsh and sedge-like, and grow in large tufts. there is none except in the open grounds. near the coast on the top of some of the untimbered hills there is a finer and softer species which resemble much the greens word. the salt marshes also produce a corse grass, Bullrushes and the Cattail flaggs. of the two last the nativs make great use in preparing their mats bags &amp;c. in those bags they carry their fish Berries roots &amp;c. [Lewis:] Friday February 14th. 1806. We are very uneasy with rispect to our sick men at the salt works. Sergt. Pryor and party have not yet returned nor can we conceive what causes their delay. Dreyer visited his traps today and caught a very fine fat beaver on which we feasted this evening. on the 11th inst. Capt. Clark completed a map of the country through which we have been passing from Fort Mandan to this place.1 1 See our atlas volume, for this map.—Ed. in this map the Missouri Jefferson's river the S. E. branch of the Columbia, Kooskooske and Columbia from the entrance of the S. E. fork to the pacific Ocean as well as a part of Flathead (Clarks) river and our tract [track] across the Rocky Mountains are laid down by celestial observation and survey. the rivers are also connected at their sources with other rivers agreeably to the information of the natives and the most probable conjecture arrising from their capacities and the relative positions of their rispective entrances which last have with but few exceptions been established by celestial observation. we now discover that we have found the most practicable and navigable passage across the Continent of North America; it is that which we traveled with the exception of that part of our rout from the neighbourhood of the entrance of Dearborn's River untill we arrived on the Flat-head (Clarks) river at the entrance of Travelers rest creek; the distance between those two points would be traveled more advantageously by land as the navigation of the Missouri above the river Dearborn is laborious and 420 miles distant by which no advantage is gained as the rout which we are compelled to travel by land from the source of Jefferson's river to the entrance of Travelers rest Creek is 220 miles being further by 500 miles than that from the entrance of Dearborn's river to the last mentioned point and a much worse rout if Indian information is to be relyed on; from the same information the Flathead river like that of the S.E. fork of the Columbia which heads with Jefferson's and Madison's Rivers can not be navigated through the Rocky Mountains in consequence of falls &amp; rappids and as a confermation of this fact, we discovered that there were no salmon in the Flathead river, which is the case in the S.E. branch of the Columbia although it is not navigable. added to this, the Indians further inform us, that the Flathead river runs in the direction of the Rocky Mountains for a great distance to the North before it discharges itself into the Columbia river, which last from the same information from the entrance of the S.E. fork to that of Flathead (Clarks) river is obstructed with a great number of difficult and dangerous rappids. considering therefore the danger and difficulties attending the navigation of the Columbia in this part, as well as the circuitous and distant rout formed by itself and the Flathead (Clarks) river we conceive that even admitting the Flathead (Clarks) river contrary to information to be as navigable as the Columbia river below it's entrance, that the tract by land over the Rocky Mountains usually traveled by the natives from the Entrance of Traveller's rest Creek to the forks of the Kooskooske is preferable; the same being a distance of 184 Miles. The inferrence therefore deduced from those premices are that the best and most Practicable rout across the Continent is by way of the Missouri (falls of Missouri) to the entrance of Dearborn's river or near that place; from thence to flathead (Clarks) river (by land to) at the entrance of Traveller's rest Creek, from thence up Traveller's rest creek to the forks, from whence you pursue a range of mounttains which divides the waters of the two forks of this creek, and which still continuing it's Westwardly course divides the waters of the two forks of the Kooskooske river to their junction; from thence to decend this river by water to the S.E. branch of the Columbia, thence down that river to the Columbia and with the latter to the Pacific Ocean. [Clark:] Friday February 14th 1806 We are very uneasy with respect to our sick men at the salt works. Serjt. Pryor and party haveing not yet returned, nor can we conceive what can be the cause of their delay. Drewyer visited his traps &amp;c. today and cought a fine fat beaver on which we feasted this evening and thought it a great delecessey. I compleated a map of the Countrey through which we have been passing from the Mississippi at the Mouth of Missouri to this place.1 1 See our atlas volume, for the Clark maps.—Ed. In the Map the Missouri Jefferson's river the S.E. branch of the Columbia or Lewis's river, Koos-koos-ke and Columbia from the enterance of the S.E. fork to the pacific Ocian, as well as a part of Clark's river and our track across the Rocky Mountains are laid down by celestial observations and survey. the rivers are also conected at their sources with other rivers agreeably to the information of the nativs and the most probable conjecture arrising from their capacities and the relative positions of their respective enterances which last have with but fiew exceptions been established by celestial ob servations. We now discover that we have found the most practicable and navigable passage across the Continent of North America; it is that which we have traveled with the exception of that part of our rout from the foot of the Falls of the Missouri, or in neighbourhood of the enterance of the Rocky Mountains untill we arive on Clarks river at the enterence of Travelers-rest Creek; the distance between those two points would be traveled more advantagiously by land as the navigation of the Missouri above the Falls is crooked laborious and 521 miles distant by which no advantage is gained as the rout which we are compelled to travel by land from the source of Jeffersons River to the enterance of Travellers rest Creek is 220 miles being further by ab' 600 miles than that from the Falls of the Missourie to the last mentioned point (Travellers rest Creek) and a much worse rout if indian information is to be relied on which is from the Sosonee or Snake Indians, and the Flatheads of the Columbia West of the rocky mountains. from the same information Clarks river like that of the S. E. branch of the Columbia which heads with Jefferson's and Maddisons river's can not be navagated thro' the rocky mountains in consequence of falls and rapids, and as a confirmation of the fact, we discovered that there were no salmon in Clark's river, which is not the case in the S.E. branch of the Columbia altho it is not navigable. added to this, the Indians of different quarte[r]s further inform us, that Clark's river runs in the direction of the Rocky Mountains for a great distance to the north before it discharges itself into the Columbia river. from the same information the Columbia from the enterance of the S. E. branch to the enterance of Clark's river is obstructed with a great number of deficuelt and dangerous rapids (and the place Clark's river comes out of the Rocky Mountains is a tremendious falls &amp;c which there is no possibility of passing the mountains either by land or water.) considering therefore the dangers and deficuelties attending the navigation of the Columbia in this part, as well as the circuitous and distant rout formed by itself and that of Clark's River we conceive that even admitting that Clarks river contrary to information to be as navagable as the Columbia below its enterance, that the tract by land over the Rocky Mountains usually traveled by the nativs from the enterance of Travellers-rest Creek to the Forks of the Kooskooske is preferable; the same being a distance of 184 miles. The inferrence therefore deduced from these premises are, that the best and most practicable rout across the Continent is by way of the Missouri to the Falls; thence to Clarks river at the enterance of Travellers rest Creek, from thence up travillers rest Creek to the forks, from whence you prosue a range of mountains which divides the waters of the two forks of this Creek, and which still Continues it's westwardly course on the Mountains which divides the waters of the two forks of the Kooskooske river to their junction; from thence to decend this river to the S. E. branch of the Columbia, thence down that river to the Columbia, and down the Latter to the Pacific Ocian. There is a large river which falls into the Columbia on its south side at what point we could not lern; which passes thro those extencive Columbian Plains from the South East, and as the Indians inform us head in the Mountains South of the head of Jefferson River and at no great distance from the Spanish settlements, Multnomah1 1 The word "Multnomah" was inserted in the text after it was first written—Ed. and that that fork which heads with the River Rajhone and waters of the Missouri passes through those extensive plains in which there is no wood, and the river crowded with rapids &amp; falls many of which are impassable. the other or westerly fork passes near a range of mountains and is the fork [on] which [live] great numbers of Indian Bands of the Sosone or Snake Indians this fork most probably heads with North River or the waters of Callifornia. this River may afford a practicable land communication with New Mexico by means of its western fork. This river cannot be navagable as an impracticable rapid is within one mile of its enterance into the Columbia, and we are fully purswaded that a rout by this river if practicable at all, would lengthen the distance greatly and incounter the same dificulties in passing the Rocky Mountains with the rout by way of Travellers rest Creek &amp; Clarks river. [Lewis:] Saturday February 15th. 1806. Drewyer and Whitehouse set out this morning on a hunting excurtion towards the praries of Point Adams. we have heard our hunters over the Netul fire several shot today, but have had no account from them as yet. about 3 P.M. Bratton arrived from the salt works and Informed us that Sergt. Pryor and party were on their way with Gibson who is so much reduced that he cannot stand alone and that they are obliged to carry him in a litter. Bratton himself appears much reduced with his late indisposition but is now recovering fast. Bratton informed that the cause of Sergt. Pryor's delay was attributeable to the winds which had been so violent for several days as to render it impossible to get a canoe up the creek to the point where it was necessary to pass with Gibson. the S.W. winds are frequently very violent on the coast when we are but little sensible of them at Fort Clatsop. in consequence of the lofty and thickly timbered fir country which surrounds us on that quarter from the South to the North East. after dark Sergt. Pryor arrived with Gibson. we are much pleased in finding him by no means as ill as we had expected. we do no[t] conceive him in danger by any means, tho' he has yet a fever and is much reduced. we beleive his disorder to have orriginated in a violent cold which he contracted in hunting and pursuing Elk and other game through the swam[p]s and marshes about the salt works. he is nearly free from pain tho' a good deel reduced and very languid. we gave him broken dozes of diluted nitre and made him drink plentifully of sage tea, had his feet bathed in warm water and at 9 P.M. gave him 35 drops of laudanum. The quadrupeds of this country from the Rocky Mountains to the pacific Ocean are 1st. the domestic animals, consisting of the horse and the dog only; 2ed.ly the native wild animals, consisting of the Brown white or grizly bear, (which I beleive to be the same family with a mearly accedental difference in point of colour) the black bear, the common red deer, the black tailed fallow deer, the Mule deer, Elk, the large brown wolf, the small woolf of the plains, the large wolf of the plains, the tiger cat, the common red fox, black fox or fisher, silver fox, large red fox of the plains, small fox of the plains or kit fox, Antelope, sheep, beaver, common otter, sea Otter, mink, spuck, seal, racoon, large grey squirrel, small brown squirrel, small grey squirrel, ground squirrel, sewelel, Braro, rat, mouse, mole, Panther, hare, rabbit, and polecat or skunk. all of which shall be severally noticed in the order in which they occur as well as shuch others as I learn do exist and which [have] not been here recapitulated. The horse is confined principally to the nations inhabiting; the great plains of Columbia extending from Latitude 40°. to 50°. N. and occupying the tract of country lying between the rocky Mountains and a range [Cascade] of Mountains which pass the Columbia river about the great falls or from Longitude 116 to 121 West. in this exte[n]sive tract of principally untimbered country so far as we have lea[r]nt the following natives reside (viz) the Sosone or snake Indians, the Chopunnish, Sokulks, Cutssahnims, Chymnapums, E[c]helutes, Eneshuh &amp; Chilluckkittequaws. all of whom enjoy the bennefit of that docile, generous and valuable anamal the horse, and all of them except the three last have immence numbers of them. Their horses appear to be of an excellent race; they are lofty eligantly formed active and durable; in short many of them look like the fine English coarsers and would make a figure in any country. some of those horses are pided [pied] with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with the black brown bey or some other dark colour, but much the larger portion are of an uniform colour with stars snips and white feet, or in this rispect marked much like our best blooded horses in Virginia, which they resemble as well in fleetness and bottom as in form and colours. the natives suffer them to run at large in the plains, the grass of which furnishes them with their only subsistence their masters taking no trouble to lay in a winters store for them, but they even keep fat if not much used on the dry grass of the plains during the winter. no rain scarcely ever falls in these plains and the grass is short and but thin. The natives (except those near the R. Monts) appear to take no pains in scelecting their male horses from which they breed, in short those of that discription which I have noticed appeared much the most indifferent. whether the horse was orrigeonally a native of this country or not it is out of my power to determine as we cannot understand the language of the natives sufficiently to ask the question. at all events the country and climate appears well adapted to this anamal. horses are said to be found wild in many parts of this extensive plain country. the several tribes of Sosones who reside towards Mexico on the waters of Clark's (Multnomah) river or particularly one of them called Shâ-bo-bó-ah have also a great number of mules, which among the Indians I find are much more highly prized than horses. an eligant horse may be purchased of the natives in this country for a few beads or other paltry trinkets which in the U' States would not cost more than one or two dollars. This abundance and cheapness of horses will be extremely advantageous to those who may hereafter attem[p]t the fir trade to the East Indies by way of the Columbia river and the Pacific Ocean. the mules in the possession of the Indians are principally stolen from the Spaniards of Mexeco; they appear to be large and fine such as we have seen. Among the Sosones of the upper part of the S. E. fork of the Columbia we saw several horses with Spanish brands on them which we supposed had been stolen from the inhabitants of Mexeco. [Clark:] Saturday February 15th. 1806 Drewyer and Whitehouse set out on a hunting excurtion towards the Mountains Southwest of us. we have heard our hunters over the Netul fire several shot today, but have had no account of them as yet. 3 P. M. Bratten arived from the saltworks, and informed us that Serjt. Pryor and party were on their way with gibson in a litter. he is verry bad and much reduced with his present indisposition. Wm. Bratten appears much reduced and is yet verry unwell. he informs that the cause of Sergt. Pryor's delay was attributiable to the winds which had been so violent for several days as to render it impossible to get a Canoe up the Creek to the point where it was necessary to pass with Gibson. the S.W. winds are frequently very violent on the coast when we are but little sensible of them at Fort Clatsop, in Consequence of the lofty and thickly timbered fir country which surrounds us from that quarter, from the south to the N. East. After Dark Sergt. Pryor arrived with Gibson. we are much pleased in finding him by no means as ill as we had expected, we do not conceive him in danger by any means, tho' he has yet a fever and is much reduced, we believe his disorder to have originated in a violent cold which he contracted in hunting and prosueing Elk and other Game through the swamps and marshes about the salt works. he is nearly free from pain tho' a good deel reduced and very languid. we gave him double doses of diluted niter and made him drink plentifully of sage tea, had his feet bathed in worm water and at 9 P. M. gave him 35 drops of laudanum. The quadrupeds of this countrey from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocian are first the Domestic Animals, consisting of the Horses and Dogs only; 2nd.ly the Native Wild Animals, consisting of the White, brown, or Grizly bear (which I believe to be the same family with a mearly accidentail difference in point of colour) The Black Bear, the Elk, the Common red Deer, the Mule deer, the black tailed fallow Deer, the large brown Wolf, the Small Wolf of the Plains, the large Wolf of the Plains, Panther, the tiger cat, the common red fox, the black fox or fisher, the Silver fox, large red fox of the plains, small fox of the plains or Kit fox, Antilope, Sheep, beaver, common otter, sea otter, minks, seals racoons, large Grey squerrel, small brown squirrel, small grey Squirrel, Ground Squirrel, Sewelel, Braro, rat, mouse, mole, hare, rabbet, and pole Cat or skunk. all of which shall be severally noticed in the order in which they occur as well as such others as I learn do exist, and which not been here recapitulated. The Horse is principally confined to the Nations inhabiting the great Plains of Columbia extending from Latitude 40° to 50°. N. and occupying the tract of Countrey lying between the Rocky Mountains and a rang[e] of Mountains which pass the Columbia River about the Great Falls or from Longitude 116° to 121° West in this extensive tract of Principally untmibered countrey so far as we have lernt the following nations reside (viz) The Sosone; or Snake Indians inhabiting the south fork or [blank space in MS.] River, the Chopunnish, Sokulks, Cutssahnims, Chymnapum, E[c]helutes, Eneshuh &amp; Chilluckkittequaws, all of whome enjoy the benefit of that docile generous and valueable animal the Horse, and all of them except the three last have emence numbers of them. their horses appear to be of an excellent race; they are lofty eligantly formed active and durable; in short maney of them look like the fine English coursers and would make a figure in any country. some of those horses inpided [pied] with large spots of white irregularly scattered and intermixed with black, brown, Bey or some other dark colour, but much the larger portion are of a uniform colour with stars, snips, and white feet, or in this respect marked much like our best blooded horses in the U. States, which they resemble as well in fleetness and bottom as in form and colour. the nativs suffer them to run at large in the plains, the Grass of which furnish them with their only subsistance, their owners takeing no trouble to lay in a winters store for them, but they keep fat if not much used on the dry grass of the plains dureing the winter. rain scercely ever falls in those plains and the Grass is short and but thin, the nativs appear to take no pains in selecting their male horses from which they bread, in short those of that discription which I have noticed appear much the most indifferent. whether the horses was originally a native of this country or not, it is out of my power to determine as we cannot understand the language of the nativs sufficiently to ask the question. at all events the Country and Climate appears well adapted to this animal. Horses aje said to be found wild in maney parts of this extensive plain country. The several tribes of Sosones who reside near Mexico on the waters of Clark's river, or particularly one of them called Shâ-bo-bó-ah have also a great number of Mules, which among the Inds. I find are much more highly prized than horses. an eligant horse may be purchased of the nativs in this country for a fiew beeds or other paltry trinkits which in the United States would not cost more than one or two dollars. This abundance and cheepness of horses will be extremely advantagious to those who may hereafter attempt the fir trade to the East Indies by way of the Columbia and the Pacific Ocian. The mules in the possession of the Inds. are principally stolen from the Spaniards of New Mexico; such as we have seen appear to be large with Spanish brands. among the Sosones of the upper part of Lewis's river we saw several horses with Spanish brands on them which the nativs informed us came from the South most probably from the Settlement in New mexico, on the heads of the North river or waters of the Bay of California. [Lewis:] Sunday February 16th. 1806. By several trials made today in order to adjust my Octant and ascertain her error in the direct observation, I found that it was 2° 1'.45".+ or additive, beyond the fracture; this error was ascertained by a comparison with my Sextant the error of which had been previously ascertained. the error of Octant in the direct observation on the broken limb next to o. or below 55° .20'. inclusive is 2° additive only. Sent Shannon Labuish and Frazier this morning on a hunting excurtion up the Kil-haw-a nak-kle river1 1 The present Klaskanine or Young's River.—Ed. which discharges itself into the head of the bay. no tidings yet of Sergt. Gass and party. Bratton is still very weak and complains of a pain in the lower part of the back when he moves which I suppose proceeds from dability. I gave him barks. Gibson's fever still continues obstenate tho' not very high; I gave him a doze of Dr. Rush's which in many instances I have found extreemly efficatious in fevers which are in any measure caused by the presence of boil. the nitre has produced a profuse perspiration this evening and the pills operated late at night his fever after which abated almost entirely and he had a good night's rest. The Indian dog is usually small or much more so than the common cur. they are party coloured; black white brown and brindle are the most usual colours. the head is long and nose pointed eyes small, ears erect and pointed like those of the wolf, hair short and smooth except on the tail where it is as long as that of the curdog and streight. the natives do not eat them nor appear to make any other use of them but in hunting the Elk as has been before observed. The brown white or grizly bear are found in the rocky mountains in the timbered parts of it or Westerly side but rarely; they are more common below the rocky Mountain on the borders of the plains where there are copses of brush and underwood near the watercourses. they are by no means as plenty on this side of the rocky mountains as on the other, nor do I beleive that they are found at all in the woody country, which borders this coast as far in the interior as the range of mountains which, pass the Columbia between the Great Falls and rapids of that river. the black bear differs not any from those common to the United states and are found under the rocky Mountains in the woody country on the borders of the great plains of columbia and also in this tract of woody country which lie between these plains and the Pacific Ocean. their oconimy and habits are also the same with those of the United States. [Clark:] Sunday February 16th. 1806. Sent Shannon Labiesh and frazier on a hunting excurtion up the Kil-haw-a-nak-kle river which discharges itself into the head of Meriwethers Bay. no word yet of Sergt. Gass and party. Bratten is verry weak and complains of a pain in the lower part of the back when he moves which I suppose proceeds from debility. I gave him barks and saltpeter. Gibsons fever still continues obstinate tho' not verry high; we gave him a dose of Dr. Rushes pills which in maney instancis I have found extreamly effecasious in fevers which are in any measure caused by the presence of boil. the niter has produced a perfuse perspiration this evening and the pils opperated late at night his feaver after which abated almost intirely and he had a good nights rest. The Indian Dogs are usually small or much more so than the common cur. they are party coloured; black white brown and brindle are the more usual colours. the head is long and nose pointed eyes small, ears erect and pointed like those of the Wolf, hair short and smooth except on the tail where it is as long as that of the curdog and streight. the nativs do not eate them, or make any further use of them than in hunting the Elk as has been before observed. Shannon an[d] Labiesh brought in to us today a Buzzard or Vulture of the Columbia which they had wounded and taken alive. I believe this to be the largest Bird of North America. it was not in good order and yet it wayed 25lbs.. had it have been so it might very well have weighed 10lb. more or 35lbs.. between the extremities of the wings it measured 9 feet 2 Inches; from the extremity of the beak to that of the toe 3 feet 9 inches and a half. from hip to toe 2 feet, girth of the head 9 inches 3/4. Girth of the neck 7 1/2 inches; Girth of the body exclusive of the wings 2 feet 3 inches; girth of the leg 3 inches. the diameter of the eye 41/2ths/10 of an inch, the iris of a pale scarlet red, the puple of a deep sea green or black and occupies about one third of the diameter of the eye the head and part of the neck as low as the figures 1.2. is uncovered with feathers except that portion of it represented by dots foward and under the eye. the tail is composed of twelve feathers of equal length, each 14 inches, the legs are 4 3/4 inches in length and of a whitish colour uncovered with feathers, they are not entirely smooth but not Imbricated; the toes are four in number three of which are foward and that in the center much the longest; the fourth is short and is inserted near the inner of the three other toes and reather projecting foward. the thye is covered with feathers as low as the knee. the top or upper part of the toes are imbricated with broad scales lying transversly, the nails are black and in proportion to the size of the bird comparitively with those of the Hawk or Eagle, short and bluntly pointed. the under side of the wing is covered with white down and feathers. a white stripe of about 2 inches in width, also marks the outer part of the wing, imbraceing the lower points of the feathers, which [c]over the joints of the wing through their whole length or width of that part of the wing. all the other feathers of whatever part are of a Glossy shineing black except the down, which is not glossy, but equally black. the skin of the beak and head to the joining of the neck is of a pale orrange Yellow, the other part uncovered with feathers is of a light flesh colour. the skin is thin and wrinkled except on the beak where it is smooth. This bird fly's very clumsily, nor do I know whether it ever seizes it's prey alive, but am induced to believe it does not. we have seen it feeding on the remains of the whale and other fish which have been thrown up by the waves on the sea coast these I believe constitute their principal food, but I have no doubt but that they also feed on flesh. we did not meet with this bird un[t]ill we had decended the Columbia below the great falls, and have found them more abundant below tide water than above. this is the same species of Bird which R. Field killed on the 18th.. of Novr. last and which is noticed on that day tho' not fully discribed then I thought this of the Buzzard speces. I now believe that this bird is reather of the Vulture genus than any other, tho' it wants some of their characteristics particularly the hair on the neck, and the feathers on the legs.1 1 This is the California vulture (Pseudogryphus, or Cathartes, californianus); as Clark says, it is one of the largest birds of the American continent.—Ed. this is a handsom bird at a little distance it's neck is proportionably longer than those of the Hawks or Eagle. Shannon also brought a Grey Eagle which appeared to be of the same kind common to the U. States. it weighed 15 pds. and measured 7 feet 7 inches between the extremities of the wings. Shannon and Labiesh informed us that when he approached this Vulture after wounding Head of a Vulture, by Clark. it. that it made a loud noise very much like the barking of a Dog. the tongue is long firm and broad, filling the under Chap and partakeing of its transvirs curvature, or its sides forming a longitudinal Groove; obtuse at the point, the Margin armed with firm cartelagenous prickkles pointed and bending inwards. [Lewis:] Monday February 17th. 1806. Collins and Windsor were permitted to hunt today towards the pranes in Point Adams with a view to obtain some fresh meat for the sick. a little before noon Shannon LaBuishe &amp; Frazier returned with the flesh and hide of an Elk which had been wou[n]ded by Sergt. Gass's party and took the water where they pursued it and caught it. they did not see Sergt. Gass or any of his party nor learn what further success they had had. continue the barks with Bratton, and commenced them with Gibson his fever being sufficiently low this morning to permit the uce of them. I think therefore that there is no further danger of his recovery, at 2. P.M. Joseph Fields arrived from the Salt works and informed us that they had about 2 Kegs of sat on hand which with what we have at this place we suppose will be sufficient to last us to our deposits of that article on the Missouri. we there [fore] directed a party of six men to go with Fields in the morning in order to bring the salt and kettles to the fort. Shannon &amp; Labuishe brought me one of the large carrion Crow or Buzza[r]ds of the Columbia which they had wounded and taken alive. I b[e]leive this to be the largest bird of North America. it was not in good order and yet it weighed 25 lbs. had it have been so it might very well have weighed 10 lbs. mor[e] or 35 lbs. between the extremities of the wings it measured 9 feet 2 inches; from the extremity of the beak to that of the toe 3 F. 9 1/2 In. from hip to toe 2 feet. girth of head 9 3/4 In. girth of the neck 7 1/2 Inches; d°. of body' exclusive of the wings 2 feet 3 Inches; d°. of leg 3 inches. diameter of the eye 4 1/2/ths10. of an inch. the iris of a pale scarlet red, the puple of deep sea green or black and occupyed about one third of the diameter of the eye. the head and a part of the neck as low as the figures 1.2. is uncovered with feathers except that portion of it represented by dots (see likeness).1 1 The likeness, being the same as that given in Clark's account, pp. 79, 80, ante, is here omitted.—Ed. the tail is composed of 12 feathers of equal length, each 14 inches. the legs are 4 3/4 inches in length and of a white colour uncovered with feathers, they are not entirely smooth but not imbricated; the toes are four in number three of which are forward and that in the center much the longes[t]; the fourth is short and is inserted near the inner of the three other toes and reather projecting forward. the thye is covered with feathers as low as the knee. the top or upper part of the toes are imbricated with broad scales lying transversly; the nails are blak and in proportion to the size of the bird comparitively with those of the halk or Eagle, short and bluntly pointed. the under side of the wing is covered with white down and feathers. a white stripe of about two inches in width, also marks the outer part of the wing, imbracing the lower points of the feathers, which cover the joints of the wing through their whole length or width of that part of the wing. all the other feathers of whatever part are glossey shining black except the down which is not glossey but equally black. the skin of the beak and head to the joining of the neck is of a pale orrange yellow the other part uncovered with feathers is of a light flesh colour. the skin is thin and wrinkled except on the beak where it is smooth. this bird flys very clumsily nor do I know whether it ever seizes it's prey alive, but am induced to beleive that it dose not. we have seen it feeding on the remains of the whale &amp; other fish which have been thrown up by the waves on the sea coast. these I beleive constitute their principal food, but I have no doubt but they also feed on flesh. we did not me[e]t with this bird untill we had decended the Columbia below the great falls, and have found them more abundant below tide-water than above. I beleive that this bird is reather of the Vulture genus than any other, tho' it wants some of their characteristics particularly the hair on the neck and feathers on the legs. this is a handsome bird at a little distance. it's neck is proportionably longer than those of the hawks or Eagle. Shannon also brought me a grey Eagle which appeared to be of the same kind common to the U'States; it weighed 15 lbs. and measured 7 Feet 7 Inches between the extremities of the wings. At 4 P.M. Sergt. Gass and party arrived; they had killed eight Elk. Drewyer and Whitehouse also returned late in the evening, had killed one Elk. Labuishe informed me that whe[n] he approached this vulture, after wounding it, that it made a loud noise very much like the barking of a dog. the tongue is large firm and broad, filling the under chap and partaking of it's transverse curvature, or it's sides colapsing upwards forming a longitudinal groove; obtuse at the point, the margin armed with firm cartelaginous prickkles pointed and bending inwards. [Clark:] Monday February 17th. 1806. Collins and Windser were permited to hunt to day towards the praries in Point Adams with a view to obtain some fresh meat for the sick. a little before noon Shannon and Labiesh &amp; frazier Came with the flesh and hide of an Elk which had been wounded by Sergt. Gasses party and took the water where they pursued it and cought it. they did not see Sergt. Gass or any of his party or learn what further sucksess they have had. Continued the barks with Bratten, and commenced them with gibson his feaver being sufficiently low this morning to permit the use of them. I think therefore that there is no further danger of his recovery. at 2 P. M. Joseph Field arrived from the Salt Works and informd us that they had about 2 Kegs of salt on hand (say 3 bushels) which with what we have at this place we suppose will be sufficient to last us to our deposit of that article on the Missouri. we directed a party of six men to go in the morning in order to bring the salt and Kittles to the Fort. at 4 P. M. Serjt. Gass and party arrive, they had killed 8 Elk. Drewyer and Whitehouse also return late in the evening, they had killed one Elk, part of the meat of which they brought in with them. The Brown, White, or Grizly Bear are found in the rocky mountains in the timbered part of it or Westerly side but rarely; they are more common below or on the East Side of the Rocky Mountains on the borders of the plains where there are copses of bushes and underwood near the water cources. they are by no means as plenty on this side of the Rocky Mountains as on the other, nor do I believe they are found at all in the woody country which borders this coast as far in the interior as the range of mountains which pass the Columbia between the enterance of Clarks and the Quicksand Rivers or below the Great falls of Columbia. The Black Bear differs not any from those common to the U. States, and are found under the Rocky Mountains in the woody country on the borders of the Great Plain's of Columbia and also in this tract of woody country which lie between these plains and the Pacific Ocian. their econimy and habits are also the same with those of the United States. [Lewis:] Tuesday February 18th. 1806. This morning we dispatched a party to the Saltworks with Sergt. Ordway. and a second with Sergt. Gass after the Elk killed over the Netul. in the evening Sergt. Ordway returned and reported that the waves ran so high in the bay that he could not pass to the entrance of the creek which we had directed him to ascend with the canoe. Collins and Winsor returned this evening with one deer which they had killed. the deer are poor and their flesh by no means as good as that of the Elk which is also poor but appears to be geting better than some weeks past. in the forenoon we were visited by eight Cla[t]sops and Chinnooks from whom we purchased a Sea Otter's skin and two hats made of waytape1 1 The long, slender roots of the white spruce, used by Indian canoe-makers to fasten together the strips of birch-bark; they call them watap or watapeh (a Chippewa word). The same name was also naturally applied to fine strips of bark used for weaving baskets. See Coues's Expeditions of Pike, i, pp. 101, 102—Ed. and white cedar bark. they remained untill late in the evening and departed for their village. these people are not readily obstructed by waves in their canoes. Sergt. Ordway brought me a specemine of a species of pine peculiar to the swamps and marshes frequently overflown by the tide as this is a distinct species I shall call it N°. 7.1 1 Picea sitchensis.—C. V. Piper. this tree seldom rises to a greater hight than 35 feet and is from 2 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter; the stem is simple branching diffuse and proliferous, the bark the same with that of N°. 1. only reather more rugged. the leaf is acerose, 2/10ths. of an inch in width and 3/4 in length. they are firm stif and somewhat accuminated, ending in a short pointed hard tendril, gibbous, thickly scattered on all sides of the bough but rispect the three upper sides only. those which have there insersion on the underside incline sidewise with their points upwards giving the leaf the figure of a sythe. the others are perpendicular or pointing upwards. is sessile growing as in N°. 1. from small triangular pedestals of a soft spungy elastic bark. the under disk of these leaves or that which grows nearest towards the base of the bough is a deep glossey green while the upper or opposite side is of a mealy whiteish pale green; in this rispect differing from almost all leaves. the boughs retain their leaves as far back as to the sixth years growth. the peculiarity of the bud scales observed in N°. 1. is observed in this species. The cone is 3 1/2 inches in length and 3 in circumpherence, of an ovate figure being thickest in the middle and tapering and terminating in two obtuse points. it is composes[d] of small, flexible, thin, obtusely pointed smooth and redish brown imbricated scales. each scale covering two small winged seeds and being itself covered in the center by a small thin inferior scale accutely pointed. the cone is somewhat of this figure they proceede from the side as well as the extremities of the bough but in the former case always at or near the commencement of some one years growth which is [in] some instances are as far back as the third year. [Clark:] Tuesday February 18th.. 1806. This morning we dispatched a party to the salt works with Sergt. Ordway. and a second party with Sergt. Gass after the Eight Elk killed over the Netul. in the evening Sergt. Ordway returned and reported that the waves ran so high in the Bay that he could not pass to the enterance of a Creek which he had directed him to assend with the Canoe. Collins and Windser returned this evening with one Deer which they had Killed. the deer are pore and their flesh by no means a[s] good as that of the Elk which is also poore but appears to be getting better than some weeks past. in the forenoon we were visited by a Clatsop and seven Chinnooks from whome I purchased a sea otter's skin and two hats made of waytape and silk grass and white cedar bark. they remained untill late in the evening and departed for their village. those people are not readily obstructed by waves in their Canoes. Since their departure we have discovered that they have stole an ax. Whitehouse brought me a roab which he purchased of the Indians formed of three skins of the Tiger Cat, this Cat differs from any which I have ever seen. it is found on the borders of the plains and the woody Country lying along the Pacific Ocean. this animale is about the size or reather larger than the wild cat of our countrey and is much the same in form, agility and ferosity. the colour of the back, neck and sides, is a redish brown irregular varigated with small spots of dark brown the tail is about two inches long nearly white except the extremity which is black; it termonates abruptly as if it had been cut off. the belly is white with small black spots, butifully varigated. the legs are of the same colour with the sides and back marked with transvers stripes of black the ears are black on the outer side covered with fine black hair, short except at the upper point which is furnished with a pencil of verry fine streight black hair, 3/4 of an inch in length, the fur of this animale is long and fine, much more so than the wild cat of the U. States but less so than the Louserva of the N West.1 1 The tiger cat here described is the lynx of the Columbia (Lynx rufus fasciatus), first noted by Lewis and Clark. By "Louserva," Clark means the loup cervier or Canadian lynx (L. canadensis).—Ed. the nativs of this Country make great use of the skins of this cat, to form the robes which they wear; three whole skins is the complement usually employed and sometimes four in each roab. Those cats are not marked alike maney of them have but fiew spots of a darker colour, particularly on the back. [Lewis:] Wednesday February 19th. 1806. Sergt. Ordway set out again this morning with a party for the salt works by land. in the evening Sergt. Gass returned with the flesh of eight Elk, and seven skins; having left one skin with Shannon and Labuishe who remained over the netul to continue the chase. we had the Elk skins divided among the messes in order that they might be prepared for covering our baggage when we set out in the spring. our sick are recovering but they appear to strengthen but slowly. The common red deer we found under the rocky Mts. in the neighbourhood of the Chopunnish, and about the great falls of the Columbia river and as low down the same as the commencement of tide water. these do not appear to differ essencially from those of our country being about the same size shape and appearance in every rispect except their great length of tail which is more than half as long again as our deer I measured one of them which was 17 inches long. The Black tailed fallow deer are peculiar to this coast and are a distinct species of deer partaking equally of peculiarities of the mule deer and the common deer.1 1 Coues identifies the common red deer as Cariacus virginianus macrurus; the black-tailed fallow deer as C. Columbianus a discovery of Lewis and Clark.—Ed. their ears are reather larger and their winter coat darker than the common deer; the recepticle of the eye or drane is mor[e] conspicuous; their legs shorter and body thicker and larger than the common deer; their tail is about the length of our deer or from 8 to 10 inches the hair on the underside of which is white, and that of it's sides and top quite black the horns resemble in form and colour those of the mule deer which it also resembles in it's gate; that is bounding with all four feet off the ground at the same time when running at full speed and not loping as the common deer or antelope do. they are sometimes found in the woodlands but most frequently in the praries and open grounds. they may be said generally to be a size larger than the common deer and that less than the mule deer. they are very seldom found in good order, or fat, even in the season which the common deer are so, and their flesh is inferior to any species of deer which I have ever seen. [Clark:] Wednesday February 19th.. 1806. Sergt. Ordway set out again with a party to the Salt works by land. in the evening Sergt. Gass returned with the flesh of Eight Elk, and seven skins haveing left one skin with Shannon and Labiesh who remained over the Netul to continue the chase. we devided the skins between the messes in order that they might be prepared for covering the baggage when we set out in the spring. our sick appear to strengthen but slowly I gave Bratten 6 of Scotts pills which did not work him. he is very weak and complains of his back. The black Fox or as they are more frequently called by the N West Trader Fisher is found in the woody country on this coast. how this animal obtained the name of fisher I know not, but certain it is, that the name is not appropriate; as it does not prey on fish, or seek it as a prey. they are extreemly active strong and made for climbing which they do with great agility, and bound from tree to tree in pursute of the squirel or Rackoon, their natural and most usual food. their colour is a jut Black except a small spot of white on the breast. the body is long, legs short and formed Something like the turnspit Dog, with a remarkable long tail. it does not differ here from those of the United States.1 1 The fisher (Mustela pennanti), or rather pekan, is not a fox, but allied to the marten. It has a wide range, westward from the Great Lakes to the Pacific. While racoons may not be their "natural food," they are known to do battle with the latter animal. See Kingsley (ed.), Riverside Natural History (Boston, 1888), v, p. 404.—Ed. The Silver Fox. this animale is very rare even in the countrey where it exists, I have never seen more than the skins of this animal and those were in the possession of the nativs of the woody country below the Great falls of the Columbia, from which I think it is most probably they are the inhabitants of the woody country exclusively. from the skins, it appeared to be about the size of the large red Fox of the plains and much of its form with a large tail. the legs I think somewhat longer it has a fine long deep fur poil. the poil is of a dark lead colour and the long hairs intermixed with it, are either white or black at the lower part, and white at top, the whole mixture forming a butifull silver Grey. I think this the handsomest of all the Fox species, except a species of which I saw one running, and Capt Lewis had a good view of another of the same species on the Missouri near the natural walls. The large red fox of the plains, and the Kit fox are the same which we met with on the Missouri and are the inhabitants almost exclusively of the open plains, or of the copse of bushes within the plain country. the Common red or grey fox of the United States is also found in the woody country on this coast, nor does it appear to be altered in respect to it's fur colour or any other particular. we have seen none of the large red fox. [Lewis:] Thursday February 20th. 1806. Permitted Collins to hunt this morning he returned in the evening unsuccessfull as to the chase but brought with him some cranberries for the sick. Gibson is on the recovery fast; Bratton has an obstenate cough and pain in his back and still appears to be geting weaker. Mc, Neal from his inattention to his disorder has become worse. This forenoon we were visited by Tâh-cum a principal Chief of the Chinnooks and 25 men of his nation. we had never seen this cheif before he is a good looking man of about 50 years of age reather larger in statu[r]e than most of his nation; as he came on a friendly visit we gave himself and party something to eat and plyed them plentifully with smoke. we gave this cheif a small medal with which he seemed much gratifyed. in the evening at sunset we desired them to depart as is our custom and closed our gates. we never suffer parties of such number to remain within the fort all night; for notwithstanding their apparent friendly disposition, their great averice and hope of plunder might induce them to be treacherous. at all events we determined allways to be on our guard as much as the nature of our situation will permit us, and never place ourselves at the mercy of any savages. we well know, that the treachery of the aborigenes of America and the too great confidence of our countrymen in their sincerity and friendship, has caused the distruction of many hundreds of us. so long have our men been accustomed to a friendly intercourse with the natives, that we find it difficult to impress on their minds the necessity of always being on their guard with rispect to them. this confidence on our part, we know to be the effect of a series of uninterupted friendly intercou[r]se, but the well known treachery of the natives by no means entitle them to such confidence, and we must check it's growth in our own minds, as well as those of our men, by recollecting ourselves, and repeating to our men that our preservation depends on never loosing sight of this trait in their character, and being always prepared to meet it in whatever shape it may present itself.1 1 Compare this cautious attitude of Lewis and Clark with that of the unfortunate officers of the "Tonquin," in the Astorian expedition. See Franchère and Ross, vols. vi and vii of Thwaites, Early Western Travels (Cleveland, 1904).—Ed. The Mule deer are the same with those of the plains of the Missouri so frequently mentioned. we met with them under the Rocky mountains in the Neighbourhood of the Chopunnish nation on the Kooskooske river, but have not seen them since nor do we know whether they exist in the interior of the great plains of Columbia or on their lower border near the mountains which pass the river about the great falls. The Elk is the same with that found in much the greatest portion of North America, they are common to every part of this country, as well the timbered lands as the plains, but are much more abundant in the former than the latter. The large brown woolf is like that of the Atlantic States and are found only in the woody country on the Pacific Ocean imbracing the mountains which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids of the same. the large and small woolves of the plains are the inhabitants principally of the open country and the woodlands on their borders and resemble in their habits and appearance those of the plains of the Missouri precisely. they are not abundant in the plains of Columbia because there is but little game on which for them to subsist. [Clark:] Thursday February 20th.. 1806. Permited Collins to hunt this morning he returned in the evening unsucksessfull as to the chase, but brought with him some Cramberries for the sick. Gibson is on the recovery fast; Bratten has an obstinate Cough and pain in his back and still appears to be getting weaker. H. Mc. Neal from his inattention to his disorder has become worse. Willard has a high fever and complains of the pain in his head and want of appetite. The forenoon we were visited by Tâh-cum a principal chief of the Chinnooks and 25 men of his nation. we had never seen this Chief before he is a good looking man of about 50 years of age reather larger in statue than most of his nation; as he came on a friendly visit we gave himself and party something to eat and plyed them plentyfully with smoke. we gave this chief a small Medal with which he seamed much pleased. in the evening at sunset we desired them to depart as is our custom and close our gates. we never suffer parties of such numbers to remain within the Fort all night; for notwithstanding their apparent friendly disposition, their great averis and hope of plunder might induce them to be treacherous. at all events we are determined always to be on our guard, as much as the nature of our situation will permit us, and never place ourselves at the mercy of any savages. we well know, that the treachery of the aborigenes of America and the too great confidence of our country men in their friendship and fadility has caused the distruction of maney hundreds of us. so long has our men been accustomed to a friendly intercourse with the nativs, that we find it dificult to impress on their minds the necessity of always being on their Guard with respect to them. this confidence on our part we know to be the effect of a serious [series] of a friendly and unintorupted intercourse. but the well known treachery of the natives by no means entitle them to such confidence, and we must check it's groth in our own minds, as well as those of our men, by recollecting ourselves, and repeating to our men, that our preservation depends on our never loseing sight of this trate in their character, and being always prepared to meet it in whatever shape it may present itself. The Mule Deer are the same with those of the Plains of the Missouri so frequently mentioned. we met with them under the rocky mountains in the neighbourhood of the Chopunnish Nation on the Koskooske river, but have not seen them since nor do we know whether they exist in the interiors of the great Plains of Columbia, or on the lower border near the Mountains which pass the river about the great falls. The Elk is the same with that found in much the greater portion of North America, they are common to every part of this country, as well the timbered lands as the plains, but are much more abundant in the former than the latter. [Lewis:] Friday February 21st.. 1806. Visited this morning by 3 Clatsop who remained with us all day; they are great begers; I gave one of them a few nedles with which he appeared much gratifyed. in the evening late they departed. Drewyer and Collins went in pursuit of some Elk, the tracks of which Collins had discovered yesterday; but it rained so hard that they could not pursue them by their tracks and returned unsuccessfull. Drewyer saw a fisher black fox but it escaped from him among the fallen timber. Sergt. Ordway returned with the party from the salt camp which we have now evacuated. they brought with them the salt and eutensils. our stock of salt is now about 20 Gallons; 12 gallons of which we secured in 2 small iron bound kegs and laid by for our voyage. gave Willard and bratton each a doze of Scotts pills; on the former they operated and on the latter they did not. Gibson still continues the barks three times a day and is on the recovery fast. The tyger Cat is found on the borders of the plains and in the woody country lying along the Pacific Ocean. this animal is about the size or reather larger than the wild cat of our country and is much the same in form, agility and ferosity. the colour of the back neck and sides is a redish brown irregularly variegated with small spots of dark brown the tail is about two inches long nearly white except the extremity which is black; it terminates abruptly as if it had been cut off. the belly is white with small black spots, beautifully variagated. the legs are of the same colour with the sides and back marked with transverse stripes of black the ears are black on the outer side covered with fine short hair except at the upper point which [is] furnished with a pensil of fine, streight, black hair, 3/4 of an inch in length. the fur of this anamal is long and fine, much more so than the wild cat of the United States but less so than that of Louservea of the N.West. the natives in this quarter make great use of the skins of this Cat to form the robes which they wear; four skins is the compliment usuly employed in each robe. the Black-fox, or as they [are] most frequently called in the neighbourhood of Detroit, Fisher. is found in the woody country on this coast. how this animal obtained the name of fisher I know not, but certain it is, that the name is not appropriate, as it dose not prey on fish or seek it as a prey. they are extreemly active strong and prepared for climbing, which they do with great agility, and bound from tree to tree in pursuit of the squirrel or Rakoon their natural and most usual food. their colour is a jut [jet] black except a small spot of white on the breast. the body is long, legs short and formed something like the tern-spit dog, with a remarkable long tail. it dose not differ here from those of the United States. The Silver fox this animal is very rare even in the country where it exists; I have never seen more than the Skins of this anamal and those were in the possession of the natives of the woody Country below the great falls of the Columbia from which I think that it is most probably the inhabitant of the woody country exclusively. from the skin it appeared to be about the size of the large red fox of the plains and much of it's form with a large tail, the legs I think somewhat longer. it has a fine long deep fur poil [pile]. the poil is of a dark lead colour and the long hairs intermixed with it are either white or black at the lower part and white at the top, the whole mixture forming a beatifull silver grey. I think this the most beautifull of all the Foxes except [a] species of which I saw one only on the Missouri near the natural walls. the large red fox of the plains and the Kit fox are the same which we met with on the Missouri and are the inhabitants almost exclusively of the open plains, or of the cops[e] of brush within the p[l]ain country. The common red fox of the United States is also found in the woody country on this coast nor dose it appear to be altered in rispect to it's fur colour or any other particular. [Lewis:] Friday February 21st.. 1806. Visited this morning by three Clatsops, wo remained with us all day; they are great begers; Capt Lewis gave one of them a fiew nedles with which he appeared much gratified, in the evening late they departed. Drewyer and Collins went in pursute of some Elk the tracks of which Collins had discovered yesterday; but it rained so hard they could not pursue them by the tracks, and returned unsucksessfull. Drewyer saw a fisher but it escaped from him among the fallen timber. Sergt. Ordway returned with the party from the Salt Camp which we have now avacuated. they brought with them the salt and utensels. our stock of salt is now about 20 Gallons; 12 Gallons we had secured in 2 small iron bound Kegs and laid by for our voyage. Gave Willard a dose of Scots pills; they opperated very well. Gibson still continus the bark 3 times a day and is on the recovery fast. The large brown Wolf is like that of the atlantic states, and are found only in the woody country on the Pacific Ocean embraceing the Mountains which pass the Columbia between the Great Falls an[d] Rapids of the same. The large and Small Wolves of [are] the inhabitents principally of the open country and the woodland on their borders, and resemble in their habits those of the plains of Missouri presisely. they are not abundant in the Plains of Columbia because there is but little game on which for them to subsist. [Lewis:] Saturday February 22ed. 1806. We were visited today by two Clatsop women and two boys who brought a parsel of excellent hats made of Cedar bark and ornamented with beargrass. two of these hats had been made by measures which Capt. Clark and myself had given one of the women some time since with a request to make each of us a hat; they fit us very well, and are in the form we desired them. we purchased all their hats and distributed them among the party. the woodwork and sculpture of these people as well as these hats and their waterproof baskets evince an ingenuity by no means common among the Aborigenes of America. in the evening they returned to their village and Drewyer accompanied them in their canoe in order to get the dogs which the Clatsops have agreed to give us in payment for the Elk they stole from us some weeks since. these women informed us that the small fish began to run which we suppose to be herring from their discription. they also informed us that their Chief, Conia or Comowooll, had gone up the Columbia to the valley in order to purchase wappetoe, a part of which he intended trading with us on his return. one of our canoes brake the cord by which it was attatched and was going off with the tide this evening; we sent Sergt. Pryor and a party after her who recovered and brought her back. our sick consisting of Gibson, Bratton, Sergt. Ordway, Willard and Mc, Neal are all on the recovery. we have not had as ma[n]y sick at any one time since we left Wood River. the general complaint seams to be bad colds and fevers, something I beleive of the influenza. The Antelope is found in the great plains of Columbia and are the same of those on the Missouri found in every part of that untimbered country. they are by no means as plenty on this side of the Rocky Mountains as on the other. the natives here make robes of their skins dressed with the hair on them. when the salmon begin to decline in the latter end of the summe[r] and Autumn the nat[i]ves leave the river, at least a majority and remove to the plains at some distance for the purpose of hunting the Antelope. they pursue them on horseback and shoot them with their arrows. The sheep1 1 Not a sheep, but the mountain goat (Haplocerus montanus; also known as Mazama montana), which has thick, soft wool like that of the sheep. Coues regards (L. and C., iii, p. 851) Lewis and Clark as discoverers of this animal, and first to describe it.—Ed. is found in various parts of the Rocky mountains, but most commonly in those parts which are timbered and steep, they are also found in greater abundance on the Chain of mountains w[h]ich form the commencement of the woody country on this coast and which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids. we have never met with this anamal ourselves but have seen many of their skins in possession of the natives dressed with the wooll on them and a[l]so seen the blankets which they manufacture of the wooll of this sheep. from the skin the animal appears to be about the size of the common sheep; of a white colour. the wooll is fine on most parts of the body but not so long as that of our domestic sheep. the wooll is also curled and thick. on the back and more particularly on the top of the neck the wooll is intermixed with a considerable proportion of long streight hairs. there is no wooll on a small part of the body behind the sholders on each side of the brisquit which is covered with a short fine hairs as in the domestic sheep. form [from] the signs which the Indians make in discribing this animal they have herect pointed horns, tho' one of our Engages La Page, assures us that he saw them in the black hills where the little Missouri passes them, and that they were in every rispect like the domestic sheep, and like them the males had lunated horns bent backwards and twisted. I should be much pleased at meeting with this animal, but have had too many proofs to admit a doubt of it's existing and in considerable numbers in the mountains near this coast. the Beaver and common Otter have before been mentioned in treating of the occupations of the natives in hunting fishing &amp;c. these do not differ from those of other parts of the Continent. [Clark:] Saturday February 22nd.. 1806. We were visited today by two Clatsops women and two boys who brought a parcel of excellent hats made of Cedar bark, and ornemented with bear grass. two of those hats had been made by measure which Capt Lewis and my self had given a woman some time since, with a request to make each of us a hat; they fit us very well, and are in the form we desired them. we purchased the hats and distribeted them among the party. the woodwork and sculpture of these people as well as those hats and the water proof baskits evince an ingenuity by no means common among the Aborigenes of America. in the evining they returned to their village and Drewyer accompanied them in order to get some dogs &amp;c.. These women informed us that the small fish began to run which we suppose to be herring from their discription. they also informed us that their Chief Conia Comawool, had gorn up the Columbia to the Vally in order to purchase wappatoo, a part of which he entended tradeing with us on his return. our sick consisting of Gibson, Bratten, Willard Mc. Neal and Baptiest La Page is something better Serjt. Ordway is complaining of a coold &amp; headake. we have not had as many sick at one time since we left the settlements of the Illinois. the general complaint appears to be bad colds and fevers, with a violent pain in the head, and back, something I believe of the influenza. The Antelope is found in the great plains of Columbia and are the same with those of the Missouri found in every part of that untimbered country. they are by no means as plenty on this side of the Rocky Mountains as on the other. the nativs here make robes of their skins dressed withe the hair on them. when the salmon begin to decline in the latter end of summer and autumn, the nativs leave the river, at least a majority and move out into the plains at some distance for the purpose of hunting the Antelope. they pursue them on hors back and shute them with their arrows. The Sheep is found in various parts of the Rocky Mountains, but most commonly on those parts which are timbered and steep. they are also found in greater abundance on the chain of Mountains which forms the commencement of the woody country on this coast and which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids. we have never met with this animal ourselves but have seen many of their skins in the possession of the nativs dressed with the wool on them and also seen and have the blankets which they manufacture of the wool of this sheep. from the skin the animal appears to be about the size of the common sheep; of a white colour. the wool is fine on most parts of the body, but not so long as that of the domestic sheep; the wool is also curled and thick. on the back and more particularly on the top of the neck the wool is intermixed with a considerable proportion of long streight hair. there is no wool on a small part ot the body behind the sholders on each side of the brisquit which is covered with a short fine hairs as in the domestic sheep. from the signs which the Indians make in discribing this animale they have herect pointed horns, tho' one of our Engages Lapage, assures us that he saw them in the Black hills where the Little Missouri river passes them, and that they were in every respect like our domestic Sheep, and like them the Mail had lunated horns bent backwards and twisted. I should be much pleased at meeting with this animal. but have had too maney proofs to admit a doubt of it's existing and in considerable numbers in the Mountains on this coast. The Beaver and common otter have before been mentioned in treating of the Occupations of the nativs in hunting, fishing, &amp;c. these do not differ from those of other parts of the Continent. [Lewis:] Sunday February 23rd. 1806. not anything transpired during this day worthy of particular notice. our sick are all on the recovery, except Sergt. Ordway who is but little wo[r]se and not very ill tho' more so than any of the others. the men have provided themselves very amply with mockersons and leather cloathing, much more so indeed than they ever have since they have been on this voige. The Sea Otter is found on the sea coast and in the salt water. this anamal when fully grown is as large as a common mastive dog. the ears and eyes are remarkab[l]y small, particularly the former which is not an inch in length thick fleshey and pointed covered with short hair. the tail is about 10 inches in length thick where it joins the body and tapering to a very sharp point; in common with the body it is covered with a deep fur particularly on the upper side, on the under part the fur is not so long, the legs are remarkably short and the feet which have five toes each are broad large and webbed.1 1 The sea-otter (Enhydris marina) was first encountered by the expedition below the Dalles, Oct. 24, 1805. This description of their feet applies to the hind ones only; the fore feet are small, something like a cat's paws. This animal is now very rare on the Northwest coast.—Ed. the legs are covered with fur and the feet with short hair. the body of this animal is long and nearly of the same thickness throughout. from the extremity of the tail to that of the nose they will measure 5 feet or upwards. the colour is a uniform dark brown and when in good order and season perfectly black and glossey. it is the riches[t] and I think the most delicious fur in the world at least I cannot form an idea of any more so. it is deep thick silkey in the extreem and strong. the inner part of the fur when opened is lighter than the surface in it's natural position. there are some fine black and shining hairs intermixed with the fur which are reather longer and add much to it's beauty. the nose, about the eyes ears and forehead in some of these otter is of a lighter colour, sometimes a light brown. those parts in the young sucking Otter of this species is sometimes of a cream coloured white, but always much lighter than the other parts. the fur of the infant Otter is much inferior in point of colour and texture to that of the full grown otter, or even after it has been weaned. there is so great a difference that I have for some time supposed it a different animal; the Indians called the infant Otter Spuck, and the full grow[n] or such as had obtained a coat of good fur, E-luck'-ke. this still further confirmed the opinion of their being distinct species; but I have since learned that the Spuck is the young Otter. the colour of the neck, body, legs and tail is a dark lead brown. The mink is found in the woody country on this coast, and dose not differ in any particu[lar] from those of the Atlantic coast. the seal are found here in great numbers, and as far up the Columbia river as the great falls, above which there are none. I have reason to beleive from the information of the men that there are several species of the seal on this coast and in the river but what the difference is I am unable to state not having seen them myself sufficiently near for minute inspection nor obtained the different kinds to make a comparison. the skins of such as I have seen are covered with a short coarse stiff and glossey hair of a redish bey brown colour. tho' the anamal while in the water or as we saw them frequently in the river appear to be black and spoted with white sometimes, when we first saw those animals at the great falls and untill our arrival at this place we conseived they were the Sea Otter. but the indians here have undeceived us. I am not much acquainted with the Seal but suppose that they are the same common also to the Atlantic Ocean in the same parallel of latitude. the skins I have seen are precisely such as our trunks are frequently covered with. [Clark:] Sunday February 23rd. 1806. Not any thing transpired deser[v]ing particular notice. our sick are all on the recovery. the men have provided themselves verry amply with mockersons &amp; leather clothing, much more so indeed than they have ever been since they have been on the voyage. The Sea Otter is found only on the sea coast and in the salt water. Those animals which I took to be the sea otter from the Great Falls of the Columbia to the mouth, proves to be the Phosia or Seal which at a little distance has every appearance of the sea otters. The sea otter when fully grown is as large as the common mastif dog, the ears and Eyes are remarkably small, particularly the former which is not an inch in length thick fleshy and pointed covered with short hair. the tail is about 10 inches in length thick where it joins the body and tapering to a very sharp point; in common with the body it is covered with a deep for particularly on the upper side, on the under part the fur is not so long. the legs are remarkably short and the feat which have five toes each are broad large and webbed. the legs are covered with fur and the feet with short hair. the body of this animal is long and nearly of the same thickness throughout. from the extremity of the tail to that of the nose they will measure 5 feet or upwards. the colour is of a uniform dark brown, and when in good order and season perfectly Black and Glossy. it is the richest and I think the most delightfull fur in the world at least I cannot form an idea of any more so. it is deep thick silky in the extream and strong. the inner part of the fur when open is lighter than the surface in its natural position. there are some fine black shineing hairs intermixed with the fur which are reather longer and add much to its beauty. the nose, about the eyes, ears and forehead in some of those otter is of a light colour, sometimes a light brown. those parts in the young suckling otters of this species is sometimes of a creem colour'd white, but always much lighter than the other parts. the fur of the infant otter is much inferior in point of colour, and texture, to that of the full grown otter, or even after it has been weened. there is so great a difference that I have for some time supposed it a different animal; the Indians call the infant otter spuck, and the full grown or such as had obtained a coat of good fur, Eluck'ko. this still further confirmed the opinion of their being distinct species; but I have since lerned that the Spuck is the young otter. the colour of the neck, body, legs and tail is a dark lead brown. The Mink is found in the woody country on this coast and does not differ in any particular from those of the Atlantic coasts. The Seal or Phoca are found here in great numbers, and as far up the Columbia as the great Falls, above which there are none. I have reasons to believe from the information of the men that there are several species of the Phoca on this coast and in the river, but what the difference is I am unable to state not haveing seen them myself sufficiently near for manute inspection nor obtain the different kinds to make a comparison. the skins of such as I have seen are covered with a short thick coarse glossy hair of a redish bey brown colour. tho' the animal while in the water, or as we saw them frequently in the river appear to be black and spoted with white sometimes. I am not much acquainted with the seal but suppose that they are the same common also to the atlantic Ocian in the same parrelal of Latitude. the skins, or those which I have seen are presisely such as trunks are frequently covered with. the flesh of this animal is highly prized by the nativs who swinge the hair off and then roste the flesh on sticks before the fire. [Lewis:] Monday February 24th. 1806. Our sick are still on the recovery. Shannon &amp; Labuishe returned in the forenoon; they had killed no Elk and reported that they beleived the Elk have retired from their former haunts and gone further back in the country to a considerable distance from this place. this is very unwelcome information for poor and inferior as the flesh of this animal is it is our principal dependance for subsistence. This evening we were visited by Comowooll the Clatsop Chief and 12 men women and children of his nation. Drewyer came a passenger in their canoe, and brought with him two dogs. The chief and his party had brought for sail a Sea Otter skin some hats, stergeon and a species of small fish which now begin to run, and are taken in great quantities in the Columbia R. about 40 miles above us by means of skiming or scooping nets. on this page I have drawn the likeness of them as large as life; it [is] as perfect as I can make it with my pen and will serve to give a general idea of the fish.1 1 For this sketch see Clark's entry for Feb. 25, 1806, post.—Ed. . the rays of the fins are boney but not sharp tho' somewhat pointed. the small fin on the back next to the tail has no rays of bone being a thin membranous pellicle. the fins next to the gills have eleven rays each. those of the abdomen have eight each, those of the pinna-ani are 20 and 2 half formed in front. that of the back has eleven rays. all the fins are of a white colour. the back is of a bluish duskey colour and that of the lower part of the sides and belley is of a silvery white. no spots on any part. the first bone of the gills next behi[n]d the eye is of a bluis[h] cast, and the second of a light goald colour nearly white. the puple of the eye is black and the iris of a silver white. the under jaw exceeds the uper; and the mouth opens to great extent, folding like that of the herring. it has no teeth. the abdomen is obtuse and smooth; in this differing from the herring, shad, anchovey &amp;c. of the Malacopterygious Order &amp; Class Clupea, to which however I think it more nearly allyed than to any other altho' it has not their accute and serrate abdomen and the under jaw exceeding the upper. the scales of this little fish are so small and thin that without minute inspection you would suppose they had none. they are filled with roes of a pure white colour and have scarcely any perceptable alimentary duct. I find them best when cooked in Indian stile, which is by roasting a number of them together on a wooden spit without any previous preperation whatever. they are so fat they require no additional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever tasted, even more delicate and lussious than the white fish of the lakes which have heretofore formed my standart of excellence among the fishes. I have heard the fresh anchovey much extolled but I hope I shall be pardoned for beleiving this quite as good. the bones are so soft and fine that they form no obstruction in eating this fish. we purchased all the articles which these people brought us; we suffered these people to remain all night as it rained, the wind blew most violently and they had their women and children with them; the latter being a sure pledge of their pacific dispositions, the Sturgeon which they brought us was also good of it's kind. we determine to send a party up the river to procure some of those fish, and another in some direction to hunt Elk as soon as the weather will permit. [Clark:] Monday February 24th. 1806 Our sick are still on the recovery. Shannon and Labiche returned in the forenoon, they had killed no Elk, and reported that they believe the Elk have returned from their former haunts and gorn further back in the mountains to a considerable distance from this place. this is very unwelcom information for poore and inferior as the flesh of this animale is, it is our principal dependance for subsistance. The Rackoon is found in the woody country on the coast in considerable quantities. the nativs take a fiew of them in snars, and deadfalls; tho' appear not to value their skins much, and but seldom prepare them for robes. The large Grey squirel appear to be a native of a narrow tract of Country on the upper side of the mountains below the Great falls of Columbia which is pritty well covered in many parts with a species of white oak. this animal is much larger than the Gray squirel of our Country, it resembles it much in form and colour. it is as large as the Fox squirel of the South Atlantic States. the tail is reather larger than the whole of the body and head, the hair of which is long and tho' inserted on all sides reispect the horozontal one. the eyes are black, whiskers black and long. the back, sides, head, tale and outer parts of the legs are of a blue lead colour grey. the breast, belly, and inner parts of the legs are of a pure white. the hair is short as that of the Fox squirel but is much finer and intermixed with a propotion of fur. the nativs make great use of those skins in forming their robes. this squirel subsists principally on the acorn and filburts, which last also grow abundantly in the Oak Country. The small brown Squirel is a butifull little animal about the size of the red squirel of the E. states or something larger than the ground squirel of the U. States, the tail is as long as the body and neck formed somewhat flat. the eyes black, whiskers long and black but not abundant. the back, sides, head, neck and outer parts of the legs are of a redish dark brown. the throat, breast, belly and inner parts of the legs are of a pale brick red. the tail is a mixture of black and fox coloured red in which the black prodomonates in the middle, and the other on the edges and extremity. the hair of the body is about 1/2 inch long and so fine and soft that it has the appearance of fur. the hair of the tail is coarser and double as long. this animal subsists principally on the seeds of various species of pine and are always found in the piney Country. they are common to the tract of woody country on this coast. they lodge in clefts of rocks, holes in the Ground, old stumps of trees and the hollow trunks of falling timber; in this respect resemble the rat always haveing their habitation in or near the earth. The Small Grey Squirel common to every part of the Rocky Mountains which is timbered, differ from the dark brown squirel just discribed only in its colour. it's back, neck, sides, head, tail and outer sides of the legs are of brown lead coloured Grey; the tail has a slight touch of the fox colour near the extremity of some of the hairs. the throat, belly, breast, and inner part of the legs are of the colour of tanners ooze and have a narrow stripe of black commencing behind each sholder and extending longitudinally for about 3 inches between the colours of the side &amp; belly. their habits are also the same with the dark brown squirel of this neighbourhood, and like them are extreamly nimble and active. The Ground Squirel is found in various parts of the country as well the Praries as wood lands, and is one of the fiew animals which we have seen in every part of our voyage. it differs not at all from those of the U. States. The Barking Squirel and handsom Ground Squirel of the Plains on the East Side of the Rocky Mountains are not found in the plains of the Columbia.1 1 The various kinds of squirrels here mentioned are thus identified by Coues (L. and C., iii, pp. 854–860): The large gray, Sciurus fossor; the fox, S. cinereus; the small gray, S. richardsoni; the small brown, S. douglasi; the red, S. hudsonius; the ground, or chipmunk, Tamias townsendi—and that of the Eastern States, T. striatus. The "barking squirrel" is really the prairie-dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). —Ed. This evening we were visited by Comowooll the Clatsop Chief and 14 men women and children of his nation. Drewyer came a pasinger in their canoe and brought with him two dogs. the chief and his party had brought for sale a sea otter skin, some hats, sturgeon and a species of fish which now begins to run and are taken in Great quantities in the Columbia River about 40 miles above us by means of skiming or scooping nets. Capt Lewis gave an old Coat and Vest for a sea otter skin, we purchased several hats of the Indian manufactry and distributed them among the party. we also purchased a fiew of the small fish which we found deliciously fine. [Lewis:] Tuesday February 25th. 1806. It continued to rain and blow so violently that there was no movement of the party today. the Indians left us in the morning on their return to their village. Willard somewhat worse the other Invalledes on the ricovery. I am mortifyed at not having it in my power to make more celestial observations since we have been at Fort Clatsop, but such has been the state of the weather that I have found it utterly impracticable. The Rackoon is found in the woody country on this coast in considerable quantities. the natives take a few of them in snars and deadfalls; tho' appear not to vallue their skins much, and but seldom prepare them for robes. The large grey squirrel appears to be a native of a narrow tract of country on the upper side of the mountains just below the grand falls of Columbia which is pretty well covered in many parts with a species of white oak. in short I beleive this squirrel to be coextensive with timber only, as we have not seen them in any part of the country where pine forms the majority of the timber, or in which the oak dose not appear. this animal is much larger than the grey squirrel of our country it resembles it much in form and colours. it is as large as the fox squirrel of the Southern Atlantic states. the tail is reather longer than the whole length of the body and head the hair of which is long and tho' inserted on all sides reispect the horizontal ones only. the eyes are black. whiskers black and long. the back, sides, head, tail and outer part of the legs are of a blue leadcoloured grey. the breast belley and inner part of the legs are of a pure white. the hair is short as that of the fox-squirrel but is much finer and intermixed with a proportion of fur. the natives make great use of these skins in forming their robes. this squirrel subsists principally on the acorn and filbird [filbert] which last also grows abundantly in the oak country. The small brown squirrel is a beautifull little animal about the size and form of the red squirrel of the Eastern Atlantic states and western lakes. the tail is as long as the body and neck, formed like that of the red squirrel or somewhat flat. the eyes black. whiskers long and black but not abundant. the back, sides, head, neck and outer part of the legs are of a redish dark brown. the throat, breast, belley and inner part of the legs are of a pale brick red. the tail is a mixture of black and fox coloured red in which the black predominates in the midle and the other on the edges and extremity. the hair of the body is about 1/2 an inch long and so fine and soft that it has the appearance of fur. the hair of the tail is coarser and doubly as long, this animal subsists principally on the seeds of various species of pine, and are always found in the piny country they are common to the tract of woody country on this coast. they lodge in clifts of rocks, holes in the ground old stumps of trees and the hollow trunks of fallen timber; in this rispect resembling the rat, always having their habitati[o]n in or near the earth, the small grey squirrel common to every part of the rocky mountain which is timbered, difirs from the dark brown squirrel just discribed only in it's colour. it's back, sides, neck, head tail and outer side of the legs are of a brown lead coloured grey; the tail has a slight touch of the fox colour near the extremity of some of the hairs. the throat, breast, belley, and inner parts of the legs are of the colour of tanner's ooze and have a narrow stripe of black, commencing just behi[n]de each sholder and exten[d]ing longitudinaly for about 3 inches betwen the colours of the sides and belley. their habids are also the same of the dark brown squirrel of this neighbourhood and like them are extreemly nimble and active. the ground squirrel is found in every part of the country, as well the praries as woodlands, and is one of the few animals which we have seen in every part of our voyage. it differs not at all from those of the U'States. the barking squirrel and handsome ground squirrel of the plains on the East side of the rocky mountains are not found in the plains of Columbia. [Clark:] Tuesday February 25th. 1806. It continued to rain and blow so violently that there was no movement of the party today. the Indians left us in the morning on their return to their village. Willard somewhat worse the others are on the recovery. we are mortified at not haveing it in our power to make more celestial observations since we have been at Fort Clatsop, but such has been the state of the weather that we have found it utterly impracti[c]able. I purchased of the Clatsops this morning about half a bushel of small fish which they had cought about 40 miles up the Columbia in their scooping nets. as this is an uncommon fish to me and one which no one of the party has ever seen. on the next page I have drawn the likeness of them as large as life; it's as perfect as I can make it with my pen and will serve to give a general idea of the fish. the rays of the fins are boney but not sharp tho' somewhat pointed. the small fin on the back next to the tail has no rays of bone being a thin membranous pellicle. the fins next to the gills have eleven rays each. those of the abdomen have Eight each, those of the pinna ani are 20 and 2 half formed in front. that of the back has eleven rays. all the fins are of a white colour. the back is of a blueish duskey colour and that of the lower part of the sides and belly is of a silvery white. no spots on any part. the first of the gills next behind the eye is of a blueish cast, and the second of a light gold colour nearly white. the puple of the eye is black and the iris of a silver white. the under jaw exceeds the upper; and the mouth opens to a great extent, folding like that of the Herring. it has no teeth. the abdomen is obtuse and smooth, in this differing from the herring, shad, anchovey &amp;c. of the Malacapterygious order and class clupea, to which however I think it more nearly allyed than to any other altho' it has not their accute and serrate abdomen and the under jaw exceeding the upper. the scales of this little fish are so small and thin that without manute inspection you would suppose they had none. they are filled with roes of a pure white colour and have scercely any perceptable alimentary duct. I found them best when cooked in Indian stile, which is by rosting a number of them together on a wooden spit without any previous preparation whatever. they are so fat that they require no aditional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever tasted, even more delicate and lussious than the white fish of the Lakes which have heretofore formed my standard of excellence among the fishes. I have herd the fresh anchovey much extoll'd but I hope I shall be pardoned for believeing this quite as good. the bones are so soft and fine that they form no obstruction in eating this fish.1 1 This is the Eulachon, which Clark is quite correct in saying is the most delicate in flavor of any fish in the world—a statement almost identical with something I had once written myself. Clark's description was written thirty-one years before Sir John Richardson's (1836); but Richardson called it Salmo pacificus, wrongly taking it for a trout, as Clark did. It belongs to the smelt family, and is related to the Capelin, and is far more delicate than any trout. It was next noticed by the Pacific Railroad survey in 1858, and named by Girard Thaleichthys stevensi. Its present scientific name is T. pacificus.—David Starr Jordan, Leland Stanford Junior University. [Lewis:] Wednesday February 26th. 1806. This morning we dispatched Drewyer and two men in our Indian canoe up the Columbia River to take sturgeon and Anchovey. or if they were unsuccessfull in fishing we directed them to purchase fish from the natives for which purpose we had furnished them with a few articles such as the natives are pleased with. we also Sent Shields, Joseph Fields and Shannon up the NetuI to hunt Elk. and directed Reubin Fields and some others to hunt in the point towards the praries of Point Adams thus we hope shortly to replenish our stock of provision which is now reduced to a mere minnamum. we have th[r]ee days provision only in store and that of the most inferior dryed Elk a little tainted, a comfortable prospect for good living. Sewelel is the Chinnook and Clatsop name for a small animal found in the timbered country on this coast. it is more abundant in the neighbourhood of the great falls and rapids of the Columbia than immediately on the coast. the natives make great use of the skins of this animal in forming their robes, which they dress with the fur on them and attatch together with sinews of the Elk or deer. I have never seen the animal and can therefore discribe it only from the skin and a slight view which some of our hunters have obtained of the living animal.1 1 The sewellel (Haplodon rufus) belongs to a family which seems to be intermediate between those of the squirrel and the beaver. This animal is much like the muskrat. The name "sewellel" was applied to the robes which they made from the skins; the animal is called "show'tl," by some Indian tribes.—Ed. the skin when dressed is from 14 to 18 inches in length and from 7 to 9 in width; the tail is always severed from the skin in forming their robes I cannot therefore say what form or length it is. one of the men informed me that he thought it reather short and flat. that he saw one of them run up a tree like a squirrel and that it returned and ran into a hole in the ground. the ears are short thin pointed and covered with short fine hair. they are of a uniform colour, a redish brown; tho' the base of the long hairs, which exceed the fur but little in length, as well as the fur itself is of a dark colour for at least two thirds of it's length next to the skin. the fur and hair are very fine, short, thickly set and silkey. the ends of the fur and tips of the hair being of the redish brown that colour predominates in the ordinary appearance of the animal. I take this animal to be about the size of the barking squirrel of the Missouri. and beleive most probably that it is of the Mustela genus, or perhaps the brown mungo itself. I have indeavoured in many instances to make the indians sensible how anxious I was to obtain one of these animals entire, without being skined, and offered them considerable rewards to furnish me with one, but have not been able to make them comprehend me. I have purchased several of the robes made of these skins to line a coat which I have had made of the skins of the tiger cat. they make a very pleasant light lining. the Braro so called by the French engages is an animal of the civit genus and much resembles the common badger. this is an inhabitant of the open plains of the Columbia as they are of those of the Missouri but are sometimes also found in the woody country. they burrow in the hard grounds of the plains with surprising ease and dexterity an[d] will cover themselves in the ground in a very few minutes, they have five long fixed nails on each foot; those of the forefeet are much the longest; and one of those on each hind foot is double like those of the beaver. they weigh from 14 to 18 lbs. the body is reather long in proportion to it's thickness. the forelegs remarkably large and muscular and are formed like the ternspit dog. they are short as are also the hind legs. they are broad across the sholders and brest. the neck short. the head is formed much like the common fist dog only that the skull is more convex. the mouth is wide and furnished with sharp streight teeth both above and below, with four sharp streight pointed tusks, two in the upper and two in the lower jaw. the eyes are black and small. whiskers are plased in four points on each side near the nose and on the jaws near the opening of the mouth. the ears are very short wide and appressed as if they had ben cut off. the apperture through them to the head is remarkably small. the tail is about 4 inches long; the hair longest on it at it's junction with the body and becoming shorter towards it's extremity where it ends in an accute point. the hairs of the body are much longer on the side and rump than any other part, which gives the body an apparent flatness, particularly when the animal rests on it's belley. this hair is upwards of 3 inches in length particularly on the rump where it extends so far towards the point of the tail that it almost conceals the shape of that part and gives to the whole of the hinder part of the body the figure of an accute angled triangle of which the point of the tail forms the accute angle. the small quantity of coarse fur which is intermixed with the hair is of a redish pale yellow. the hair of the back, sides, upper part of the neck and tail, are of a redish light or pale yellow for about 2/3rds. of their length from the skin, next black, and then tiped with white; forming a curious mixture of grey and fox-coloured red with a yellowish hue. the belley flanks and breast are of the foxcoloured redish yellow. the legs black. the nails white the head on which the hair is short, is variagated with black and white. a narrow strip of white commences on the top of the nose about 1/2 an inch from it's extremity and extends back along the center of the forehead and neck nearly to the sholders. two stripes of black succeed the white on either side imbracing the sides of the nose, the eyes, and extends back as far as the ears. two other spots of black of a ramboidal figure are placed on the side of the head near the ears and between it [them] and the opening of the mouth. two black spots also immediately behind the ears. the other parts of the head white. this animal feeds on flesh, roots, bugs, and wild fruits. it is very clumsy and runs very slow. I have in two instances out run this animal and caught it. in this rispect they are not much more fleet than the porcupine. [Clark:] Wednesday February 26th 1806. This morning we dispatched Drewyer and two men in our indian canoe up the Columbia River to take sturgion and anchovey. or if they were unsucksessfull in fishing we directed them to purchase fish from the nativs, for which purpose we had furnished them with a fiew articles such as the nativs are pleased with. we also sent Shields Jo. Field and Shannon up the Netul to hunt Elk. and directed Reubin Field and some other man to hunt in the point towards the Praries &amp; Point Adams. thus we hope shortly to replenish our stock of provisions which is now reduced to a mear minnamum. we have three days provisions only in store and that of the most inferior dried Elk a little tainted, what a prospect for good liveing at Fort Clatsop at present. Sewelel is the Clatsop and Chinnook name for a small animal found in the timbered country on this coast. it is more abundant in the neighbourhood of the great falls and rapids of the Columbia than imediately on the coast. the nativs make great use of the skins of this animal in forming their robes, which they dress with the fur on them and attached together with the sinears [sinews] of the Elk or Deer. I have never seen the animale and can therefore only discribe it from the skin and a slight view which some of our party have obtained of the liveing animal. the skin when dressed is from 14 to 18 inches in length, and from 7 to 9 in width; the tail is always severed from the body in forming their robes, I cannot therefore say in what form or length it is. one of the men informed me that he thought it reather short and flat. that he saw one of them run up a tree like a squirel, and that it returned and ran into a hole in the ground. the ears are short, thin, pointed and covered with short fine hair. they are of uniform colour, a redish brown; tho the base of the long hairs, exceed the fur but little in length, as well as the fur itself is of a dark colour for at least 2/3ds. of it's length next to the skin, the fur and hair are very fine, short, thickly set, and silky. the ends of the fur and tips of the hair is of a redish brown, that colour prodominates in the ordinary appearance of the animale. I took this animal to be about the size of the barking squirel of the Missouri. and believe most probably that it is of the Mustela genus, or perhaps the brown mungo itself. I have in maney instances endeavured to make the nativs sensiable how anxious I was to obtain one of those animals entire, without being skined, and offered them rewards to furnish me with one, but have not been able to make them comprehend me. we have purchased several of the roabs made of those skins to loin [line] a westcoat of the sea otter, which I have made and Capt Lewis a Tiger cat skin coat loined with them also, they make a very pleasant light lighting. The Rat in the rocky mountains on its west side are like those on the upper part of the Missouri in and near those mountains and have the distinguishing trait of possessing a tail covered with hair like other parts of the body; one of these we caught at the white bear Islands in the beginning of July last and then partially discribed. There is rats in this neighbourhood but I have not seen them it is most probable that they are like those of the Atlantic States, or at least the native rat of our country which have no hair on their tail. this speces we found on the Missouri as far up it as the woody country extended. it is as large as the common European house rat or reather larger is of a lighter colour, bordering more on the lead or drab colour, the hair longer; and the female has only four tits which are placed far back near the hinder legs. this rat I have seen in the southern parts of the state of Kentucky &amp; west of the Miami.1 1 The two species of native wood-rat: that with a smooth tail, Neotoma floridana; that with a bushy tail, N. cinerea.—Ed. The Mouse and Mole of this neighbourhood are the same as those native animals with us. The Panther is found indifferently either in the Great Plains of Columbia the Western side of the Rocky Mountains or on this coast in the timbered country. it is precisely the same animal common to the Atlantic States, and most commonly met with on our frontiers or unsettled parts of the country. this animal is scerce in the country where they exist and are so remarkable shye and watchfull that it is extreamly dificuelt to kill them. The Polecat is found in every part of the country. they are very abundant on some parts of the Columbia, particularly in the neighbourhood of the Great falls &amp; Narrows of that river, where they live in the clifts along the river &amp; feed on the offal of the Indian fishing shores. they are the same as those of other parts of North America.1 1 "Polecat" is quite often incorrectly applied to the skunk (Mephitis mephitica) —Ed. [Lewis:] Thursday February 27th. 1806. Reubin Fields returned this evening and had not killed anything. he reports that there are no Elk towards point Adams. C[o]llins who had hunted up the Netul on this side returned in the evening having killed a buck Elk. Willard still continues very unwell the other sick men have nearly recovered. Gutridge and Mc, Neal who have the pox are recovering fast, the former nearly well. The rat in the Rocky mountain on it's West side are like those on the upper part of the Missouri in and near those mountains and have the distinguishing trait of possessing a tail covered with hair like other parts of the body; one of those we caught at the White-bear Islands in the beginning of July last and was then discribed. I have seen the nests of those in this neighbourhood but not the animal. I think it most probable that they are like those of the Atlantic States or at least the native rat of our country which have no hair on the tail. this species we found on the Missouri as far up it as the woody country extended. it is as large as the common European house rat or reather larger, is of a lighter colour bordering more on the lead or drab colour, the hair longer; and the female has only four tits which are placed far back near the hinder legs. this rat I have observed in the Western parts of the State of Georgia and also in Madison's cave in the state of Virginia. the mouse and mole of this neighbourhood are the same as those native animals with us. The Panther is found indifferently either in the Great Plains of Columbia, the Western side of the rocky mountains or on this coast in the timbered country. it is precisely the same animal common to the Atlantic coast, and most commonly met with on our frontiers or unsettled parts of the country. this animal is scarce in the country where they exist and are so remarkable shye and watchfull that it is extreemly difficult to kill them. [Clark:] Thursday February 27th 1806. Reubin Field returned this evening and had not killed anything, he reported that there were no Elk towards Point Adams. Collins who had hunted up the Netul on this side returned in the evening haveing killed a buck Elk. Willard still continues very unwell the other sick men have nearly recovered. Goodrich &amp; McNeal who have the Pox are recovering fast, the former nearly well. LaPage complaining. The Braro so called by the French engages is an animal of the civit genus and much resembles the common badger. this is an enhabitent of the open plains of the Columbia as they are of those of the Missouri, but are sometimes also found in the woody country. they burrow in the hard Grounds in the Plains with surprising ease and dexterity and will cover themselves in the Ground in a very fiew minits. they have five long fixed nails on each foot; those of the [f]ore feet are much the longest; and one of those on each hind foot is double like those of the beaver. they weigh from 14 to 2olbs. the body is reather long in perportion to its thickness. the fore legs remarkably large and muscular and are formed like the turnspit dog. they are short as also the hind legs. they are broad across the sholders and breast. the neck short; the head is formed much like the common fistdog only that the skull is more convex, the mouth is wide and furnished with long sharp teeth, both above and below, and with four sharp streight pointed tushes, two in the upper and two in the lower jaw. the eyes are black and small. Whiskers are placed in four points on each side near the nose and on the jaws near the opening of the mouth. the ears are very short wide and oppressed as if they had been cut off. the appertere through them to the head is remarkably small; the tail is about 4 inches long; the hair longest on it at it's junction, with the body and becomeing shorter towards it's extremity where it ends in an accute point. the hairs of the body are much longer on the sides and rump than any other part, which givs the body an appearent flatness, particularly when the animal rests on it's belly. this hair is upwards of 3 inches in length, particularly on the rump where it extends so far towards the point of the tail, that it almost conceals the shape of that part and givs to all the hinder part of the body an accute angled triangle of which the point of the tail forms the accute angle. the small quantity of fur which is intermixed with the hair is of a redish pale yellow. the hair of the back, sides upper part of the neck and tail, are of redish light or pale yellow fox about two thirds of their length from the skin, next black, and then tiped with white; forming a curious mixture of grey and fox colourd red with a yellowish hue. the belly flanks and breast are of the fox coloured redish yellow. the legs black, the nails white. the head on which the hair is short is varigated with black and white. a narrow strip of white commences on the top of the nose about half an inch from its extremity and extends back along the center of the forehead and neck nearly to the sholders. two stripes of black suckceed the white on either side, imbraceing the side of the nose, the eyes, and extends back as far as the ears. two other spots of black of a romboidal figure are placed on the side of the head near the ears and between them and the opening of the mouth. two black spots also imediately behind the ears. the other part of the head white. this animal feeds on flesh, roots, bugs and wild fruits, it is very clumsy and runs very slow, depending more on burr[y]ing to secure it self than running. I have in several instances out run and caught this animal. in this respect they are not much more fleet than the porcupine. [Lewis:] Friday February 28th. 1806. Reubin Fields and Collins set out this morning early on a hunting excurtion. Kuskelar a Clatsop man and his wife visited us today. they brought some Anchovies, Sturgeon, a beaver robe, and some roots for sail tho' they asked so high a price for every article that we purchased nothing but a part of a Sturgeon for which we gave a few fishing hooks, we suffered them to remain all night. Shields Jos. Fields and Shannon returned late this evening having killed five Elk. tho' two of them ar[e] on a mountain at a considerable distance. we ordered these hunters to return early in the morning and continue their hunt, and Sergt. Gass to take a party and go in quest of the Elk which they had killed. the hunters inform us that the Elk are tolerable plenty near the mountains about 9 or ten miles distant. Kuskelar brought a dog which Cruzatte had purchased. The hare on this side of the Rocky mountains is exclusively the inhabitant of the great Plains of Columbia, as they are of those of the Missouri East of these mountains. they weigh from 7 to eleven pounds.1 1 This is the jack-rabbit (Lepus campestris), which turns white in winter.—Ed. the measure of one which weighed ten lbs. was as follows. from the extremity of the hinder, to that of the fore feet when extended 3 F. length from nose to the extremity of the tail 2 F. 2.I. hight when standing erect 1 F. 3 I. girth of the body 1 F. 4 I. length of tail 6 1/2 I. length of ear 5 1/2 I. width of d°. 3 1/8 I. from the hip to the extremity of toe of the hind foot 1 F. 4 1/4 I. the eye is large and prominent. the pupil is circular, of a deep sea green and occupys one third of the diameter of the eye, the iris is of a bright yellowish silver colour. the ears are placed far back on the head and very near each other, they are flexable and the animal moves them with great ease and quickness, and can dilate and throw them forward, or contract and fold them on his back at pleasure. the fold of the front of the ear is of a redish brown colour, the inner folds or those which lie together when the ears are th[r]own back, and which occupy 2/3rds. of the width of the ears are of a pure white except the tips of the ears for about an inch. the hinder folds or those which lie on the back are of a light grey. the head, neck, back, sholders, sides, &amp; outer part of the legs and thyes are of a lead coloured grey; the sides as they approach the belley become gradually more white. the belley, brest, and inner part of the legs and thyes are white, with a slight shade of the lead colour. the tail is round and bluntly pointed, covered with fine soft white fur not quite as long as on the other parts of the body. the body is covered with a deep fine soft close for. the colours here discribed are those which the animal assumes from the middle of April to the middle of November, the ballance of the year they are of a pure white, except the black and redish brown of the ears which never changes, a few redish brown spots are sometimes seen intermixed with the white, at this season, on their heads and upper part of the neck and sholders. the body of this animal is smaller and longer in proportion to it's hight than the rabbit. when it runs it carrys it's tail streight behind in the direction of it's body. they appear to run with more ease and bound with greater agility than any animal I ever saw. they are extreemly fleet and never burrow or take she[l]ter in the ground when pursued, it's teeth are like those of the rabbit as is also it's upper lip which is divided as high as the nose. it's food is grass, herbs, and in winter feeds much on the bark of several aromatic shrubs which grow in the plains and the young willow along the rivers and other watercourses. I have measured the leaps of this animal and find them commonly from 18 to 21 feet. they are generally found seperate, and never seen to asscociate in any number or more than two or three. the rabbit are the same of our country and are found indifferently either in the praries or woodlands. they are not very abundant in this country. The Pole-cat is also found in every part of the country, they are very abundant on some parts of the Columbia, particularly in the neighbourhood of the great falls and narrows of that river, where the[y] live in the clifts along the river and feed on the offal of the Indian fishing shores. these are the same as those of other parts of North America. [Clark:] Friday February 28th 1806 Reuben Field and Collins set out this morning early on a hunting excurtion up the Netul. Kus-ke-lar a Clatsop man his wife and a small boy (a slave, who he informed me was his cook, and offerd to sell him to me for beeds &amp; a gun) visited us today they brought some anchovies, sturgeon, a beaver robe, and some roots for sale tho' they asked such high prices for every article that we purchased nothing but a part of a sturgeon for which we gave a fiew fishing hooks. we suffered them to stay all night. Shields Jos. Field and Shannon returned late this evening haveing killed five Elk. tho' two of them are of [on] a mountain at a considerable distance. we ordered these hunters to return early in the morning and continue the hunt, and Sergt. Gass to take a party and go in quest of the Elk which they had killed. the hunters informed us that the Elk is tolerable plenty near the mountains about nine or ten miles distant. Kuskalaw brought a dog which Peter Crusat had purchased with his capo which this fellow had on.1 1 The capot, a short cloak with a hood, usually made from a blanket, was a customary garment of French engagées.—Ed. The Hare on this side of the Rocky Mountains is exclusively the inhabitents of the Great Plains of Columbia, as they are of those of the Missouri East of the Mountains. they weigh from 7 to 12 pounds. the measure of one which weighed 10 pounds, was as follows. from the extremity of the hinder, to that of the fore feet when extended 3 Feet. length from nose to the extremity of the tail 2 feet, 2 inches. Hight when standing erect 1 foot, 3 inches. Girth of the body 1 foot, 4 inches. length of tail 6 1/2 inches. length of ear 5 1/2 inches. width of ear 3 inches and 1/8. from the hip to the extremity of toe of the hind foot 1 foot 4 1/4 inches. the eye is large and prominent. the pupil is circular, of a deep sea green and occupies one third of the diamiter of the eye, the iris is of a bright yellowish silver colour. The ears are placed far back on the head and very near each other, they are flexable and the animal moves them with great ease and quickness and can dilate and throw them foward, or contract and fold them on his back at pleasure. the fold of the front of the ear is of a redish brown colour, the inner folds are those which lie together when the ears are thrown back, and which occupies 2/3ds. of the width of the ears of a pure white except the tips of the ears for about an inch. the hinder folds or those which lie on the back are of a light grey; the sides as they approach the belly become gradually more white, the belly brest, and inner part of the legs and thyes are white, with a slight shade of a lead colour. the Head, neck, back sholders, sides, outer part of the legs and thyes are of a Lead coloured Grey. the tail is bluntly pointed and round covered with fine soft white fur not quite as long as on the other parts of the body. the body is covered with a deep fine soft close fur. the colours here described are those which the animale assumes from the middle of April to the middle of November, the ballance of the year they are of a pure white, except the black and redish brown of the ears which never changes, a fiew redish brown spots are sometimes seen intermixed with the white, at this season on the heads and upper parts of the neck an[d] sholders. The body of this animal is smaller and longer in purpotion to it's hight than the Rabbit. when it runs it carrys its tail streight behind in the direction of it's body. they appear to run with more ease and bound with greater agility than any animal I ever saw. they are extreemly fleet and never burrow or take shelter in the grounds when pursued. it's teeth are like those of the rabit, as is also its upper lip which is divided as high as the nose. it's food is grass, herbs, and in winter feeds much on the bark of several arematic shrubs which grow in the plains and the young willows along the rivers and other water courses. I have measured the leaps of this animal and find them commonly from 18 to 22 feet. they are Generally found separate, and never seen to associate in any number or more than two or three. [Lewis:] Saturday March 1st. 1806. This morning Sergt. Gass and a party set out in quest of the Elk which had been killed by the hunters the day before yesterday. they returned with the flesh of three of them late in the evening. Thompson was left with the hunters in order to jurk and take care of the flesh of the remaining two. Kuskelar and wife left us about noon. he had a good looking boy of about 10 years of age with him who he informed us was his slave. this boy had been taken prisoner by the Killamucks from some nation on the Coast to the S.East of them at a great distance. like other Indian nations they adopt their slaves in their families and treat them very much as their own children. Reubin Fields and Collins who have been absent since yesterday morning returned without having killed any game. The birds of the Western side of the Rocky Mountain to the Pacific Ocean, for convenience I shall divide into two classes, which I shal designate from the habits of the birds, Terrestrial and Aquatic. The Grouse or Prarie hen is peculiarly the inhabitant of the Grait Plains of Columbia they do not differ from those of the upper portion of the Missouri, the tail of which is pointed or the feathers in it's center much longer than those on the sides. this species differs essentially in the construction of this part of their plumage from those of the Illinois which have their tails composed of f[e]athers of equal length.1 1 The Illinois species is that known as pinnated grouse (Tympanuchus americanus). Coues identifies the Pacific species as the sharp-tailed grouse (Pediocætes columbianus.) —Ed. in the winter season this bird is booted even to the first joint of it's toes. the toes are also curiously bordered on their lower edges with narrow hard scales which are placed very close to each other and extend horizontally about 1/8 of an inch on each side of the toes thus adding to the width of the tread which nature seems bountifully to have furnished them at this season for passing over the snow with more ease. in the summer season those scales fall off. they have four toes on each foot, their colour is a mixture of dark brown redish and yellowish brown and white confusedly mixed in which the redish brown prevails most on the upper parts of the body wings and tail and the white underneath the belley and lower parts of the breast and tail. they asscociate in large flocks in autumn &amp; winter and are frequently found in flocks of from five to six even in summer. They feed on grass, insects, the leaves of various shrubs in the plains and on the seeds of several species of spelts and wild rye which grow in the richer parts of the plains. in winter their food is the buds of the willow &amp; Cottonwood also the most of the native berries furnish them with food. The Indians of this neighbourhood eat the root of the Cattail or Cooper's flag. it is pleasantly taisted and appears to be very nutricious.2 2 Typhia latifolia.—C. V. Piper. the inner part of the root which is eaten without any previous preperation is composed of a number of capillary white flexable strong fibers among which is a mealy or starch like substance which readily desolves in the mouth and seperate from the fibers which are then rejected. it appears to me that this substance would make excellent starch; nothing can be of a purer white than it is. [Clark:] Saturday March the 1st 1806 This morning we despatched Sergt. Gass with 12 men in two canoes in quest of the Elk which had been killed by the hunters the day before yesterday. they returned with the flesh of three of them late in the evening. Thompson was left with the hunters in order to jurk and take care of the flesh of the remaining two. Kuskalar &amp;c. left us about noon. The boy which this Indian offered to sell to me is about 10 years of age. this boy had been taken prisoner by the Kilamox from some Nation on the Coast to the S.East of them at a great distance. like other Indian nations they adopt their slaves in their famelies and treat them very much like their own children. Reuben Field and Collins who had been absent since yesterday morning returned without killing any thing. The birds on the western side of the Rocky Mountain's to the Pacific Ocian for convenience I shall devide into from the habit of the birds, Terrestrial and Aquatic. i e Fowls of the air, and fowls of the water. The Prarie Hen sometimes called the Grouse is peculiarly the inhabitent of the Great Plains of Columbia. they do not differ from those of the upper portion of the Missouri, the tails of which is pointed or the feathers in its center much longer than those on the Sides. this species differ assentially in the construction of this part of their plumage from those of the Illinois which have their tail composed of feathers of equal length. in the winter season this berd is booted even to the first joint of it's toes. the toes are also curiously bordered on their lower edges with narrow hard scales which are placed very close to each other and extend horizontally about 1/8 of an inch on each side of the toe, thus adding to the width of the tread which nature seams bountifully to have furnished them with at this season for passing over the snow with more ease. in the summer season those scales fall off. they have four toes on each foot. their colour is a mixture of dark brown redish and yellowish brown and white confusedly mixed in which the redish brown prevails most on the upper parts of the body wings and tail. and the white underneath the belley and lower parts of the breast and tail. they associate in large flocks in autumn &amp; winter and are frequently found in flocks of from five to six even in summer. They feed on grass, insects, the leaves of various shrubs in the Praries, and on the seeds of several species of spelts and wild rye which grow in the richer parts of the Plains. in the winter their food is the buds of the willow and Cottonwood also the most of the native berries furnish them with food. they cohabit in flock &amp; the cocks fight very much at those seasons. [Lewis:] Sunday March 2nd. The diet of the sick is so inferior that they recover their strength but slowly. none of them are now sick but all in a state of convalessence with keen appetites and nothing to eat except lean Elk meat. late this evening Drewyer arrived with a most acceptable supply of fat Sturgeon, fresh Anchovies1 1 The fishing party brought with them some thousands of the small fish . . . which they call Ulken.—Gass (pp. 270, 271). and a bag containing about a bushel of Wappetoe. we feasted on Anchovies and Wappetoe. The Cock of the Plains2 2 Coues thinks the sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) was discovered by Lewis and Clark.—Ed. is found in the plains of Columbia and are in Great abundance from the entrance of the S.E. fork of the Columbia to that of Clark's river. this bird is about 2/3rds. the size of a turkey. the beak is large short curved and convex. the upper exceeding the lower chap. the nostrils are large and the b[e]ak black. the colour is an uniform mixture of dark brown reather borde[r]ing on a dove colour, redish and yellowish brown with some small black specks. in this mixture the dark brown prevails and has a slight cast of the dove colour at a little distance. the wider side of the large feathers of the wings are of a dark brown only. the tail is composed of 19 feathers of which that in the center is the longest, and the remaining 9 on each side deminish by pairs as they receede from the center; that is only one feather is equal in length to one equadistant from the center of the tail on the oposite side. the tail when foalded comes to a very sharp point and appears long in proportion to the body. in the act of flying the tail resembles that of a wild pigeon. tho' the motion of the wings is much that of the pheasant and Grouse. they have four toes on each foot of which the hinder one is short. the leg is covered with feathers about half the distance between the knee and foot. when the wing is expanded there are wide opening[s] between it's feathers the plumeage being so narrow that it dose not extend from one quill to the other. the wings are also proportionably short, reather more so than those of the pheasant or grouse. the habits of this bird are much the same as those of the grouse. only that the food of this fowl is almost entirely that of the leaf and buds of the pulpy leafed thorn; nor do I ever recollect seeing this bird but in the neighbourhood of that shrub. they sometimes feed on the prickley pear. the gizzard of it is large and much less compressed and muscular than in most fowls; in short it resembles a maw quite as much as a gizzard. when they fly they make a cackling noise something like the dunghill fowl. the following is a likeness of the head and beak.1 1 The drawing is here omitted, being a copy of that of Clark's for the same day; see post.—Ed. the flesh of the cock of the Plains is dark, and only tolerable in point of flavor. I do not think it as good as either the Pheasant or Grouse. it is invariably found in the plains. The feathers about it's head are pointed and stif. some hairs about the base of the beak. feathers short fine and stif about the ears. [Clark:] Sunday March 2nd 1806 The diet of the sick is so inferior that they recover their strength but slowly. none of them are now sick but all in a state of covelessence with keen appetites and nothing to eate except lean Elk meat. The nativs of this neighbourhood eate the root of the cattail or cooper's flag. it is pleasantly tasted and appears to be very nutricious. the inner part of the root which is eaten without any previous preperation is composed of a number of capellary white flexable strong fibers among which is a mealy or starch like substance which readily disolves in the mouth and separates from the fibers which are then rejected. it appears to me that this substance would make excellent starch, nothing can be of a pureer white than it is. This evening late Drewyer, Crusat &amp; Wiser returned with a most acceptable supply of fat sturgen, fresh anchoves and a bag containing about a bushel of Wappato. we feasted on the Anchovies and wappatoe. The Heath Cock or cock of the Plains is found in the Plains of Columbia and are in great abundance from the enterance of Lewis's river to the mountains which pass the Columbia between the Great falls and Rapids of that river. this fowl is about 3/4ths. the size of a turkey. the beak is large short curved and convex, the upper exceeding the lower chap. the nostrils are large and the baek black. the colour is a uniform mixture of dark brown reather bordering on a dove colour, redish and yellowish brown with some small black specks. in this mixture the dark brown provails and has a slight cast of the dove colour at a little distance. the wider side of the larger feathers of the wings are of a dark brown only. the tail is composed of 19 feathers of which that in the center is the longest, and the remaining 9 on each side deminish by pairs as they receede from the center; that is any one feather is equal in length to one of an equal distance from the center of the tail on the opposit side, the tail when folded comes to a very sharp point and appears long in perpotion to the body in the act of flying the tail resembles that of a wild pigeon, tho' the motion of the wings is much that of the Pheasant and Grouse. they have four toes on each foot of which the hinder one is short. the leg is covered with feathers about half the distance between the knee and foot. when the wings is expanded there are wide opening between it's feathers, the plumage being so narrow that it does not extend from one quill to another. the wings are also propotionably short, reather more so than those of the Pheasant or Grouse. the habits of this bird is much the same as those of the Prarie hen or Grouse. only that the food of this fowl is almost entirely that of the leaf and buds of the pulpy leafed thorn, nor do I ever recollect seeing the bird but in the neighbourhood of that shrub. The gizzard of it is large and much less compressed and muscular than in most fowls, in short it resembles a maw quite as much as a gizzard. When they fly they make a cackling noise something like the dunghill fowl. the flesh of this fowl is dark and only tolerable in point of flavour. I do not think it as good as eith[er] the Pheasant or Prarie hen, or Grouse, the feathers above it's head are pointed and stiff some hairs about the base of the beak. feathers short fine and stiff about the ears and eye. This is a faint likeness of the Cock of the Plains or Heath cock the first of those fowls which we met with was on the Missouri below and in the neighbourhood of the Rocky Mountains and from [there] to the Mountain which passes the Columbia between the Great falls and Rapids they go in large gangues or singularly and hide remarkably close when pursued, make short flights, &amp;c. The large Black &amp; White Pheasant is peculiar to that portion of the Rocky Mountains watered by the Columbia River. at least we did not see them untill we reached the waters of that river, nor since we have left those mountains. they are about the size of a well grown hen. the contour of the bird is much that of the redish brown Pheasant common to our country. the tail is proportionably as long and is composed of 18 feathers of equal length, of a uniform dark brown tiped with black. the feathers of the body are of a dark brown black and white. the black is that which most prodomonates, and white feathers are irregularly intermixed with those of the black and dark brown on every part but in greater perpotion about the neck Cock of the Plains, by Clark. breast and belley. this mixture gives it very much the appearance of that kind of dunghill fowl, which the henwives of our countrey call dommanicker. in the brest of some of those birds the white prodominates most. they are not furnished with tufts of long feathers on the neck as other Pheasants are, but have a space on each side of the neck about 2 1/2 inches long and one inch in width on which no feathers grow, tho' it is consealed by the feathers which are inserted on the hinder and front part of the neck, this space seams to serve them to dilate or contract the feathers of the neck with more ease. the eye is dark, the beak black, uncovered somewhat pointed and the upper exceeds the under chap. they have a narrow strip of vermillion colour above each eye which consists of a fleshey substance not protuberant but uneaven, with a number of minute rounded dots. it has four toes on each foot of which three are in front, it is booted to the toes. it feeds on wild fruits, particularly the berry of the Sac-a-commis,1 1 Clark on Jan. 25, 1806 (p. 13, ante), surmises that this word is derived from two French words, commis (clerks) and sac (bag), indicating the habit of the employés of the North West Company to carry this plant in a pouch, for the purpose of smoking. It was in reality an Indian word, sagakomi—see Thwaites (ed.), Lahontan's Voyages in North America (Chicago, 1904); probably the French had adopted the first derivation as a pun. For a description of the plant see Lewis, pp. 21, 22, ante.—Ed. and much also on the seed of the pine &amp; fir. this fowl is usually found in small numbers two and three &amp; 4 together on the ground. when supprised flies up and lights on a tree and is easily shot their flesh is superior to most of the Pheasant species which we have met with. they have a gizzard as other Pheasants &amp;c. feed also on the buds of the small Huckleberry bushes [Lewis:] Monday March 3rd. 1806. Two of our perogues have been lately injured very much in consequence of the tide leaving them partially on shore. they split by this means with their own weight. we had them drawn out on shore. our convalessents are slowly on the recovery. Lapage is taken sick, gave him a doze of Scots pills which did not operate. no movement of the party today worthy of notice. every thing moves on in the old way and we are counting the days which seperate us from the 1st. of April and which bind us to fort Clatsop. The large black and white pheasant is peculiar to that portion of the Rocky Mountain watered by the Columbia river. at least we did not see them in these mountains untill we reached the waters of that river nor since we have left those mountains. they are about the size of a well grown hen. the contour of the bird is much that of the redish brown pheasant common to our country. the tail is proportionably as long and is composed of eighteen feathers of equal length, of an uniform dark brown tiped with black. the feathers of the body are of a dark brown black and white. the black is that which most predominates, and wh[i]te feathers are irregularly intermixed with those of the black and dark brown on every part, but in greater proportion about the neck breast and belley. this mixture gives it very much the appearance of that kind of dunghill fowl which the hen-wives of our country call dommanicker [Dominique]. in the brest of some of these birds the white predominates most. they are not furnished with tufts of long feathers on the neck as our pheasants are, but have a space on each side of the neck about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 In. in width on which no feathers grow, tho' t[h]is is concealed by the feathers which are inserted on the hinder and front part of the neck; this space seems to surve them to dilate or contract the feathers of the neck with more ease. the eye is dark, the beak black, curved somewhat pointed and the upper exceeds the under chap. they have a narrow stripe of vermillion colour above each eye which consists of a fleshey substance not protuberant but uneven with a number of minute rounded dots. it has four toes on each foot of which three are in front. it is booted to the toes. it feeds on wild fruits, particularly the berry of the sac-a-commis, and much also on the seed of the pine and fir. The small speckled pheasant found in the same country with that above discribed, differs from it only in point of size and somewhat in colour. it is scarcely half the size of the other; ascociates in much larger flocks and is very gentle. the black is more predominant and the dark bro[w]n feathers less frequent in this than the larger species. the mixture of white is also more general on every part of this bird. it is considerably smaller than our pheasant and the body reather more round. in other particulars the[y] differ not at all from the large black and white pheasant. this by way of distinction I have called the speckled phesant. the flesh of both these species of party coloured phesants is of a dark colour and with the means we had of cooking them not very well flavored. The small brown pheasant is an inhabitant of the same country and is of the size and shape of the spec[k]led pheasant which it also resembles in it's economy and habits. the stripe above the eye in this species is scarcely perceptable, and is when closely examined of a yellow or orrange colour instead of the vermillion of the outhers. it's colour is an uniform mixture of dark and yellowish brown with a slight mixture of brownish white on the breast belley and the feathers underneath the tail. the whol[e] compound is not unlike that of the common quail only darker. this is also booted to the toes. the flesh of this is preferable to either of the others and that of the breast is as white as the pheasant of the Atlantic coast. the redish brown pheasant has been previously discribed.1 1 Coues thus identifies (L. and C., iii, pp. 870–872) these "pheasants" (more properly, grouse): The large black and white, the adult male of Franklin's grouse (Dendragapus franklini); the small speckled kind, the adult female and the young, of the same species; the small brown, the Oregon ruffed grouse, a variety only (var. fuscus) of the Eastern ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Both these birds were discovered by Lewis and Clark.—Ed. The Crow raven and Large Blackbird are the same as those of our country only that the crow is here much smaller yet it's note is the same. I observe no difference either between the hawks of this coast and those of the Atlantic. I have observed the large brown hawk, the small or sparrow hawk, and the hawk of an intermediate size with a long tail and blewish coloured wings remarkably swift in flight and very firce. sometimes called in the U'States the hen hawk. these birds seem to be common to every part of this country, and the hawks crows &amp; ravens build their nests in great numbers along the high and inaccessable clifts of the Columbia river and it's S.E. branch where we passed along them. we also met with the large hooting Owl under the Rocky Mountain on the Kooskoskee river. it did not appear to differ materially from those of our country. I think it's colours reather deeper and brighter than with us, particularly the redish brown. it is the same size and form. [Clark:] Monday March 3rd. 1806 Two of our canoes have been lately injured very much in consequence of the tide leaveing them partially on shore. they split by this means with their own weight. we had them drawn out on shore. our convalessents are slowly on the recovery. Lapage is taken sick. gave him some of Scotts Pills which did not opperate. no movement of the party to day worthey of notice. every thing moves on in the old way and we are counting the days which seperate us from the 1st. of April, &amp; which bind us to Fort Clatsop. The Small Speckled Pheasant found in the Rocky Mountains, and differ from the large black and white pheasant only in point of size, and somewhat in colour. it is scercely half the size of the other; assosiates in much larger flocks and is also very gentle. the black is more predominate and the dark brown feathers less frequent in this than the larger species. the mixture of white is also more general on every part of this bird. it is considerably smaller than our Pheasant and the body reather more round. in other particulars they differ not at all, from the large black and white Pheasant. this by way of distinction I have called the Speckled Pheasant. the flesh of both these species of party coloured Pheasant is of a dark colour, and with the means we had of cooking them were only tolerably flavoured tho' these birds would be fine well cooked. The small Brown Pheasant is an inhabitant of the same country and is of the size and shape of the Speckled Pheasant, which it also resembles in it's economy and habits, the stripe above the eye in this species is scercely preceptable and is when closely examined of a yellow or orrange colour insted of the vermillion of the others. it's colour is of a uniform mixture of dark and yellowish brown with a slight mixture of brownish white on the brest belley and the feathers under the tail. the whole compound is not unlike that of the common quaile only darker. this is also booted to the toes. the flesh is tolerable and that of the breast is as white as the Pheasant of the atlantic coast. the redish brown Pheasant has been previously described. The Crow Ravin and large Blackbird are the same as those of our country, only that the crow here is much smaller, yet its note is the same. I observe no difference between the Hawk of this coast and those of the Atlantic. I have observed the large brown Hawk, the small or sparrow hawk, and a hawk of an intermediate size with a long tail and blewish coloured wings, remarkably swift in flight and very ferce. Sometimes called in the Un. States the hen Hawk. those birds seam to be common to every part of this country in greater or smaller numbers, and the Hawks, Crows, and ravins build their nests in great numbers along the high &amp; inaxcessable clifts of the Columbia, and Lewis's rivers when we passd. along them. we also met with the large hooting Owl under the Rocky mountains on the Kooskooske R. it's colour reather deeper than with us, but differ in no other respect from those of the U States. [Lewis:] Tuesday March 4th. 1806. Not any occurrence today worthy of notice. we live sumptuously on our wappetoe and Sturgeon. the Anchovey is so delicate that they soon become tainted unless pickled or smoked. the natives run a small stick through their gills and hang them in the smoke of their lodges, or kindle a small fire under them for the purpose of drying them. they need no previous preperation of guting &amp;c and will cure in 24 hours. the natives do not appear to be very scrupelous about eating them when a little feated [fetid]. the fresh sturgeon they keep for many days by immersing it in water. they coock their sturgeon by means of vapor or steam. the process is as follows. a brisk fire is kindled on which a parcel of stones are la[i]d. when the fire birns down and the stones are sufficiently heated, the stones are so arranged as to form a tolerable level surface, the sturgeon which had been previously cut into large fletches is now laid on the hot stones; a parsel of small boughs of bushes is next laid on and a second course of the sturgeon thus reP[e]ating alternate layers of sturgeon and boughs untill the whole is put on which they design to cook. it is next covered closely with matts and water is poared in such manner as to run in among the hot stones and the vapor arrising being confined by the mats, cooks the fish. the whole process is performed in an hour, and the sturgeon thus cooked is much better than either boiled or roasted. The turtle dove and robbin are the same of our country and are found as well in the plain as open country. the Columbian robbin heretofore discribed seems to be the inhabitant of the woody country exclusively. the Magpie is most commonly found in the open country and are the same with those formerly discribed on the Missouri.1 1 To be found in Natural History data, vol. vi, post, under date of Sept. 17, 1805.—Ed. The large woodpecker or log cock,2 2 The pileated woodpecker (Ceophlœus pileatus). The red-shafted lark-woodpecker is Colaptes mexicanus. There is no entirely white woodpecker; but several species are black and white, with red head. That found east of the Rocky Mountains is Melanerpes erythrocephalus; the one mentioned by Lewis, elsewhere said to be migratory, belongs to the Pacific slope (Sphyropicus ruber); another bird, resembling this, is Picus villosus harrisi, and does not migrate.—Ed. the lark woodpecker and the small white woodpecker with a read head are the same with those of the Atlantic states and are found exclusively in the timbered country. The blue crested Corvus3 3 To be found in Natural History data, vol. vi, post.—Ed. and the small white breasted d°. have been previously discribed and are the natives of a piney country invariably, being found as well on the rocky mountains as on this coast. the lark is found in the plains only and are the same with those before mentioned on the Missouri, and not very unlike what is called in Virginia the old field lark.4 4 Coues identifies these larks, respectively, as Sturnella neglecta and S. magna. The blue-crested "corvus" is a jay (Cyanocilla stelleri); the white-breasted is Perisoreus obscurus, closely related to the common Canada jay, or "whiskey-Jack" (P. canadensis).—Ed. The large blueish brown or sandhill Crain are found in the valley of the Rocky mountains in Summer and Autumn where they raise their young, and in the winter and begining of spring on this river below tide water and on this coast. they are the same as those common to the Southern and Western States where they are most generally known by the name of the Sandhill crain. The vulture has also been discribed. there are two species of the flycatch, a small redish brown species with a short tail, round body, short neck and short pointed beak. they have some fine black specks intermixed with the uniform redish brown. this the same with that which remains all winter in Virginia where it is sometimes called the wren. the second species has lately returned and dose not remain here all winter. it's colours are a yellowish brown on the back head neck wings and tail the breast and belley of a yellowish white; the tail is in proportion as the wren but it is a size smaller than that bird. it's beak is streight pointed convex reather la[r]ge at the base and the chaps of equal length. the first species is the smallest, in short it is the smalest bird that I have ever seen in America except the humming bird. both these species are found in the woody country only, or at least I have never seen them elsewhere. [Clark:] Tuesday March 4th 1806 Not any accurrance to day worthy of notice. we live sumptuously on our Wappatoe and sturgeon. the Anchovey is so delicate that they soon become tainted unless pickled or smoked. the nativs run a small stick through their gills and hang them in the smoke of their Lodges, or Kindle small fires under them for the purpose of drying them. they need no previous preperation of gutting &amp;c. and will cure in 24 hours. the nativs do not appear to be very scrupelous about eating them a little feated [fetid]. the fresh sturgeon they Keep maney days by immersing it in water. they cook their sturgeon by means of vapor or steam, the Process is as follows. a brisk fire is kindled on which a parcel of stones are sufficiently heated, the stones are so arranged as to form a tolerable leavel surface, the sturgeon which had been previously cut into large flaetches is now laid on the hot stones; a parcel of small boughs of bushes is next laid on, and a second course of the sturgeon thus repeating alternate layers of sturgeon &amp; boughs untill the whole is put on which they design to cook, it is next covered closely with mats and water is poared in such manner as to run in among the hot stones and the vapor arrising being confind. by the mats, cooks the fish. the whole process is performd. in an hour and the sturgeon thus cooked is much better than either boiled or roasted. in their usual way of boiling of other fish in baskets with hot stones is not so good. The turtle dove and robin are the same of those of our countrey and are found as well on the plains as open countrey. the Columbia robin heretofore discribed seams to be the inhabitent of the woody country exclusively. the Magpye is most commonly found in the open country and are the same with those formerly discribed on the Missouri. The large woodpecker or log cock the lark woodpecker and the common woodpecker with a red head are the same with those of the Atlantic States, and are found exclusively in the timbered country. The Blue crested Corvus and the small white brested corvus are the nativs of a piney country invariably, being found as well on the Rocky Mountains as on this coast. The lark is found in the plains only and are the same with those on the Missouri and the Illinois and not unlike what is called in Virginia the old field Lark. The large bluish brown or Sandhill Crain are found in the Vally's of the Rocky Mountain in summer and autumn when they raise their young and in the winter and beginning of spring on this river below tide water and on this coast. they are the same as those common to the Southern and Western States where they are most generally known by the name of the Sand hill Crain. The Vulture has already been discribed. There are two species of fly catch, a small redish brown with a short tail, round body, short neck, and short pointed beak, and the same as that with us sometimes called the wren. the 2d species does not remain all winter they have just returned and are of a yellowish brown colour. [Lewis:] Wednesday March 5th 1806. This morning we were visited by two parties of Clatsops. they brought some fish a hat and some skins for sale most of which we purchased. they returned to their village in the evening. late in the evening the hunters returned from the kil-haw-â-nack-kle River which discharges itself into the head of the bay. They had neither killed nor seen any Elk. they informed us that the Elk had all gone off to the mountains a considerable distance from us. this is unwelcome information and reather allarming we have only 2 days provision on hand, and that nearly spoiled. we made up a small assortment of articles to trade with the Indians and directed Sergt. Pryor to set out early in the morning in a canoe with 2 men, to ascend the Columbia to the resort of the Indian fishermen and purchase some fish; we also directed two parties of hunters to renew the Chase tomorrow early. the one up the Netul and the other towards Point Adams. if we find that the Elk have left us, we have determined to ascend the river slowly and indeavour to procure subsistence on the way, consuming the Month of March in the woody country. earlyer than April we conceive it a folly to attempt the open plains where we know there is no fuel except a few small dry shrubs. we shall not leave our quarters at fort Clatsop untill the first of April, as we intended unless the want of subsistence compels us to that measure The common snipe of the marshes and the smal sand snipe are the same of those common to the Atlantic Coast tho' the former are by no means as abundant here. the prearrow [sparrow] of the woody country is also similar to ours but not abundant. those of the plains of Columbia are the same with those of the Missouri, tho' they are by no means so abundant. I have not seen the little singing lark or the large brown Curloo so common to the plains of the Missouri, but beleive that the latter is an inhabitant of this country during summer from Indian information. I have no doubt but what many species of birds found here in Autumn and Summer had departed before our arrival. [Clark:] Wednesday March 5th.. 1806 This morning we were visited by two parties of Clatsops they brought some fish, a hat and some skins for sale most of which we purchased, they returned to their village in the evening with the returning tide. late in the evening the hunters returned from the Kil-haw-â-nack kle River which discharges itself into the Head of the Bay. they had neither killed nor seen any Elk. they informed us that the Elk had all gorn off to the Mountains a considerable distance from us. this is unwelcom information and reather alarming. we have only two days provisions on hand and that nearly spoiled. we made up a small assortment of articles to trade with the Indians, and directed Sergt Natl. Pryor to set out early in the morning in a canoe with two men, to assend the Columbia to the resort of the Indians fishermen and purchase some fish; we also derected two parties of hunters to renew the chase tomorrow early. the one up the Netul and the other towards point Adams. If we find that the Elk have left us, we have determined to assend the river slowly and endeaver to precure subsistance on the way, consumeing the month of March in the woody country, earlyer than april we conceive it a folly to attempt the open plains where we know there is no fuel except a fiew small dry shrubs. we shall not leave our quarters at Fort Clatsop untill the 1st. of april as we intended, unless the want of subsistance compels us to that Measure. The common Snipe of the Marshes and the small sand snipe are the same of those common to the Atlantic coast tho the former are by no means as abundant here. The sparrow of the woody country is also similar to ours but not abundant. those of the plains of Columbia are the same with those of the Missouri, tho' they are by no means so abundant. I have not seen the little singing lark or the large brown Curloe so common to the Plains of the Missouri, but believe the Curloe is an inhabitent of this countrey dureing summer from Indian information and their attempts to mimick the notes of this fowl. I have no doubt but what many species of birds found here in autumn and summer had departed before our arrival. The Aquatic Birds of this country or such as obtain their subsistence from the water, are the large blue and brown heron, fishing Hawk, blue crested fisher, Gulls of several species of the coast, the large grey Gull of the Columbia, Comorant, loons of two species, white and the brown brant, small and large Geese, small and large swans, the Duckinmallard, canvis back Duck, red headed fishing Duck, black and white duck, little brown Duck, Black Duck, two species of Divers, blue winged teal, and some other species of Ducks, two species of Plevers. The hunters who were out last informed me that they discovered a very considerable fall in the Kil-haw-â-nack-kle River on its main western fork at which place it falls abt 100 feet from the side of a mountain S. E. about 6 miles from Fort Clatsop and nearly 15 from its enterance into the bay by the Meanderings of this river.1 1 At the head of Young's Bay, almost directly south of Astoria and about six or seven miles away, there are two small rivers entering the Bay, the Klaskanine and Young's River. At the head of tidewater on Young's River are the falls referred to by Lewis and Clark. They are located about ten miles south of Astoria, and you can go with a row boat on tidewater up to within a few hundred yards of them. Above the falls, Young's River is in summer time nothing more than a large mill stream, perhaps twenty or thirty feet wide and two or three deep, easily fordable at any place where the trail crosses.—Thomas N. Strong, Portland, Ore. This is easily identified as Young's River Falls, on Young's River. There is no other fall in the entire region; and it is, moreover, very well located in the description of the journal. It is a picturesque cataract, perpendicular quarter way from the top, then striking a ledge by which it is spread into a one-sided fan, and reaching the pool below in spray. The volume is sufficient to operate a paper pulp mill. The formation is a very hard basalt, of almost black color—much resembling that of the famous Tillamook Rock, the head called in the journal "Clark's Point of View," and upon which is built the Tillamook Rock lighthouse. The fall is seventy-five feet high, and only about ten miles from the entrance of Young's River into the bay of the same name—the estimates of the journal being here, as usual, above the actual measurements. The Kilhawânackkle is undoubtedly Young's River, of which the Klaskanine is the eastern and larger fork; though below the fall the western branch seems the larger, and might be called the main western fork.—H. S. Lyman, Astoria, Ore. a high Mountain is situated S 60° W. about 18 miles from Fort Clatsop on which there has been snow since Nov.2 2 Saddle Mountain.—Ed. [Lewis:] Thursday March 6th. 1806. This morning the fishing and hunting parties set out agreeably to their instructions given them last evening. at 11. A.M. we were visited by Comowoll and two of his children.1 1 This was the chief to whom Lewis and Clark presented Fort Clatsop (see post); he occupied it for several years, each fall and winter, during the hunting season. The descendants of Coboway (Comowoll)—see vol. iii, p. 278, ante—have had a large share in Oregon history. Three of his daughters married white men—the eldest was the wife, first of W. W. Matthews, one of the clerks of the Astorian expedition (1811–13); later, she married Louis Labonte, who came overland with Wilson P. Hunt in 1811–12, and after serving with the North West and Hudson's Bay Companies settled at French Prairie in the Willamette Valley, where one of their sons was still living in 1900. See Lyman, "Reminiscences of Louis Labonte", in Oregon Hist. Soc. Quarterly, 1900. The second daughter, Celiast or Helen, married Solomon Smith, a teacher at old Fort Vancouver; she lived until 1891, and distinctly remembered Lewis and Clark. For the reminiscences of her son, see Smith, "Beginnings of Oregon," in Ore. Hist. Soc. Proceedings, 1899. Mrs. Smith acted as an envoy to negotiate with the Clatsops after the unfortunate wreck of the "William and Ann," in 1829, and the supposed complicity of the tribe therein. The third daughter became the wife of Joseph Gervais, a French fur-trader and early settler of French Prairie.—Ed. he presented us with some Anchovies which had been well cured in their manner, we fou[n]d them excellent, they were very acceptable particularly at this moment, we gave the old man some small articles in return. this we have found much the most friendly and decent savage that we have met with in this neighbourhood. Hall had his foot and ankle much injured yesterday by the fall of a large stick of timber; the bones were fortunately not broken and I expect he will be able to walk again shortly. Bratton is now weaker than any of the convalessants, all of whom recover slowly in consequence of the want of proper diet, which we have it not in our power to procure.2 2 Among our other difficulties we now experience the want of tobacco; and out of thirty-seven persons composing our party, there are but seven who do not make use of it; we use crab-tree bark as a substitute.—Gass (p. 271). The Aquatic birds of this country or such as obtain their subsistence from the water, are the large blue and brown heron, fishing hawk, blue crested fisher, gulls of several species of the Coast, the large grey gull of the Columbia, Cormorant, loons of two species, white, and the brown brant, small and large geese, small and large Swan, the Duckinmallard, canvis back duck, red headed fishing duck, black and white duck, little brown duck, black duck, two speceis of divers, blue winged teal, and some other speceis of ducks. [Clark:] Thursday March 6th. 1806. This morning the fishing and hunting party's set out agreeably to their instructions given them last evening. At 11 A. M. we were visited by Commowoll and two boys sons of his. he presented us with some Anchovies which had been well cured in their manner, we found them excellent. they were very acceptable perticularly at this moment. we gave the old mans sones a twisted wire to ware about his neck, and I gave him a par of old glovs which he was much pleased with. this we have found much the most friendly and decent Indian that we have met with in this neighbourhood. Hall had his foot and ankle much injured yesterday by the fall of a log which he had on his sholder; the bones are fortunately not broken, I expect he will be able to walk again shortly. Bratten is now weaker than any of the convalessants, and complains verry much of his back, all of them recovering slowly in consequence of the want of proper diet, which we have it not in our power to precure. The large Blue and brown Herons or crains as they are usialy called in the U.States are found below tide water. they are the same of those of the U. States. The Fishing Hawk with the crown of the head white, and back of a milkey white, and the blue crested or king fisher are found on every part of the Columbia and its water along which we passed and are the same with those of the U. States.1 1 The herons (Ardea herodias), the fishing-hawk (Pandion haliaëtos carolinensis), and the blue-crested king fisher (Ceryle alcyon) are, as Clark states, not peculiar to the Pacific coast.—Ed. the fishing hawk is not abundant, particularly in the mountains. There are 4 species of the larus or gull on this coast and river. 1st a small species the size of a Pegion; white except some black spots about the head and the little bone on the but of the wing. 2d. a species somewhat larger of a light brown colour, with a mealy coloured back. 3rd. the large Grey Gull, or white larus with a greyish brown back, and light grey belly and breast, about the size of a well grown pullet, the wings are remarkably long in perpotion to the size of the body and it's under chap towards the extremity is [more] gibbous and protuberant than in either of the other species, a White Gull about the size of the second with a remarkable beak; adjoining the head and on the base of the upper chap there is an elivated orning of the same substance with the beak which forms the nostriels at A; it is somewhat in this form the feet are webed and the legs and feet of a yellow colour. the form of the wings body &amp;c are much that of the 2d species this bird was seen on Haleys bay.1 1 Coues identifies these gulls in the order here given: 1st, Chroicocephalus philadelphia; 2d, the young of Larus glaucescens; 3d, the young of L. occidentalis; 4th, the fulmar petrel of the Pacific (Fulmar glacialis glupischa).—Ed. The large Grey Gull is found on the Columbian waters as high as the enterence of the Kooskooske and in common with the other species on the coast; the others appear confined to the tidewater, and the 4th. species not so common as either of the others. The Comorant is a large black duck which feeds on fish; I proceive no difference between it &amp; these found in the rivers of the Atlantic Coasts. we met with [it] as high up the river as the enterance of the Chopunnish into the Kooskooske river. they increased in numbers as we decended, and formed much the Greatest portion of waterfowls which we saw on the Columbia untill we reached tidewater, where they also abound but do not bear a similar proportion to the fowls found in this quarter. we found this bird fat and tolerably flavoured as we decended the Columbia.2 2 The cormorant (Phalacrocorax dilophus dncinnatus) is not, properly speaking, a duck.—Ed. [Lewis:] Friday March 7th. 1806. The wind was so high that Comowol did not leave us untill late this evening. Labuishe and Drewyer returned at sunset having killed one Elk only. they report that there are some scattering male Elk in the neighbourhood of the place they killed this one or about 5 miles up the Netul on this side. Head of a Gull, by Clark. Bratton is much wo[r]se today, he complains of a violent pain in the small of his back and is unable in consequence to set up. we gave him one of our flanel shirts, applyed a bandage of flannel to the part and bathed and rubed it well with some vollatile linniment which I prepared with sperits of wine, camphor, castile soap and a little laudinum. he felt himself better in the evening. the large blue and brown herons, or crains as they are usually called in the U' States are found on this river below tidewater. they are the same with those of the U' States. the fishing hawk with the crown of the head White and back of a mealy white, and the blue crested or King fisher are found on every part of the Columbia and it's waters and are the same with those of the U' States. the fishing hawk is not abundant particularly in the mountains. there are four speceis of larus or gull on this coast and river 1st. a small speceis about the size of a pigeon; white except some black spots about the head and a little brown on the but of the wings, 2nd. a speceis somewhat larger of a light brown colour with a whitish or mealy coloured back. 3rd. the large grey gull, or white larus with a greyish brown back and a light grey belley and breast, about the size of a well grown pullet or reather larger. the wings are remarkably long in proportion to the size of the body and it's under chap towards the extremity is more gibbous and protuberant than in either of the other species. 4th. a white gull about the size of the second with a remarkable beak; adjoining the head and at the base of the up[p]er Chop there is an elivated orning of the same substance with the beak which forms the nostrils; it is somewhat in this form.1 1 This head, being a copy of that given by Clark (see p. 140, ante), is here omitted.—Ed. the feet are webbed and the legs and feet of a yellow colour. the form of the wings body &amp;c are much that of the second species. the large grey gull is found on the river as high as the entrance of the Kooskooske and in common with the other speceis on the coast; the others appear to be confined to tidewater, and the fourth speceis not so common as either of the others. The cormorant is a large black duck which feeds on fish; I perceive no difference between it and those found in the Potomac and other rivers on the Atlantic Coast. tho' I do not recollect seeing those on the atlantic so high up the rivers as those are found here. we first met with them on the Kooskooske at the entrance of Chopunnish river. they increased in quantity as we decended, and formed much the greatest portion of the waterfowl which we saw on the Columbia untill we reached tidewater where they also abound but do not bear a similar proportion to the other fowls found in this quarter. There are two speceis of loons. 1st. the Speckled loon found on every part of the rivers of this country, they are the same size colours and form with those of the Atlantic coast. the second speceis we first met with at the great falls of the Columbia and from thence down. this bird is not more than half the size of the speckled loon, it's neck is long, slender and white in front. the Colour of the body and back of the neck and head are of a dun or ash colour, the breast and belley are white. the beak is like that of the speckled loon and like them it cannot fly but flutters along on the top of the warter or dives for security when pursued.1 1 The speckled loon may be any one of several species of this aquatic bird. Coues thinks it is probably the Pacific diver, the commonest loon of the Northwest coast (Colymbus or Urinator pacificus). The second species is probably not a loon, but a grebe (Æchmophorus occidentalis), first described by Lewis and Clark. Their statement that these birds do not fly is incorrect.—Ed. [Clark:] Friday March 7th. 1806 The wind was so high that Comowol did not leave us untill late this evening. Drewyer and Labiesh returned at sunset haveing killed one Elk only. they report that there are some scattering mail Elk in the neighbourhood of the place they killed this one or about 5 miles up the Netul river on the west side. Bratten is much worse to day he complains of a violent pain in the small of his back, and is unable in consequence of it to set up. we gave him one of our flannel shirts. I applied a bandage of flanel to the part and rubed it well with some volatile linniment which was prepared with sperits of wine, camphire, castile soap, and a little laudinum. he felt himself better in the evening at which time I repeated the linniment and bathed his beet [feet], to restore circulation which he complained of in that part. There are two species of Loons. 1st. the speckled loon found on every part of the rivers of this quarter, they are the same size colour and form with those of the Ohio, and atlantic coasts, the 2d. species we first met with at the great falls of the Columbia and from thence down. This bird is not more than half the size of the speckled loon, it's neck is long, slender and white in front. the colour of the body and back of the neck and head are of a dun or ash colour, the breast and belly are white. the back is like that of the speckled loon, and like them it cannot fly, but flutters along on the top of the water or Dives for security when pursued, John Shields Reuben Fields &amp; Robert frasure measured 2 trees of the fur kind one 37 feet around, appears sound, has but fiew limbs for 200 feet it is East of the Netul abt. 280 feet high. [Lewis:] Saturday March 8th. 1806. Bratton is much better today, his back gives him but little pain, Collins returned early in the morning and informed us that he had killed three Elk about five miles distant on the edge of the prarie in Point Adams. one of them fell in a deep pond of water and [he] could not get it, the other two he butcherd and secured. he saw two large herds of Elk in that quarter. we sent Drewyer and Joseph Fields to hunt those Elk. a party were also sent with Labuish for the flesh of the Elk which Drewyer and himself had killed up the netul, they returned with it in the evening. Shields, R. Fields and Frazier returned this evening from the Kilhawanackkle unsuccessfull having seen no Elk. Mc, Neal and Goodrich having recovered from the Louis veneri I directed them to desist from the uce of mercury. The white brant is very common in this country particularly below tidewater where they remain in vast quantities during the winter. they feed like the swan gees &amp;c on the grass roots and seeds which they find in the marshes. this bird is about the size of the brown brant or a third less than the common Canadian or wild goose. the head is proportionably with the goose reather large; the beak also thicker shorter and of much the same form, being of a yellowish white colour except the edges of the chaps, which are frequently of a dark brown. the legs and feet are of the same form of the goose and are of a redish white or pale flesh colour. the tail is composed of sixteen feathers of equal length as those of the geese and brown brant are and bears about the same proportion in point of length. the eye is of a dark colour and nothing remarkable as to size. the wings are rether longer compared with those of the goose but not as much so as in the brown or pided brant. the colour of the plumage of this bird is uniformly a pure white except the large feathers of the extremities of the wings which are black. the large feathers of the 1st. joint of the wing next to the body are white. the note of this bird differs essentially from that of the goose; it more resembles that of the brown brant but is somewhat different. it is like the note of [a] young domestic goose which has not perfectly attained it's full note. the flesh of this bird is exceedingly fine, preferable to either the goose or pided brant.1 1 Coues's identifications are as follows: the snow-goose (Chen hyperboreus); but the Western variety is smaller than that of the Atlantic slope. The brown brant is Bernicla brenta. The large goose is B. canadensis occidentalis; the small goose, B. hutchinsi.—Ed. The Brown or pided brant are much the same size and form of the white only that their wings are considerably longer and more pointed. the plumage of the upper part of the body neck head and tail is much the colour of the Canadian goose but reather darker in consequence of som dark brown feathers which are distributed and irregularly scattered throughout. they have not the white on the neck and sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the body. like the goose there are some white feathers on the rump at the joining of the tail. the beak is dark and the legs and feet also dark with a greenish cast; the breast and belley are of a lighter colour than the back and is also irregularly intermixed with dark brown and black feathers which give it a pided appearance, the flesh of this bird is dark and in my estimation reather better than that of the goose, the habits of this bird are the same nearly with the goose and white brant with this difference that they do not remain in this climate in such numbers during the winter as the others, and that it sets out earlier in the fall season on it's return to the south and arrives later in the spring than the goose. I see no difference between this bird and that called simply the brant, common to the lakes the Ohio and Mississippi &amp;c. The small goose of this country is reather less than the brant; it's head and neck like the brant are reather larger than that of the goose in proportion; their beak is also thicker and shorter. their notes are more like those of our tame gees; in all other rispects they are the same with the large goose with which, they so frequently ascociate that it was some time after I first observed this goose before I could determine whether it was a distinct speceis or not. I have now no hesitation in declaring them a distinct speceis. the large goose is the same of that common on the Atlantic coast, and known by the appellation of the wild, or Canadian goose. [Clark:] Saturday March 8th. 1806 Bratten is much better this morning, his back givs him but little pain. Collins returned early in the morning, and informed us that he had killed three Elk about five miles distance on the edge of the prarie in point Adams. one of them fell in a deep pond of water and he could not git to it. the other two he butchered and saved. he saw two large herds of Elk in that quarter. We sent Drewyer &amp; Jos: Field to hunt these Elk, a party was also sent with Labiesh for the flesh of the Elk which Drewyer and himself had killed up the Netul, they returned with it in the evening. Shields, R. Field and Frasure returned this evening from the Kilhawanackkle unsuccessfull haveing seen no Elk. Mc Neal and Goodrich haveing recovered from the Louis veneri I directed them to desist from takeing the Mercury or useing in future. Willard is yet complaining and is low sperited. The White Brant is very common in this country particularly below tide water where they remain in vast quantities dureing the winter. they feed like the Swan Goose &amp;c. on the grass and roots &amp; seeds which they find in the marshes this bird is a little larger than the brown brant and a fourth less than the common wild or Canadian goose. the head is proportionably with the goose reather large; the beak thicker shorter and of the same form, being of a yellowish white colour except the edges of the chaps, which are frequently of a dark brown. the legs and feet are of the same form of the goose, and are of a redish white or pail flesh colour. the tail is composed of sixteen feathers of equal length as those of the geese and brown brant are, and bears about the same perpotion in point of length. the Eye is of a dark colour and nothing remarkable as to size, the wings are reather longer compared with those of the goose, but not as much so as is the brown or pieded brant. the colour of the plumage of this bird is uniformly a pure white except the large feathers of the extremities of the wings which are black. The large feathers of the 1st. joint of the wing next to the body are white. the note of this bird differs essentially from that of the goose; it more resembles that of the brown brant but is somewhat different. it is like the note of a young domestic goose which has not perfectly attained its full note. the flesh of this bird is exceedingly fine, prefferable to either the goose or pieded brant. the neck is shorter in pr[o]potion than that of the goose. The Brown or pieded brant are nearly the size and much the same form of the white brante only that their wings are considerably longer and more pointed. the plumage of the upper part of the body, neck, head and tail is much the colour of the Common or Canadian Goose but rather darker in consequence of some dark brown feathers which are distributed and irregularly scattered throughout. they have not the white on the neck and sides of the head as the goose has nor is the neck darker than the body. like the goose there are some white feathers on the rump at the junction of the tail. the beak, legs and feet are dark, with a greenish cast; the breast and belly are of a lighter colour than the back and is also intermixed, irregularly, with dark brown and black feathers which gives it a pieded appearance. the flesh of this bird is dark, and in my estimation reather better than that of the goose. the habits of this bird is nearly the same with the goose and white brant, with this difference that they do not remain in this climate in such numbers dureing the winter as the others. I see no difference between this bird and that called Loonpilly the Brant common to the Lakes and frequently seen on the Ohio and Mississippi in large flocks. &amp;c. The Small Goose of this country is reather less than the Brant; it's head and neck like the brant are reather larger than that of the goose in purpotion; their beak is also thicker and shorter. their notes are more like those of our taim geese, in all other respect they are the same with the large goose with which, they so frequently ascoiate, that it was some time after I first observed this goose before I could [tell] whether it was a distinct speces or not. I have no hesitation now in declaring them a distinct species. the large Goose is the same as that common to the Ohio, and atlantic coast, and known by the appellation of the wild, or Canadian Goose. [Lewis:] Sunday March 9th. 1806. This morning the men set out at daylight to go in qu[e]st of the Elk which Collins had killed, they returned with it at eleven A.M. Bratton complains of his back being very painfull to him today; I conceive this pain to be something of the rheumatism. we still apply the linniment and flannel; in the evening he was much better. Drewyer and Joseph Fields returned not having found any Elk. Sergt. Pryor and the fishing party not yet arrived, suppose they are detained by the winds. visited by 3 Clatsop men who brought a dog some fish and a Sea Otter skin for sale. we suffered them to remain all night. we set Shields at work to make some sacks of Elk skin to contain various articles. The Large Swan is precisely the same common to the Atlantic States. the small swan differs only, from the larger one in size and it's note.1 1 The large swan here described is Cygnus (sub-genus Olor) buccinator; the smaller, or whistling, swan is C. (O.) columbianus. Coues says that it is the latter species, not the former, that is common on the Atlantic coast.—Ed. it is about one fourth less and it's note entirely different. the latter cannot be justly immetated by the sound of letters nor do I know any sounds with which a comparison would be pertinent. it begins with a kind of whistleing sound and terminates in a round full note which is reather louder than the whistleing, or former part; this note is as loud as that of the large swan. from the peculiar whistleing of the note of this bird I have called it the whistleing swan. it's habits colour and contour appear to be precisely those of the large Swan. we first saw them below the great narrows of the Columbia near the Chilluckkittequaw nation. They are very abundant in this neighbourhood and have remained with us all winter. in number they are fully five for one of the large speceis. The duckinmallard or common large duck w[h]ich resembles the domestic duck are the same here with those of the U'Sts. they are abundant and are found on every part of the river below the mountains. they remain here all winter but I beleive they do not continue during winter far above tidewater. a beautifull duck and one of the most delicious in the world is found in considerable quantities in this neighbourhood during the Autumn and winter. this is the same with that known in the Delliware, Susquehannah, and Potomac by the name of the Canvisback and in James River by that of shell-Drake; in the latter river however I am informed that they have latterly almost entirely disappeared. to the epicure of those parts of the union where this duck abounds nothing need be added in praise of the exqu[i]site flavor of this duck. I have frequently eaten of them in several parts of the Union and I think those of the Columbia equally as delicious. this duck is never found above tide-water; we did not meet with them untill after we reached the marshey Islands; and I beleive that they have already left this neighbourhood, but whether they have gone northwardly or Southwardly I am unable to determin; nor do I know in what part of the Continent they raise their young. The read headed fishing duck is common to every part of the river and are found as well in the Rocky Mountains as elsewhere; in short this was the only duck we saw on the waters of the Columbia within the mountains. they feed principally on crawfish; and are the same in every rispect as those on the rivers in the Mountains of the Atlantic Ocean.1 1 These three ducks ares : 1st, Anasboscas; 2d, Aristonetta vallisneria; 3d, Mergus serrator.—Ed. [Clark:] Sunday March 9th. 1806 This morning the men set out at day light to go in quest of the Elk which Collins had killed, they returned at 11. A. M. Bratten complains of his backs being very painfull to him to day. we still apply the linnement &amp; flannel; in the evening he was much better. Jos. Field &amp; Drewyer returned not haveing found any Elk. Sergt. Pryor and the fishing party not yet returned, suppose they are detained by the winds. We are visited by 3 Clatsop men who brought a Dog, some fish and a sea otter skin for sale. we suffered them to remain all night. we set Shields at work to make some sacks of Elk skin to contain my papers, and various articles which we wish kept Dry. The large Swan is precisely the same common to the Missouri, Mississippi and the Atlantic States &amp;c. The small swan differ only from the large one in size and it's note. it is about 1/4th. less, and its notes entirely different. the latter cannot be justly immetated by the sound of letters nor do I know any sound with which a comparison would be pertinent. it begins with a kind of whistling sound and terminates in a round full note which is reather louder than the whistling, or former part; this note is as loud as that of the large swan. from the peculiar whistling of the note of this bird I have called it the Whistling Swan, it's habits colour and contour appear to be precisely those of the large swan. we first saw them below the great narrows of the Columbia near the Chilluckkittequaw Nation. they are very abundant in this neighbourhood and have remained with us all winter. in number they are fully five for one of the large species of the swan's. The Duckinmallard are the same here with those of the U. States. they are abundant and are found on every part of the river below the mountains. they remain here all winter, but I believe they do not remain all winter above tide water. a butifull Duck and one of the most delicious in the world is found in considerable quantities in this neighbourhood dureing the autumn and winter. this is the same as that known in the Dilliwar, Susquehannah and Potomoc by the name of the Canvisback and James River by that of Shell-Drake; in the latter river I am informed that they have latterly almost entirely disapeared. [For] the epicures of those parts of the Union where those Ducks abound nothing need be added in prais of the exquisit flavor of this duck. I have eaten of them in several parts of the union and I think those of the Columbia equally as delicious. this duck is never found above tide water; we did not meat with them untill after we reached the Marshey Islands; and I believe that they have already left this neighbourhood; but whether they are gorn Northerly or Southerly, I am unable to deturmine; nor do I know in what part of the country they rais their young. The red headed fishing duck is common to every part of the river and are found as well in the Rocky Mountains as elsewhere; in short this was the only duck we saw within the Mountain on the Columbian waters. they feed principally on crawfish; and are the same in every respects as those on the Ohio and rivers in the mountains of the atlantic Ocian. The black and white Duck are small about the size of the blue-winged teal, or reather larger.1 1 Probably Charitonetta albeola.—Ed. the mail is butifully varigated with black and white. the white occupies the side of the head, breast and back. black the tail, large feathers of the wing, two tufts of feathers which cover the upper part of the wings when folded, the neck and head. the female is darker or has much less white about her. I take this to be the same species of duck common to the Ohio, as also the atlantic coast, and sometimes called the butterbox. the back is wide and short, and as well as the legs of a dark colour. the flesh of this duck is verry well flavored I think superior to the Duckinmallard. [Lewis:] Monday March 10th. 1806. About 1. P.M. it became fair and we sent out two parties of hunters on this side of the Netul the one below and the other above. we also directed a party to set out early in the morning and pass the bay and hunt beyond the Kilhowanackkle. from the last we have considerable hope as we have as yet hunted but little in that quarter. it blew hard all day. in the evening the Indians departed. The hunters who were over the Netull the other day informed us that they measured a pine tree, (or fir N°. 1) which at the hight of a man's breast was 42 feet in the girth; about three feet higher, or as high as a tall man could reach, it was 40 feet in the girth which was about the circumpherence for at least 200 feet without a limb, and that it was very lofty above the commencement of the limbs. from the appearance of other trees of this speceis of fir and their account of this tree, I think it may be safely estimated at 300 feet. it had every appearance of being perfectly sound. The black and white duck are small; ab[o]ut the size of the blue-winged teal, or reather larger. the male is beautifully variagated with black and white. the white occupys the sides of the head, breast and back, black, the tail feathers of the wings two tufts of feathers which cover the upper part of the wings when foalded, the neck and head, the female is darker or has much less white about her. I take this to be the same speceis of duck common to the Atlantic coast, and frequently called the butterbox. the beak is wide and short, and as well as the legs, of a dark colour. the flesh of this duck is very well flavored, the brown duck is much in form like the duckinmallard, tho' not much more than half it's size. the colour is an uniform mixture of yellowish and dark brown. there is nothing remarkable in the appearance of this duck; it generally resorts the same kind of grassey marshes with the duckinmallard and feeds in a similar manner, on grass seed, and roots. both these ducks are common to the river for some distance above tide water as well as below. The black duck is about the size of the bluewinged teal. their colour is a duskey black the breast and belley somewhat lighter than the other parts, or a dark brown. the legs stand longitudinally with the body, and the bird when on shore stands of cours very erect. the legs and feet are of a dark brown, the toes are four on each foot, a short one at the heel and three long toes in front, which are unconnected with a web. the webs are attatched to each sides of the several joints of the toe, and divided by deep sinuses at each joint. the web assuming in the intermediate part an eliptical figure. the beak is about two inches long, streight, flated on the sides, and tapering to a sharp point. the upper chap somewhat longest, and bears on it's base at the joining of the head, a little conic protuberance of a cartelagenous substace, being redish brown at the point. the beak is of an ivory white colour. the eye dark. these ducks usually associate in large flocks, and are very noisey; their note being a sharp shrill whistle. they are usually fat and agreeably flavored; and feed principally on moss, and other vegitable productions of the water. we did not meet with them untill we reached tide-water, but I beleive them not exclusively confined to that district at all seasons, as I have noticed the same duck on many parts of the Rivers Ohio and Mississippi. the gizzard and liver are also remarkably large in this fowl.1 1 Coues does not identify the small brown duck, which may be the female of some of the other species. The black duck is a coot (Fulica americana).—Ed. the divers are the same with those of the Atlantic States. the smaller species has some white feathers about the rump with no perceptable tail and is very active and qu[i]ck in it's motion; the body is of a redish brown. the beak sharp and somewhat curved like that of the pheasant. the toes are not connected but webed like those discribed of the black duck. the larger speceis are about the size of the teal and can flye a short distance which the small one scarcely ever atta[m]pts. they have a short tail. their colour is also an uniform brickredish brown, the beak is streight and pointed. the feet are of the same form of the other speceis and the legs are remarkably thin and flat one edge being in front. the food of both speceis is fish, and the flesh unfit for uce.1 1 The smaller diver (Podilymbus podiceps), and the larger, probably Podiceps holbœlli, are not peculiar to the Pacific coast.—Ed. the blue-winged teal are a very excellent duck, and are the same with those of the Atlantic coast. There are some other speceis of ducks which shall be hereafter discribed as I may hereafter have an opportunity to examine them. [Clark:] Monday March 10th. 1806 about 1 P. M. it became fair and we sent out two parties of hunters on this side of the Netul, one above and the other below, we also directed a party to set out early in the morning and pass Meriwethers Bay and hunt beyond the Kilhowanakkle. from the last we have considerable hope, as we have as yet hunted but little in that quarter. it blew hard all day, in the evening the Indians departed. The Hunters, S. R. F. &amp; F. who were over the netul the other day informed us that they measured a 2d tree of the fir speces (N°. 1) as high as a a man could reach, was 39 feet in the girth; it tapered but very little for about 200 feet without any considerable limbs, and that it was a very lofty above the commencement of the limbs. from the appearance of other species of fir, and their account of this tree, I think it might safely [be] estimated at 300 feet, it had every appearance of being perfectly sound in every part. The brown Duck is much in form like the Duckinmallard, tho' not much more than half it's size. the colour is one uniform mixture of yellowish and dark brown. there is nothing remarkable in the colour of this duck; it resorts the same kind of grassy marshes with the Duckinmallard, and feeds in a similar manner, on grass, seeds &amp; roots. both these ducks are common to the river for some distance above tide water as well as below. The black Duck is about the size of the bluewinged teel. their colour is a duskey black the breast and belly somewhat lighter than the other parts, or a dark brown. the legs stand longitudianally with the body, and the Bird when on shore stands very erect. the legs and feet are of a dark brown, the toes are four on each foot, a short one on the heel and three long toes in front which are unconnected with a web. the web is atached to each side of the several joints of the toes, and divided by deep sinues at each joint, the web assumeing in the intermediate part an elipticle figure. the beak is about two inches long, streight, flated on the sides, and tapering to a sharp point. the upper chap somewhat longest and bears on its base at the joining of the head, a little conic protuberance of a cartelagenous substance, being redish brown. the beak is of a ivery white colour. the eye dark. these ducks usially associate in large flocks, and are very noisey; their note being a sharp shrill whistle. they are usially fat and tolerably flavoured; and feed on moss and other vegitable productions of the water. we did not meet with them untill we reached tide water; I have noticed the same duck on maney parts of the Ohio and Mississippi. the Gizzard and liver are also remarkably large in this fowl. The Divers are the same with those of the atlantic states. the smaller species has some white feathers about the rump and no perceptable tail and is very active and quick in its motion; the body is of a redish brown. the beak sharp and somewhat curved like that of the Pheasant the toes are not connected but webd. like those discribed of the black duck. The large species are about the size of the teal &amp;c. the food of both those species is fish, and their flesh is unfit for use. The bluewinged teal are a very excellent duck, and are the same with those of the Atlantic coast. There are some other species of ducks which shall be hereafter describd. as I may hereafter have an oppertunity of examening them. [Lewis:] Tuesday March 11th. 1806. Early this morning Sergt. Pryor arrived with a small canoe loaded with fish which he had obtained from the Cathlahmah's for a very small part of the articles he had taken with him. the wind had prevented his going to the fis[h]ery on the opposite side of the river above the Wackiacums, and also as we had suspected, prevented his return as early as he would otherwise have been back. The dogs at the Cathlahmahs had bitten the trong [thong] assunder which confined his canoe and she had gone a drift. he borrowed a canoe from the Indians in which he has returned. he found his canoe on the way and secured her, untill we return the Indians their canoe, when she can be brought back. Sent Sergt. Gass and a party in surch of a canoe which was reported to have been sunk in a small creek on the opposite side of the Netul a few miles below us, where she had been left by Shields R. Fields and Frazier when they were lately sent out to hunt over the Netul. They returned and reported that they could not find the canoe she had broken the cord by which she was attatched, and had been carried off by the tide. Drewyer Joseph Fields and Frazier set out by light this morning to pass the bay in order to hunt as they had been directed the last evening. we once more live in clover; anchovies fresh Sturgeon and Wappetoe. the latter Sergt. Pryor had also procured and brought with him. The reptiles of this country are the rattlesnake garter snake and the common brown Lizzard. The season was so far advanced when we arrived on this side of the rocky mountains that but few rattlesnakes were seen I did not remark one particularly myself, nor do I know whether they are of either of the four speceis found in the different parts of the United states, or of that species before mentioned peculiar to the upper parts of the Missouri and it's branches. The garter snake so called in the United States is very common in this country; they are found in great numbers on the open and sometimes marshey grounds in this neighbourhood. they differ not at all from those of the U'States. the black or dark brown lizzard we saw at the rock fort Camp at the commencement of the woody country below the great narrows and falls of the Columbia; they are also the same with those of the United States. The snail is numerous in the woody country on this coast; they are in shape like those of the United States, but are at least five times their bulk.1 1 Lewis and Clark were the first to describe this large snail (Helix fidelis).—Ed. There is a speceis of water lizzard of which I saw one only just above the grand rapids of the Columbia. it is about 9 inches long and the body is reather flat and about the size of a mans finger covered with a soft skin of a dark brown colour with an uneven surface covered with little pimples the neck and head are short, the latter terminating in an accute angular point and flat. the fore feet each four toes, the hinder ones five unconnected with a web and destitute of tallons. it's tail was reather longer than the body and in form like that of the Musk-rat, first rising in an arch higher than the back and decending lower than the body at the extremity, and flated perpendicularly. the belley and under part of the neck and head were of a brick red, every other part of the colour of the upper part of the body a dark brown. the mouth was smooth, without teeth.1 1 First described by Lewis and Clark; now known as the warty salamander (Diemyctylus torosus.—Ed. [Clark:] Tuesday 11th. of March 1806 Early this morning Sergt. Pryor arrived with a small Canoe loaded with fish which he had obtained from the Cath-lah-mah's for a very small part of the articles he had taken with him. the wind had prevented his going to the fishery on the opposit side of the river above the Waukiecum's, and also as we had suspected, prevented his return as early as he otherwise would have been back. The dogs of the Cathlamah's had bitten the throng assunder which confined his canoe and she had gorn adrift: he borrowed a Canoe from the Indians in which he has returned. he found his canoe on the way and secured her, untill we return the Indians their canoe. Sent Sergt. Gass and a party in serch of one of our canoes which was reported to have been lost from a hunting party of Shields R. Field &amp; Frazier when they were last out on the opposit side of the Netul. they returned and reported that they could not find the canoe which had broken the cord with which it was attached, and was caried off by the tide. Drewyer Jo. Field &amp; Frazier set out by light this morning to pass the bay in order to hunt as they had been directed last evening. we once more live in clover; anchovies fresh sturgeon and Wappatoe. the latter Sergt. Pryor had also procured a fiew and brought with him. The Deer of this coust differ from the Common Deer, fallow Deer or Mule Deer as has [been] beformentiond. The Mule Deer we have never found except in rough country; they prefer the Open Grounds and are seldom found in the wood lands near the river; when they are met with in the wood lands or river bottoms and pursued, they imediately run to the hills or open country as the Elk do, the contrary happens with the common Deer. there are several differences between the Mule and common deer as well as in form as in habits. they are fully a third larger in general, and the male is particularly large; think there is somewhat greater disparity of size between the Male and the female of this Species than there is between the male and female fallow Deer; I am convinced I have seen a Buck of this species twice the volume [of] a Buck of the common Deer. the Ears are peculiarly large, I measured those of a large Buck which I found to be eleven inches long and 3 1/2 in width at the widest part; they are not so delicately formed, their hair in winter is thicker longer and of a much darker grey, in Summer the hair is still coarser longer and of a paler red, more like that of the Elk; in winter they also have a considerable quantity of very fine wool intermixed with the hair and lying next to the skin as the Antelope has. the long hair which grows on the outer side of the first joint of the hind legs, and which in the common Deer do not usially occupy more than 2 inches in them occupy from 6 to 8; their horns also differ, those in the common deer consist of two main beams gradually deminishing as the points proceed from it, with the Mule deer the horns consist of two beams which at the distance of 4 or 6 inches from the head divide themselves into two equal branches which again either divide into two other equal branches or terminate in a smaller, and two equal ones; haveing either 2, 4 or 6 points on a beam; the horn is not so rough about the base as the common deer, and are invariably of a much darker colour. the most striking difference of all, is the white rump and tail. from the root of the tail as a center there is a circular spot perfectly white of about 3 1/2 inches radius, which occupy a part of the rump and the extremities of buttocks and joins the white of the belley underneath; the tail which is usially from 8 to 9 inches long for the first 4 or 5 inches from its upper extremity is covered with short white hairs, much shorter indeed than those hairs of the body; from hence for about one inch further, the hair is still white but gradually becoms longer, the tail then termonates in a tissue of Black hair of about 3 inches long. from this black hair of the tail they have obtained among the French engages the appelation of the black tailed Deer, but this I conceive by no means characteristic of the Animal as much the larger portion of the tail is white. the Ears and the tail of this Animale when compared with those of the Common Deer, so well comported with those of the Mule when compared with the Horse, that we have by way of distinction adapted the appellation of the Mule Deer which I think much more appropriate. on the inner corner of each eye there is a drane (like the Elk) or large recepticle which seams to answer as a drane to the eye which givs it the appearance of weeping, this in the Common Deer of the Atlantic States is scercely proceptable but becoms more conspicious in the fallow Deer, and still more so in the Elk; this recepticle in the Elk is larger than any of the Pecora order with which I am acquainted.1 1 See vol. iii, p. 278, ante.—Ed. I have some reasons to believe that the Calumet Eagle is sometimes found on this side of the Rocky Mountains from the information of the Indians in whose possession I have seen their plumage. those are the same with those of the Missouri, and are the most butifull of all the family of the Eagle of America it's colours are black and white with which it is butifully varigated. the feathers of the tail which is so highly prized by the Indians is composed of twelve broad feathers of equal length those are white except about two inches at the extremity which is of a jut black. their wings have each a large circular white spot in the Middle when extended. the body is variously marked with white and black. the form is much that of the Common bald Eagle, but they are reather smaller and much more fleet. this Eagle is feared by all carnivarous birds, and on his approach all leave the carcase instantly on which they were feeding, it breeds in the inaccessable parts of the Mountains where it spends the summer, and descends to the plains and low country in the fall and winter when it is usially sought and taken by the nativs. two tails of this bird is esteemed by Mandans, Minnetares, Ricaras, &amp;c. as the full value of a good horse, or Gun and accoutrements. With the Osage &amp; Kanzas and those nations enhabiting countrys where this bird is more rare, the price is even double of that mentioned. with these feathers the nativs deckerate the stems of their sacred pipes or calumets; whence the name of Calumet Eagle, which has Generally obtained among the Engages. The Ricaras have domesticated this bird in many instances for the purpose of obtaining its plumage. the nativs in every part of the Continent who can precure those feathers attach them to their own hair and the mains and tail of their favorite horses by way of orniment. they also deckerate their own caps or bonnets with those feathers.1 1 Coues contends that there is no such bird as the "Calumet eagle." Indians use the feathers of the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaëtos), and those of the bald eagle (Haliaëtus leucocephalus) when its tail is changing from black to white. Probably Clark here refers to the latter.—Ed. The Leather winged bat is found &amp;c. [Lewis:] Wednesday March 12th. 1806. We sent a party again in surch of the perogue but they returned unsuccessfull as yesterday. Sent one hunter out on this side of the Netul, he did not return this evening. I beleive the Callamet Eagle is sometimes found on this side of the rocky mountains from the information of the Indians in whose possession I have seen their plumage. these are the same with those of the Missouri, and are the most beautifull of all the family of the Eagles of America. it's colours are black and white with which it is beautifully variagated. the feathers of the tail which are so highly prized by the Indians is composed of twelve broad feathers of equal length. these are white except about 2 inches at the extremity which is of a jut black. there wings have each a large circular white spot in the middle when extended. the body is variously marked with white and black. the form is much that of the common bald Eagle, but they are reather smaller and much more fleet. this eagle is feared by all carnivorous birds, and on his approach all leave the carcase instantly on which they were feeding, it breads in the inaccessable parts of the mountains where it spends the summer, and decends to the plains and low country in the fall and winter when it is usually sought and taken by the natives. two tails of this bird is esteemed by the Mandans Minnetares Ricares, &amp;c as the full value of a good horse, or gun and accoutrements. with the Great and little Osages and those nations inhabiting countries where this bird is more rare the price is even double of that mentioned. with these feathers the natives decorate the stems of their sacred pipes or callamets [calumets]; whence the name, of Callamet Eagle, which has generally obtained among the Engages. the Ricares have domesticated this bird in many instancies for the purpose of obtaining it's plumage. the natives in every part of the continent who can procure these feathers attatch them to their own hair and the mains and tails of their favorite horses by way of ornament. they also decorate their war caps or bonnets with those feathers. The leather winged bat common to the United states is also found on this side of the Rocky mountains. Besides the fish of this coast and river already mentioned we have met with the following speceis viz. the Whale, Porpus, Skaite, flounder, Salmon, red charr, two speceis of Salmon trout, mountain or speckled trout, and a speceis similar to one of those noticed on the Missouri within the mountains, called in the Eastern states, bottle-nose. I have no doubt but there are many other speceis of fish, which also exist in this quarter at different seasons of the year, which we have not had an oportunity of seeing. the shell fish are the Clam, perrewinkle, common mussle, cockle, and a speceis with a circular flat shell. The Whale is sometimes pursued harpooned and taken by the Indians of this coast; tho' I beleive it is much more frequently killed by runing fowl [foul] on the rocks of the coast in violent storms and thrown on shore by the wind and tide. in either case the Indians prese[r]ve and eat the blubber and oil as has been before mentioned, the whale bone they also carefully preserve for sale. Our party are now furnished with 358 pair of mockersons exclusive of a good portion of dressed leather. [Clark:] Wednesday March 12th 1806 We sent a party again in serch of the Canoe but they returned unsucksessfull as yesterday sent one hunter out on this side of the Netul he did not return this evening. Our party are now furnished with 358 par of Mockersons exclusive of a good portion of Dressed leather, they are also previded with shirts overalls capoes of dressed Elk skins for the homeward journey. Besides the fish of this coast and river already mentioned we have met with the following species. viz. the Whale, Porpus, Skaite, flounder, Salmon, red-carr, two Specis of salmon trout, mountain or speckled trout, and a Species similar to one of those noticed on the Missouri within the mountains, called in the Eastern States, bottle nose. I have no doubt but there are many other species of fish which also exist in this quarter at different seasons of the year, which we have not had an oppertunity of seeing. the Shell fish are the Clam, perriwinkle, common Muscle, cockle, and a species with a circular flat shell. The Whale is sometimes pursued harpooned and taken by the Indians of this coast; tho I believe it is much more frequently killed by running on the rocks of the coast to S.S.W. in violent storms, and thrown on different parts of the coast by the winds and tide. in either case the Indians preserve and eat the blubber and oil as has been before mentioned. the whale bone they also carefully preserve for sale. The Reptiles of this country are the rattlesnake, garter snake a common brown Lizzard. the season was so far advanced on this side of the Rocky Mountains that but fiew rattle snakes were seen. I did not remark one particularly my self nor do I know if they are of either of the four species found in different parts of the United States, or of that species before observed only on the upper parts of the Missouri &amp; its branches. The Garter snake so called in the U States is very common in this country, they are found in great numbers on the open and sometimes marshy grounds in this neighbourhood. they differ not at all from those of the United States. the Black or dark brown Lizzard we saw at the long narrows or commencement of the woody country on the Columbia; they are also the same with those of the U. States. The snail is noumerous in the woodey country on the Columbia; they are in shape like those of the U. States, but are at least five times their bulk. there is a specis of water Lizzard of which I only saw one just above the grand rapid of the Columbia. it is about 9 inches long the body is reather flat and about the size of a mans finger, covered with a soft skin of dark brown colour with an uneaven surface covered with little pimples, the neck and head are short, the latter termonateing in an accute angular point and flat. the fore feet each have four toes, the hinder ones five unconnected with a web and destitute of tallons. it's tail was reather longer than the body, and in form like that of the Muskrat, first riseing in an arch higher than the back, and decending lower than the body at the extremety, and flated perpendicularly. the belley and under part of the neck and head were of a Brick red every other part of the colour of the upper part of the body are dark brown. the mouth was smooth without teeth. The horns of some of the Elk have not yet fallen off and those of others have Grown to the length of six inches. the latter are in the best order, from which it would seem that the pore Elk retain their horns longer. [Lewis:] Thursday March 13th 1806. This morning Drewyer Jos. Fields and Frazier returned; they had killed two Elk and two deer. visited by two Cathlahmahs who left us in the evening. we sent Drewyer down to the Clatsop village to purchase a couple of their canoes if possible. Sergt Pryor and a party made another surch for the lost perog[u]e but was unsuccessfull; while engaged in surching for the perogue Collins one of his party killed two Elk near the Netul below us. we sent Sergt. Ordway and a party for the flesh of one of the Elk beyond the bay with which they returned in the evening, the other Elk and two deer were at some distance. R. Fields and Thompson who set out yesterday morning on a hunting excurtion towards point Adams have not yet returned. The horns of some of the Elk have not yet fallen off, and those of others have shotten out to the length of six inches. the latter are in the best order; from which it would seem that the poor Elk retain their horns longest.

The flounder is also an inhabitant of the salt water, we have seen them also on the beach where they had been left by the tide, the Indians eat the latter and esteem it very fine, these several speceis are the same with those of the Atlantic coast. the common Salmon and red Charr are the inhabitants of both the sea and rivers. the former is usually largest and weighs from 5 to 15 lbs. it is this speceis that extends itself into all the rivers and little creeks on this side of the Continent, and to which the natives are so much indebted for their subsistence. the body of this fish is from 2 1/2 to 3 feet long and proportionably broad. it is covered with imbricated scales of a moderate size and is variagated with irregular black spots on it's sides and gills, the eye is large and the iris of a silvery colour the pupil black. the nostrum [rostrum] or nose extends beyond the under jaw, and both the upper and lower jaws are armed with a single series of long teeth which are subulate and infle[c]ted near the extremities of the jaws where they are also more closely arranged. they have some sharp teeth of smaller size and same shape placed on the tongue which is thick and fleshey. the fins of the back are two; the first is plaised nearer the head than the ventral fins and has rays, the second is placed far back near the tail is small and has no rays. the flesh of this fish is when in order of a deep flesh coloured red and every shade from that to an orrange yellow, and when very meager almost white. the roes of this fish are much esteemed by the natives who dry them in the sun and preserve them for a great length of time. they are about the size of a small pea nearly transparent and of a redish yellow colour. they resemble very much at a little distance the common currants of our gardens but are more yellow. this fish is sometimes red along the sides and belley near the gills; particularly the male. The red Charr are reather broader in proportion to their length than the common salmon, the skales are also imbricated but reather large.1 1 All the species of salmon on the Pacific coast may be reduced to five, belonging to the one genus Oncorhyncus: (1) O. chavicha, or quinnat, called "quinnat" and "king salmon"—the "common salmon "of Lewis and Clark; (2) O, nerka, the blue-backed salmon ("red char"); (3) O. kisutch, the silver salmon, called by Lewis and Clark "white salmon-trout," and figured on p. 133 of Codex I. (see Clark, Mar. 16, 1806); (4) O. kita, the dog-salmon; (5) O. gorbuscha, the humpbacked salmon.—Ed. the nostrum [rostrum] exceeds the lower jaw more and the teeth are neither as large nor so numerous as those of the salmon. some of them are almost entirely red on the belley and sides; others are much more white than the salmon and none of them are variagated with the dark spots which make the body of the other. their flesh roes and every other particular with rispect to their form is that of the Salmon. this fish we did not see untill we decended below the gr[e]at falls of the Columbia, but whether they are exclusively confined to this portion of the river or not at all seasons I am unable to determine. [Clark:] Thursday March 13th 1806 This morning Drewyer Jos. Fields and Frazer returned. they had killed two Elk and two deer. Visited by two Cath-lah-mars who left us in the evening. we sent Drewyer down to the Clatsop Village to purchase a couple of their canoes if possible. Sergt. Pryor and a party made another serch for the lost Canoe but was unsucksessfull; while engaged in serching for the canoe, Collins one of his party killed two Elk near the Netul below us. we sent Sergt. Ordway and a party for the flesh of one of the Elk beyond the Bay with which they returned in the evening; the other Elk and 2 Deer were at some distance. R. Field and Thompson who set out on a hunting excursion yesterday morning towards point Adams have not yet returned. took equal altitudes to day this being the only fair day for sometime past. The Porpus is common on this coast and as far up the river as the water is brackish. the Indians sometimes gig them and always eat the flesh of this fish when they can precure it; to me the flavour is disagreeable. the Skaite is also common to the salt water, I have seen several of them that had perished and were thrown out on the beach by the tide. The flounder is also an enhabitent of the salt water. we have seen them also on the beach where they had been left by the tide, the nativs eate the latter and esteem it very fine. these several species are the same of those of the atlantic coasts. The common salmon and red charr are the inhabitents of both the sea and river, the former is usially largest and weighs from 5 to 15 lbs. it is this species that extends itself into all the rivers and little creek on this side of the Continent, and to which the nativs are so much indented for their subsistence. the body of this fish is from 2 1/2 to 3 feet long and perpotionably broad. it is covered with imbricated scales of a moderate size and is varigated with irregular black spots on its side and gills. the eye is large and the iris of a silvery colour the pupil black. the nostrum or nose extend beyond the under jaws, and both the upper and the lower jaw are armed with a single series of long teeth which are subulate and infleted near the extremities of the jaws where they are more closely arranged. they have some sharp teeth of smaller size and same shape on the tongue which is thick and fleshey. the fins of the back are two; the first is placed nearer the head than the Ventral fins and has [blank space in MS.] rays, the second is placed far back near the tail is small and has no rays. The flesh of this fish when in order of a deep flesh coloured red and every shade from that to an orrange yellow, and when very meager almost white. the Roe of this fish are much esteemed by the nativs, who dry them in the sun and preserve them for a great length of time. they are about the size of a small pea nearly transparrent and of a redish yellow colour. they resemble very much at a little distance the common current of our gardens but are more yellow. this fish is sometimes red along the sides and belly near the gills; particularly the male of this species. The Red Charr are reather broader in proportion to their length than the common salmon, the skales are also embricated but reather large. the nostrum exceeds the lower jaw more and the teeth are neither so noumerous or large as those of the salmon. some of them are almost entirely red on the belly and sides; others are much more white than the salmon, and none of them. are varigated with the dark spots which mark the body of the other. their flesh roe and every other particular with respect to their [form] is that of the salmon. this fish we did not see untill we had decended below the Great falls of the Columbia; but whether they are exclusively confined to this portion of the river or not at all seasons, I am unable to determine. The Salmon Trout are seldom more than two feet in length, they are narrow in purportion to their length, at least much more so than the salmon &amp; red charr. their jaws are nearly of the same length, and are furnished with a single series of subulate streight teeth, not so long or so large as those of the salmon, the mouth is wide, and the tongue is also furnished with some teeth, the fins are placed much like those of the salmon, at the Great Falls are met with this fish of a silvery white colour on the belly and sides, and a blueish light brown on the back and head, in this neighbourhood we have met with another species which does not differ from the other in any particular except in point of colour. this last is of a dark colour on the back, and its sides and belley are yellow with transverse stripes of dark brown. sometimes a little red is intermixed with these colours on the belly and sides towards the head. the flesh &amp; roe is like those described of the salmon. the white species which we found below the falls were in excellent order when the salmon were entirely out of season and not fit for use. The species which we found here early in november on our arrival in this quarter had declined considerably, reather more so than the red charr with which we found them associated in the little riverlets and creeks. I think it may be safely asserted that the Red charr and both species of the salmon trout remain in season longer in the fall of the year than the common salmon;1 1 The dark-colored salmon trout is Salmo gairdineri.—Ed. but I have my doubt whether [any] of the species of the salmon trout ever pass the Great falls of the Columbia. The Indians tell us that the salmon begin to run early in the next month; it will be unfortunate for us if they do not, for they must form our principal dependance for food in assending the Columbia above the Falls and it's S. E. branch Lewis's river to the Mountains. The Speckled or Mountain Trout are found in the waters of the Columbia within the Rocky Mountains.2 2 Salmo purpuratus.—Ed. they are the same of those found in the upper part of the Missouri, but are not so abundant in the Columbian Waters as in that river. The bottlenose is also found on the waters of the Columbia within the Mountains.3 3 See vol. iii, p. 304, ante.—Ed. [Lewis:] Friday March 14th 1806. This morning we sent a party after the two Elk which Collins killed last evening, they returned with them about noon. Collins, Jos. Fields and Shannon went in quest of the flock of Elk of which Collins had killed those two. this evening we heared upwards of twenty shot, and expect that they have fallen in with and killed a number of them. Reubin Fields and Thompson returned this evening unsuccessfull having killed one brant only. late in the evening Drewyer arrived with a party of the Clatsops who brought an indifferent canoe some hats and roots for sale, the hats and roots we purchased, but could not obtain the canoe without giving more than our stock of merchandize would lisence us. I offered him my laced uniform coat but he would not exchange. The Salmon Trout are seldom more than two feet in length they are narrow in proportion to their length, at least much more so than the Salmon or red charr. the jaws are nearly of the same length, and are furnished with a single series of small subulate streight teeth, not so long or as large as those of the Salmon. the mouth is wide, and the tongue is also furnished with some teeth, the fins are placed much like those of the salmon. at the great falls we met with this fish of a silvery white colour on the belley and sides, and a bluish light brown on the back and head, in this neighbourhood we have met with another speceis which dose not differ from the other in any particular except in point of colour. this last is of a dark colour on the back. and it's sides and belley are yellow with transverse stripes of dark brown. sometimes a little red is intermixed with these colours on the belley and sides towards the head. the eye, flesh, and roes are like those discribed of the Salmon. the white speceis which we found below the falls was in excellent order when the salmon were entirely out of season and not fit for uce. the speceis which we found here on our arrival early in November has declined considerably, reather more so inded than the red Charr with which we found them ascociated in the little rivulets and creeks. I think it may be safely asserted that the red Charr and both speceis of the salmon trout remain in season longer in the fall of the year than the common Salmon; but I have my doubts whether either of them ever pass the great falls of the Columbia. The Indians tell us that the Salmon begin to run early in the next month; it will be unfortunate for us if they do not, for they must form our principal dependence for food in ascending the Columbia, above the falls and it's S.E. branch to the Mountains. The mountain or speckled trout are found in the waters of the Columbia within the mountains, they are the same of those found in the upper part of the Missouri, but are not so abundant in the Columbia as on that river. we never saw this fish below the mountains, but from the transparency and coldness of the Kooskooske I should not doubt it's existing in that stream as low as it's junction with the S.E. branch of the Columbia. The bottle nose is the same with that before mentioned on the Missouri and is found exclusively within the mountains. [Clark:] Friday March 14th 1806. This morning we dispatched a party after two Elk which Collins killed last evening, they returned with them about noon. Jos: Field, Collins, Go: Shannon &amp; Labiesh went in quest of the gang of Elk out of which Collins had killed the 2 yesterday. this evening we had upwards of twenty shot and expect they have fallen in with and killed several of them. Reuben Field and Thompson returned this evening unsucksessfull haveing killed only one Brant. late in the evening Geo: Drewyer arrived with a party of the Clatsops who brought an indifferent canoe, three hats and some roots for sale we could not purchase the canoe without giveing more than our stock of merchandize would lisence us. Capt. Lewis offered his land uniform coat for a verry indiferent canoe, agreeable to their usial way of tradeing his price was double. we are informed by the Clatsops that they have latterly seen an Indian from the Q uin-na-chart Nation1 1 A Salishan tribe allied to the Indians of Puget Sound, probably merged in the Quinaielt. Lewis and Clark appear to be the only authority giving the name in this form. See "Estimate of Western Indians," vol. vi, post,—Ed. who reside six days march to the N. W and that four vessles were there and the owners Mr. Haley, Moore, Callamon &amp; Swipeton were tradeing with that noumerous nation, whale bone oile and skins of various discription. [Lewis:] Saturday March 15th 1806. This morning at 11. OCk. the hunters arrived, having killed four Elk only. Labuish it seems was the only hunter who fell in with the Elk and having by some accedent lost the fore sight of his gun shot a great number of times but killed only the number mentioned. as the elk were scattered we sent two parties for them, they returned in the evening with four skins and the flesh of three Elk, that of one of them having become putrid from the liver and pluck having been carelessly left in the animal all night. we were visited this afternoon by Delashshelwilt a Chinnook Chief his wife and six women of his nation which the old baud his wife had brought for market. this was the same party that had communicated the venerial to so many of our party in November last, and of which they have finally recovered. I therefore gave the men a particular charge with rispect to them which they promised me to observe. late this evening we were also visited by Catel a Clatsop man and his family. he brought a canoe and a Sea Otter Skin for sale neither of which we purchased this evening. The Clatsops who had brought a canoe for sale last evening left us early this morning. Bratton still sick. Observed Equal Altitudes of the ? with Sextant. h m s h m s A M. 7. 58. 29 P.

It is the American white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons gambeli).—Ed. the flesh of this fowl is as good as that of the common pided brant. they not remain here during the winter in such numbers as the white brant do, tho' they have now returned in considerable quantities. first saw them below tide-water. [Clark:] Saturday March 15th 1806 This morning at 11 oClock the hunters arrived, haveing killed four Elk only. Labiesh it seams was the only Hunter who fell in with the Elk and haveing by some accident lost the foresight of his gun shot a great number of times and only killed four. as the Elk were scattered we sent two parties for them, they return in the evening with four skins, and the flesh of three Elk, that of one of them haveing become putred from the liver and pluck haveing been carelessly left in the animal all night. We were visited this Afternoon in a canoe 4 feet 2 I. wide by De-lash-hel-wilt a Chinnook Chief his wife and six women of his Nation, which the Old Boud his wife had brought for Market. this was the same party which had communicated the venereal to several of our party in November last, and of which they have finally recovered. I therefore gave the men a particular charge with respect to them which they promised me to observe. late this evening we were also visited by Ca-tel a Clatsop man and his family. he brought a Canoe and a sea otter skin for sale neither of which we could purchase of him. the Clatsops which had brought a Canoe for sale last evening left us this morning. Bratten is still very weak and unwell. There is a third species of Brant in the neighbourhood of this place which is about the size and much the form of the b[p]ided brant. they weigh about 8 1/2 lbs. the wings are not as long nor so pointed as the common pided brant. the following is a likeness of its head and beak. a little distance around the base of the beak is white and is suddenly succeeded by a narrow line of dark brown. the ballance of the neck, head, back, wings and tail all except the tips of the feathers are of the blueish brown of the common wild goose, the breast and belly are white with an irregular mixture of black feathers which give that part a pided appearance. from the legs back underneath the tail, and around the junction of the same with the body above, the feathers are white. the tail is composed of 18 feathers; the longest of which are in the center and measure 6 inches with the barrel of the quill; those on the side of the tail are something shorter and bend with their extremities inwards towards the center of the tail. the extremities of these feathers are white. the beak is of a light flesh colour. the legs and feet which do not differ in structure from those of the Goose or brant of the other species, are of an orrange yellow colour. the eye is small; the iris is of a dark yellowish brown, and puple black. the note of this brant is much that of the common pided brant from which in fact they are not to be distinguished at a distance, but they certainly are a distinct species of brant. the flesh of this fowl is as good as that of the common pided brant. they do not remain here dureing the winter in such numbers as the white brant do, tho' they have now returned in considerable quantities. we first met with this brant on tide water. The Clams of this coast are very small. the shells consist of two valves which open with a hinge, the shell is smooth Head of a Brant, by Clark. thin and of an oval form or like that of the common Muscle and of a skye blue colour; it is of every size under a Inch &amp; 3/4 in length, and hangs in clusters to the moss of the rocks, the nativs sometimes eate them. The Periwinkle both of the river and ocian are similar to those found in the same situation on the Atlantic. there is also an animal which inhabits a shell perfectly circular about 3 inches in diameetor, thin and entire on the marjin, convex and smooth on the upper side, plain on the under part and covered with a number of minute capillary fibers by means of which it attaches itself to the sides of the rocks. the shell is thin and consists of one valve. a small circular opperture is formed in the center of the under shell the animal is soft and boneless &amp;c.1 1 Placunanomia macroschisma, a bivalve of the family Anomiidæ. The "clams" are properly a species of salt-water mussels (Mytilus edulis).—Ed. [Lewis:] Sunday March 16th 1806. Not any occurrence worthy of relation took place today. Drewyer and party did not return from the Cathlahmahs this evening as we expected. we suppose he was detained by the hard winds of today. the Indians remained with us all day, but would not dispose of their canoes at a price which it was in our power to give consistently with the state of our Stock of Merchandize. two handkerchiefs would now contain all the small articles of merchandize which we possess; the ballance of the stock consists of 6 blue robes one scarlet d° one uniform artillerist's coat and hat, five robes made of our large flag, and a few old cloaths trimed with ribbon. on this stock we have wholy to depend for the purchase of horses and such portion of our subsistence from the Indians as it will be in our powers to obtain. a scant dependence indeed, for a tour of the distance of that before us. the Clam of this coast are very small. the shell consists of two valves which open with a hinge. the shell is smooth thin of an oval form or like that of the common mussle, and sky blue colour, it is about 1 1/2 inches in length, and hangs in clusters to the moss of the rocks. the natives sometimes eat them. the perewinkle of the river and Ocean are similar to those found in the same situations on the Atlantic coast. the common mussle of the river are also the same with those in the rivers of the atlantic coast. the cockle is small and also much the same of the Atlantic. there is also an animal which inhabits a shell perfectly circular about 3 Inches in diameter, thin and entire on the margin, convex and smooth on the upper side, plain on the under part and covered with a number [of] minute capillary fibers by means of which it attatches itself to the sides of the rocks. the shell is thin and consists of one valve. a small circular apperture is formed in the center of the under shell, the animal is soft &amp; boneless. The white Salmon Trout which we had previously seen only at the great falls of the Columbia has now made it's appearance in the creeks near this place. one of them was brought us today by an Indian who had just taken it with his gig. this is a likness of it; it was 2 feet 8 Inches long, and weighed 10 lbs. the eye is moderately large, the puple black and iris of a silvery white with a small addmixture of yellow, and is a little terbid near it's border with a yellowish brown. the position of the fins may be seen from the drawing,1 1 For this drawing see Clark's entry for March, 16, p. 176, post.—Ed. they are small in proportion to the fish, the fins are boney but not pointed except the tail and back fins which are a little so, the prime back fin and ventral ones, contain each ten rays; those of the gills thirteen, that of the tail twelve, and the small fins placed near the tail above has no bony rays, but is a tough flexable substance covered with smooth skin. it is thicker in proportion to it's width than the salmon. the tongue is thick and firm beset on each border with small subulate teeth in a single series. the teeth of the mouth are as before discribed. neither this fish nor the salmon are caught with the hook, nor do I know on what they feed. [Clark:] Sunday March 16th 1806 Not any occurrence worthy of relation took place today. Drewyer and party did not return from the Cathlahmah's this evening as we expected. we suppose he was detained by the hard winds today. the Indians remain with us all day, but would not dispose of their canoe at a price which it was in our power to give consistently with the state of our stock of Merchandize which we possess, the ballance of the stock consists of 6 small blue robes or Blankets one of scarlet. one uniform Artillerist's coat and hat, 5 robes made of our larg flag, and a fiew [of] our old clothes trimed with ribon. on this stock we have wholy to depend for the purchase of horses and such portion of our subsistence from the Indians as it will be in our power to obtain. a scant dependence indeed for the tour of the distance of that before us. The pellucid jelly like substance, called the sea nettle I found in great abundance along the Strand where it has been thrown up by the waves and tide, and adheres to the sand. There are two species of the Tuci or (seawead) seawreck which we also found thrown up by the waves. the 1st. specie at one extremity consists of a large s[v]esicle or hollow vessale which would contain from one to 2 gallons, of a conic form, the base of which forms the extreem End and is convex and Globelar bearing on its center some short broad and irregular fibers. the substance is about the consistancy of the rind of a citron Mellon and 3/4 of an inch thick, yellow celindrick, and regularly tapering the tube extends to 20 or 30 feet and is then termonated with a number of branches which are flat 1/2 inch in width, rough particularly on the edges, where they are furnished with a number of little oval vesicles or bags of the size of a Pigions egg. this plant seams to be calculated to float at each extremity, while the little end of the tube from whence the branches proceed, lies deepest in the water. The White Salmon Trout which we had previously seen only at the Great Falls of the Columbia, or a little below the Great Falls, has now made its appearance in the creeks near this place. one of them was brought us to day by an indian who had just taken it with his gig. This is a likeness of it; it was 2 feet 8 inches long, and weighed ten pounds the eye is moderately large, the puple black with a small admixture of yellow and the iris of a silvery white with a small admixture of yellow and a little tirbed near its border with a yellowish brown. the position of the fins may be seen from the drawing, they are small in perpotion to the fish. the fins are boney but not pointed except the tail and back fins which are a little so, the prime back fin and venteral ones, contain each ten rays; those of the gills twelve, and the small finn placed near the tail above has no long rays, but is a tough flexable substance covered with smooth skin. it is thicker in perpotion to its width than the salmon. the tongue is thick and firm beset on each border with small subulate teeth in a single series. the Teeth of the mouth are as before discribed. neither this fish nor the salmon are cought with the hook, nor do I know on what they feed. [they] now begin to run &amp;c. &amp;c. [Lewis:] Monday March 17th. 1806. Catel and his family left us this morning. Old Delashelwilt and his women still remain they have formed a ca[m]p near the fort and seem to be determined to lay close s[i]ege to us but I beleive notwithstanding every effort of their wining graces, the men have preserved their constancy to the vow of celibacy which they made on this occasion to Capt. C. and myself. we have had our perogues prepared for our departure, and shal set out as soon as the weather will permit. the weather is so precarious that we fear by waiting untill the first of April that we might be detained several days longer before we could get from this to the Cathlahmahs as it must be calm or we cannot accomplish that part of our rout. Drewyer returned late this evening from the Cathlahmahs with our canoe which Sergt. Pryor had left some days since, and also a canoe which he had purchased from those people. for this canoe he gave my uniform laced coat and nearly half a carrot of tobacco. it seems that nothing excep[t] this coat would induce them to dispose of a canoe which in their mode of traffic is an article of the greatest val[u]e except a wife, with whom it is equal, and is generally given in exchange to the father for his daughter. I think the U'States are indebted to A White Salmon Trout, by Clark. me another Uniform coat for that of which I have disposed on this occasion was but little woarn. we yet want another canoe, and as the Clatsops will not sell us one at a price which we can afford to give we will take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us in the winter. The pellucid jellylike substance, called the sea-nettle is found in great abundance along the stra[n]d where it has been thrown up by the waves and tide. There are two speceis of the Fuci or seawreck [wrack] which we also find thrown up by the waves. the 1st. speceis at one extremity consists of a large vesicle or hollow vessell which would contain from one to two gallons, of a conic form, the base of which forms the extreem end and is convex and globelar bearing on it's center some short broad and irregular fibers, the substance is about the consistence of the rind of a citron mellon and 3/4 of an inch thick. the rihind is smooth. from the small extremity of the cone a long hollow, celindrick, and regularly tapering tube extends to 20 or thirty feet and is then terminated with a number of branches which are flat 1/2 an inch in width rough particular[ly] on the edges where they are furnished with a number of little ovate vesicles or bags of the size of a pigeon's egg. this plant seems to be calculated to float at each extremity while the little end of the tube from whence the branches proceed, lies deepest in the water. The other speceis I have never seen but Capt. Clark who saw it on the coast towards the Killamucks informed me that it resembles a large pumpkin, it is solid and it's specific gravity reather greater than the water, tho it is sometimes thrown out by the waves. it is of a yellowis[h] brown colour. the rhind smooth and consistence harder than that of a pumpkin tho' easily cut with a knife. there are some dark brown fibers reather harder than any other part which pass longitudinally through the pulp or fleshey substance w[h]ich forms the interior of this marine production.1 1 Coues thinks these both belong to the same species, i. e. Nereocystis lutkeana.—Ed. The following is a list of the names of the commanders of vessels who visit the entrance of the Columbia river in the spring and autumn fror the purpose of trading with the natives or hunting Elk. these names are spelt as the Indians pronounce them.1 1 Cf. Clark's list, under date of January 1, in vol. iii, pp. 305–307, ante.—Ed.

[Clark:] Monday March 17th. 1806 Catel and his family left us this morning. Old Delashelwilt and his women still remain, they have formed a camp near the fort and seam determined to lay close sege to us, but I believe notwithstanding every effort of their wining graces the men have preserved their constancy to the vow of celibacy which they made on this Occasion to Capt L. and myself. we have had our Canoes prepared for our departure, and shall set out as soon as the weather will permit. the weather is so precarious that we fear by waiting untill the first of April that we might be detained several days longer before we could get from this to the Cath-lah-mahs, as it must be calm or we cannot accomplish that part of the rout in our canoes. Drewyer returned late this evening from the Cath-lah-mahs with our Indian canoe which Sergt: Pryor had left some days since, and also a canoe, which he had purchased from those people. for this canoe he gave Captn. Lewis's uniform laced coat and nearly half a carrot of tobacco. it seams that nothing except this Coat would induce them to dispose of a canoe which in their mode of traffic is an article of the greatest value except a wife, with whome it is nearly equal, and is generally given in exchange to the father for his daughter. I think that the United States are in justice indebted to Captn Lewis another uniform Coat for that of which he has disposed of on this ocasion, it was but little worn. We yet want another canoe as the Clatsops will not sell us one, a proposition has been made by one of our interpts. and sever [al] of the party to take one in lieu of 6 Elk which they stole from us this winter &amp;c</field>

DREWYER was taken last night with a violent pain in his side. Capt. Clark blead him. several of the men are complaining of being unwell. it is truly unfortunate that they should be sick at the moment of our departure. we directed Sergt. Pryor to prepare the two Canoes which Drewyer brought last evening for his mess. they wanted some knees to strengthen them and several cracks corked and payed. he completed them except the latter operation which the frequent showers in the course of the day prevented as the canoes could not be made sufficiently dry even with the assistance of fire. Comowooll and two Cathlahmahs visited us today; we suffered them to remain all night. this morning we gave Delashelwilt a certificate of his good deportment &amp;c. and also a list of our names, after which we dispatched him to his village with his female band. These lists of our names we have given to several of the natives and also paisted up a copy in our room.1 1 Biddle relates (ii, p. 204, note) that one of these papers was delivered by the natives to Captain Hill, of the American brig "Lydia." Proceeding to Canton, he apparently presented it to a friend there, who sent a copy of it (with a letter dated January, 1807) to a friend in Philadelphia.—Ed. the object of these lists we stated in the preamble of the same as follows (viz) "The object of this list is, that through the medium of some civilized person who may see the same, it may be made known to the informed world, that the party consisting of the persons whose names are hereunto annexed, and who were sent out by the government of the U'States in May 1804. to explore the interior of the Continent of North America, did penetrate the same by way of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, to the discharge of the latter into the Pacific Ocean, where they arrived on the 14th. of November 1805, and from whence they departed the [blank space in MS.] day of March 1806 on their return to the United States by the same rout they had come out." on the back of some of these lists we added a sketch of the connection of the upper branches of the Missouri with those of the Columbia, particularly of it's main S.E. branch, on which we also delineated the track we had come and that we meant to pursue on our return where the same happened to vary. There seemed so many chances against our government ever obtaining a regular report, through the medium of the savages and the traders of this coast that we declined making any. our party are also too small to think of leaving any of them to return to the U'States by sea, particularly as we shall be necesarily divided into three or four parties on our return in order to accomplish the objects we have in view; and at any rate we shall reach the United States in all human probability much earlier than a man could who must in the event of his being left here depend for his passage to the United States on the traders of the coast who may not return immediately to the U'States or if they should, might probably spend the next summer in trading with the natives before they would set out on their return. this evening Drewyer went in quest of his traps, and took an Otter. Joseph Fields killed an Elk. The Indians repeated to us the names of eighteen distinct tribes residing on the S.E. coast who spoke the Killamucks language, and beyond those six others who spoke a different language which they did not comprehend.1 1 For these tribes see Ethnology: Western Indians, in our vol. vi.—Ed. [Clark2 2 The journal of Clark for March 18–April 3, 1806, is found in Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 2.—Ed. :] Tuesday March 17 [18]th 1806 Drewyer was taken last night with a violent pain in his side. I bled him. several of the men are complaining of being unwell. it is truly unfortunate that they should be sick at the moment of our departure. Derected Sergt. Pryor to prepare the two Indian Canoes which we had purchased for his mess. they wanted some knees to strengthen them and several cracks corked and payed. he compleated them except paying the frequent showers of rain prevented the canoes drying sufficient to pay them even with the assistance of fire. Commorwool and two Cathlahmahs visited us to day; we suffered them to remain all night. this morning we gave Delashelwilt a certificate of his good deportment &amp;c. and also a list of our names, after which we dispatched him to his village with his female band. Those list's of our names we have given to several of the nativs, and also posted up a copy in our room. the object of these lists we stated in the preamble of the same as follows Viz: "The Object of this list is, that through the medium of some civilized person who may see the same, it may be made known to the informed world, that the party consisting of the persons whose names are hereunto annexed; and who were sent out by the Government of the United States in May 1804, to explore the interior of the Continent of North America, did penetrate the same by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, to the discharge of the latter into the Pacific Ocian, where they arrived on the 14th. of November 1805, and from whence they departed the [blank space in MS.] day of March 1806 on their return to the United States by the same rout they had come out." On the back of lists we added a sketch of the continent of the upper branches of the Missouri with those of the Columbia, particularly of its upper S. E. branch or Lewis's River, on which we also delienated the track we had came and that we ment to pursue on our return, when the same happened to vary. There seemes so many chances against our governments ever obtaining a regular report, through the medium of the savages, and the traders of this coast that we decline makeing any. Our party are too small to think of leaveing any of them to return to the Unt. States by Sea, particularly as we shall be necessarily devided into two or three parties on our return in order to accomplish the Object we have in View; and at any rate we shall reach the U. States in all humain probability much earlier than a man could who must in the event of his being left here depend for his passage to the U. State[s] on the traders of the coast, who may not return imediately to the U. States, or if they should, might probably spend the next summer in tradeing with the nativs before they would set out on their return. This evening Drewyer went in quest of his traps, and took an otter. Joseph Field killed and [an] Elk. The Indians repeated to us Eighteen distinct Nati[ons] resideing on the S S.E coast who speak the Kilamox language or understand it. and beyend those six other Nations which speak a different language which they did not comprehend. The 2d. species of seawreck which I saw on the coast to the S. S. E. near the Kilâmox nation. it resembles a large pumpkin, it is solid and it's specific Gravity reather greater than the water, tho' it is sometimes thrown out by the waves. it is of a pale yellowish brown colour. the rhind smooth and consistency harder than that of the pumpkin, tho' easily cut with a knife. there are some fibers of a lighter colour and much harder than any other part which pass Longitudinally through the pulp or fleshey substance which forms the interior of this Marine production. [Lewis:] Wednesday March 19th. 1806. It continued to rain and hail today in such manner that nothing further could be done to the canoes. a party were sent out early after the Elk which was killed yesterday with which they returned in the course of a few hours. we gave Comowooll alias Connia, a cirtificate of his good conduct and the friendly intercourse which he has maintained with us during our residence at this place; we also gave him a list of our names, (do not) The Killamucks, Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs and Wâc-ki-a-cums (Qu: Wackms) resemble each other as well in their persons and dress as in their habits and manners. their complexion is not remarkable, being the usual copper brown of most of the tribes of North America. they are low in statu[r]e reather diminutive, and illy shapen; poss[ess]ing thick broad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs wide mouths thick lips, nose moderately large, fleshey, wide at the extremity with large nostrils, black eyes and black coarse hair. their eyes are sometimes of a dark yellowish brown the puple black. I have observed some high acqualine noses among them but they are extreemly rare. the nose is generally low between the eyes. the most remarkable trait in their physiognomy is the peculiar flatness and width of forehead which they artificially obtain by compressing the head between two boards while in a state of infancy and from which it never afterwards perfectly recovers. this is a custom among all the nations we have met with West of the Rocky mountains. I have observed the heads of many infants, after this singular bandage had been dismissed, or about the age of 10 or eleven months, that were not more than two inches thick about the upper edge of the forehead and reather thiner still higher. from the top of the head to the extremity of the nose is one streight line. this is done in order to give a greater width to the forehead, which they much admire. this process seems to be continued longer with their female than their mail children, and neither appear to suffer any pain from the operation. it is from this peculiar form of the head that the nations East of the Rocky mountains, call all the nations on this side, except the Aliohtans or snake Indians, by the generic name of Flatheads. I think myself that the prevalence of this custom is a strong proof that [of] those nations having originally proceeded from the same stock. The nations of this neighbourhood or those recapitulated above, wear their hair loosly flowing on the back and sholders; both men and women divide it on the center of the crown in front and throw it back behind the ear on each side. they are fond of combs and use them when they can obtain them; and even without the aid of the comb keep their hair in better order than many nations who are in other rispects much more civilized than themselves. the large or apparently swolen legs particularly observable in the women are obtained in a great measure by tying a cord tight around the ankle. their method of squating or resting themselves on their hams which they seem from habit to prefer to siting, no doubt contributes much to this deformity of the legs by preventing free circulation of the blood. the dress of the man consists of a smal robe, which reaches about as low as the middle of the thye and is attatched with a string across the breast and is at pleasure turned from side to side as they may have occasion to disencumber the right or left arm from the robe entirely, or when they have occasion for both hands, the fixture of the robe is in front with it's corners loosly hanging over their arms. they sometimes wear a hat which has already been discribed. this robe is made most commonly of the skins of a small animal which I have supposed was the brown Mungo, tho' they have also a number, of the skins of the tiger cat, some of those of the Elk which are used principally on their war excursions, others of the skins of the deer panther and bear and a blanket wove with the fingers of the wool of the native sheep. a mat is sometimes temperarily thrown over the sholders to protect them from rain. they have no other article of cloathing whatever neither winter nor summer. and every part except the sholders and back is exposed to view. they are very fond of the dress of the whites, which they wear in a similar manner when they can obtain them, except the shoe which I have never seen woarn by any of them. they call us pâh-shish'-e-ooks, or cloth men. The dress of the women consists of a robe, tissue, and sometimes when the weather is uncommonly cold, a vest. their robe is much smaller than that of the men, never reaching lower than the waist nor extending in front sufficiently for to cover the body. it is like that of the men confined across the breast with a string and hangs loosly over the sholders and back. the most esteemed and valuable of these robes are made of strips of the skins of the Sea Otter net together with the bark of the white cedar or silk-grass. these strips are first twisted and laid parallel with each other a little distance assunder, and then net or wove together in such manner that the fur appears equally on both sides, and unites between the strands. it make[s] a warm and soft covering. other robes are formed in a similar manner of the skin of the Rackoon, beaver &amp;c. at other times the skin is dressed in the hair and woarn without any further preperation. in this way one beaver skin, or two of those of the Raccoon or tiger catt forms the pattern of the robe. the vest is always formed in the manner first discribed of their robes and covers the body from the armpits to the waist, and is confined behind, and destitute of straps over the sholder to keep it up. when this vest is woarn the breast of the woman is concealed, but without it which is almost always the case, they are exposed, and from the habit of remaining loose and unsuspended grow to great length, particularly in aged women in many of whom I have seen the bubby reach as low as the waist. The garment which occupys the waist, and from thence as low as nearly to the knee before and the ham, behind, cannot properly be denominated a petticoat, in the common acceptation of that term; it is a tissue of white cedar bark, bruised or broken into small shreds, which are interwoven in the middle by means of several cords of the same materials, which serve as well for a girdle as to hold in place the shreds of bark which form the tissue, and which shreds confined in the middle hang with their ends pendulous from the waist, the whole being of sufficient thickness when the female stands erect to conceal those parts usually covered from formiliar view, but when she stoops or places herself in many other attitudes, this battery of Venus is not altogether impervious to the inquisitive and penetrating eye of the amorite. This tissue is sometimes formed of little twisted cords of the silk-grass knoted at their ends and interwoven as discribed of the bark. this kind is more esteemed and last much longer than those of bark. they also form them of flags and rushes which are woarn in a similar manner. the women as well as the men sometimes cover themselves from the rain by a mat woarn over the sholders. they also cover their heads from the rain sometimes with a common water cup or basket made of the cedar bark and beargrass. these people seldom mark their skins by puncturing and introducing a colouring matter. such of them as do mark themselves in this manner prefer their legs and arms on which they imprint parallel lines of dots either longitudinally or circularly. the women more frequently than the men mark themselves in this manner. The favorite ornament of both sexes are the common coarse blue and white beads which the men wear tightly wound aro[u]nd their wrists and ankles many times untill they obtain the width of three or more inches. they also wear them in large rolls loosly arond the neck, or pendulous from the cartelage of the nose or rims of the ears which are purforated for the purpose. the women wear them in a similar manner except in the nose which they never purforate. they are also fond of a species of wampum which is furnished them by a trader whom they call Swipton. it seems to be the native form of the shell without any preperation. this shell is of a conic form somewhat curved, about the size of a raven's quill at the base, and tapering to a point which is sufficiently large to permit to hollow through which a small thred passes; it is from one to 1 1/2 Inches in length, white, smooth, hard and thin.1 1 Apparently a species of Dentalium.—Ed. these are woarn in the same manner in which the beads are; and furnish the men with their favorite ornament for the nose. one of these shells is passed horizontally through the cartilage of the nose and serves frequently as a kind of ring to prevent the string which suspends other ornaments at the same part from chafing and freting the flesh. the men sometimes wear collars of bears claws, and the women and children the tusks of the Elk variously arranged on their necks arms &amp;c. both males and females wear braslets on their wrists of copper brass or Iron in various forms. I think the most disgusting sight I have ever beheld is these dirty naked wenches. The men of these nations partake of much more of the domestic drudgery than I had at first supposed. they collect and prepare all the fuel, make the fires, assist in cleansing and preparing the fish, and always cook for the strangers who visit them. they also build their houses, construct their canoes, and make all their wooden utensils. the peculiar provence of the woman seems to be to collect roots and manufacture various articles which are prepared of rushes, flags, cedar bark, bear grass or waytape. the management of the canoe for various purposes seems to be a duty common to both sexes, as also many other occupations which with most Indian nations devolves exclusively on the woman. their feasts of which they are very fond are always prepared and served by the men. Comowool and the two Cathlahmahs left us this evening. it continued to rain so constantly today that Sergt. Pryor could not pitch his canoes. [Clark:] Wednesday March 19th 1806 Inds. Descd. It continued to rain and hail in such a manner that nothing could be done to the canoes. a party were sent out early after the Elk which was killed last evening, with which they returned in the course of a fiew hours, we gave Commorwool alias Cania, a certificate of his good conduct and the friendly intercourse which he has maintained with us dureing our residence at this place: we also gave him a list of our names &amp;c. The Kilamox, Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs, Waukiacum and Chiltz I.[ndians] resemble each other as well in their persons and Dress as in their habits and manners. their complexion is not remarkable, being the usial copper brown of the tribes of North America. they are low in statue reather diminutive, and illy shaped, possessing thick broad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs, wide mouths, thick lips, noses stuck out and reather wide at the base, with black eyes and black coarse hair. I have observed some high acqualine noses among them but they are extreemly reare. the most remarkable trate in their physiognamy is the peculiar flatness and width of the forehead which they artificially obtain by compressing the head between two boards while in a state of infancy, and from which it never afterwards perfectly recovers. This is a custom among all the nations, we have met with West of the Rocky Mountains. I have observed the head of maney infants after this singular bandage had been dismissed, or about the age of 11 or 12 months, that were not more than two inches thick about the upper part of the forehead and reather thiner still higher. from the top of the head to the extremity of the nose is one streight line. this is done in order to give a greater width to the forehead, which they much admire. This process seams to be continued longer with their female than their male children, and neither appear to suffer any pain from the opperation. it is from this peculiar form of the head that the nations East of the Rocky Mountains, call all the nations on this side, except Aliahtans, So-so-ne, or Snake Indians by the General name of Flat Heads. I think myself that the provalence of this custom is a strong proof of those nations haveing originally proceeded from the same stock. The Nations of this neighbourhood or those rec[a]pitulated above, ware their hair loosly flowing on their back and sholders; both men and women divide it on the center of the crown in front and throw it back behind the ear on each side. they are fond of combs and use them when they can obtain them; and even without the aid of combs keep their [hair] in better order, than maney nations who are in other respects much more civilized than themselves. The large or apparently sweled legs particularly observable in the women are obtained in a great measure by tying a cord tight around the leg above the ancle bone. their method of squating or resting themselves on their hams which they seam from habit to prefer to sitting, no doubt contributes much to this deformity of the legs by preventing free circulation of the blood. This is also the custom of the nations above. The dress of the men like those above on the Columbia river consists of a small robe, which reaches about as low as the middle of the thye and is attatched with a string across the breast and is at pleasure turned from side to side as they may have an occasion to disincumber the right or left arm from the robe entirely, or when they have occasion for both hands, the fixture of the robe is in front with it's corner loosly hanging over their arms. they sometimes wear a hat which have already been discribed (see 29th Jany.) Their robes are made most commonly of the skins of a small animal which I have supposed was the brown Mungo tho' they have also a number of the skins of the tiger cat, some of those of the Elk which are used principally on their war excursions, others of the skins of Deer, panthor, Bear, and the Speckled Loon, and blankets wove with the fingers of the wool of the native sheep. and some of those on the sea coast have robes of Beaver and the sea otter. a mat is sometimes tempera[ri]ly thrown over the sholders to protect them from rain. they have no other article of cloathing whatever neither winter nor summer, and every part except the sholders and back is exposed to view. they are very fond of the dress of the whites, which they ware in a similar manner when they can obtain them, except the shoe or mockerson which I have never seen worn by any of them. They call us pâh-shish-e-ooks or cloath men. The dress of the women consists of a roab, tissue, and sometimes when the weather is uncommonly cold, a vest. their robe is much smaller than that of the men, never reaching lower than the waist nor extending in front sufficiently far to cover the body. it is like that of the men confined across the breast with a string and hangs loosely over the sholders and back. the most esteemed and valuable of those robes are made of strips of the skin of the sea otter net together with the bark of the white cedar or silk grass, these fish [strips] are first twisted and laid parallel with each other a little distance asunder, and then net or wove together in such a manner that the fur appears equally on both sides, and united between the strands, it makes a worm and soft covering. other robes are formed in a similar manner of the skins of the rackoon, beaver &amp;c. at other times the skins is dressed in the hair and worn without any further preparation. in this way one beaver skin or two of the rackoon or one of the tiger cat forms a vest and covers the body from the armpits to the waist, and is confined behind, and destitute of straps over the sholder to keep it up. when this vest is worn the breast of the woman in consealed, but without it which is almost always the case, they are exposed, and from the habit of remaining loose and unsuspended grow to great length particularly in aged women, on many of whom I have seen the bubby reach as low as the waist. The petticoat or tissue which occupies the waiste has been already described (see 7th. Novr. 1805) formd. of the Bark of white cedar, silk grass, flags &amp; rushes. The women as well as the men sometimes cover themselves from the rain by a mat worn over the sholders. They also cover their heads from the rain sometimes with a common water cup or basket made of cedar bark and bear grass. Those people sometimes mark themselves by punctureing and introducing a colouring matter. Such of them as do mark themselves in this manner prefur the legs and arms on which they imprint parallel lines of dots either longitudinally or circularly, the women more frequently than the men mark themselves in this manner. The favorite orniments of both sexes are the common coarse blue and white beads as before discribed of the Chinnooks. those beads the men wear tightly wound around their wrists and ankles maney times untill they obtain the width of three or four inches. they also wear them in large rolls loosly around the neck, or pendulous from the cartelage of the nose or rims of the ears which are purforated in different places round the extremities for the purpose. the women wear them in a similar manner except in the nose which they never purforate. they are also fond of a species of wompum, which is furnished by a trader whome they call Swipton. it seams to be the nativ form of the shell without any preparation. this shell is of a conic form somewhat curved about the size of a ravens quill at the base, and tapering to a point which is sufficiently large to permit a hollow through which a small thread passes; it is from 1 to 1 1/2 inches in length, white, smooth, hard and thin these are worn in the same manner in which the beeds are; and furnish the men with their favorite orniment for the nose, one of these shells is passed horizontally through [the] cartilage of the nose and serves frequently as a kind of ring which prevents the string which suspends other orniments at the same part from chafing and freting the flesh. The men sometimes wear collars of Bears Claws, and the women and children the tusks of the Elk variously arranged on their necks arms &amp;c. both male and female wear bracelets on their wrists of copper, Brass or Iron in various forms. The women sometimes wash their faces &amp; hands but seldom. I think the most disgusting sight I have ever beheld is those dirty naked wenches. The men of those nations partake of much more of the domestic drudgery than I had at first supposed, they collect and prepare all the fuel, make the fires, cook for the strangers who visit them, and assist in cleaning and prepareing the fish. they also build their houses, construct their canoes, and make all their wooden utensils. the peculiar province of the woman seams to be to collect roots and manufacture various articles which are prepared of rushes, flags, cedar bark, bear grass or way tape, also dress and manufacture the Hats &amp; robes for common use. the management of the canoe for various purposes seams to be a duty common to both sexes, as are many other occupations which with most Indian nations devolve exclusively on the womin. their feasts of which they are very fond are always prepared and served by the men. it continued to rain so constantly dureing the day that Sergt. Pryor could not Pay his canoes. The Clatsop chief Commo-wool and the two Cath-lah-mahs left us this evening and returned to their village. [Lewis:] Thursday March 20th. 1806. It continued to rain and blow so violently today that nothing could be done towards forwarding our departure. we intended to have Dispatched Drewyer and the two Fieldses to hunt near the bay on this side of the Cathlahmahs untill we jounded [joined] them from hence, but the rain rendered our departure so uncertain that we declined this measure for the present. nothing remarkable happened during the day. we have yet several days provision on hand, which we hope will be sufficient to subsist us during the time we are compelled by the weather to remain at this place. Altho' we have not fared sumptuously this winter and spring at Fort Clatsop, we have lived quite as comfortably as we had any reason to expect we should; and have accomplished every object which induced our remaining at this place except that of meeting with the traders who visit the entrance of this river. our salt will be very sufficient to last us to the Missouri where we have a stock in store. it would have been very fortunate for us had some of those traders arrived previous to our departure from hence, as we should then have had it in our power to obtain an addition to our stock of merchandize which would have made our homeward bound journey much more comfortable.1 1 For the trading vessel then upon the Northwest Coast, see note in vol. iii, pp. 327, 328, ante.—Ed. many of our men are still complaining of being unwell; Willard and Bratton remain weak, principally I beleive for the want of proper food. I expect when we get under way we shall be much more healthy. it has always had that effect on us heretofore. The guns of Drewyer and Sergt. Pryor were both out of order. the first was repared with a new lock, the old one having become unfit for uce; the second had the cock screw broken which was replaced by a duplicate which had been prepared for the lock at Harpers ferry where she was manufactured.2 2 See documents in Appendix, in our vol. vii, relative to the equipment of the expedition. —Ed. but for the precaution taken in bringing on those extra locks, and parts of locks, in addition to the ingenuity of John Shields, most of our guns would at this moment [have] been untirely unfit for use; but fortunately for us I have it in my power here to record that they are all in good order.3 3 This is the last journal entry in Codex J; the remaining pages (145–152) are occupied with a "weather diary" for January—March, 1806, which is transferred to " Meteorology," in our vol. vi. Lewis's journal continues with Codex K.—Ed. [Clark:] Thursday March 20th.. 1806 It continued to rain and blow so violently to day that nothing could be done towards fowarding our departure. we intended to have dispatched Drewyer &amp; the 2 Field'es to hunt above Point William untill we joined them from here but the rain renders our departure so uncertain that we decline this measure for the present. nothing remarkable happened dureing the day. we have yet several days provisions on hand, which we hope will be sufficient to serve us dureing the time we are compell'd by the weather to remain at this place. Altho' we have not fared sumptuously this winter &amp; spring at Fort Clatsop, we have lived quit[e] as comfortably as we had any reason to expect we should; and have accomplished every object which induced our remaining at this place except that of meeting with the traders who visit the enterance of this river. our Salt will be very sufficient to last us to the Missouri where we have a stock in store. it would have been very fortunate for us had some of those traders arrived previous to our departure from hence; as we should then have had it in our power to obtain an addition to our sock of Merchandize, which would have made our homeward bound journey much more comfortable. Maney of our men are still complaining of being unwell; Bratten and Willard remain weak principally I believe for the want of proper food. I expect when we get under way that we shall be much more healthy. it has always had that effect on us heretofore. The Guns of Sergt. Pryor &amp; Drewyer were both out of order. the first had a cock screw broken which was replaced by a duplicate which had been prepared for the Locks at Harpers Ferry; the second repared with a new Lock, the old one becoming unfit for use. but for the precaution taken in bringing on those extra locks, and parts of locks, in addition to the ingenuity of John Shields, most of our guns would at this moment [have] been entirely unfit for use; but fortunate for us I have it in my power here to record that they are in good order, and complete in every respect. [Lewis:] Friday March 21st. 1806. As we could not set out we thought it best to send out some hunters and accordingly dispatched Sheilds and Collins on this side the Netul for that purpose with orders to return in the evening or sooner if they were successfull.1 1 I made a calculation of the number of elk and deer killed by the party from the 1st of December 1805, to the 20th of March 1806, which gave 131 elk, and 20 deer. There were a few smaller quadrupeds killed, such as otter and beaver, and one racoon.—Gass (p. 274). The hunters returned late in the evening unsuccessfull. we have not now more than one day's provision on hand. we directed Drewyer and the Fieldses to set out tomorrow morning early, and indevour to provide us some provision on the bay beyond point William, we were visited to day by some Clatsop indians who left us in the evening. our sick men Willard and bratton do not seem to recover; the former was taken with a violent pain in his leg and thye last night. Bratton is now so much reduced that I am somewhat uneasy with rispect to his recovery; the pain of which he complains most seems to be seated in the small of his back and remains obstinate. I beleive that it is the rheumatism with which they are both afflicted. [Clark:] Friday March 21st. 1806 As we could not set out we thought it best to send out some hunters and accordingly dispatched Shields and Collins on this side of the Netul for that purpose with orders to return in the evening or sooner if they were successfull. they returned late in the evening unsuccessfull. we have not now more than two days provisions on hand. we derected Drewyer and the two Fieldses to set out tomorrow morning early, and indevour to provide us some provision on the Bay beyond point William. we were visited to day by some Clatsops who left us in the evening. our sick men Willard and Bratten do not seem to recover; the former was taken with a violent pain in his leg and thye last night. Bratten is now so much reduced that I am somewhat uneasy with respect to his recovery; the pain of which he complains most seems to be settled in the small of his back and remains obstinate. I believe that it is the rheumatism with which they are both affected. [Lewis:] Saturday March 22ed 1806. Drewyer and the Feildses departed this morning agreably to the order of the last evening. we sent out seven hunters this morning in different directions on this side the Netul. about 10 A.M. we were visited by 4 Clatsops and a killamucks; they brought some dried Anchoveis and a dog for sale which we purchased. the air is perefectly temperate, but it continues to rain in such a manner that there is no possibility of geting our canoes completed. at 12 OCk. we were visited by Comowooll and 3 of the Clatsops. to this Chief we left our houses and fu[r]niture. he has been much more kind an[d] hospitable to us than any other indian in this neighbourhood.1 1 They are still remembered by the older Indians. One of these Indians told a settler that the captains were real chiefs, and that the Americans who had come since were but tilikum, or common people. Ske-mah-kwe-up, the chief, and almost the last survivor of the Wah-kiakum Tsinuk, preserved with great pride the medal given him by Lewis and Clarke, until within a year or two [about 1858?] when it was accidentally lost, to his great grief.—George Gibbs (U. S. Geol. Survey, Contrib. N. Amer. Ethnol., i, p. 238). the Indians departed in the evening. the hunters all returned except Colter, unsuccessfull. we determined to set out tomorrow at all events, and to stop the canoes temperarily with Mud and halt the first fair day and pay them. the leafing of the hucklebury riminds us of spring. [Clark:] Saturday March 22nd. 1806 Drewyer and the two Fieldses departed this morning agreably to the order of last evening. we sent out six hunters this morning in different directions on both sides of the Netul. about 10 A.M. we were visited by Que-ne-o alias Commorwool 8 Clatsops and a Kil-a-mox; they brought some dried Anchovies, a common otter skin and a Dog for sale all of which we purchased. the Dog we purchased for our sick men, the fish for to add to our small stock of provision's, and the skin to cover my papers. those Indians left us in the evening, the air is perfectly temperate, but it continues to rain in such a manner that there is no possibility of getting our canoes completed in order to set out on our homeward journey. The Clatsops inform us that several of their nation has the sore throat, one of which has latterly died with this disorder. the Hunters sent out to day all returned except Colter uns[ucc]essfull. [Lewis:] Sunday March 23rd 1806. Half after 9 A.M. Colter arrived, having killed one Elk, but so distant that we could not send for the meat and get arround Point William today, we therefore prefered seting out and depending on Drewyer and the hunters we have sent forward for meat. the wind is pretty high but it seems to be the common opinion that we can pass point William. we accordingly distributed the baggage and directed the canoes to be launched and loaded for our departure. at 1 P.M. we bid a final adieu to Fort Clatsop. we had not proceeded more than a mile before we met Delashelwilt and a party of 20 Chinnooks men and women. this Cheif lea[r]ning that we were in want of a canoe some days past, had brought us one for sale, but being already supplyed, we did not purchase it. I obtained one Sea Otter skin from this party. at a 1/4 before three we had passed Meriwethers bay and commenced coasting the difficult shore; at 1/2 after five we doubled point William, and at 6. arrived in the mouth of a small creek1 1 John Day Creek.—Ed. where we found our hunters. they had killed 2 Elk, at the distance of a mile &amp; 1/2. it was too late to send after it this evening. we therefore encamped on the Stard. side of the Creek. the wind was not very hard. [Clark:] Sunday 23rd. March 1806 This morning proved so raney and uncertain that we were undetermined for some time whether we had best set out &amp; risque the [tide] which appeared to be riseing or not. Jo Colter returned haveing killed an Elk about 3 miles towards Point Adams, the rained seased and it became fair about Meridian, at which time we loaded our canoes &amp; at 1 P. M. left Fort Clatsop on our homeward bound journey, at this place we had wintered and remained from the 7th. of Decr. 1805 to this day and have lived as well as we had any right to expect, and we can say that we were never one day without 3 meals of some kind a day either pore Elk meat or roots, notwithstanding the repeated fall of rain which has fallen almost constantly since we passed the long narrows on the [blank space in MS.] of Novr. last indeed w[e] have had only [blank space in MS.] days fair weather since that time. Soon after we had set out from Fort Clatsop we were met by Delashelwilt &amp; 8 men of the Chinnook and Delashelwilts wife the old boud and his six Girls, they had, a canoe, a sea otter skin, dried fish and hats for sale, we purchased a sea otter skin, and proceeded on, thro' Meriwethers Bay, there was a stiff breese from the S.W. which raised considerable swells around Meriwethers point which was as much as our canoes could ride. above point William we came too at the camp of Drewyer &amp; the 2 Field's. they had killed 2 Elk which was about 1 1/2 miles distant. here we encampd. for the night having made 16 miles. [Lewis:] Monday March 24th. 1806. This morning we sent out a party of 15 at light, for the meat, and concluded to take breakfast before we set out. they soon returned. we breakfasted and Set out at 1/2 after 9 A.M. Saw a white woodpecker with a red head of the small kind common to the United States; this bird has but lately returned they do not remain during the winter. the country thick and heavily timbered. we saw very few waterfowl today, not a single swan, white brant nor a small goose is to be seen. a few Cormorant, duckinmallard, butterbox, and common large geese were only to be found. the tide being out this morning we found some difficulty in passing through the bay below the Cathlahmah village; this side of the river is very shallow to the distance of 4 miles from the shore tho' there is a channel sufficient for canoes near S. side. at 1 P.M. we arrived at the Cathlahmah village1 1 For the location of this village, see vol. iii, p. 252, ante.—Ed. where we halted and purchased some wappetoe, a dog for the sick, and a hat for one of the men. on one of the Seal Islands opposite to the village of these people they have scaffolded their dead in canoes elivating them above tidewater mark. these people are very fond of sculpture in wood of which they exhibit a variety of specemines about their houses. the broad peices supporting the center of the roof and those through which the doors are cut, seem to be the peices on which they most display their taist. I saw some of these which represented human figures setting and supporting the burthen on their sholders.1 1 These carved timbers are commonly known as "totem-posts," and are found among all the coast tribes.—Ed. at half after 3 P.M. we set out and continued our rout among the seal Islands; not paying much attention we mistook our rout which an Indian perceiving pursued overtook us and put us in the wright channel this Cathlahmah claimed the small canoe which we had taken from the Clatsops. however he consented very willingly to take an Elk's skin for it which I directed should be given him and he immediately returned. we continued our rout along the South side of the river and encamped at an old village of 9 houses opposite to the lower Wackkiacum village. the night was cold tho' wood was abundant after dark two Chinnook men came to us in a small canoe; they remained with us all night, came 15 miles to day. [Clark:] Monday 24th.. of March 1806 Sent out 15 men verry early this morning for the flesh of the two Elk killed by Drewyer and Fields yesterday, they returned at 8 oclock, after taking a slight brackfast we set out at half past 9 a.m. and proceeded to the Cathlahmah Village at 1 P. M. and remained untill 1/4 after 3 p. m. at this village we purchased a fiew wappato and a Dog for our sick men—Willard and Bratten who are yet in a weak state. at this village I saw two very large elegant canoes inlaid with shells. those shells I took to be teeth at first view, and the nativs informed several of the men that they [were] the teeth of their enemies which they had killed in war. in examining of them closely haveing taken out several pices, we found that [they] were sea shells which yet contained a part of the iner [blank space in MS.] they also deckerate their smaller wooden vessles with those shells which have much the appearance of human teeth. Capt Cook may have mistaken those shells verry well for human teeth without a close examination.2 2 Cook speaks of the decoration of native canoes at Nootka Sound with the teeth of seals, but not with those of men. Clark probably got his impression from the account Cook gives of the heads and hands of enemies being offered him for sale.—Ed. The village of these people is the dirtiest and stinkingest place I ever saw in any shape whatever, and the inhabitants partake of the carrestick [characteristic] of the village. we proceeded on through some difficult and narrow channel between the Seal Islands, and the South side to an old village on the South Side opposit to the lower Warkiacom village, and Encamped. to this old villg a very considerable deposit of the dead at a short distance below in the usial and customary way of the nativs of this coast in canoes raised from the ground as before described.1 1 See vol. iii, p, 139, ante.—Ed. Soon after we made our camp 2 Indians visited us from the opposit side, one of them spoke several words of English and repeated the names of the traders, and many of the salors. made 16 miles. [Lewis:] Tuesday March 25th 1806. The morning being disagreeably cold we remained and took breakfast. at 7 A.M. we set out and continued our rout along the South Coast of the river against the wind and a strong current, our progress was of course but slow. at noon we halted and dined. here some Clatsops came to us in a canoe loaded with dryed anchovies, which they call Ol-then′, Wappetoe and Sturgeon. they informed us that they had been up on a trading voyage to the Skillutes. I observe that the green bryer which I have previously mentioned as being common on this river below tide-water retains it's leaves all winter. the red willow and seven bark begin to put fourth their leaves. after dinner we passed the river to a large Island2 2 Puget's Island; see vol. iii, p. 206, note 2, ante,—Ed. and continued our rout allong the side of the same about a mile when we arrived at a Cathlahmah fishing cam[p] of one lodge; here we found 3 men 2 women and a couple of boys, who from appearances had remained here some time for the purpose of taking sturgeon, which they do by trolling. they had ten or douzen very fine sturgeon which had not been long taken. we offered to purchase some of their fish but they asked us such an extravegant price that we declined purchase. one of the men purchased a Sea Otter skin at this lodge, for which he gave a dressed Elkskin and an handkerchief. near this lodge we met some Cathlahmahs who had been up the river on a fishing excurtion. they had a good stock of fish on board, but did not seem disposed to sell them. we remained at this place about half an hour and then continued our rout up the Island to it's head and passed to the south side. the wind in the evening was very hard. it was with some difficulty that we could find a spot proper for an encampment, the shore being a swamp for several miles back; at length late in the evening opposite to the place we had encamped on the 6th. of November last; we found the entrance of a small creek which afforded us a safe harbour from the wind, and encamped.1 1 In Columbia County, Ore., probably at or near the entrance of Clatskanie Creek.—Ed. the ground was low and moist tho' we obtained a tolerable encampment. here we found another party of Cathlahmahs about 10 in number who had established a temperary residence for the purpose of fishing and taking seal. they had taken a fine parcel of sturgeon and some seal. they gave us some of the fleese [flesh] of the seal which I found a great improvement to the poor Elk. here we found Drewyer and the Feildses who had been seperated from us since morning; they had passed on the North side of the large Island which was much nearer. the bottom lands are covered with cottonwood, the growth with a broad leaf which resembles ash except the leaf. the underbrush red willow, broad leafed willow, sevenbark, goosburry, green bryer &amp; the large leafed thorn; the latter is now in bloom; the natives inform us that it bears a freut about an inch in diameter which is good to eat.2 2 The cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), the growth resembling the ash (Acer macrophyllum) are common in this neighborhood. The willows are not certainly identified; the seven bark is Physocarpus opulifolius; the gooseberry, Ribes divaricatum, Dougl.; the green briar, Ruhus macropetaus. There has been some difficulty in identifying the "large-leaved thorn," but this reference to the time of blossoming makes it practically certain that the plant is the "salmon-berry'" (Rubus spectabilis, Pursh.). Lewis brought back types of this.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Tuesday 25th of March 1806 Last night and this morning are cool wind hard a head and tide going out, after an early brackfast we proceeded on about 4 miles and came too on the South side to warm and dry our selves a little. soon after we had landed two Indians came from a Warkiacum village on the opposit side with 2 dogs and a fiew wappato to sell neither of which we bought. Som Clatsops passed down in a canoe loaded with fish and wappato. as the wind was hard a head and tide against us we concluded to delay untill the return of the tide which we expected at 1 oClock, at which hour we set out met two canoes of Clatsops loaded with dried anchovies and sturgion which they had taken and purchased above. we crossed over to an Island on which was a Cathlahmah fishing camp of one Lodge; here we found 3 man two woman and a couple of boys who must have [been here] for some time for the purpose of taking sturgeon which they do by trolling. they had 10 or 12 very fine sturgeon which had not been long taken; we wished to purchase some of their fish but they asked such extravegent prices that we declined purchaseing. one of our Party purchased a sea otter skin at this Lodge, for which he gave a dressed Elk skin &amp; a Handkerchief. we remained at this place about half an hour and then continued our rout. the winds in the evening was verry hard, it was with some dificuelty that we could find a Spot proper for an encampment, the shore being a swamp for several miles back; at length late in the evening opposit to the place we had encamped on the 6th.. of Novr. last; we found the enterance of a small creek which offered us a safe harbour from the winds and Encamped. the Ground was low and moist tho' we obtained a tolerable encampment. here we found another party of Cathlahmahs about 10 in number, who had established a temporary residence for the purpose of fishing and takeing seal. they had taken about 12 sturgeon and some seal. they gave us some of the flesh of the seal which I found a great improvement to the poor Elk. here we found Drewyer and the 2 Fields' who had been seperated from us since morning. they had passed on the North side of the large Island which was much nearest. the bottom lands are covered with a species of Asepin, the Growth with a broad leaf which resembles ash except the leaf. the under brush red willow, broad leafed willow, seven bark, Goose berry, Green bryor, and the larged leaf thorn; the latter is now in blume, the nativs inform us that it bears a fruit about an Inch in diamieter which is good to eate. the red willow and 7 bark begin to put forth their leaves. The green bryor which I have before mentioned retains leaves all winter. made 15 miles. [Lewis:] Wednesday March 26th. 1806. The wind blew so hard this morning that we delayed untill 8 A.M. we gave a medal of small size to a man by the name of Wal-lal'-le, a principal man among the Cathlahmahs, he appeared very thankfull for the honour conferred on him and presented us a large sturgeon. we continued our rout up the river to an old village on the Stard. side where we halted for dinner. we met on the way the principal Cheif of the Cathlahmahs, Sâh-hâh-wôh-cap, who had been up the river on a trading voyage. he gave us some Wappetoe and fish; we also purchased some of the latter. soon after we halted for dinner the two Wackiacums who have been pursuing us since yesterday morning with two dogs for sale, arrived. they wish tobacco in exchange for their dogs which we are not disposed to give as our stock is now reduced to a very few carrots. our men who have been accustomed to the use of this article (Tobaco) and to whom we are now obliged to deny the uce of this article appear to suffer much for the want of it. they substitute the bark of the wild crab which they chew; it is very bitter, and they assure me they find it a good substitute for tobacco. the smokers substitute the inner bark of the red willow and the sacacommis. here our hunters joined us having killed three Eagles and a large goose. I had now an oportunity of comparing the bald with the grey Eagle; I found that the greay Eagle was about 1/4 larger, it's legs and feet were dark while those of the bald Eagle wer[e] of a fine orrange yellow; the iris of the eye is also of a dark yellowish brown while that of the other is of a bright silvery colour with a slight admixture of yellow. after dinner we proceeded on and passed an Elegant and extensive bottom on the South side and an island near it's upper point which we call Fanny's Island and bottom. the greater part of the bottom is a high dry prarie. near the river towards the upper point we saw a fine grove of whiteoak trees; we saw some deer and Elk at a distance in the prarie, but did not delay for the purpose of hunting them. we continued our rout after dinner untill late in the evening and encamped on the next island above fanny's Island.1 1 This island was named for Clark's youngest sister, Frances; it is now known as Grim's Island, located a little below Green Point, Ore. The island on which the party encamped is Fisher's Island. The "fine grove of whiteoak trees "stood upon what was later known as Oak Point, and were the first oak met ascending the Columbia. It was on the south side nearly opposite the end of Fanny' s Island, and in 1810 was the site of the first attempt to establish a trading post on the Columbia, made by the Boston firm of Winship Brothers, who sent out the "Albatross" for this purpose. The settlement was soon abandoned because of Chinook hostility.—Ed. we found it difficult to obtain as much wood as answered our purposes. the hunters who had proceeded on before us after dinner did not join us this evening. Some indians visited us after dark, but did not remain long. agreeably to our estimate as we decended the river, we came 16 m. 23rd. 16 m. the 24th., 15. the 25th., and 18 m. the 26th., tho' I now think that our estimate in decending the river was too short. [Clark:] Wednesday March 26th 1806 The wind blew so hard untill 8 A. M. that we [were] detained, we gave a Medal to a man by the name of Wal-lal-le a principal man among the Cathlahmahs, he appeared very thankfull for the honor confured on him and presented us with a large sturgion. we continued our rout up the river to an old village on the south side where we halted for dinner. we met on the way the principal Chief of the Cathlahmahs, Sâh-hâh-wâh-cop, who had been up the river on a trading voyage, he gave us some wappato and fish, we also purchased some wappato soon after halted for dinner at an old village on the south point opposit the lower pt. of Fannys Island. The two Warkiacums who had been pursueing us since yesterday morning with two dogs for sale, arrived. they wish Tobacco in exchange for their dogs which we are not disposed to give, as our stock is now reduced to 3 carrots. our men who have been accustomed to the use of this article, and to whome we are now obliged to deny the use of this article appear to suffer much for the want of it. they substitute the bark of the wild crab which they chew; it is very bitter and they assure me they find it a good substitute for tobacco. the smokers substitute the iner bark of the redwillow and the saccommis. here our hunters joined us haveing killed 3 Eagles and a large wild goose. I had now an oppertunity of comparing the bald with the Grey Eagle; I found the grey Eagle about 1/4 largest, its legs and feet were dark which those of the bald eagle were of a fine orrange yellow; the iris of the eye is also of a dark yellowish brown, while that of the Grey is of a light silvery colour with a slight admixture of yellow. after dinner I walked on shore through an eligant bottom on the south side opposit to Fannys Island. This bottom we also call fannys bottom it is extensive and an open leavel plain except near the river bank which is high dry rich w[hite] oak land. I saw some deer &amp; Elk at a distance in the Prarie. we continued untill late in the evening and encamped on a small Island near the Middle of the river haveing made 18 miles. 2 Indians visited us this evening. [Lewis:] Thursday March 27th. 1806. We set out early this morning and were shortly after joined by some of the Skillutes who came along side in a small canoe for the purpose of trading roots and fish, at 10 A.M. we arrived at two houses of this nation on the Stard side where we halted for breakfast. here we overtook our hunters, they had killed nothing. the natives appeared extreemly hospitable, gave us dryed Anchovies, Sturgeon, wappetoe, quamash, and a speceis of small white tuberous roots about 2 inches in length and as thick as a man's finger; these are eaten raw, are crisp, milkey, and agreeably flavored, most of the party were served by the natives with as much as they could eat; they insisted on our remaining all day with them and hunting the Elk and deer which they informed us were very abundant in their neighbourhood. but as the weather would not permit us to dry our canoes in order to pitch them we declined their friendly invitation, and resumed our voyage at 12 OCk. the principal village of these Skillutes reside on the lower side of the Cowe-lis'-kee river a few miles from it's entrance into the Columbia. these people are said to be numerous. in their dress, habits, manners and language they differ but little from the Clatsops Chinnooks &amp;c. they have latterly been at war with Chinnooks but peace is said now to be restored between them, but their intercourse is not yet resumed. no Chinnooks come above the marshey islands nor do the Skillutes visit the mouth of the Columbia. The Clatsops, Cathlahmahs and Wackkiacums are the carriers between these nations being in alliance with both. The Coweliskee is 150 yards wide, is deep and from indian Information navigable a very considerable distance for canoes. it discharges itself into the Columbia about three miles above a remarkable high rocky nole1 1 Mount Coffin, a notable landmark in that region; both it and Coffin Rock (four or five miles above the mouth of Cowlitz River) are thus named from having long been places of sepulture for the Indians of that vicinity. See vol. iii, p. 206, ante.—Ed. which is situated on the N. side of the river by which it is washed on the South side and is seperated from the No[r]thern hills of the river by a wide bottom of several miles to which it is united. I suspect that this river waters the country lying West of the range of mountains which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids, and north of the same nearly to the low country which commences on the N.W. coast about Latitude [blank space in MS.] North. above the Skillutes on this river another nation by the name of the Hul-loo-et-tell reside who are said also to be numerous. at the distance of 2 m. above the village at which we breakfasted we passed the entrance of this river; we saw several fishing camps of the Skillutes on both sides of the Columbia, and were attended all the evening by parties of the natives in their canoes who visited us for the purpose of trading their fish and roots; we purchased as many as we wished on very moderate terms; they seemed perfectly satisfyed with the exchange and behaved themselves in a very orderly manner. late in the evening we passed our camp of the 5th. of November and encamped about 4 1/2 [miles] above at the commencement of the bottom land on stard. below Deer Island. we had scarcely landed before we were visited by a large canoe with eight men; from them we obtained a dryed fruit which resembled the raspburry and which I be[l]eive to be the fruit of the large leafed thorn frequently mentioned. it is reather ascid tho' pleasently flavored. I preserved a specemine of this fruit I fear that it has been baked in the process of drying and if so the seed will not vegitate. saw the Cottonwood, sweet willow,1 1 The "sweet-willow" is mentioned again April 5 and 30. A consideration of all these references points to Salix lasiandra, Benth., as the plant.—C. V. Piper. oak, ash and the broad leafed ash, the growth which resembles the beach &amp;c. these form the growth of the bottom lands while the hills are covered almost exclusively with the various speceis of fir heretofore discribed. the black Alder appears as well on some parts of the hills as the bottoms. before we set out from the Skillute village we sent on Gibson's canoe and Drewyer's with orders to proceed as fast as they could to Deer island and there to hunt and wait our arrival. we wish to halt at that place to repair our canoes if possible. the indians who visited us this evening remained but a short time, they passed the river to the oposite side and encamped. the night as well as the day proved cold wet and excessively disagreeable, we came 20 miles today. [Clark:] Thursday March 27th. 1806 A rainey disagreeable night rained the greater part of the night. we set out this morning verry early and proceeded on to two houses of the Skil-lute Indians on the South Side here we found our hunters who had Seperated from us last evening. the wind rose and the rain became very hard soon after we landed here we were very friendly receved by the natives who gave all our party as much fish as they could eate, they also gave us wappato and pashaquaw roots to eate prepared in their own way. also a species of small white tuberous roots about 2 inches in length and as thick as a mans finger, these are eaten raw, or crips [crisp], milkey and agreeably flavoured; the nativs insisted on our remaining all day with them and hunt the Elk and deer which they informed us was very abundant in this neighbourhood; but as the weather would not permit our drying our canoes in order to pitch them, we declined their friendly invertation, and resumed our voyage at 12 oClock. The principal village of the Skil-lutes is situated on the lower side of the Cow-e-lis-kee river a fiew miles from it's enterance into the Columbia. those people are said to be noumerous, in their dress, habits, manners and Language they differ but little from the Clatsops, Chinnooks &amp;c. they have latterly been at war with the Chinnooks, but peace is said to be now restored between them, but their intercourse is not yet restored. no Chinnook come above the Warkiacums, nor do the Skillutes visit the mouth of the Columbia. The Clatsops, Cathlahmahs &amp; Warkiacoms are the carriers between those nations being in alliance with both. The Coweliskee river is 150 yards wide, is deep and from Indian information navigable a very considerable distance for canoes. it discharges itself into the Columbia about 3 miles above a remarkable knob which is high and rocky and situated on the North side of the Columbia, and seperated from the Northern hills of the river by a wide bottom of several miles, to which it [is] united. I suspect that this river waters the country lying west of a range of Mountains which passes the Columbia between the Great falls and rapids, and North of the same nearly to the low country which commences on the N W. Coast about Latitude 4° 'North.1 1 Clark left this space with degrees and minutes and the figure 4 to be filled in by some latitude between 40° and 50°.—Ed. above the Skillutes on this river another nation by the name of the Hul-loo-et-tell reside who are said also to be numerous. at the distance of 2 miles above the village at which we brackfast we passed the enterance of this river; we saw several fishing camps of the Skillutes on both sides of the Columbia, and also on both sides of this river. we were attended all the evening by parties of the nativs in their canoes who visited us for the purpose of tradeing their fish and roots; we purchased as maney as we wished on very moderate terms; they seamed perfectly satisfied with the exchange and behaved themselves in a very orderly manner. late in the evening we passed the place we camped the 5th. of Novr. and Encamped about 4 miles above at the commencement of the Columbian Vally on the Stard. Side below Deer Island. we had scercely landed before we were visited by a large canoe with 8 men; from them we obtained a dried fruit which resembled the raspberry and which I believe is the fruit of the large leafed thorn frequently mentioned. it is reather ascide tho' pleasantly flavored. Saw Cottonwood, sweet willow, w[hite] oake, ash and the broad leafed ash the Growth which resembles the bark &amp;c. these form the groth of the bottom lands, whilst the Hills are almost exclusively covered with the various species of fir heretofore discribed. the black alder appears on maney parts of the hills sides as on the bottoms. before we set out from the 2 houses where we brackfast we sent on two canoes with the best hunters, with orders to proceed as fast as they could to Deer island and there to hunt and wait our arrival. we wish to halt at that place and repare 2 of our canoes if possible. the Indians that visited us this evening remained but a short time, they passed over to an Island and encamped. the night as well as the day proved cold wet and excessively disagreeable. we came 20 miles in the course of this day. [Lewis:] Friday March 28th. 1806 This morning we set out very early and at 9 A.M. arrived at the old Indian village on Lard. side of Deer Island where we found our hunters had halted and left one man with the two canoes at their camp; they had arrived last evening at this place and six of them turned out to hunt very early this morning; by 10 A.M. they all returned to camp having killed seven deer. these were all of the common fallow deer with the long tail. I measured the tail of one of these bucks which was upwards of 17 Inches long; they are very poor, tho' they are better than the black tailed fallow deer of the coast. these are two very distinct speceis of deer.1 1 Long-tailed fallow deer (Cariacus virginianus macrurus); black-tailed deer (C. columbianus).—Ed. the Indians call this large Island E-lal-lar or deer island which is a very appropriate name. the hunters informed us that they had seen upwards of a hundred deer this morning on this island. the interior part of the island is praries and ponds, with a heavy growth of Cottonwood ash and willow near the river. we have seen more waterfowl on this island than we have previously seen since we left Fort Clatsop, consisting of geese, ducks, large swan, and Sandhill crains. I saw a few of the Canvis-back duck. the duckinmallard are the most abundant. one of the hunters killed a duck which appeared to be the male, it was a size less than the duckinmallard.2 2 Coues thinks this was the ring-necked scaup duck (Fuligula collaris), of which Lewis and Clark were the discoverers.—Ed. the head neck as low as the croop, the back tail and covert of the wings were of a fine black with a small addmixture of perple about the head and neck, the belley &amp; breast were white; some long feathers which lie underneath the wings and cover the thye were of a pale dove colour with fine black specks; the large feathers of the wings are of a dove colour. the legs are dark, the feet are composed of 4 toes each of which there are three in front connected by a web, the 4th. is short flat and placed high on the heel behind the leg. the tail is composed of 14 short pointed feathers. the beak of this duck is remarkably wide, and is 2 inches in length, the upper chap exceeds the under one in both length and width, insomuch that when the beak is closed the under is entirely concealed by the upper chap. the tongue, indenture of the margin of the chaps &amp;c. are like those of the mallard. the nostrils are large longitudinal and connected. a narrow strip of white garnishes the upper part or base of the upper chap—this is succeeded by a pale skye blue colour which occupys about one inch of the chap, is again succeeded by a transverse stripe of white and the extremity is of a pure black. the eye is moderately large the puple black and iris of a fine orrange yellow. the feathers on the crown of the head are longer than those on the upper part of neck and other parts of the head; these feathers give it the appearance of being crested. at 1/2 after ten A.M. it became fair, and we had the canoes which wanted repairing halled out and with the assistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them sufficiently to receive the pitch which was immediately put on them; at 3 in the evening we had them compleat and again launched and reloaded. we should have set out, but as some of the party whom we had permitted to hunt since we arrived have not yet returned we determined to remain this evening and dry our beding baggage &amp;c. the weather being fair. Since we landed here we were visited by a large canoe with ten natives of the quathlahpahtle nation who are numerous and reside about seventeen miles above us on the Lard. Side of the Columbia, at the entrance of a small river.1 1 See vol. iii, p. 201, ante.—Ed. they do not differ much in their dress from those lower down and speak nearly the same language, it is in fact the same with a small difference of accent. we saw a great number of snakes on this island; they were about the size and much the form of the common garter snake of the Atlantic coast and like that snake are not poisonous. they have 160 scuta on the abdomen and 71 on the tall. the abdomen near the head, and jaws as high as the eyes, are of a bluish white, which as it receedes from the head becomes of a dark brown. the field of the back and sides is black. a narrow stripe of a light yellow runs along the center of the back, on each side of this stripe there is a range of small transverse oblong spots of a pale brick red which gradually diminish as they receede from the head and disappear at the commencement of the tail. the puple of the eye is black, with a narrow ring of white bordering it's edge; the ballance of the iris is of a dark yellowish brown. the men who had been sent after the deer returned and brought in the remnent which the Vultures and Eagles had left us; these birds had devoured 4 deer in the course of a few hours. the party killed and brought in three other deer a goose some ducks and an Eagle. Drewyer also killed a tiger cat. Joseph Fields informed me that the Vultures had draged a large buck which he had killed about 30 yards, had skined it and broken the back bone. we came five miles only today. [Clark:] Friday March 28th. 1806 This morning we set out verry early and at 9 A. M. arived at an old Indian Village on the NE side of Deer Island where we found our hunters had halted and left one man with the canoes at their camp, they arrived last evening at this place, and six of them turned out very early to hunt, at 10 A. M. they all returned to camp haveing killed seven Deer, those were all of the common fallow Deer with a long tail. I measured the tail of one of these bucks which was upwards of 17 inches long; they are very poor, tho' they are better than the black tail Species of the sea coast. those are two very distinct species of Deer. the Indians call this large Island E-lal-lar, or Deer Island, which is a very appropriate name. the hunters informed us that they had seen upwards of a hundred Deer this morning on this island, the interior of this Island is a prarie and ponds, with a heavy growth of cottonwood, ash &amp; willow near the river. we have seen more waterfowl on this island than we have previously seen since we left Fort Clatsop, consisting of Geese, Ducks, large Swan &amp; Sand Hill crains. I saw a fiew of the canvis back Duck as I believe. at 1/2 after 10 A. M. it became fair and we had the canoes which wanted repareing hauled out and with the assistance of fires which we had kindled for the purpose dryed them sufficiently to receive the pitch which was immediately put on them; at 3 in the evening we had them compleated and lanced and reloaded. we should have set out but some of the party whom we had permited to hunt since we arrived heve not yet returned. we determined to remain here this evening and dry our bedding &amp;c. the weather being fair. Since we landed here we were visited by a large canoe with ten nativs of the Quathlahpohtle nation who are numerous and reside about fourteen miles above us on the N. E. side of the Columbia above the Enterance of a small river which the Indians call Châh wâh-na-hi-ooks. we saw a great number of snakes on this island; they were about the size and much the form of the garter snake of the U. S. the back and sides are black with a narrow stripe of light yellow along the center of the back with small red spots on each side they have [blank space in MS.] scuta on the abdomen &amp; [blank space in MS.] on the tail and are not poisonous. The men who had been sent after the deer returned with four only, the other 4 haveing been eaten entirely by the Voulture except the skin. The men we [who] had been permitted to hunt this evening killed 3 deer 4 Eagles &amp; a Duck, the deer are remarkably pore. Some rain in the after part of the day. we only made 5 miles to day. [Lewis:] Saturday March 29th. 1806. We set out early this morning and proceeded along the side of Deer Island; halted at 10 A.M. near its upper point and breakfasted. here we were joined by three men of the Clan-nah-min-na-mun1 1 In the Biddle text, this is "the Towahnahiook nation."—Ed. nation, the upper point of this island may be esteemed the lower side or commencement of the Columbian valley. after breakfast we proceeded on and at the distance of 14 miles from our encampment of the last evening we passed a large inlet 300 yds. in width. this inlet or arm of the river extends itself to the South 10 or 12 M. to the hills on that side of the river and receives the waters of a small creek which heads with Killamucks river,2 2 Warrior's Slough and Scappoose Creek respectively.—Ed. and that of a bayau which passes out of the Columbia about 20 miles above, the large Island thus formed we call wappetoe island. on this inlet and Island the following nations reside, (viz) Clân-nah-min-na-mun, Clacks-star, Cath-lah-cum-up, Clâh-m-na-ta, Cath-lah-nah-qui-ah, and Cath-lah-cam-mah-tup.3 3 These tribes are probably all of Chinook origin, except the Clackstar, whom Coues identifies with a vagrant Athapascan nation, the Tlatscanai.—Ed. the two first reside on the inlet and the others on the bayau and island. observed a speceies of small wild onion growing among the moss on the rocks, they resemble the shives of our gardens and grow remarkably close together forming a perfect turf; they are as quite agreeably flavoured as the shives. on the North side of the columbia a little above the entrance of this inlet a considerable river discharges itself. this stream the natives call the Cah-wâh-na-hi-ooks.1 1 Now called Lewis's River, although it appears on many maps as Cathlapotle; it has two large branches, and drains the eastern border of Skamania Co., Wash.—Ed. it is 150 yards wide and at present discharges a large body of water, tho' from the information of the same people it is not navigable but a short distance in consequence of falls and rappids. a tribe called the Hul-lu-et-tell reside on this river above it's entr. at the distance of three miles above the entrance of the inlet on the N. side behind the lower point of an island we arrived at the village of the Cath (Quath)-lah-poh-tle w[h]ich consists of 14 large wooden houses. here we arrived at 3 P.M. the language of these people as well as those on the inlet and Wappetoe Island differs in some measure from the nations on the lower part of the river. tho' many of their words are the same, and a great many others with the difference only of accent. the form of their houses and dress of the men, manner of living habits customs &amp;c. as far as we could discover are the same. their women wear their ornaments robes and hair as those do below tho' (Indian women on Wappato Island &amp; in that Valey) here their hair is more frequently braded in two tresses and hang over each ear in front of the body. in stead of the tissue of bark woarn by the women below, they wear a kind of leather breech clout about the width of a common pocket handkerchief and reather longer. the two corners of this at one of the narrow ends are confined in front just above the hips; the other end is then brought between the legs, compressed into a narrow foalding bundel is drawn tight and the corners a little spread in front and tucked at the groin over and arround the part first confined about the waist. the small robe which dose not reach the waist is their usual and only garment commonly woarn beside that just mentioned. when the weather is a litt[l]e warm this robe is thrown aside and the leather truss or breech-clout constitutes the whole of their apparel. this is a much more indecent article than the tissue bark, and bearly covers the mons ven[er]is, to which it is drawn so close that the whole shape is plainly perceived. the floors of most of their houses are on a level with the surface of the earth tho' some of them are sunk two or 3 feet beneath. the internal arrangement of their houses is the same with those of the nations below. they are also fond of sculpture. various figures are carved and painted on the peices which support the center of the roof, about their doors and beads. they had large quantities of dryed Anchovies strung on small sticks by the gills and others which had been first dryed in this manner, were now arranged in large sheets with strings of bark and hung suspended by poles in the roofs of their houses; they had also an abundance of sturgeon and wappetoe; the latter they take in great quantities from the neighbouring ponds, which are numerous and extensive in the river bottoms and islands. the wappetoe furnishes the principal article of traffic with these people which they dispose of to the nations below in exchange for beads cloth and various articles. the natives of the sea coast and lower part of the river will dispose of their most valuable articles to obtain this root. they have a number of large symeters of Iron from 3 to 4 feet long1 1 Gibbs relates (Contrib. N. Amer. Ethnol., i, pp. 236, 237) the captivity among the Clatsops of two seamen from a wrecked vessel. "They remained as slaves to the Klatsop until it was found that one was a worker in iron, of which the Indian began to see the value, when they made him a chief." These men both remained among the Indians, marrying native women; one of them had a son named Soto, which may indicate that he was a Spaniard. Eva E. Dye says that a Spaniard was once a captive among some of the coast Indians, who called him Ko-na-pee.—Ed. which hang by the heads of their beads [beds]; the blade of this weapon is thickest in the center tho' thin even there. all it's edges are sharp and it's greatest width which is about 9 inches from the point is about 4 inches. the form is thus. this is a formidable weapon. they have heavy bludgeons of wood made in the same form nearly which I presume they used for the same purpose before they obtained metal. we purchased a considerable quantity of wappetoes 12 dogs, and 2 Sea otter skins of these people. they were very hospitable and gave us anchovies and wappetoe to eat. notwithstanding their hospitality if it deserves that appellation, they are great begers, for we had scarcely finished our repast on the wappetoe and Anchovies which they voluntarily set before us before they began to beg. we gave them some small articles as is our custom on those occasions with which they seemed perfectly satisfyed. we gave the 1st Cheif a small medal, which he soon transfered to his wife. after remaining at this place 2 hours we set out and continued our rout between this [Bachelor's] island, which we now call Cath-lah-poh-tle after the nation, and the Lard. shore. at the distance of 2 miles we encamped in a small prarie on the main shore, having traveled 19 miles by estimate. the river rising fast. great numbers of both the large and small swans, gees and ducks seen to day. the former are very abundant in the ponds where the wappetoe is found, they feed much on this bulb. the female of the duck which was described yesterday is of a uniform dark brown with some yellowish brown intermixed in small specks on the back neck and breast. the garter snakes are innumerable &amp; are seen entwined arround each other in large bundles of forty or fifty lying about in different directions through the praries. the frogs are croaking in the swam[p]s and mar[s]hes; their notes do not differ from those of the Atlantic States; they are not found in the salt marshes near the entrance of the river. heared a large hooting owl hollowing this evening. saw several of the crested fishers and some of the large and small black-birds. [Clark:] Saturday March 29th. 1806 we set out very early this morning and proceeded to the head of deer island and took brackfast. the morning was very cold wind sharp and keen off the range of mountains to the East covered with snow. the river is now riseing very fast and retards our progress very much as we are compelled to keep out at some distance in the curent to clear the bushes, and fallen trees and drift logs makeing out from the shore. dureing the time we were at Brackfast a canoe with three Indians of the Clan-nar-min-na-mon Nation came down, one of those men was dressed in a Salors Jacket &amp; hat &amp; the other two had a blanket each, those people differ but little either in their dress manners &amp; Language from the Clatsops &amp; Chinnooks. they reside on Wappato Inlet which is on the S W. side about 12 miles above our encampment of the last night and is about 2 miles from the lower point, four other tribes also reside on the inlet and sluce which passes on the South W. side of the Island, the first tribe from the lower point is the Clannarminamon, on the Island, the Clackster Nation on the main S.W. shore the next Cath-lah-cum-up, Clâh-in-na-ta, Cath-lah-nah-qui-ah and at some distance further up is a tribe called Cath-lah-com-mah-up Those tribes all occupie single villages. we proceeded on to the lower point of the said island accompanied by the 3 Indians, &amp; were met by 2 canoes of nativs of the quath-lah-poh-tal who informed us that the chanel to the NE of the Island was the proper one. we prosued their advice and crossed into the mouth of the Chah-wah-na-hi-ooks River which is about 200 yards wide and a great portion of water into the Columbia at this time it being high. The indians inform us that this river is crowded with rapids after some distance up it. Several tribes of the Hul-lu-et-tell Nation reside on this river. at 3 oClock P.M. we arived at the Quathlahpahtle village of 14 Houses on main Shore to the N.E. side of a large island. those people in their habits manners customs and language differ but little from those of the Clatsops and others below. here we exchanged our deer skins killed yesterday for dogs and purchased others to the number of 12 for provisions for the party, as the deer flesh is too poore for the men to subsist on and work as hard as is necessary. I also purchased a sea otter robe. we purchased wappatoe and some pashaquar roots. gave a Medal of the small size to the principal chief, and at 5 oClock reembarked and proceeded up on the N E of an Island to an inlet about 1 mile above the village and encamped on a butifull grassy plac[e], where the nativs make a portage of their canoes, and wappato roots to and from a large pond at a short distance. in this pond the nativs inform us they collect great quantities of p [w] appato, which the women collect by getting into the water, sometimes to their necks holding by a small canoe and with their feet loosen the wappato or bulb of the root from the bottom from the Fibers, and it imedeately rises to the top of the water, they collect &amp; throw them into the canoe, those deep roots are the largest and best roots. Great numbers of the whistling swan, Gees and Ducks in the Ponds. Soon after we landed 3 of the nativs came up with wappato to sell a part of which we purchased. they continued but a short time. our men are recovering fast. Willard quit[e] well &amp; Bratten much stronger. we made 15 miles to day only. [Lewis:] Sunday March 30th. 1806. We got under way very early in the morning, and had not reached the head of the island before we were met by three men of the Clan-nah-min-na-mun nation one of whom we recognized being the same who had accompanied us yesterday, and who was very pressing in his entreaties that we should visit his nation on the inlet S. W. of Wappetoe island, at the distance of about 2 M. or at the head of the quathlahpahtle island we met a party of the Claxtars1 1 The Tlatscanai (or Klatscanai), an Athapascan tribe; when Gibbs visited them (about 1855), they were nearly extinct. According to their traditions, they had formerly lived on the Chehalis (Tsihalis) River, in Southwest Washington (Contrib. N. Amer. Ethnol., i, p. 171).—Ed. and Cathlahcumups in two canoes; soon after we were met by several canoes of the different nations who reside on each side of the river near this place. Wappetoe [Sauvie] Island is about 20 miles long and from 5 to 10 in width; the land is high and extreemly fertile and intersected in many parts with ponds which produce great quantities of the sagittaria Sagittifolia, the bulb of which the natives call wappetoe. there is a heavy growth of Cottonwood, ash, the large leafed ash and sweet willow on most parts of this island. the black alder common on the coast has now disappeared. we passed several fishing camps on wappetoe island, and at the distance of 5 miles above quathlahpotle Island on the N.E. side we halted for breakfast near the place we had encamped on the evening of the 4th. of November last; here we were visited by several canoes which came off from two towns situated a little distance above us on wappetoe Island. the 1st of these tribes about a miles above us call themselves Clan-nah-quah, the other about a mile above them call themselves Mult-no-mah.1 1 These are both tribes of Chinnooks, from the latter of which the Willamette was for some time named.—Ed. from these visiters we purchased a sturgeon and some wappetoe and pashequa for which we gave some small fishinghooks. these like the natives below are great higglers in dealing. at 10 A.M. we set out and had not proceeded far before we came to a landing place of the natives where there were several large canoes drawn out on shore and several natives seting in a canoe apparently waiting our arrival; they joined the fleet and continued with us some miles. we halted a few minutes at this landing and the Indians pointed to a village which was situated ab[o]ut 2 miles from the river behi[n]d a pond lying parallel with it on the N.E. side nearly opposite to the Clan-nah-quah town. here they informed us that the Sho-toes resided. here we were joined by several other canoes of natives from the Island. most of these people accompanyed us untill 4 in the evening when they all returned; their principal object I b[el]eive was merely to indulge their curiossity in looking at us. they appeared very friendly, tho' most had taken the precaution to bring with them their warlike implements. we continued our rout along the N.E. shore of the river to the place we had halted to dine on the 4th. of Novembr. opposite to the center of Immage canoe island where the Indians stole Capt. Clarks tomahawk. here we encamped a little before sunset in a beautifull prarie above a large pond2 2 At or near present site of the historic Fort Vancouver, and present location of Vancouver, Wash. The "large pond" is now called Lake Vancouver, which flows into Lake or Calapooya River.—Coues (L. and C., iii, p. 917). having traveled 23 m. I took a walk of a few miles through the prarie and an open grove of oak timber which borders the prarie on the back part. I saw 4 deer in the course of my walk and much appearance of both Elk and deer. Joseph feields who was also out a little above me saw several Elk and deer but killed none of them; they are very shye and the annual furn which is now dry and abundant in the bottoms makes so much nois in passing through it that it is extreemly difficult to get within reach of the game. Feilds killed and brought with him a duck. about 10 P.M. an indian alone in a small canoe arrived at our camp, he had some conversation with the centinel and soon departed. The natives who inhabit this valley are larger and reather better made than those of the coast. like those people they are fond of cold, hot, &amp; vapor baths of which they make frequent uce both in sickness and in health and at all seasons of the year. they have also a very singular custom among them of baithing themselves allover with urine every morning. The timber and appearance of the country is much as before discribed. the up lands are covered almost entirely with a heavy growth of fir of several speceis like those discribed in the neighbourhood of Fort Clatsop; the white cedar is also found here of large size; no white pine nor pine of any other kind. we had a view of mount St. helines and Mount Hood. the 1st. is the most noble looking object of it's kind in nature. it's figure is a regular cone. both these mountains are perfectly covered with snow; at least the parts of them which are visible. the highlands in this valley are rolling tho' by no means too steep for cultivation they are generally fertile of a dark rich loam and tolerably free of stone. this valley is terminated on it's lower side by the mountanous country which borders the coast, and above by the rainge of mountains which pass the Columbia between the great falls and rapids of the Columbia river. it is about 70 miles wide on a direct line and it's length I beleive to be very extensive tho' how far I cannot determine. this valley would be co[m]petent to the mantainence of 40 or 50 thousand souls if properly cultivated and is indeed the only desirable situation for a settlement which I have seen on the West side of the Rocky mountains. [Clark:] Sunday March 30th. 1806 We got under way verry early and had not proceeded to the head of the island before we met with the three men of the Clan-nar-min-a-mon's who met us yesterday brackfast at the upper point of the Island we met several of the Clackstar and Cath-lah-cum-up in two canoes. soon after we were overtaken by several canoes of different tribes who reside on each side of the river the three above Tribes and the Clâh-in-na-ta Cath-lah-nah-qui-up &amp; Cath-lah-com-mah-cup reside on each side of Wappato inlet and back of Wappato Island which Island is formed by a small chanel which passes from the Lower part of Image canoe Island into an inlet which makes in from the S W. side, and receves the water of a Creek which heads with the Kilamox River. this wappato Island is about 18 or 20 miles long and in places from 6 to 10 miles wide high &amp; furtile with ponds on different parts of it in which the nativs geather wappato. nearly opposit the upper point of the Isld. behind which we encamped last night, or on the Wappato Isld. is several camps of the nativs catching sturgion. about 5 miles still higher up and on the N E. side we halted for brackfast at the place which we had encamped the 4th of November last. here we were visited by several canoes of Indians from two Towns a short distance above on the Wappato Island, the 1st of those tribes call themselves Clan-nah-quah and situated about 2 miles above us, the other about a mile above call themselves Mult-no-mah we purchased of those visitors a Sturgion and some wappato &amp; quarmarsh roots for which we gave small fishing hooks. at 10 A. M. we set out and had not proceeded far before we came to a landing place where there was several large canoes hauled up, and sitting in a canoe appearantly waiting our arival with a view to join the fleet [an] indian who was then alongside of us. this man informed he was a Shoto and that his nation resided a little distance from the river. we landed and one of the indians pointed to the Shoto village which is situated back of [a] Pond which lies parallel with the river on the NE. side nearly opposit the Clannahquah village. here we were also joined by several canoes loaded with the natives from the Island who continued to accompany us untill about 4 oClock when they all returned and we proceeded on to the place the Indians stole my Tomahawk 4th. Nov. last and Encamped in a small Prarie above a large Pond on N.E and opposit the center of image canoe Island. Capt. Lewis walked out and saw several deer. Jo. Field shot at Elk he killed and brought in a fine duck. Soon after I had got into bead an Indian came up alone in a small canoe. Those tribes of Indians who inhabit this vally differ but little in either their dress, manners, habuts and language from the Clatsops Chinnooks, and others on the Sea coast. they differ in a fiew words and a little in the accent. The men are stouter and much better formed than those of the sea coast, more of their women ware their hair braded in two tresses and hang over each ear. instead of the tissue of bark worn by the women below, they ware a kind of leather breech clout as before described as worn by the womin at the enterance of Lewis's river. the width of a common pocket Handkerchief or something smaller and longer. the two corners of this at one of the narrow ends are confined in front just above the hips; the other side is then brought between their legs, compressed into a narrow folding bundle is drawn tight, and the corners a little spred in front tucked at the ends over and around the part first confined about the waist. a small roab which does not reach the waist is their usial and only garment commonly worn besides this just mentioned. when the weather is a little worm the roab is thrown aside, and the latter truss or breachclout constitutes the whole of their apparreal. this is a much more indesant article than the tissue of bark, and bearly covers the mons venus, to which it is drawn so close that the whole Shape is plainly perseived. The Houses are similar to those already described. they are fond of sculpture. various figures are carved and painted on the pieces which support the center of the roof about their dores and beads. They are well supplied with anchoves sturgion and Wappato. the latter furnishes the principal article of traffic with those Tribes which they despose of to the nativs below in exchange for beeds, cloath and various articles. the nativs of the sea coast and lower part of this river will dispose of their most valueable articles to obtain this root. I saw in several houses of the Cathlahpohtle village large symeters of Iron from 3 to 4 feet long which hang by the heads of their beads; the blade of this weapon is thickest in the center tho' thin even there, all it's edges are sharp and its greatest width which is about 9 inches from the point, is about 4 inches. the form is this this is a form[id]able weapon. they have heavy bludgeons of wood made in the same form nearly which I prosume they use for the same purpose before they obtained metal. we made 22 miles only to day the wind and a strong current being against us all day with rain. discovered a high mountain S.E. covered with snow which we call Mt. Jefferson. [Lewis:] Monday March 31st. 1806. We set out early this morning and proceeded until 8 A.M. when we Landed on the N. side opposite one large wooden house of the Shâh-ha-la nation1 1 Under this collective name the explorers include four small tribes of Upper Chinooks. See "Estimate of Western Indians," in our vol. vi.—Ed. and took breakfast, when we decended the river in November last there were 24 other lodges formed of Straw and covered with bark near this house; these lodges are now distroyed and the inhabitants as the Indians inform us have returned to the great rapids of this river which is their permanent residence; the house which remains is inhabited; soon after we landed two canoes came over from this house with 4 men and a woman. they informed us that their relations who were with them last fall usuly visit them at that season for the purpose of hunting deer and Elk and collecting wappetoe and that they had lately returned to the rapids I presume to prepare for the fishing season as the Salmon will begin to run shortly. this morning we overtook the man who had visited our camp last night he had a fine sturgeon in his canoe which he had just taken. the Sagittaria Sagittifolia dose not grow on this river above the Columbian valley. These indians of the rapids frequently visit this valley at every season of the year for the purpose of collecting wappetoe which is abundant and appears never to be out of season at any time of the year. at 10 A.M. we resumed our march accompanyed by three men in a canoe; one of these fellows appeared to be a man of some note among them; he was dressed in a salor's jacket which was decorated in his own fashion with five rows of large and small buttons in front and some large buttons on the pocket flaps. they are remarkably fond of large brass buttons. these people speak a different language from those below tho' in their dress habits manners &amp;c. they differ but little from the quathlahpohtles. their women wear the truss as those do of all the nations residing from the quathlahpohtles to the entrance of Lewis's river. they differ in the manner of intering their dead. they lay them horizontally on boards and cover them with mats, in a valt formed with boards like the roof of a ho[u]se supported by forks and a single pole laid horizontally on those forks. many bodies are deposited in the same valt above ground. these are frequently laid one on the other, to the hight of three or fo[u]r corps. they deposit with them various articles of which they die possessed, and most esteem while living. their canoes are frequently broken up to strengthen the vault. these people have a few words the same with those below but the air of the language is intirely different, insomuch, that it may be justly deemed a different language. their women wear longer and larger robes generally, than those below; these are most commonly made of deer skins dressed with the hair on them. we continued our rout along the N. side of the river passed diamond Island and whitebrant island to the lower point of a handsom prarie opposite to the upper entrance of the Quicksand river; here we encamped1 1 For Seal and Quicksand rivers, and Diamond Island, see vol. iii, pp. 190–192, ante.—Ed. having traveled 25 miles to day. a little below the upper point of the Whitebrant Island Seal river discharges itself on the N. side.1 it is about 80 yards wide, and at present discharges a large body of water. the water is very clear. the banks are low and near the Columbia overflow and form several large ponds. the natives inform us that it is of no great extent and heads in the mountains just above us. at the distance of one mile from the entrance of this stream it forks, the two branches being nearly of the same size. they are both obstructed with falls and innumerable rappids, insomuch that it cannot be navigated. as we could not learn any name of the natives for this stream we called it Seal river from the great abundance of those animals which we saw about it's entrance. we determined to remain at our present encampment a day or two for the several purposes of examining quicksand river [which Capt. Clark could not believe to be the river watering the Country to the Sth. and for the purpose of] making some Celestial observations, and procuring some meat to serve us as far as the falls or through the Western mountains where we found the game scarce as we decended. the three indians who accompanyed us last evening encamped a little distance above us and visited our camp where they remained untill 9 P.M. in the entrance of Seal river I saw a summer duck or wood duck as they are sometimes called. this is the same with those of our country and is the first I have seen since I entered the rocky mountains last summer. our hunters who had halted a little below Seal river in consequence of the waves being too high for their small canoe did not join us untill after dark. Drewyer who was out below Seal river informed us that game was very scarce in that quarter, a circumstance which we did not expect. [Clark:] Monday March 31st 1806 We set out this morning and proceeded untill 8 oClock when we landed on the N. side opposit one large House of the Shah-ha-la Nation near this house at the time we passed on the 4th. of November last was situated 25 houses, 24 of these were built of straw &amp; covered with bark as before mentioned. those [of] that description are all distroyed, the one built of wood only remains and is inhabited. we overtook the man whome came to our Camp last night and soon after we landed two canoes come over from the opposit side with 5 men and a woman those people informed us that their relations who was with them last fall reside at the Great rapids, and were down with them last fall gathering wappato which did not grow above, and also killing deer, that they secured the bark of the houses which they then lived in against their return next fall. they also inform us that their relations also visit them frequently in the spring to collect this root which is in great quantities on either side of the Columbia. at 10 A. M. we proceeded on accompanied by one canoe and three men. one of them appeared to be a man of some note, dressed in a salors jacket which had 5 rows of large and small buttons on it. Those people speak a different language from those below, with some fiew words the same, the accent entirely different. their dress and manners appear very similar. the women ware the truss or breach clout and short robes, and men roabs only passed up on the N. side of White brant Island near the upper point of which a small river falls in about 80 yards wide and at this time discharges a great quantity of water. the nativs inform us that this river is very short and heads in the range of mountains to the NE of its enterance into the Columbia. the nativs haveing no name which we could learn for this little river we call it Seal river from the great number of those Animals which frequents its mouth. this river forks into two nearly equal branches about 1 mile up and each branch is crowded with rapids &amp; falls. we proceed on about 2 miles above the enterance of this seacalf river and imediately opposit the upper mouth of the quick sand river we formed a camp in a small Prarie on the North side of the Columbia where we intend to delay one or two days to make some selestial observations, to examine quicksand river and kill some meat to last us through the Western Mountains which commences a fiew miles above us and runs in a N N W. &amp; S. S. E. derection. The three Indians encamped near us and visited our fire we entered into a kind of a conversation by signs, of the country and situation of the rivers. they informed us that Seal river headed in the mountains at no great distance. quick sand river was short only headed in Mt. Hood which is in view and to which he pointed. this is a circumstance we did not expect as we had heretofore deemed [it] a consederable river. Mount Hood bears East from this place and is distant from this place about 40 miles. this information if true will render it necessary to examine the river below on the South side behind the image canoe and Wappato islands for some river which must water the country weste of the western mountains to the waters of California. The Columbia is at present on a stand and we with dificuelty made 25 miles to day. [Lewis:] Tuesday April 1st. 1806. This morning early we dispatched Sergt. Pryor with two men in a small canoe up quicksand [Sandy] river with orders to proceed as far as he could and return this evening, we also sent a party of three hunters over the river to hunt a large bottom of woodland and prarie above the entrance of the Quicksand river; the ballance of the hunters we sent out in different directions on this side of the Columbia [and employed those about camp in making a rope of Elkskin] the Indians who encamped near us last evening continued with us untill about midday. they informed us that the quicksand river which we have heretofore deemed so considerable, only extendes through the Western mountains as far as the S. Western side of mount hood where it takes it's source, this mountain bears E. from this place and is distant about 40 miles. this information was corroborated by that of sundry other indians who visited us in the course of the day. we were now convinced that there must be some other considerable river which flowed into the Columbia on it's south side below us which we have not yet seen, as the extensive valley on that side of the river lying between the mountainous country of the Coast and the Western mountains must be watered by some stream which we heretofore supposed was the quicksand river, but if it be a fact that the quicksand river heads in Mount Hood it must leave the valley within a few miles of it's entrance and runs nearly parallel with the Columbia river upwards. we indeavoured to ascertain by what stream the southern portion of the Columbian valley was watered but could obtain no satisfactory information of the natives on this head. they informed us that the quicksand river is navigable a short distance only in consequence of falls and rapids; and that no nation inhabits it. Sergt Pryor returned in the evening and reported that he had ascended the river six miles; that above the point at which it divides itself into two channels it is about 300 yds. wide tho' the channel is not more than 50 yds. and only 6 ft. deep, this is a large vollume of water to collect in so short a distance; I therefore think it probable that there are some large creeks falling into it from the S.W. the bed of this stream is formed entirely of quicksand; it's banks are low and at preasent overflown. the water is turbid and current rapid. the following are the courses taken by Sergt Pryor. S. 10°. W. 1.M. to a point on the Lard. side passing a large Island on Stard. S. 24 E. 2 M. to the head of an Island near the Lard. shore. S. 33°. E.4 M. to a Stard point passing several islands on the Lard. side and a creek 50 yds wide on Stard. at 1 1/2 miles. the river from hence appeared to bend to the East. he heard falls of water. several different tribes informed us that it heads at Mount Hood. We were visited by several canoes of natives in the course of the day; most of whom were decending the river with their women and children. they informed us that they resided at the great rapids and that their relations at that place were much streightened at that place for want of food; that they had consumed their winter store of dryed fish and that those of the present season had not yet arrived. I could not learn wheather they took the sturgeon but presume if they do it is in but small quantities as they complained much of the scarcity of food among them. they informed us that the nations above them were in the same situation &amp; that they did not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2d. of May. we did not doubt the varacity of these people who seemed to be on their way with their families and effects in surch of subsistence which they find it easy to procure in this fertile valley. This information gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our future means of subsistence. above [the] falls or through the plains from thence to the Chopunnish there are no deer Antelope nor Elk on which we can depend for subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in the same situation, under these circumstances there seems to be but a gloomy prospect for subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it into serious consideration what measures we were to pursue on this occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to wait the arrival of the salmon as that would detain us so large a portion of the season that it is probable we should not reach the United States before the ice would close the Missouri; or at all events would hazard our horses which we left in charge of the Chopunnish who informed us they intended passing the rocky mountains to the Missouri as early as the season would permit them w[h]ich is as we believe about the begining of May. should these people leave their situation near kooskooske before our arrival we may probably find much difficulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be but little possibility of repassing the mountains; we are therefore determined to loose as little time as possible in geting to the Chopunnish Village. at 3 P.M. the hunters who were sent over the river returned having killed 4 Elk and two deer; the Elk were in good order but the deer extreemly poor. they informed us that game is very plenty in that quarter. the hunters on this side of the river also returned but had killed nothing; they saw a few Elk and deer. there was also much sign of the black bear seen on the other side of the river. we sent a party to bring in the flesh of the Elk and deer that were killed. they did not return this evening. I purchased a canoe from an Indian to day for which I gave him six fathoms of wampum beads; he seemed satisfyed with his bargain and departed in another canoe but shortly after returned and canceled the bargain, took his canoe and returned the beads. this is frequently the case in their method of traiding and is deemed fair by them. The last evening and this morning were so cloudy that I could neither obtain any Lunar observations nor equal altitudes. Point of observation N°. 55 At our encampment on the N. side of the Columbia opposite the upper entrance of the Quicksand river Observed meridian Altitude of ?'s U. L. 98° 34′–″ with sextant by the direct observation Latitude deduced from this observation [blank space in MS.] it was so cloudy at the time of this observation that I cannot vouch for any great accuracy. [Clark:] Tuesday April 1st. 1806 This morning early we dispatched Sergt. Pryor, with two men in a small canoe up quick sand river with orders to proceed as far as he could and return this evening. we also sent a party of three hunters over the river to hunt a large bottom of woodland and prarie above the enterance of Q. sand River; the ballance of the hunters we sent out in different directions on this side of the Columbia, and employed those about camp in makeing a rope of Elk skin. The information given by the indians to us last night respecting quick sand river was corrobarated by sundery other indians who visited us in the course of this day. we were now convinced that if there information be just; that some considerable river which flowed into the Columbia on it's South Side below us which we have not yet seen, as the extensive vally on that side of the river, lying between the mountanious country of the Coast, and the western mountains must be watered by some Stream which we had heretofore supposed was the quicksand river, but if it be a fact that Quick sand river heads in Mount Hood it must leave the vally within a fiew miles of it's enterance, and runs nearly parrilel with the Columbia River upwards, we indeavered to assertained by what stream the south portion of the Columbian Vally was watered, but could obtain no satisfactory information of the nativs on this head. they inform us that the quick sand river is not naviagable any distance in consequence of falls and rapids; and that no nation inhabit it. Sergt. Pryor returned in the evening and reported that he had assendd. the river six miles; that above the point which it divides itself into two chanels, it is about 300 yards wide tho' the chanel is not more than 50 yards, and only 6 feet deep. the other part of the river from 2 to 4 inches water, the bead of this river is formed entirely of quick sand; its banks are low and at present overflown, the water is turbed and current rapid. The following are the courses taken by Sergt. Pryor. "S. 10°. W. 1 mile to a point on the Lard. side passing a large island on Stard side. S. 24° E. 2 M. to the head of the island near the Lard Shore. S 33°. E 4 M to a Stard. point passing several islands on the Lard side and a Creek 50 yards wide on the Stard. side at 1 1/2 miles. the river from hence upwards bend to the East. a fall of water heard at no great distance up this river." Several different tribes of indians inform us that it heads at Mount Hood which is in view. we were visited by several canoes of the nativs in the course of this day; most of whome were decending the river with their womin and children. they inform us that they reside at the great rapids and that their relations at that place were much streightened for the want of food, that they had consumed their winter store of dryed fish and those of the present season had not yet arived. I could not lern whether they took the Sturgion but prosume if they do it is in but small quantities as they complain much of the scercity of food among them, they informed us that the nativs above them were in the same situation, and that they did not expect the salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the 2nd. of May. we did not doubt the veracity of those people who seamed to be on their way with their families and effects in serch of subsistence which they find it easy to precure in this fertile vally. This information givs us much uneasiness with respect to our future means of subsistence, above the falls, on through the Plains from thence to the Chopunnish there are no Deer Antilopes or Elk on which we could depend for subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they have no fish their dogs must be in the same situation, under these circumstances there seams to be a gloomey prospect for subsistence on any terms; we therefore took it into serious consideration what measure we were to pursue on this occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to waite the arival of the salmon as that would detain us so long a portion of the season that it is probable we should not reach the U States before the ice would close the Missouri; or at all events would hazard our horses which we left in charge of the Chopunnish who informed us that they intended passing the Rocky Mountains to the Missouri as early as the season would permit them which is about the first of May. Should these people leave their situation near Kooskooske before our arival we may probably find much dificulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be but little possibility of repassing the Mountains; we are therefore determined to lose as little time as possible in getting to the Chopunnish Village. At 3 P.M. the hunters who were sent over the river returned haveing killed 4 Elk and 2 Deer; the Elk were in good order but the deer extreemly poor. they informed us that game is very plenty in that quarter. the hunters on this side of the river also returned but had killed nothing; they saw a fiew Elk and Deer. there were also much sign of the black bear seen on the other side of the river. we sent a party to bring in the flesh of the Elk and Deer that were killed. they did not return this evening. we purchased a Canoe from an Indian today for six fathoms of white wampom; he seemed satisfied with his bargin and departed in another Canoe but shortly after returned and canseled the bargain; took his canoe and returned the beeds. this is frequently the case in their method of trading and is deemed fair by them. The last evening and this morning were so cloudy that we could neither obtain any Lunar observations nor equal altitudes. [Lewis:] Wednesday April 2ed. 1806. This morning we came to a resolution to remain at our present encampment or some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained as much dryed meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the Chopunnish. to exchange our perogues for canoes with the natives on our way to the great falls of the columbia or purchase such canoes from them for Elkskins and Merchandize as would answer our purposes. these canoes we intend exchanging with the natives of the plains for horses as we proceed untill we obtain as many as will enable us to travel altogether by land. at some convenient point, perhaps at the entrence of the S.E. branch of the Columbia, we purpose sending a party of four or five men a head to collect our horses that they may be in readiness for us by our arrival at the Chopunnish; calculating by thus acquiring a large stock of horses we shall not only secure the means of transporting our baggage over the mountains but that we will also have provided the means of subsisting; for we now view the horses as our only certain resource for food, nor do we look forward to it with any detestation or horrow [horror], so soon is the mind which is occupyed with any interesting object, reconciled to it's situation. The men who were sent in quest of the Elk and deer that were killed yesterday returned at 8 A.M. this morning. we now enformed the party of our intention of laying in a store of meat at this place, and immediately dispatched two parteis consisting of nine men to the opposite side of the river. five of those we sent below the Quicksand river and 4 above. we also sent out three others on this side, and those who remained in camp were employed in collecting wood making a scaffoald and cutting up the meat in order to dry it. about this time several canoes of the natives arrived at our camp and among others one from below which had on board eight men of the Shah-ha-la nation these men informed us that 2 young men whom they pointed out were Cash-hooks and resided at the falls of a large river which discharges itself into the Columbia on it's South side some miles below us. we readily prevailed on them to give us a sketch of this river which they drew on a mat with a coal. it appeared that this river which they called Mult-no-mâh1 1 A name properly applied only to the lower reach of the Willamette, below the falls of that river (which are 24 miles from its upper mouth). For etymology of the name Willamette, see Bancroft's N. W. Coast, ii, pp. 60, 61.—Ed. discharged itself behind the Island which we called the image canoe Island and as we had left this island to the S. both in ascending and decending the river we had never seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and run a considerable distance to the South between the mountains. Capt. Clark determined to return and examine this river accordingly he took a party of seven men and one of the perogues and set out 1/2 after 11 A.M., he hired one of the Cashhooks, for a birning glass, to pilot him to the entrance of the Multnomah river and took him on board with him. in their manners dress language and stature these people are the same with the quathlahpohtle nation and others residing in the neighbourhood of wappetoe Island. near the entrance of Multnomah river a considerable nation resides on the lower side of that stream by the same name. as many as ten canoes with natives arrived at our camp in the course of the day; most of them were families of men women and children decencing the river. they all gave the same account of the scarcity of provision above. I shot my air gun with which they were much astonished. one family consisting of ten or twelve persons remained near us all night. they conducted themselves in a very orderly manner. the three hunters on this side of the river returned in the evening they had killed two deer, tho' they were so poor and at such a distance from camp that they brought in their skins only. the night and morning being cloudy I was again disappointed in making the observations I wished. at noon I observed the Meridian Altitude of the ?'s U.L. with sextant by the direct obsn. 99°· 20′· 45″· Latitude deduced from this observation [blank space in MS.] This observation may be depended on to 15″ of a degree. Fir is the common growth of the uplands, as is the cottonwood, ash, large leafed ash and sweet willow that of the bottom lands. the huckleburry, shallon, and the several evergreen shrubs of that speceis which bear burries have seased to appear except that speceis which has the leaf with a prickly margin. among the plants of this prarie in which we are encamped I observe the passhequo, Shannetahque, and compound firn the roots of which the natives eat; also the water cress, strawburry, flowering pea not yet in blume, the sinquefoil, narrow dock, sand rush which are luxuriant and abundant in the river bottoms; a speceis of the bearsclaw of which I preserved a specemine it is in blume. the large leafed thorn has also disappeared. the red flowering currant is found here in considerable quantities on the uplands. the hunters inform me that there are extensive praries on the highlands a few miles back from the river on this side, the land is very fertile. [Clark:] Wednesday April 2nd. 1806 This morning we came to a resolution to remain at our present encampment or some where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained as much dried meat as would be necessary for our voyage as far as the Chopunnish. to exchange our large canoes for small ones with the nativs on our way to the great Falls of the Columbia or purchase such canoes from them for Elk skins and Merchandize as would answer our purposes. these canoes we intend exchangeing with the nativs of the Plains for horses as we proceed untill we obtain as maney as will enable us to travel altogether by land. at some convenient point, perhaps at the enterance of Lewis's River we intend sending a party of 4 or 5 men a head to collect our horses that they may be in readiness for us by our arrival at the Chopunnish; calculating by thus acquiring a large stock of horses we shall not only secure the means of transporting our baggage over the Mountains, but that we also have provided the means of subsisting; for we now view the horses as our only certain resource for food, nor do we look foward to it with any detestation or horrow, so soon is the mind which is occupied with any interesting object, reconsiled to it's situation. The men who went in quest of the Elk and Deer which were killed yesterday returned at 8 A. M. this morning. we now informed the party of our intention of laying in a store of meat at this place, and imediately dispatched two parties consisting of nine men to the opposit side of the river. 5 of them below and 4 above quick sand River. we also sent out 3 others on this side, and those who remained in camp were employd in collecting wood makeing a scaffold and cutting up the meat in order to dry it. about this time several canoes of the nativs arived at our Camp among others two from below with Eight men of the Shah-ha-la Nation those men informed us that they reside on the opposit side of the Columbia near some pine trees which they pointed to in the bottom South of the Dimond Island, they singled out two young men whome they informed us lived at the Falls of a large river which discharges itself into the Columbia on it's south side some miles below us. we readily prevailed on them to give us a sketch of this river which they drew on a Mat with a coal, it appeared that this river which they call Mult-nó-mah discharged itself behind the Island we call the image canoe island, and as we had left this island to the south in decending &amp; assending the river we had never seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and runs a considerable distance to the south between the Mountains. I deturmined to take a small party and return to this river and examine its size and collect as much information of the nativs on it or near it's enterance into the Columbia of its extent, the country which it waters and the nativs who inhabit its banks &amp;c. I took with me six men, Thompson J. Potts, Peter Crusat, P. Wiser, T. P. Howard, Jos. Whitehouse &amp; my man York in a large Canoe, with an Indian whome I hired for a Sun glass to accompany me as a pilot. at half past 11 A. M. I set out, and had not proceeded far eer I saw 4 large canoes at some distance above decending and bending their course towards our Camp which at this time is very weak Capt. Lewis haveing only 10 men with him. I hesitated for a moment whether it would not be advisable for me to return and delay untill a part of our hunters should return to add more strength to our Camp. but on a second reflection and reverting to the precautions always taken by my friend Capt Lewis on those occasions banished all apprehensions and I proceeded on down. at 8 miles passed a village on the South side at this place my Pilot informed me he resided and that the name of the tribe is Ne-cha-co-lee,1 1 Bancroft (N. W. Coast, ii, p. 44) thinks this is the tribe now known as Wasco.—Ed. this village is back on the South of Dimond island, and as we passed on the North side of the island both decending and assending did not see or know of this village. I proceeded on without landing at this village, at 3 P. M. I landed at a large double house of the Ne-er-che-ki-oo tribe of the Shah-ha-la Nation. at this place we had seen 24 aditional straw Huts as we passed down last fall and whome as I have before mentioned reside at the Great rapids of the Columbia, on the bank at different places I observed small canoes which the women make use of to gather wappato &amp; roots in the Slashes. those canoes are from 10 to 14 feet long and from 18 to 23 inches wide in the widest part tapering from the center to both ends in this form and about 9 inches deep and so light that a woman may with one hand haul them with ease, and they are sufficient to carry a woman an[d] some loading. I think 100 of these canoes were piled up and scattered in different directions about in the woods, in the vicinity of this house, the pilot informed me that those canoes were the property of the inhabitents of the Grand rapids who used them ocasionally to gather roots. I entered one of the rooms of this house and offered several articles to the nativs in exchange for wappato. they were sulkey and they positively refused to sell any. I had a small pece of port fire match in my pocket, off of which I cut a pece one inch in length &amp; put it into the fire and took out my pocket compas and set myself down on a mat on one side of the fire, and [also showed] a magnet which was in the top of my ink stand the port fire cought and burned vehemently, which changed the colour of the fire; with the magnit I turned the needle of the compas about very briskly; which astonished and alarmed these nativs and they laid several parsles of wappato at my feet, &amp; begged of me to take out the bad fire; to this I consented; at this moment the match being exhausted was of course extinguished and I put up the magnet &amp;c. this measure alarmed them so much that the womin and children took shelter in their beads and behind the men, all this time a very old blind man was speaking with great vehemunce, appearently imploring his god. I lit my pipe and gave them smoke, &amp; gave the womin the full amount [value] of the roots which they had put at my feet. they appeared somewhat passified and I left them and proceeded on. on the south side of Image Canoe Island which I found to be two Islands, hid from the opposit side by one near the center of the river. the lower point of the upper and the upper point of the lower cannot be seen from the North Side of the Columbia on which we had passed both decending and ascending and had not observed the apperture between those islands. at the distance of 13 miles below the last village and at the place I had supposed was the lower point of the image canoe island, I entered this river which the nativs had informed us of, called Multnomah River so called by the nativs from a nation who reside on Wappato Island a little below the enterance of this river. Multnomah discharges itself in the Columbia on the S.E. and may be justly said to be 1/4 the size of that noble river. Multnomah had fallen 18 inches from its greatest annual height. three small Islands are situated in it's mouth which hides the river from view from the Columbia. from the enterance of this river, I can plainly see Mt. Jefferson which is high and covered with snow S.E. Mt. Hood East, Mt St. Helians [and] a high humped mountain [Mount Adams] to the East of Mt. St. Helians. S 30° W. 2 miles to the upper point of a small island in the middle of Moltnomar river. thence S. 10°. W. 3 miles to a sluce 80 yards wide which devides Wappato Island from the main stard. side shore passing a willow point on the Lard. side. S. 60°. E. 3 miles to a large Indian house on the Lard side below some high pine land. high bold shore on the Starboard side. thence S. 30° E 2 miles to a bend under the high lands on the Stard. Side passing a Larboard point. 10 thence the river bends to the East of S East as far as I could see. at this place I think the width of the river may be stated at 500 yards and sufficiently deep for a Man of war or ship of any burthen. [Lewis:] Thursday April 3rd. 1806. Early this morning Joseph Fields came over and informed me that Reubin Feilds Drewyer and himself had killed four Elk. as the party with me were now but weak and the Indians constantly crouding about our camp, I thought it best to send a few men to dry the meat on the other side of the river; accordingly Sergt. Pryor and two men returned with Jos. Fields for that purpose. the hunters were ordered to continue the chase, while the others were employed in drying the meat. I have had no account as yet from the party below the entrance of Quicksand river. The Indians continued to visit us to day in considerable numbers most of them were decending the river with their families these poor people appeared to be almost starved, they picked up the bones and little peices of refuse meat which had been thrown away by the party. they confirm the report of the scarcity of provision among the natives above. I observe some of the men among them who wear a girdle arround the waist between which and the body in front they confine a small skin of the mink or polecat which in some measure conceals the parts of generation. they also frequently wear a cap formed of the skin of the deer's head with the ears left on it, they have some collars of leather wrought with porcupine quills after the method of the Shoshonees. From this place Mount Hood bears S. 85°. E. distant 40 miles. This evening we completed drying the flesh of the Elk which had been brought to camp. at 6 P.M. Capt. Clark returned, having completely succeeded in his expedition. he found the entrance of the large river of which the Indians had informed us, just at the upper part of wappetoe Island. the following is a sketch of the river furnished Capt C. by an old and inteligent Indian man.1 1 For this sketch see Clark's journal, April 3, p. 242, post.—Ed. (add Clahnaquah [Clark:] Thursday April 3rd. 1806 The water had fallen in the course of last night five inches. I set out and proceeded up a short distance and attempted a second time to fathom the river with my cord of 5 fathom but could find no bottom. the mist was so thick that I could see but a short distance up this river. When I left it, it was bending to the East of S.E. being perfectly satisfyed of the size and magnitude of this great river which must water that vast tract of Country between the western range of mountains and those on the sea coast and as far S. as the Waters of Callifornia about Latd. 37. North. I deturmined to return.1 1 Clark ascended to a point at or near the present site of Portland, Ore. A writer in the Portland Oregonian, July 25, 1902, claims that it was within the city limits, near the railroad bridge which crosses the Willamette.—Ed. at 7 oClock A. M. set out on my return. the men exirted themselves and we arived at the Neerchokioo house in which the nativs were so illy disposed yesterday at 11 A. M. I entered the house with a view to smoke with those people who consisted of about 8 families, finding my presence alarmed them so much that the children hid themselves, womin got behind their men, and the men hung their heads, I detained but a fiew minits and returnd on board the canoe. My pilot who continued in the canoe informed me on my return that those people as well as their relations were very illy disposed and bad people. I proceeded on along the south side met five canoes of the Shah-ha-la Nation from the Great rapids with their wives and children decending the Columbia into this fertile Vally in pursute of provisions. My pilot informed me in a low voice that those people were not good, and I did not suffer them to come along side of my canoe which they appeared anxious to do. their numbers in those canoes who appeard anxious to come along side was 21 men and 3 boys. at 3 P. M. we arived at the residence of our Pilot which consists of one long house with seven appartments or rooms in square form about 30 feet each room opening into a passage which is quit[e] through the house those passages are about 4 feet in width and formed of wide boa[r]ds set on end in the ground and reaching to the Ruff [roof] which serves also as divisions to the rooms. The ground plot is in this form 1.1.1.1 is the passages. 2.2 &amp;c. is the apartments about 30 feet square. this house is built of bark of the white cedar Supported on long stiff poles resting on the ends of broad boads which form the rooms &amp;c. back of this house I observe the wreck of 5 houses remaining of a very large village, the houses of which had been built in the form of those we first saw at the long narrows of the E-lute Nation with whome those people are connected. I indeavored to obtain from those people of the situation of their nation, if scattered or what had become of the nativs who must have peopled this great town. an old man who appeared of some note among them and father to my guide brought foward a woman who was badly marked with the Small Pox and made signs that they all died with the disorder which marked her face, and which she was verry near dieing with when a girl. from the age of this woman this Distructive disorder I judge must have been about 28 or 30 years past, and about the time the Clatsops inform us that this disorder raged in their towns and distroyed their nation. Those people speak a different language from those below tho' in their dress habits and manners &amp;c. they differ but little from the Quathlahpohtles. their women ware the truss as those do of all the nations residing from the Quathlahpohtle to the enterance of Lewis's river and on the Columbia above for some distance. those people have some words the same with those below but the air of their language is entirely different, their men are stouter and much better made, and their womin ware larger &amp; longer robes than those do below; those are most commonly made of Deer skins dressed with the hair on them. they pay great attention to their aged severall men and women whom I observed in this village had arived at a great age, and appeared to be helthy tho' blind. I prevailed on an old man to draw me a sketch of the Multnomar River and give me the names of the nations resideing on it which he readily done, and gave me the names of 4 nations who reside on this river two of them very noumerous. The first is Clark-a-mus nation reside on a small river which takes its rise in Mount Jefferson and falls into the Moltnomar aboue 40 miles up. this nation is noumerous and inhabit 11 Towns. the 2d. is the Cush-hooks who reside on the N E. side below the falls, the 3rd. is the Char-cowah who reside above the Falls on the S W. side neither of those two are noumerous. The fourth Nation is the Cal-lar-po-e-wah1 1 This tribe is not Chinookan, but gives name to a different linguistic family the Kalapuya (Calapooya). They inhabited the Willamette Valley through most of its extent, and have given their name to a range of mountains which form the upper watershed of the Willamette.—Ed. which is very noumerous &amp; inhabit the country on each side of the Multnomar from its falls as far up as the knowledge of those people extend. they inform me also that a high mountain passes the Multnomar at the falls, and above the country is an open plain of great extent. I purchased 5 dogs of those people for the use of their oil in the Plains, and at 4 P M left the village and proceeded on to Camp where I joind Capt. Lewis. The enterance of Multnomah river is 142 miles up the Columbia river from its enterance into the Pacific Ocean. In my absence and soon after I left camp several canoes of men women and children came to the camp, and at one time there was about 37 of those people in camp Capt Lewis fired his Air gun which astonished them in such a manner that they were orderly and kept at a proper distance dureing the time they continued with him. as maney as 10 canoes arrived at camp in the course of this day. they all seemed to give the same account of the scercity of Provisions above. one family continued all night and behaved themselves in a very orderly manner. on the 3d. Joseph Field returned from the woods and informed th[at] Drewyer Rubin &amp; himself had killed four Elk. Cap L. sent Sergt. Pryor and two men with Joseph Field to dry the flesh of the Elk in the woods on scaffolds with fire. the party below quick sand river did not return to day. The Indians continue to visit our camp in considerable number from above with their families. these pore people appeared half starved. they picked up the bones and little refuse meat which had been thrown away by the party. Capt. L had the flesh of the 4 Elk which was killed on the 1st. inst. dried. Some of the men of the nativs who visited Capt. Lewis wore a girdle with a small skin in front and a cap of the skin of the deers head &amp;c.</field>

THIS morning we sent Sergt. Ordway in Surch of Sergt. Gass and party below the entrance of the Quicksand river from whom we have yet had no report. in the course of a few hours both parties returned. Sergt. Gass and party brought the flesh of a bear and some venison. they informed us that they had killed an Elk and six deer tho' the flesh of the greater part of those animals was so meagre that it was unfit for uce and they had therefore left it in the woods. Collins who had killed the bear, found the bed of another in which there were three young ones; and requested to be permitted to return in order to waylay the bed and kill the female bear; we permitted him to do so; Sergt. Gass and Windsor returned with him. Several parties of the natives visit us today as usual both from above and below; those who came from above were moving with their families, and those from below appeared to be impeled mearly by curiossity to see us. About noon we despatched Gibson Shannon Howard and Wiser in one of the light canoes, with orders to proceed up the Columbia to a large bottom on the South side about six miles above us and to hunt untill our arrival. late in the evening Joseph Fields and Drewyer returned. they had killed two deer yesterday and informed us that the meat would be dryed by midday tomorrow. we directed Drewyer and the two Feildses to ascend the river tomorrow to join Gibson and party, and hunt untill our arrival. this evening being fair I observed time and distance of D's Eastern Limb from regulus with Sextant. * West.

[Lewis:] Saturday April 5th. 1806. This morning was so cloudy that I could not obtain any lunar observations with a Aquilae as I wished. Joseph Fields and Drewyer departed this morning agreeably to their orders of last evening. at 9 A.M. we Sent Sergt. Ordway and a party to assist Sergt. Pryor in bringing in the meat of four Elk which he had dryed. at 1 P.M. the party returned with the meat. it had been so illy dryed that we feared it would not keep. we therefore directed it to be cut thinner and redryed over a fire this evening, as we purpose setting out early in the morning. the deerskins which we have had cased for the purpose of containing our dryed meat are not themselves sufficiently dryed for that purpose, we directed them to be dryed by the fire also. the weather has been so damp that there was no possibility of pounding the meat as I wished. we were visited to day by several parties of the natives as usual; they behaved themselves in a very orderly manner.

Gass returned with Collins and Windsor they had not succeeded in killing the female bear tho' they brought the three cubs with them. the Indians who visited us today fancyed these petts and gave us wappetoe in exchange for them. Drewyer informed me that he never knew a female bear return to her young when they had been allarmed by a person and once compelled to leave them. The dogwood grows abundantly on the uplands in this neighbourhood. it differs from that of the United States in the appearance of it's bark which is much smoother, it also arrives here to much greater size than I ever observed it elsewhere sometimes the stem is nearly 2 feet in diameter.1 1 Cornus nuttalli.—C. V. Piper. we measured a fallen tree of fir N°. 1. which was 318 feet including the stump which was about 6 feet high. this tree was only about 31/2 feet in diameter. we saw the martin, small gees, the small speckled woodpecker with a white back, the Blue crested Corvus, ravens, crows, eagles Vultures and hawks. the mellow [melon] bug and long leged spider have appeared, as have also the butterfly blowing fly and many other insects. I observe not any among them which appear to differ from those of our country or which deserve particular notice. [Clark:] Saturday April 5th.. 1806. This morning was so cloudy that we could not obtain any lunar observations with a Aquilæ as we wished. Joseph Fields &amp; Drewyer left us this morning agreeably to their orders of last evening. at the same time we sent Sergt. Ordway and five men to assist Sergt. Pryor in bringing in the meat of four Elk which he had dried in the woods. at 1 p.m. the party returned withe the meat. it was not sufficiently dryed to keep. we had it cut thiner and redryed over a fire this evening, as we purpose setting out early in the morning. the dear skins which we had cased for the purpose of holding our dried meat is not sufficently dry for that purpose, we derected them to be dried by the fire also. the weather being so damp that there was no possibulity of pounding the meat as I wished. We were visited by several parties of the nativs to day; they behaved themselves in a very orderly manner.1 1 The astronomical data, being transcripts of those in Lewis, are here omitted.—Ed. Saw the Log cock, the humming bird, Geese, Ducks &amp;c. to day. the tick has made it's appearance it is the same with those of the Atlantic States, the Musquetors have also appeared but are not yet much troublesom. this morning at 10. A.M. Sergt. Gass returned with Collins and Windser they had not succeeded in killing the female bear, tho' they brought the three cub's with them. the Indians who visited us to day fancied those pets and gave us wappato in exchange for them. Fir and white cedar is the common growth of the uplands, as is the cotton wood, ash, large leafed Ash and sweet willow that of the bottom lands. The Huckleberry, shallon, and the several evergreen shrubs, of that speces that bears berries have seased to appear, except that species which has the leaf with a prickley margin. among the plants of this prarie in which we are encamped I observe the pashequo, shannetahque, and compound firn the root of which the nativs eate; also the water cress, strawberry flowering pea not yet in blume, narrow dock, and rush which are luxuriant and abundent in the river bottoms.2 2 The water cress is cardamine sp. mentioned in the "Weather Diary" for April 9, as "wild cress or tongue grass"; there are several species on the Columbia. The strawberry is Fragaria spp. The flowering pea is either Lathyrm polyphyllus, Nutt. or Vicia americana, Muhl. The narrow dock is probably Rumex salicifolius, Weinrn. —C. V. Piper. the large leafed thorn has also disappeared The red flowering current is found here in considerable quantities on the upland,3 3 The red-flowering currant is the same as that mentioned Apr. 12, 1806, as the purple currant (Ribes sanguineum, Pursh).—C. V. Piper. and the common Dog wood is found on either side of the river in this neighbourhood and above Multnomah river. The country on either side is fertile, the bottoms on the South Side is wide and intersperced with small ponds in which the natives gather their wappato. back of this bottom the country rises to about 200 feet and the soil is very rich as that also above Q[uick] Sandy river quite to the mountains. the country on the N. Side from a fiew miles above this place as low down as the enterance of Cah-wah-na-ki-ooks River rises to the hight generally of 150 or 200 feet is tolerably leavel, thickly timbered with Fir and white cedar, the soil of the richest quallity. Some small Praries on the bank of the river. That portion of country below as low down as the enterance of Cah-wah-na-ki-ooks River is a broken rich country. the hills are high, the bottom lands as before mentioned and fertile &amp;c. The country a fiew miles up the Multnomah River rises from the river bottoms to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and is rich &amp; fertile. Some plains can be seen to the N.E. of our camp of 10 or 12 miles in secumference The Hunters &amp; Serjt. Pryor informe us that they had measured a tree on the upper side of quick sand River 312 feet long and about 4 feet through at the stump. [Lewis:] Sunday April 6th 1806. This morning we had the dryed meat secured in skins and the canoes loaded; we took breakfast and departed at 9 A.M. we continued up the N. side of the river nearly to the place at which we had encamped on the 3rd. of Nov. when we passed the river to the south side in quest of the hunters we had sent up yesterday and the day before. from the appearance of a rock near which we were encamped on the 3rd. of November last I could judge better of the rise of the water than I could at any point below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was at that time; the river is here about 11/2 miles wide; it's general width from the beacon [beaten before—but really beacon] rock which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands is from one to 2 miles tho' in many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock. this remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred feet; it has some pine or reather fir timber on it's no[r]thern side, the southern is a precipice of it's whole hight. it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles below on the river. at the distance of ten miles from our encampment we met with our hunters in the upper end of the bottom to which we had directed them on the South side of the river. they had killed three Elk this morning and wounded two others so badly that they expected to get them. we therefore determined to encamp for the evening at this place in order to dry the meat, in surch of which we sent a party immediately and employed others in preparing scaffoalds and collecting firewood &amp;c. against their return. we found some indians with our hunters when we arrived; these people are constantly hanging about us. As has been before mentioned Capt C set out with a party of seven men on 2ed inst. in surch of the entrance of the Multnomah river.1 1 Lewis here inserts an account of Clark's visit to the Multnomah (Willamette) River, which is copied from Clark's journal for April 2 and 3, and therefore here omitted.—Ed. The party whom we sent for the flesh of the Elk which Shannon had killed returned in the evening with that of four, one had by some mistake been omitted. Drewyer and Shannon found the two wounded Elk and had killed them. we set all hands at work to prepare the meat for the scaffoald they continued their operations untill late at night. we directed Shannon to go out early in the morning with a party to bring in the Elk which had been left last evening in mistake. we also directed Drewyer and the two Feildses to ascend the river early in the morning to a small bottom a few miles above and hunt untill our arrival. [Clark:] Sunday April 6th. 1806 Two Indians came last night very late to our camp and continued all night, early we had all the meat packed up and our canoes loaded ready for to set out, and after an early brackfast at which time all things were ready and we set out, and proceeded to the Camp of Gibson &amp; party about 9 miles, they had killed 3 Elk at no great distance and wounded two others so badly that we expect to precure them. Sent a party of six men with Shannon who had killed the Elk to bring in the Elk, and formed a Camp, near which we had a scaffold made ready to dry the meat as soon as it should arive. Reubin Fields killed a bird of the quail kind or class which was whistleing near our camp it is larger than the quail or partridge as they are called [in] Kentucky and Virginia, its form is presisely that of our partridge tho' its plumage differs in every part, the upper part of the head, sides and back of the neck, including the Croop and about 1/3 of the under part of the body is of a bright dove coloured blue, under neath the under beak, as high as the lower edge of the eye, and back as far as the hinder part of the eyes and thence comeing down to a point in the front of the neck about 2/3rd. of it's length downwards, is of a fine dark brick red. between this brick red and the dove colour there runs a narrow stripe of pure white. the ears are covered with some coarse dark brown feathers. just at the base of the under chap there is a narrow transvirce stripe of white. from the crown of the head two long round feathers extend backwards nearly in the direction of the beak and are of a black colour. the length of these feathers is 21/2 inches. one overlais and conseals the other which is somewhat shorter and seems to be [w]raped in the plumage of that in front which folding backwards colapses behind and has a round appearance. the tail is composed of 12 dark brown feathers of nearly equal length. the large feathers of the wings are of a dark brown &amp; are reather short in purpotion to the body of the bird. in this respect very similar to the partridge. the covert of the wings and back are of a dove colour with a slight admixture of redish brown. a wide stripe which extends from side to side of the body and occupies the lower region of the breast is beautifully varigated with the brick red white &amp; black which perdominates in the order they are mentioned and the colours mark the feathers transversely. the legs are covered with feathers as low as the Knee; these feathers are of dark brown tiped with a dark brick red as are also those between and about the joining of the legs with the body. the foot is presisely that of the common partridge except that they are as also the legs white. the upper beak is short, wide at it's base, black, convex, curved downwards and reather obtusely pointed. it exceeds the under chap considerably which is of a white colour, also convex underneath and obtusely pointed. the nostrils are remarkably small, placed far back and low down on the sides of the beak. they are covered by a thin prot[ub]erant elastic, black leather like substance. the eyes are of a uniform pierceing black colour. this is a most butifull bird I preserved the skin of this bird retaining the wings feet &amp; head which I hope will give a just Idea of the bird.1 1 This is the earliest description of the beautiful mountain quail of California (Oreortyx picta).—Coues (L. and C., ii, p. 936). it's loud note is single and consists of a loud squall, intirely different from the whistling of our partridge or quailes. it has a chiping note when allarmed like our partridge. to day there was a second of those birds killed which precisely resembles that just discribed. I believe those to be the mail bird the female, if so, I have not yet seen. at 6 P. M. Shannon and party returned with the flesh of five Elk. the two he had wounded in the morning he found dead near the place he had Shot them. we had the meat cut into thin pi[e]ces and scaffor[l]ed with a fire under it to dry it, which we expect in the course of the night can be effected. four Indians from the great rapids visited us to day and continued all day. they give the same account of the scercity of provisions above the falls as has already been given by others. This supply of Elk I think by useing economey and in addition of roots and dogs which we may probably precure from the Nativs on Lewis's river will be sufficient to last us to the Chopunnish where we shall meet with our horses, and near which place there is some deer to be precured. Frazer killed a pheasent of the common kind. Jos: Field killed a vulture of that speces already discribed. in the evening late the Indians left us and returned to their village. we derected that fires be kept under the meat all night. and th[at] Drewyer and the two Fields proceed on to the next bottom and hunt untill we should arive. 9 miles [Lewis:] Monday April 7th. 1806. This morning early the flesh of the remaining Elk was brought in and Drewyer with the Feildses departed agreeably to the order of the last evening. we employed the party in drying the meat today which we completed by the evening, and we had it secured in dryed Elkskins and put on board in readiness for an early departure. we were visited today by several parties of indians from a village about 8 miles above us of the S[h]ah-halah nation. I detected one of them in steeling a peice of lead and sent him from camp. I hope we have now a sufficient stock of dryed meat to serve us as far the Chopunnish provided we can obtain a few dogs horses and roots by the way. in the neighbourhood of the Chopunnish we can procure a few deer and perhaps a bear or two for the mountains. last evening Reubin Field killed a bird of the quail kind it is reather larger than the quail, or partridge as they are called in Virginia. (copy for Dr. Barton) it's form is precisely that of our partridge tho' it's plumage differs in every part. the upper part of the head, sides and back of the neck, including the croop and about 1/3 of the under part of the body is of a bright dovecoloured blue, underneath the under beak, as high as the lower edge of the eyes, and back as far as the hinder part of the eyes and thence coming down to a point in front of the neck about two thirds of it's length downwards, is of a fine dark brick red. between this brick red and the dove colour there runs a narrow stripe of pure white. the ears are covered with some coarse stiff dark brown feathers. just at the base of the under chap there is [a] narrow transverse stripe of white. from the crown of the head two long round feathers extend backwards nearly in the direction of the beak and are of a black colour. the longest of these feathers is two inches and an half, it overlays and conceals the other which is somewhat shorter and seems to be raped in the plumage of that in front which folding backwards colapses behind and has a round appearance. the tail is composed of twelve dark brown feathers of nearly equal length. the large feathers of the wings are of a dark brown and are reather short in proportion to the body of the bird in that rispect very similar to our common partridge. the covert of the wings and back are of a dove colour with a slight admixture of redish brown. a wide stripe which extends from side to side of the body and occupyes the lower region of the breast is beautifully variagated with the brick red white and black which p[r]edominate in the order they are mentioned and the colours mark the feathers transversely. the legs are covered with feathers as low as the knee; these feathers are of a dark brown tiped with dark brick red as are also those between and about the joining of the legs with the body. they have four toes on each foot of which three are in front and that in the center the longest, those one [on] each side nearly of a length; that behing[d] is also of good length and are all armed with long and strong nails. the legs and feet are white and imbrecated with proportionably large broad scales. the upper beak is short, wide at it's base, black, convex, curved downwards and reather obtusely pointed. it exceeds the under chap considerably which is of a white colour, also convex underneath and obtusely pointed. the nostrils are remarkably small, placed far back and low down on the sides of the beak. they are covered by a thin protuberant elastic, black leatherlike substance. the eyes are of a uniform piercing black colour. this is a most beautifull bird. I preserved the skin of this bird retaining the wings feet and head which I hope will give a just idea of the bird. it's loud note is single and consists of a loud squall, intirely different from the whistling of our quales or partridge. it has a cherping note when allarmed something like ours. today there was a second of these birds killed [by Capt C.] which precisely resembled that just discribed. I believe these to be the male bird the female, if so, I have not yet seen. the day has been fair and weather extreemly pleasant. we made our men exercise themselves in shooting today and regulate their guns found several of them that had their sights moved by accedent, and others that wanted some little alterations all [of] which were compleatley rectifyed in the course of the day. in the evening all the indians departed for their village. [Clark:] Monday April 7th 1806 This morning Drewyer &amp; the two Fields set out agreeably to their orders of last evening, the remainder of the party employed in drying the flesh of the five Elk killed by Shannon yesterday. which we completed and we had it secured in dried shaved Elk Skins and put on board in readiness for our early departure. we were visited by several parties of Indians from a village about 12 miles above us of the Sahhalah nation. one of them was detected in stealing a piece of Lead. I sent him off imedeately. I hope now we have a sufficient stock of dryed meat to serve us as far as the Chopunnish provided we can obtain a fiew dogs, horses and roots by the way. in the neighbourhood of the Chopunnish under the Rocky Mountains we can precure a fiew deer, and perhaps a Bear or two for the Mountains. The day has been fair and weather exceedingly pleasent. we made our men exercise themselves in shooting and regulateing their guns, found several of them that had their Sights moved by accident, and others that wanted some little alterations all which were compleated rectified in the course of the day except my small rifle, which I found wanted cutting out. about 4 oClock P M all the Indians left us, and returned to their village. they had brought with them wappato, &amp; pashequa roots chapellel cakes, and a species of raspberry for sale, none of which they disposed of as they asked such enormous prices for those articles that we were not able to purchase any. Drewyer returned down the river in the evening &amp; informed us that the nativs had sceared all the Elk from the river above. Joseph &amp; reuben Fields had proceeded on further up the river in the canoe, he expected to the village. I provaled on an old indian to mark the Multnomah R down on the sand which hid [he did] and perfectly corisponded with the sketch given me by sundary others, with the addition of a circular mountain which passes this river at the falls and connects with the mountains of the Seacoast. he also lais down the Clarkamos [Clackamas] passing a high conical mountain near it's mouth on the lower Side and heads in Mount Jefferson which he lais down by raiseing the Sand as a very high mountain and covered with eternal snow. the high mountain which this Indian lais down near the enterance of Clarkamos river, we have not seen as the hills in it's direction from this vally is high and obscures the sight of it from us. Mt Jefferson we can plainly see from the enterance of Multnomah from which place it bears S.E. this is a noble mountain and I think equally as high or something higher than Mt. St. Heleans but its distance being much greater than that of the latter, so great a portion of it does not appear above the range of mountains which lie between both those stupendious mountains and the mouth of Multnomah. like Mt. St. Heleans its figure is a regular cone and is covered with eturnial snow. that the Clarkamos nation1 1 One of the best known of the Chinookan tribes. There are still a few Clackamas on the Grand Ronde reservation in Oregon.—Ed. as also those at the falls of the Multnomah live principally on fish of which those streams abound and also on roots which they precure on it's borders, they also sometimes come down to the Columbia in serch of Wappato. they build their houses in the same form with those of the Columbian vally of wide split boa[r]ds and covered with bark of the white cedar which is the entire length of the one side of the roof and jut over at the eve about 18 inches. at the distance of about 18 inches transvers sp[l]inters of dried pine is inserted through the ceder bark in order to keep it smooth and prevent it's edge from colapsing by the heat of the sun; in this manner the nativs make a very secure light and lasting roof of this bark. which we have observed in every vilege in this vally as well as those above. this Indian also informed me that multnomah above the falls was crouded with rapids and thickly inhabited by indians of the Cal-lah-po-é-wah Nation. he informed he had himself been a long way up that river &amp;c. [Lewis:] Tuesday April 8th. 1806. The wind blew so violently this morning that we were obliged to unlode our perogues and canoes, soon after which they filled with water.1 1 Some of the men are complaining of rheumatic pains, which are to be expected from the wet and cold we suffered last winter; during which, from the 4th of November 1805, to the 25th of March, 1806, there were not more than twelve days in which it did not rain, and of these but six were clear.—Gass (pp. 283, 284). being compelled to remain during the day at our present station we sent out some hunters in order to add something to our stock of provisions; and exposed our dryed meat to the sun and the smoke of small fires. in the evening the hunters returned having killed a duck only; they saw two bear and some of the blacktailed jumping or fallow deer, such as are found about Fort Clatsop; this kind of deer are scarce in this neighbourhood, the common longtailed fallow deer being most abundant. we have seen the black bear only in this quarter. the wind continued without intermission to blow violently all day. I took a walk today of three miles down the river; in the course of which I had an opportunity to correct an errow [error] which I have heretofore made with rispect to the shrub I have hithertoo called the large leafed thorn. the leaf of this thorn is small being only ab[o]ut 21/2 inches long, is petiolate, conjugate; the leafets are petiolate accutely pointed, having their margins cut with unequal angular insissures. the shrub which I have heretofore confounded with this grows in similar situations, has a stem precisely like it except the thorn and bears a large three loabed leaf.2 2 This briar is Rubus macropetalus, while the broad-leaved thorn is doubtless R. spectabilis.—C. V. Piper. this bryer is of the class Polyandria and order Polygynia. the flowers are single, the peduncle long and celindric. the calix is a perianth, of one leaf, five cleft &amp; accutely pointed. the perianth is proper, erect, inferior with rispect to both petals and germen, and equal. the corolla consists of five accute pale scarlet petals, insirted in the recepticle with a short and narrow claw, the Corolla is smooth, moderately long, situated at the base of the germen, permanent, and cup shaped. of the stamens the filaments are subulate, inserted into the recepticle, unequal and bent inwards concealing the pistillum; anther two loabed and inflected situated on the top of the fillaments of the pistillum the germ is conical, imbricated, superior, sessile and short. the styles are short with rispect to the stamen, capillary smooth, obtuse, distributed over the serface of the germ and deciduous. no perseptable stigma. late at night the centinel detected an old indian man in attempting to creep into camp in order to pilfer; he allarmed the indian very much by presenting his gun at him; he gave the fellow a few stripes with a switch and sent him off. this fellow is one of a party of six who layed incamped a few hundred yards below us, they departed soon after this occurrence. [Clark:] Tuesday April 8th. 1806 This morning about day light I heard a considerable roreing like wind at a distance and in the course of a short time wavs rose very high which appeared to come across the river and in the course of an hour became so high that we were obliged to unload the canoes, at 7 oClock A.M. the winds swelded and blew so hard and raised the waves so emensely high from the N.E. and tossed our canoes against the shore in such a manner as to render it necessary to haul them up on the bank. finding from the appearance of the winds that it is probable that we may be detained all day, we sent out Drewyer, Shannon, Colter &amp; Collins to hunt with derections to return if the wind should lul, if not to continue the hunt all day except they killed Elk or bear sooner &amp;c. we had the dried meat which was cured at our last encampment below exposed to the sun. John Shields cut out my small rifle &amp; brought hir to shoot very well. the party ows much to the injinuity of this man, by whome their guns are repared when they get out of order which is very often. I observed an Indian woman who visited us yesterday blind of an eye, and a man who was nearly blind of both eyes. the loss of sight I have observed to be more common among all the nations inhabiting this river than among any people I ever observed. they have almost invariably sore eyes at all stages of life. the loss of an eye is very common among them; blindness in persons of middle age is by no means uncommon, and it is almost invariably a concammitant of old age. I know not to what cause to attribute this prevalent deficientcy of the eye except it be their exposure to the reflection of the sun on the water to which they are constantly exposed in the occupation of fishing. about 1 P M Collins Shannon and Colter returned. Collins saw 2 bear but could not get a shot at them. neither Shannon nor Colter saw anything worth shooting. Soon after Drewyer returned haveing only a Summer Duck. the Elk is gone to the mountains as the hunters Suppose. in the evening late an old man his Son &amp; Grand Son and their wives &amp;c. came down dureing the time the waves raged with great fury. the wife of the grandson is a woman of differant appearance from any we have seen on this river, [s]he has a very round head and pierceing black eyes. Soon after those people arived the old man was detected in stealing a spoon and he was ordered away, at about 200 yards below our camp they built themselves a fire and did not return to our fires after. The wind continued violently hard all day, and threw our canoes with such force against the shore that one of them split before we could get it out [Lewis:] Wednesday April 9th. 1806. This morning early we commenced the operation of reloading our canoes; at 7 A.M. we departed and proceeded on to the Camp of Reubin and Joseph Fields they had not killed any game; we made no halt at this place but continued our rout to the Wah-clel-lah Village which is situated on the North side of the river about a mile below the beacon rock; here we halted and took breakfast. John Colter one of our party observed the tomehawk in one of the lodges which had been stolen from us on the 4th of November last as we decended this river; the natives attempted to wrest the tomahawk from him but he retained it. they indeavoured afterwards to exculpate themselves from the odium of having stolen it, they alledged that they had bought it from the natives below; but their neighbours had several days previously, informed us that these people had stolen the Tommehawk and then had it at their village. this village appears to be the winter station of the Wah-clel-lahs and Clahclellars,1 1 See our vol. iii, p. 189, for this village. These two tribes were of the Shahala nation.—Ed. the greater part of the former have lately removed to the falls of the Multnomah, and the latter have established themselves a few miles above on the North side of the river opposite the lower point of brant island, being the commencement of the rapids, here they also take their salmon; they are now in the act of removing, and not only take with them their furniture and effects but also the bark and most of the boards which formed their houses 14 houses remain entire but are at this time but thinly inhabited, nine others appear to have been lately removed, and the traces of ten or twelve others of ancient date were to be seen in the rear of their present village. they sometimes sink their houses in the earth, and at other times have their floors level with the surface of the earth; they are generally built with boards and covered with Cedar bark. most of them have a devision in their houses near the entrance w[h]ich is at the end or in the event of it's b[e]ing a double house is from the center of a narrow passage. several families inhabit one appartment. the women of these people pierce the cartelage of the nose in which they wear various ornaments in other rispects they do not differ from those in the neighbourhood of the Diamond island, tho' most of the women brad their hair which hanges in two tresses one hanging over each ear. these people were very unfriendly, and seemed illy disposed had our numbers not detered them [from] any acts of violence, with some difficulty we obtained five dogs from them and a few wappetoe. on our way to this village we passed several beautifull cascades1 1 The most noted and most beautiful of these is Multnomah Falls, which is variously estimated as 600 to 800 feet in height. In its vicinity are numerous other cascades, the most noted of which are Bridal Veil, Latourelle, Horse Tail, and Oneonta.—Ed. which fell from a great hight over the stupendious rocks which closes the river on both sides nearly, except a small bottom on the South side in which our hunters were encamped. the most remarkable of these casscades falls about 300 feet perpendicularly over a solid rock into a narrow bottom of the river on the south side. it is a large creek, situated about 5 miles above our encampment of the last evening. several small streams fall from a much greater hight, and in their decent become a perfect mist which collecting on the rocks below again become visible and decend a second time in the same manner before they reach the base of the rocks, the hills have now become mountains high on each side are rocky steep and covered generally with fir and white cedar. we saw some turkey buzzards this morning of the speceis common to the United states which are the first we have seen on this side the rocky mountains. during our halt at this village the grand Cheif and two inferior Cheifs of the Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw nation arrived with several men and women of their nation in two large canoes. these people were on their return up the river, having been on a trading voyage to the Columbean vally, and were loaded with wappetoe dryed anchovies, with some beads &amp;c. which they had received in exchange for dryed and pounded salmon shappelell beargrass &amp;c. These people had been very kind to us as we decended the river we therefore smoked with them and treated them with every attention, at 2 P.M. we renewed our voyage; passed under the beacon rock on the north side, to the left of two small islands situated near the shore. at four P.M. we arrived at the Clah-clel-lah village; here we found the natives busily engaged in erecting their new habitations, which appear to be reather of a temperary kind; it is most probable that they only reside here during the salmon season. we purchased two dogs of these people who like those of the village b[e]low were but sulky and illy disposed; they are great rogues and we are obliged to keep them at a proper distance from our baggage, as we could not ascend the rapid by the North side of the river with our large canoes, we passed to the opposite side and entered the narrow channel which seperates brant Island from the South shore; the evening being far spent and the wind high raining and very cold we thought best not to attempt the rapids this evening, we therefore sought a safe harbour in this narrow channel and encamped on the main shore. our small canoe with Drewer and the two feildses was unable to pass the river with us in consequence of the waves they therefore toed her up along the N. side of the river and encamped opposite the upper point of brant Island. after halting this evening I took a turn with my gun in order to kill a deer, but was unsuccessfull. I saw much fresh sign, the fir has been lately injured by a fire near this place and many of them have discharged considerable quantities of rozin. we directed that Collins should hunt a few hours tomorrow morning and that Gibson and his crew should remain at this place untill we returned and employ themselves in collecting rozin which our canoes are now in want of. [Clark:] Wednesday April 9th. 1806 last night at a late hour the old amsiated [emaciated?] Indian who was detected in stealing a Spoon yesterday, crept upon his belley with his hands and feet, with a view as I suppose to take some of our baggage which was in several defferent parcels on the bank, the Sentinal observed the motions of this old amcinated retch untill he got with[in] a fiew feet of the baggage at [that] he hailed him and approached with his gun in a possion [position] as if going to shoote which allarmed the old retch in such a manner that he ran with all his powers tumbleing over brush and every thing in his way. at 7 A. M. we set out and proceeded on to the camp of Joseph &amp; Reubin Fields, they had killed nothing, here we did not delay but proceeded on to Wah-clel-lah Village on the North side and brackfast here one of the men Colter observed the Toma-hawk which was stolen from [me] on the 4th. of Novr. last as we decended the Columbia, he took the tomahawk the natives attempted to wrest it from him, he held fast the Tomahawk. Those people attempted to excuse themselves from odium of stealing it, by makeing signs that they had purchased the Tomahawk, but their n[e]ighbours informed me otherwise and made signs that they had taken it. This village appears to be the wintering station of two bands of the Shah-ha-la Nation. One band has already moved [to] the Falls of the Multnomah which is the place they take their Salmon. The other band is now moveing a fiew miles above to the foot of the first rapid on this river, at which place they take their salmon. 14 houses only appear occupied and the inhabitants of those moveing off hourly, they take with them in their canoes independent of all their household effects the bark of their houses, and boards. 9 houses has been latterly abandened and 14 others is yet thinly inhabited at present, and the remains of 10 or 12 others are to be seen and appears to have been enhabited last fall. those people were not hospita[b]l[e] and with some dificuelty we precured 5 dogs and a fiew Wappato of them, soon after we arived at this village the Grand Chief and two others of the Chee-luck-kit-le-quaw Nation arived from below. they had with them 11 men and 7 womin and had been trading in the Columbia Vally for Wappato, beeds and dried anchovies &amp;c. in exchange for which they had given pounded fish shappalell, beargrass, acorns boiled berries &amp;c. &amp;c. and are now on their return to their village. as those people had been very kind to us as we decended the river we gave them smoke. at 2 oClock P. M. we set out and passed under the Beacon rock on the North Side of two small Islds. situated nearest the N. side. at 4 P. M. we arived at the first rapid at the head of Strawberry island at which place on the N W. Side of the Columbia here we found the nativs from the last village rebuilding their habitations of the bark of their old village 16 Huts are already compleated and appear only temporrary it is most probable that they only reside here dureing the season of the Salmon. as we could not pass with the large canoes up the N.W. Side for the rocks, the wind high and a rainey disagreeable evining. our smallest canoe being too low to cross through the high waves, we sent her up on the N W. Side with Drewyer and the two Fields and after purchaseing 2 dogs crossed and into the sluce of a large high Island seperated from the S.E. Side by a narrow chanel. in this chanel we found a good harbor and encamped on the lower side. we saw some deer sign and [sent] Collins to hunt in the morning untill the canoes were toed above the rapid. made 16 miles to day. evening wet &amp; disagreeable [Lewis:] Thursday April 10th. 1806. We set out early and droped down the channel to the lower end of brant Island from whence we drew them up the rapid by a cord about a quarter of a mile which we soon performed; Collins and Gibson not having yet come over we directed Sergt Pryor to remain with the cord on the Island untill Gibson arrived and assist him with his crew in geting his canoe up the rapid, when they were to join us on the oposite side at a small village of six houses of the Clah-clah′-lahs where we halted for breakfast. in passing the river which is here about 400 yds. wide the rapidity of the currant was such that it boar us down a considerable distance notwithstanding we employed five oars. on entering one of these lodges, the natives offered us a sheepskin for sail, than which nothing could have been more acceptable except the animal itself. the skin of the head of the sheep with the horns remaining was cased in such manner as to fit the head of a man by whom it was woarn and highly prized as an ornament. we obtained this cap in exchange for a knife, and were compelled to give two Elkskins in exchange for the skin. this appeared to be the skin of a sheep not fully grown; the horns were about four inches long, celindric, smooth, black, erect and pointed; they rise from the middle of the forehead a little above the eyes, they offered us a second skin of a full grown sheep which was quite as large as that of a common deer. they discovered our anxity to purchase and in order to extort a great price declared that they prized it too much to dispose of it. in expectation of finding some others of a similar kind for sale among the natives of this neighbourhood I would not offer him a greater price than had been given for the other which he refused. these people informed us that these sheep were found in great abundance on the hights and among the clifts of the adjacent mountains. and that they had lately killed these two from a herd of 36, at no great distance from their village. we could obtain no provision from those people except four white salmon trout. at ten oclock Sergt. Pryor and Gibson joined us with Collins who had killed 3 deer. these were all of the blacktailed fallow kind. we set out and continued our rout up the N. side of the river with great difficulty in consequence of the rapidity of the current and the large rocks which form this shore; the South side of the river is impassable.1 1 Until recent years the Cascades blocked continuous navigation to the Dalles on the upper river; but after fifteen years or more of work, and an expenditure of between three and four million dollars, there is now in operation a lock at the Cascades through which steamers pass with but little loss of time. For account of the improvements in the river, rendering its navigation possible, see Report of Board of Engineers, April 12, 1893 (53rd Congress, 1st Sess., Senate Ex. Doc. No. 7), and the Annual Reports (especially for 1900) of the Chief of Engineers.—Ed. as we had but one sufficient toe-rope and were obliged to employ the cord in geting on our canoes the greater part of the way we could only take them one at a time which retarded our progress very much. by evening we arrived at the portage on the North side where we landed and conveyed our bagage to the top of the hill about 200 paces distant where we formed a camp. we had the canoes drawn on shore and secured. the small canoe got loose from the hunters and went a drift with a tin vessel and tommahawk in her; the Indians caught her at the last village and brought her up to us this evening for which service we gave them a couple of knives; the canoe overset and lost the articles which were in her. saw the white pine at this place. [Clark:] Thursday April 10th. 1806 Collins went out in the bottom to hunt agreeable to the order of last evening and gibsons crew was derected to delay for Collins dureing which time they were derected to collect rozin from the pines in the bottom near our camp at 6 A M we set out and proceeded to the lower point of the Island from whence we were compelled to draw our canoes up a rapid for about 1/4 mile which we soon performed. Collins &amp; gibson haveing not yet come over we derected Serjt. Pryor to delay on the Island untill Gibson come over &amp; assist him with the large toe roap which we also left and to join us at a village of four houses of the Clah-lah-lar Tribe which is opposit to this Island on North Side at which place we intend to brackfast. in crossing the river which at this place is not more than 400 yards wide we fell down a great distance owing to the rapidity of the current. I entered one of the houses of those people and was scercely seated before they offered me a sheep skin for sale nothing could be more acceptable except the animal itself in examoning this skin I found it was a young one, the skin of the head was cased so as to fit the head of a man and was esteemed as a great orniment and highly prised by them. we precured this cased head for a knife and the skin we were obliged to give two raw Elk skins for. Soon after they offered a large one for sale. after finding us anxious to purchase they declined selling this skin. those people informed us that they killed those animals among the rocks in the mountains under which they live; and that great numbers of those animals inhabit those mountains &amp; that the lamb was killed out of a gange of 36 at a short distance from their village. The wool of the full grown sheep, or that on the skin which we saw was much corser than that of the one which we purchased. the skin was about the size of that of a common deer. The skin we obtained appeared to be the skin of a sheep not fully grown, the wool fine, the Horns were abought 4 inches long, celindric, smooth, black, a little bending backwards and pointed; they rise from the middle of the forehard, and a little above the eyes, and appeared to possess all the marks of the common sheep as already discribed. we could precure no provisions from those people except four white Salmon trout. at 10 oClock Sergt. Pryor and Gibson joined us with Collins who had killed 3 deer. these were all of the blacktailed fallow kind. We set out and continued up on the N. Side of the river which great dificuelty in consequence of the rapidity of the current and the large rocks which forms this shore; the South Side of the river is impassable. As we had but one sufficent toe roap and were obliged to employ the cord in getting on our canoes the greater part of the way we could only take them one at a time which retarded our progress very much, by evening we arived at the portage on the N. Side where we landed and conveyed our baggage to the top of the hill about 200 paces distant where we formed a camp. We had the canoes drawn on shore and secured. the small canoe got loose from the hunters and went adrift with a tin cup &amp; a tomahawk in her; the Indians caught her at the last village and brought her up to us this evening for which we gave them two knives; the canoe overset and lost the articles which were in her. [Lewis:] Friday April 11th. 1806. As the tents and skins which covered both our men and baggage were wet with the rain which fell last evening, and as it continued still raining this morning we concluded to take our canoes first to the head of the rapids, hoping that by evening the rain would cease and afford us a fair afternoon to take our baggage over the portage. this portage is two thousand eight hundred yards along a narrow rough and slipery road.1 1 See Clark's map of The Cascades (called by him "the great shoot"), vol. iii, ante.—Ed. the duty of getting the canoes above the rapid was by mutual consent confided to my friend Capt. C. who took with him for that purpose all the party except Bratton who is yet so weak he is unable to work, three others who were lamed by various accedents and one other to cook for the party. a few men were absolutely necessary at any rate to guard our baggage from the War-clel-lars who crouded about our camp in considerable numbers. these are the greates[t] theives and scoundrels we have met with. by the evening Capt. C. took 4 of our canoes above the rapids tho' with much difficulty and labour. the canoes were much damaged by being driven against the rocks in dispite of every precaution which could be taken to prevent t. the men complained of being so much fatiegued in the evening that we posponed taking up our 5th. canoe untill tomorrow. these rapids are much worse than they were [in the] fall when we passed them,2 2 "All that the chiefs of this expedition say concerning their voyage down the Columbia goes to show that the river must have been lower in 1805 than it usually is now, or than it was in ordinary seasons twenty-five years later than Lewis and Clark descended it. . . . In easons of high water, steamers are sometimes run completely over all the dangerous places, to Celilo, at the mouth of the Des Chutes." —Bancroft, N. W. Coast, ii, p. 43. at that time there were only three difficult points within seven miles, at present the whole distance is extreemly difficult of ascent, and it would be impracticable to decend except by leting down the empty vessels by a cord and then even the wrisk would be greater than in taking them up by the same means. the water appears to be (considerably) upwards of 20 feet higher than when we decended the river. the distance by way of the river between the points of the portage is 3 Ms. many of the natives crouded about the bank of the river where the men were engaged in taking up the canoes; one of them had the insolence to cast stones down the bank at two of the men who happened to be a little detatched from the party at the time. on the return of the party in the evening from the head of the rapids they met with many of the natives on the road, who seemed but illy disposed; two of these fellows met with John Sheilds who had delayed some time in purchasing a dog and was a considerable distance behind the party on their return with Capt. C. they attempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out of the road. he had nothing to defend himself with except a large knife which he drew with an intention of puting one or both of them to death before they could get themselves in readiness to use their arrows, but discovering his design they declined the combat and instantly fled through the woods. three of this same tribe of villains the Wah-clel-lars, stole my dog this evening, and took him towards their village; I was shortly afterwards informed of this transaction by an indian who spoke the Clatsop language, (some of which we had learnt from them during the winter) and sent three men in pursuit of the theives with orders if they made the least resistence or difficulty in surrendering the dog to fire on them; they overtook these fellows or reather came within sight of them at the distance of about 2 miles; the indians discovering the party In pursuit of them left the dog and fled. they also stole an ax from us, but scarcely had it in their possession before Thompson detected them and wrest[ed] it from them. we ordered the centinel to keep them out of camp, and informed them by signs that if they made any further attempts to steal our property or insulted our men we should put them to instant death.1 1 Doubtless the expedition was protected from greater insult by its size alone. A party of fifteen traders under Alexander Stuart and James Keith were driven back from the Cascades in 1813, and several wounded. See Thwaites, Early Western Travels, vols. vi, vii.—Ed. a cheif of the Clah-clel-lah tribe informed us that there were two very bad men among the Wah-clel-lahs who had been the principal actors in these seenes of outradge of which we complained, and that it was not the wish of the nation by any means to displease us. we told him that we hoped it might be the case, but we should certainly be as good as our words if they persisted in their insolence. I am convinced that no other consideration but our number at this moment protects us. The Cheif appeared mortified at the conduct of his people, and seemed friendly disposed towards us. as he appeared to be a man of consideration and we had reason to beleive much rispected by the neighbouring tribes we thought it well to bestoe a medal of small size upon him. he appeared much gratifyed with this mark of distinction, and some little attention which we showed him. he had in his possession a very good pipe tomahawk which he informed us he had received as a present from a trader who visited him last winter over land pointing to the N.W., whome he called Swippeton; he was pleased with the tommahawk of Capt. C. in consequence of it's having a brass bowl and Capt. C. gratified him by an exchange. as a further proof of his being esteemed by this white trader, he gave us a well baked Saylor's bisquit which he also informed us he had received from Swippeton. from these evidences I have no doubt but the traders who winter in some of the inlets to the N. of us visit this part of the Columbia by land at certain seasons, most probably when they are confined to their winter harbour, and if so some of those inlets are probably at no great distance from this place, as there seems to be but little inducement to intice the trader hither from any considerable distance particularly as the difficulty in traveling on the borders of this mountainous country must be great at that season as the natives informed me their snows were frequently breast deep. I observe snow-shoes in all the lodges of the natives above the Columbean vally. I hope that the friendly interposition of this chief may prevent our being compelled to use some violence with these people; our men seem well disposed to kill a few of them. we keep ourselves perefectly on our guard. This evening we send Drewyer and the two Feildses on a few miles up the river to the entrance of Cruzatt's river to hunt untill our arrival. The inhabitants of the Y-eh-huh Village on the North side immediately above the rapids have lately removed to the opposite side of the river, where it appears they usually take their salmon. like their relations the Wah-Clel-lars they have taken their houses with them. I observe that all the houses lately established have their floors on the surface of the ear[th], are smaller and of more temperary structure than those which are sunk in the ground. I presume the former are their spring and Summer dwellings and the latter those of the fall and winter. these houses are most generally built with boards and covered with bark. some of an inferior ore more temperary cast are built entirely of cedar bark, which is kept smooth and extended by inserting small splinters of wood through the bark crosswise at the distance of 12 or 14 inches assunder. several families inhabit the same appartment. their women as well as those of the 3 villages next below us pierce the cartelage of the nose and insert various ornaments. they very seldom imprint any figures on their skins; a few I observed had one or two longitudinal lines of dots on the front of the leg, reaching from the ankle upwards about midleg. most of their women braid their hair in two tresses as before mentioned. the men usually cew their hair in two parsels which like the braded tresses of the female hang over each ear in front of the sholder, and gives an additional width to the head and face so much admired by them. these cews are usually formed with throngs of dressed Otterskin crossing each other and not roled in our manner arrond the hair. in all other rispects I observe no difference in their dress habits manners &amp;c. from those in the Neighbourhood of the diamond Island. today we recognized a man of the Elute nation who reside at the long narrows of the Columbia, he was on his return from a trading voyage to the Columbean valley with 10 or 12 others of his nation. many other natives from the village above were employed in taking their roots &amp;c. over the portage on their return. I observed that the men equally with the women engage in the labour of carrying. they all left their canoes below the rapids and took others above which they had left as they decended. those which were left below were taken down the river by the persons from whom they had been hired or borrowed. the natives from above behaved themselves in a very orderly manner. The salmon have not yet made their appearance, tho' the natives are not so much distressed for food as I was induced to believe. I walked down today about 3/4 of a mile below our encampment to observe the manner in which these people inter their dead. I found eight sepulchers near the north bank of the river built in the following manner. four strong forks are first sunk several feet in the ground and rise about six feet high, forming a parrallelogram of 8 by 10 feet. the intervals between these upright forks, on which four poles are laid, are filled up with broad erect boards with their lower ends sunk in the ground and their upper ends confined to the horizontal poles, a flat roof is formed of several layers of boards; the floors of these sepulchres are on a level with the surface of the earth. the human bodies are well rolled in dressed skins and lashed securely with chords and laid horizontaly on the back with the head to the west, in some of these sepulchres they are laid on each other to the debth of three or four bodies, in one of those sepulchres which was nearly decayed I observed that the human bones filled it perfectly to the hight of about three feet. many articles appear to be sacrificed to the dead both within and without the sepulcres. among other articles, I observed a brass teakettle, some scollep shells, parts of several robes of cloth and skins, with sticks for diging roots &amp;c. this appears to be the burying ground of the Wahclellahs, Clahclellahs and Yehhuhs. [Clark:] Friday April 11th. 1806. rained the greater part of the last night and continued to rain this morning, as the skins and the covering of both the mend [men] and loading were wet we determined to take the canoes over first in hopes that by the evening the rain would sease and afford us a fair afternoon to carry our baggage over the portage which is 2 miles by land and a slipery road. I therefore took all the men except three who had sore feet and two to cook, and who were with the baggage; and with great dificuelty and much fatigue we drew up 4 of our canoes above the Rapids 3 miles in extent. the men became so fatigued that we deturmined to puspone takeing the 5th. canoe untill tomorrow. Those rapids are much worse than they were at the time we passed last fall at that time there was only three bad places in the distance of 7 miles. at this time the whole distance is a rapid and dificuelt of assent; and would be very dangerous at this stage of the water (which is [blank space in MS.] feet higher than when we passed down) to decent in any kind of craft. Great numbers of the nativs visited us and viewed us from the banks as we passed on with the canoes, maney of those people were also about our baggage and on the portage road. two of those fellows insulted John Shields who had delayed in purchaseing a dog at the upper part of the rapids and was some distance behind myself and the party on our return to camp. they attempted to take his dog and push him out of the road. he had nothing to defend himself except a large knife which he drew with a full deturmmation to pit [put] one of them to death before he had an oppertunity of dischargeing his arrow. the nativs observeing his motion ran off. one other Indn. stold an ax and was not in possession before he was detected by Thompson and the ax taken from him. one other fellow attempted to steal Capt. Lewis's dog, and had decoyed him nearly half a mile we were informed of it by a man who spoke the Clatsop language and imediately sent three men with their guns who over took the Indians, who on their approach ran off and left the dog. we informed the nativ's by signs that if the indians insulted our men or stold our property we should certainly put them to death a Chief of the Clah-clal-lahs Tribe informed us that there was two very bad men who had been guilty of those mischevious acts. that it was not the wish of their tribe that any thing should be done which might displese the white people. this Chief had a large fine pipe tomahawk which he informed me he got from a Trader he called Swippeton. I exchanged tomahawks with this Chief, and as he appeared to be a man of consideration among the tribes of this neighbourhood and much conserned for the ingiries offered us, we gave him a medal of the small size which appeared to please him verry much, and will I hope have a favourable tendency, in as much as it will attach him to our interest, and he probably will harang his people in our favour, which may prevent any acts of violence being commited, on either side. nothing but the strength of our party has prevented our being robed before this time. Sent Drewyer &amp; 2 Fields on a head to hunt. The inhabitents of the Wy-ach-hich Tribe village imedeately above those rapids on the N W. Side have latterly moved their village to the opposit side of the river, where they take their Salmon; they are now in the act of removeing and not only take their furniture and effects but also the bark and most of the boards which formed their houses. Those like the tribes below sometimes sink their houses in the earth, and at other times have their flours leavel with the surface of the earth; they are Generally built of boards and covered with bark. those which appear intended for temporary use are most generally built of the white cedar bark. Most of those have a division in the houses near the enterance which is at the end, or in the event of it's being a double house is from the center of a narrow passage. Several families enhabit one appartment. the women of those people as well as those in the 3 villages below pierce the cartilage of the nose in which they ware various orniments. in other respects they do not differ from those of the Dimond Island, tho' most of the women brad their hair which hangs in two tresses, one hanging over each ear. The young men of all those tribes ware their hair plated, in two plats [h]anging over each sholder, maney of them also cew their hair with otter skin divided on the crown of the head and hanging over each ear. to day I recognized a man of the Elute nation who reside at the great Long narrows, he was on his return from a tradeing voyage to the Columbian Vally with 10 or 12 of his tribe. maney others from the villages above this were takeing their roots &amp;c. over the portage to day on their return home. vegitation is rapidly progressing. sarvis berry, sackacommis and the large leafed ash is in blume. also fir No. [blank space in MS.] in bloom [Lewis:] Saturday April 12th. 1806. It rained the greater part of last night and still continued to rain this morning. I therefore determined to take up the remaining perogue this morning for which purpose I took with me every man that could be of any service. a small distance above our camp there is one of the most difficult parts of the rapid. at this place the current sets with great violence against a projecting rock. in hawling the perogue arround this point the bow unfortunately took the current at too great a distance from the rock, she turned her side to the stream and the utmost exertions of all the party were unable to resist the forse with which she was driven by the current, they were compelled to let loose the cord and of course both perogue and cord went adrift with the stream. the loss of this perogue will I fear compell us to purchase one or more canoes of the indians at an extravegant price. after breakfast all hands were employed in taking our baggage over the portage. we caused all the men who had short rifles to carry them, in order to be prepared for the natives should they make any attempts to rob or injure them. I went up to the head of the rapids and left Capt. C. below. during the day I obtained a vocabulary of the language of the War-clel-lars &amp;c. I found that their numbers were precisely those of the Chinnooks but the other parts of their language essentially different. by 5 P.M. we had brought up all our baggage and Capt. C. joined me from the lower camp with the Clahclellah cheif. there is an old village situated about halfway on the portage road; the fraim of the houses, which are remarkably large, [one 160 by 45 feet,] remain almost entire. the covering of the houses appears to have been sunk in a pond back of the village. this the chief informed us was the residence occasionally of his tribe. these houses are fraimed in the usual manner but consist of a double set as if oune house had been built within the other. the floors are on a level with the ground. the natives did not croud about us in such numbers today as yesterday, and behaved themselves much better; no doubt the precautions which they observed us take had a good effect. I employed Sergt. Pryor the greater part of the day in reparing and corking the perogue and canoes. it continued to rain by showers all day. about 20 of the Y-eh-huhs remained with me the greater part of the day and departed in the evening. they conducted themselves with much propryety and contemned the conduct of their relations towards us. We purchased one sheepskin for which we gave the skin of an Elk and one of a deer. this animal was killed by the man who sold us the skin near this place; he informed us that they were abundant among the mountains and usually resorted [to] the rocky parts. the big horned animal is also an inhabitant of these mountains. I saw several robes of their skins among the natives, as the evening was rainy cold and far advanced and ourselves wet we determined to remain all night. the mountains are high steep and rocky. the rock is principally black. they are covered with fir of several speceis and the white cedar. near the river we find the Cottonwood, sweet willow, broad leafed ash, a species of maple, the purple haw, a small speceis of cherry; purple currant, goosberry, red willow, vining and whiteburry honeysuckle, huckleburry,. sacacommis, two speceis of mountain holley, &amp; common ash.1 1 Most of these plants have already been identified. The purple haw is probably Crataegus douglasii; the cherry, Prunus emarginata, Dougl. The two species of mountain holly are Berberis aquifolium and B. nervosa. See pp. 61, 62, ante.— C. V. Piper. for the three last days this inclusive we have made only 7 miles. [Clark:] Saturday April 12th. 1806. rained the greater part of the last night and this morning untill 10 A.M. we employed all hands in attempting to take up the last canoe. in attempting to pass by a rock against which the current run with emence force, the bow unfortunately took the current at too great a distance from the rock, she turned broad side to the stream, and the exertions of every man was not sufficient to hold her. the men were compelled to let go the rope and both the canoe and rope went with the stream. the loss of this canoe will I fear compell us to purchase another at an extravigent price. after brackfast all hands who were employed in carrying the baggage over the portage 11/2 miles which they performed by 4 P.M. the nativs did not visit us in such crowds to day as yesterday, we caused all the men of the party who had Short guns to carry them on the portage for fear of some attempt on the part of the nativs to rob the party. The rain continued at intervales all day. in the evening after everything was taken from the lower camp I set out myself accompanied by the Chief of the Clah-clal-lars to the head of the portage, as we passed the remains of an old village about half way the portage, this chief informed me that this old village had been the residence of his Tribe dureing the last Salmon Season. this village I mentioned in decending this river, but did not know the Tribe that had inhabited it that time. Capt. Lewis took a vocabulary of the langu[a]ge of those people whilst I had all the baggage taken across the portage &amp; we formed a camp at the place we had encamped on our way down. at my arival at the head of the portage found about 20 of the natives of the Wy-ach-hich tribe who reside above the rapids, with Capt. Lewis. those people appeared much better disposed towards us than either the Clahclallah or Wahclellah and condemn their conduct much. Those tribes I believe to be all the same Nation their Language habits manners dress &amp;c. are presisely alike and differ but little from those below the Great Narrows of this river. I observed a woman with a Sheep Skin robe on which I purchased for one Elk and one deer skin. the father of this woman informed me that he had killed the animal off of which he had taken this skin on the mountains imediately above his village, and that on those mountains great numbers of those animals were to be found in large flocks among the steep rocks. I also purchased 2 pieces of Chapellell and some roots of those people. as the evening was rainey and ourselves and party wet we concluded to delay untill the morning and dry our selves. The Indians left us about 6 PM and returned to their village on the opposit side. Mountains are high on each side and covered with snow for about 1/3 of the way down. the growth is principally fir and white cedar. the bottoms and low situations is covered with a variety such as cotton, large leafed ash, sweet willow a species of beech, alder, white thorn, cherry of a small species, Servis berry bushes, Huckleberries bushes, a species of Lorel &amp;c. &amp;c. I saw a turkey buzzard which is the 3rd. which I have seen west of the rocky mountains. the 1st. was on the 7 instt. above quick sand river. for the three last days this inclusive we have made 7 miles only. [Lewis:] Sunday April 13th. 1806. The loss of one of our perogues rendered it necessary to distribute her crew and cargo among the 2 remaining perogues and 2 canoes, which being done we loaded and set out [at] 8 A.M. we passed the village immediately above the rapids where only one house at present remains entire, the other 8 having been taken down and removed to the oposite side of the river as before mentioned. we found the additional laiding which we had been compelled to put on board rendered our vessels extreemly inconvenient to mannage and in short reather unsafe in the event of high winds; I therefore left Capt. C. with the two perogues to proceede up the river on the N. side, and with the two canoes and some additional hands passed over the river above the rapids to the Y-eh-huh village in order to purchase one or more canoes. I found the village consisting of 11 houses crouded with inhabitants; it appeared to me that they could have mustered about 60 fighting men then present. they appeared very friendly disposed, and I soon obtained two small canoes from them for which I gave two robes and four elkskins. I also purchased four paddles and three dogs from them with deerskins. the dog now constitutes a considerable part of our subsistence and with most of the party has become a favorite food; certain I am that it is a healthy strong diet, and from habit it has become by no means disagreeable to me, I prefer it to lean venison or Elk, and it is very far superior to the horse in any state. after remaining about 2 hours at this Village I departed and continued my rout with the four canoes along the S. side of the river the wind being too high to pass over to the entrance of Cruzatts [Wind] river where I expected to have overtaken Capt. C. not seing the perogues on the opposite side I ascended the river untill one oclock or about 5 ms. above the entrance of Cruzat's river. being convinced that the perogues were behind I halted and directed the men to dress the dogs and cook one of them for dinner; a little before we had completed our meal Capt. C. arrived with the perogues and landed opposite to us. after dinner I passed the river to the perogues and found that Capt. C. had halted for the evening and was himself hunting with three of the party. the men informed me that they had seen nothing of the hunters whom we had sent on the 11th ints. to the Entrance of Cruzatt's Riv. I directed Sergt. ordway to take the two small canoes for his mess and the loading which he had formerly carried in the perogue we lost yesterday, and to have them dryed this evening and payed with rozin. Capt. Clark returned in about an hour and being convinced that the hunters were yet behind we dispatched Sergt. Pryor in surch of them with two men and an empty canoe to bring the meat they may have killed. John Sheilds returned a little after six P.M. with two deer which he had killed. these were also of the blacktailed fallow deer; there appears to be no other speceis of deer in these mountains. Capt. C. informed me that the wind had detained him several hours a little above Cruzatt's river; that while detained here he sent out some men to hunt; one of them wounded two deer but got neither of them. the wind having lulled in the evening and not seing anything of Drewyer and the Feildses he had proceeded on to this place where he intended waiting for me, and as he did not see my canoes when he landed had taken a hunt with some of the men as before mentioned. [Clark:] Sunday April 13th 1806 The loss of one of our large canoes rendered it necessary to divide the loading and men of that canoe between the remaining four, which was done and we loaded and set out at 8 oClock A.M. passed the village imediately above the rapids, where only one house remains entire the other 8 haveing been taken down and moved to the opposit side of the Columbia as already mentioned. the additional men and baggage in each canoe renders them crouded and unsafe. Capt. Lewis with 2 of the smallest canoes of Sergt. Pryor &amp; gibson and crossed above the Rapids to the village on the S E side with a view to purchase a canoe of the nativs if possible. he took with him some cloth and a fiew Elk skins and Deer skins. I with the two large canoes proceede on up the N. W. Side with the intention of gitting to the Encampment of our hunters who was directed to hunt in the bottom above Crusats River, and there wait the arrival of Capt. Lewis. I proceeded on to the bottom in which I expected to find the hunters but could see nothing of them. the wind rose and raised the wavs to such a hight that I could not proceed any further. we landed and I sent out Shields and Colter to hunt, Shields shot two deer but could get neither of them. I walked to Crusats river and up it 1/2 a mile on my return to the party found that the wind had lulled and as we could see nothing of our hunters, I determined to proceed on to the next bottom where I thought it probable they had halted at 1/2 passed 2 P M set out and proceeded on to the bottom 6 miles and halted at the next bottom formed a camp and sent out all the hunters. I also walked out my self on the hills but saw nothing, on my return found Capt. Lewis at camp with two canoes which he had purchased at the Y-ep-huh village for two robes and four elkskins. he also purchased 4 paddles and three Dogs from the nativs with deer skins, the dogs now constitutes a considerable part of our Subsistance &amp; with most of the party has become a favourable food. Certain I am that [it] is a helthy strong diet, derected Serjt. ordway to take the 2 small canoes purchased by Capt. Lewis for his mess and the loading he had in his canoe which we lost yesterday, and drawed up and paid with rozin. I was convinced that the hunters must have been up River Cruzatt. despatched Sergt. Pryor with 2 men in a canoe, with directions to assend crusats river and if he found the hunters to assist them in with the meat. Jo: Shields returned about sunset with two deer which he had killed, those were of the Black tail fallow Deer. there appears to be no other species of Deer in those mountains. we proceeded on 12 miles. [Lewis:] Monday April 14th. 1806. This morning at seven OCk. we were joined by Sergt. Pryor and the three hunters they brought with them 4 deer which Drewyer had killed yesterday, we took breakfast and departed. at 9 A.M. the wind arrose and continued hard all day but not so violent as to prevent our proceeding, we kept close along the N. shore all day. the river from the rapids as high as the commencement of the narrows is from 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile in width, and possesses scarcely any current. the bed is principally rock except at the entrance of Labuish's river which heads in Mount hood and like the quicksand river brings down from thence vast bodies of sand, the mountains through which the river passes nearly to the sepulchre rock, are high broken, rocky, partially covered with fir white cedar, and in many places exhibit very romantic seenes. some handsome cascades are seen on either hand tumbling from the stupendious rocks of the mountains into the river. near the border of the river I observed today the long leafed pine, this pine increases in quantity as you ascend the river and about the sepulchre rock where the lower country commences it superceedes the fir altogether. throughout the whole course of this river from the rapids as high as the Chilluckkittequaws, we find the trunks of many large pine trees s[t]anding erect as they grew at present in 30 feet [of] water; they are much doated and none of them vegetating; at the lowest tide of the river many of these trees are in ten feet water. certain it is that those large pine trees never grew in that position, nor can I account for this phenomenon except it be that the passage of the river through the narrow pass at the rapids has been obstructed by the rocks which have fallen from the hills into that channel within the last 20 years; the appearance of the hills at that place justify this opinion, they appear constantly to be falling in, and the apparent state of the decayed trees would seem to fix the era of their decline about the time mentioned. at 1 P.M. we arrived at a large village situated in a narrow bottom on the N. side a little above the entrance of canoe creek. their houses are reather detatched and extent[d] for several miles. they are about 20 in number. These people call themselves We-ock-sock, Wil-la-cum. they differ but litt[l]e in appea[ra]nce dress &amp;c. from those of the rapids. Their men have some leging and mockersons among them. these are in the stile of [the] Chopunnish. they have some good horses of which we saw ten or a douzen. these are the fi[r]st horses we have met with since we left this neighbourhood last fall, in short the country below this place will not permit the uce of this valuable animal except in the Columbian vally and there the present inhabitants have no uce for them as they reside immediately on the river and the country is too thickly timbered to admit them to run the game with horses if they had them. we halted at this village and dined. purchased five dogs, some roots, shappalell, filberds and dryed burries of the inhabitants. here I observed several habitations entirely under grownd; they were sunk about 8 feet deep and covered with strong timber and several feet of earth in a conic form. these habitations were evacuated at present. they are about 16 feet in diameter, nearly circular, and are entered through a hole at the top which appears to answer the double purpose of a chimney and a door. from this entrance you decend to the floor by a ladder. the present habitations of these people were on the surface of the ground and do not differ from those of the tribes of the rapids. their language is the same with that of the Chilluckkittequaws. these people appeared very friendly. some of them informed us that they had lately returned from a war excurtion against the snake indians who inhabit the upper part of the Multnomah river to the S.E. of them. they call them To-wan-nah′-hi′-ooks. that they had been fortunate in their expedition and had taken from their enimies most of the horses which we saw in their possession. after dinner we pursued our voyage; Capt. Clark walked on shore with Charbono. I ascended the river about six miles at which place the river washed the base of high clifts on the Lard. side, here we halted a few minutes and were joined by Capt. C. and Charbono and proceeded on to the entrance of a small run on N. side a little below a large village on the same side opposite the sepulchre rock.1 1 Near the present town of White Salmon, Wash.—Coues (L. and C., iii, p. 677). this village can raise about an hundred fighting men they call themselves [blank space in MS.] [Smack-shops] they do not differ in any rispect from the village below. many of them visited our camp this evening and remained with us untill we went to bed. they then left us and retired to their quarters. [Clark:] Monday April 14th 1806 This morning at 7 oClock we were joined by Sgt. Pryor and they [the] three hunters they brought with them 4 deer which drewyer had killed yesterday. we took brackfast and departed at 9 A.M. the wind rose and continued to blow hard all day but not so violent as to prevent our proceeding. we kept close allong the N. Shore all day. the river from the rapids to the commencement of the narrows is from 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile in width, and possesses but little current. the bead is rock except at the enterence of Labiech's river which heads in Mt. Hood and like the quick sand River brings down from thence vast bodies of sand the mountains through which the river passes nearly to Cataract River are high broken rocky, particularly covered with fir and white cedar, and in maney places very romantic scenes. Some handsom cascades are seen on either side tumbling from the stupendious rocks of the mountains into the river. I observe near the river the long leafed Pine which increas as we assend and superseeds the fir altogether about the Supulcher rock. we find the trunks of maney large pine trees standing erect as they grew, at present in 30 feet water; they are much doated and none of them vegitateing. at the lowest water of the river maney of those trees are in 10 feet water. the cause I have attempted to account for as I decended. at 1 P M. we arrived at a large village situated in a narrow bottom on the N. Side a little above the enterance of Canoe creek. their houses are reather detached, and extend for several miles. they are about 20 in number. those people call themselves Wil-la-cum. they differ but little in appearance dress &amp;c. from those of the rapids. their men have some legins and mockersons among them. those are in the stile of Chopunnish. they have some good horses of which we saw 10 or 12 these are the first horses we have met with since we left this neighbourhood last fall in short the country below this place will not permit the use of this valuable animal except in the Columbian Vally, and there the present inhabitents have no use for them as they reside imedeately on the river and the country is too thickly timbd. we halted at this village Dined and purchased five dogs, Some roots Chappalell, Philberds [filberts] and dried berries of the inhabitants. here I observed several habitations under ground; they were sunk about 8 feet deep and covered with strong timber and several feet of earth in a conic form. those habitations are avacuated at present. they are about 16 feet diameter, nearly circular, and are entered through a hole at top which appears to answer the double purpose of chimney and a dore. from this enterance you decend to the flore by a ladder. the present habitations of those people were on the surface of the ground and do not differ from those of the tribes about the rapids. their language is the same with the Cheluckkittequaws. these people appeared very friendly. Some of them informed us that they had latterly returned from the war excurtion against the Snake Indians who inhabit the upper part of the Multnomah river to the S.E. of them they call them To wan nah hi ooks. that they had been fortunate in the expedition and had taken from their enimies most of the horses which we saw in their possession. after dinner we proceeded on our voyage. I walked on shore with Shabono on the N. Side through a handsom bottom. met several parties of women and boys in serch of herbs &amp; roots to subsist on maney of them had parcels of the stems of the sun flower. I joined Capt Lewis and the party at 6 miles, at which place the river washed the bottom of high Clifts on the N. Side. Several canoes over take us with families moveing up. we passed 3 encampments and came too in the mouth of a small creek on the N. Side imediately below a village and opposit the Sepulchar rock. this village consists of about 100 fighting men of several tribes from the plains to the north collected here waiting for the Salmon. they do not differ in any respect from those below. many of them visited our camp this evening and remained with us untill we went to bead. they then left us and returned to their quarters. made [blank space in MS.] miles. [Lewis:] Tuesday April 15th. 1806 We delayed this morning untill after breakfast in order to purchase some horses of the Indians; accordingly we exposed some articles in exchange for horses the natives were unwilling to barter, we therefore put up our merchandize and at 8 A.M. we set out. we halted a few minutes at the sepulchre rock, and examined the deposits of the ded at that place. these were constructed in the same manner of those already discribed below the rapids. some of them were more than half filled with dead bodies. there were thirteen sepulchres on this rock which stands near the center of the river and has a surface of about 2 acres above high water mark.1 1 Sepulchre Island is the best known of several islands which are formed of the lava which the waters have worn away; they are known as the Memaloose Islands— a Klikitat name signifying "the dead"—all being more or less used as places of sepulture by the Indians.—Ed. from hence we returned to the no[r]thern shore and continued up it about four miles to another village of the same nation with whom we remained last night. here we halted and informed the natives of our wish to purchase horses; the[y] produced us several for sale but would not take the articles which we had in exchange for them. they wanted an instrument which the Northwest traders call an eye-dag (a sort of war hatchet) which we had not. we procured two dogs of them and departed. a little below the entrance of Cataract river we halted at another village of the same people, at which we were equally unsuccessfull in the purchase of horses. we also halted at the two villages of the Chilluckkittequaws a few miles above with no better success. at three in the evening we arrived at the entrance of Quinnette1 1 A corruption of t'kwin'-nat, the native name, on the Columbia River, for the king salmon (Salmo quinnat).—Ed. creek which we ascended a short distance and encamped at the place we have called rockfort camp.2 2 Now Mill Creek, where is the town of The Dalles.—Ed. here we were visited by some of the people from the villages at the great narrows and falls. we informed them of our wish to purchase horses, &amp; agreed to meet them on the opposite or North side of the river tomorrow for the purpose of bartering with them. most of them returned to their villages this evening three only remained with us all night. these people are much better clad than any of the nations below; their men have generally leging mockersons and large robes. many of them wear shirts of the same form [as] those of the Chopunnish and Shoshonees highly ornamented with the quills of the porcupine as are also their mockersons and legings. they conceal the parts of generation with the skin of a fox or some other small animal drawn underneath a girdle and hanging loosly in front of them like a narrow apron. the dress of their women differs very little from those about the rapids. both men and women cut their hair in the forehead which comes down as low as the eyebrows, they have long earlocks cut square at the end. the other part of their hair is dressed in the same manner as those of the rapids. after we landed and formed our camp this evening Drewyer and some others took a hunt and killed a deer of the longtailed kind. it was a buck and the young horns had shot fourth about 2 inches. [Clark:] Tuesday April 15th. 1806 We delayed this morning untill after brackfast in order to purchase some horses of the Indians; accordingly we exposed some articles in exchange for horses the nativs were unwilling to exchange their horses, we put up our Merchandize and at 8 A M. set out, we halted a fiew minits at the Sepulchar rock and examined the deposit of the dead at that place. those were constructed in the same manner of those already described below the rapids. Some of them were more than half filled with dead bodies. there was 13 Supulchers on this rock which stands near the center of the river, and has a cerface of about two acres above the water. from here we returned to the Northern Shore and continued up it about 4 miles to a village at the enterance of Cateract river, here we halted and informed the nativs of our wish to purchase horses; the[y] produced several for sale but would not take the articles we had in exchange for them. they wanted an instriment which the North W[est] Traders call an eye dag which we had not. we precured two dogs and departed we also halted at the two villages of the Chilluckkitequaws a fiew ms. above with no better Sucksess. at 3 in the evening we arrived at the enterance of Quinnett Creek which we assended a short distance and Encamped at the place we had called rock fort camp, here we were visited by some of the people from the villages at the long narrows &amp; Falls. we informed them of our wish to purchase horses, and agreed to meet them on the opposit or north side on tomorrow for the purpose of bartering with them. most of them returned to their village this evening three only remained with us all night. those people are much better clad than the nativs below. their men have generaly Legins Mockersons &amp; large robes. maney of them were [wear] shirts of the same form of those of the Chopunnish &amp; Shoshonees highly ornamented with the quils of the purcupine, as are also their mockersons &amp; Legins. they conseal the parts of generation with the skins of the Fox or some other small animal drawn under neath a girdle and hanging loosely in front of them like a narrow apron. The dress of their women differ verry little from those about the rapids. both men &amp; women cut their hair in the forehead which comes down as low as the eyebrows, they have long ear locks cut square at the end. The other parts of their hair is dressed in the same manner as those of the rapids. after we landed and formed our camp this evening Drewyer and some others took a hunt and killed a Deer of the lo[n]g tailed kind. it was a Buck and the young Deer horns had shot forth about two inches made [blank space in MS.] miles to day. [Lewis:] Wednesday April 16th. 1806. About 8 A.M. Capt. Clark passed the river with the two interpreters, the indian woman and nine men in order to trade with the natives for their horses, for which purpose he took with him a good part of our stock of merchandize. I remained in camp; sent out the hunters very early in the morning, and set Sergts. Gass and Pryor with some others at work to make a parsel of packsaddles. twelve horses will be sufficient to transport our baggage and some pounded fish which we intend taking with us as a reserved store for the rocky mountains. I was visited today by several of the natives, and amused myself in making a collection of the esculent plants in the neighbourhood such as the Indians use, a specemine of which I preserved. I also met with sundry other plants which were strangers to me which I also preserved, among others there is a currant which is now in blume and has [a] yellow blossom something like the yellow currant of the Missouri but is a different speceis.1 1 Ribes aureum, Pursh. This specimen is still extant.—C. V. Piper. Reubin Feilds returned in the evening and brought with him a large grey squ[i]rrel and two others of a kind I had never before seen. they are a size less than the grey squirrel common to the middle atlantic states and of a pided grey and yellowish brown colour, in form it resembles our grey squ[i]rrel precisely. I had them skined leaving the head feet and tail to them and placed in the sun to dry. Joseph Feilds brought me a black pheasant which he had killed; this I found on examination to be the large black or dark brown pheasant I had met with on the upper part of the Missouri. it is as large as a well grown fowl the iris of the eye is of a dark yellowish brown, the puple black, the legs are booted to the toes, the tail is composed of 18 black feathers tiped with bluish white, of which the two in the center are reather shorter than the others which are all of the same length. over the eye there is a stripe of a 1/4 of an inch in width uncovered with feathers of a fine orrange yellow. the wide spaces void of feathers on the side of the neck are also of the same colour. I had some parts of this bird preserved. our present station is the last point at which there is a single stick of timber on the river for a great distance and is the commencement of the open plains which extend nearly to the base of the rocky Mts Labuish returned this evening having killed two deer I sent and had them brought in. this evening Capt. C. informed me by some of the men whom he sent over that that he had obtained no horses as yet of the natives. that they promised to trade with him provided he would remove to their village. to this he had consented and should proceede to the Skillute village above the long narrows as soon as the men returned whom he had sent to me for some other articles. I dispatched the men on their return to Capt. C. immediately with these articles and he set out with his party accompanyed by the natives to their village where he remained all night. the natives who had spent the day with me seemed very well disposed, they left me at 6 in the evening and returned to their rispective villages. the hunters informed me that they saw some Antelopes, &amp; the tracks of several black bear, but no appearance of any Elk. we were informed by the Indians that the river which falls in on the S. side of the Columbia just above the Eneshur village heads in Mount hood and dose not water the extensive country which we have heretofore calculated on.1 1 Des Chutes River.—Ed. a great portion of that extensive tract of country to the S. and S.W. of the Columbia and it's S.E. branch, and between the same and the waters of Callifornia must be watered by the Multnomah river.

Crossed the river and Sent Drewyer &amp; Goodrich to the Skil-lute village to envite the Indians to trade horses with us, also sent Frazer &amp; Shabono to the Che-luck-kit-ti-quar village for the same purpose a number of Indians came of both nations and delayed the greater part of the day without tradeing a single horse the Great chief of the Skillutes also came with Drewyer. he was lame and could not walk he told me if I would go to his Town, his people would trade with me. I set out late and arrived at Sunset and informed the natives that in the morning I would trade with them. he gave me onions to eate which had been Sweated. Peter played the violin and the men danced. Saw abt. 100 Stacks of fish. maney nations visit this place for trade the discription of the houses, their dress habits &amp;c. Smoked &amp;c. I saw great numbers of horses [Clark, second draft:] Wednesday April 16th 1806 About 8 oClock this morning I passed the river with the two interpreters, and nine men in order to trade with the nativs for their horses, for which purpose I took with me a good part of our stock of merchindize. Capt L. sent out the hunters and set several men at work makeing pack saddles. twelve horses will be sufficient to transport our baggage and some pounded fish with our dried Elk, which we intend takeing with us as a reserved store for the plains &amp; rocky mountains. I formed a Camp on the N. Side and sent Drewyer &amp; Goodrich to the Skillute Village. and Shabono &amp; Frazer down to the Chilluckkitequaw Village with derections to inform the nativs that I had crossed the river for the purpose of purchaseing horses, and if they had horses to sell us to bring them to my camp. Great numbers of Indians came from both villages and delayed the greater part of the day without tradeing a single horse. Drewyer returned with the principal Chief of the Skillutes who was lame and could not walk. after his arival some horses were offered for sale, but they asked nearly half the merchindize I had with me for one horse. this price I could not think of giveing. the Chief informed me if I would go to his town with him, his people would sell me horses. I therefore concluded to accompany him to his village 7 miles distant. we set out and arrived at the village at Sunset. after some serimony I entered the house of the Chief. I then informed them that I would trade with them for their horses in the morning for which I would give for each horse the articles which I had offered yesterd[ay]. The Chief set before me a large platter of onions which had been sweeted [sweated]. I gave a part of those onions to all my party and we all eate of them, in this state the root is very sweet and the tops tender. the nativs requested the party to dance which they very readily consented and Peter Cruzat played on the violin and the men danced several dances &amp; retired to rest in the houses of the 1st. and second Chief. this village is moved about 300 yards below the spot it stood last fall at the time we passed down. they were all above grown[d] and built in the same form of those below already described. We observed maney stacks of fish remaining untouched on either side of the river. The Inhabitents of this village ware the robe of deer Elk Goat &amp;c. and most of the men ware Legins and Mockersons and shirts highly ornimented with Porcupine quills &amp; beeds. the women were the Truss most commonly, tho some of them have long shirts all of those articles they precure from other nations who visit them for the purpose of exchangeing those articles for their pounded fish of which they prepare great quantities. This is the great mart of all this country. ten different tribes who reside on Taptate and Catteract River visit those people for the purpose of purchaseing their fish, and the Indians on the Columbia and Lewis's river quite to the Chopunnish Nation visit them for the purpose of tradeing horses buffalow robes for beeds, and such articles as they have not. The Skillutes precure the most of their cloth knivs axes &amp; beeds from the Indians from the North of them who trade with white people who come into the inlets to the North at no great distance from the Tapteet. their horses of which I saw great numbers, they precure from the Indians who reside on the banks of the Columbia above, and what fiew they take from the Towarnihiooks or Snake Indians. I smoked with all the principal men of this nation in the house of their great Chief and lay my self down on a mat to sleep but was prevented by the mice and vermin with which this house abounded and which was very troublesom to me. [Lewis:] Thursday April 17th. 1806. This morning early I sent out the hunters, and set several additional hands about the packsaddles. I find that the sturgeon is not taken by any of the natives above the Columbean valley. the inhabitants of the rapids at this time take a few of the white salmon trout and considerable quantities of a small indifferent mullet on which they principally subsist. I have seen none except dryed fish of the last season in the possession of the people above that place, they subsist on roots principally with some dryed and pounded fish. the salmon not having made their appearance proves a serious inconvenience to us. but few of the natives visited my camp today and those only remained a few hours. even at this place which is merely on the border of the plains of Columbia the climate seems to have changed the air feels dryer and more pure. the earth is dry and seems as if there had been no rain for a week or ten days. the plain is covered with a rich virdure of grass and herbs from four to nine inches high and exhibits a beautifull seen particularly pleasing after having been so long imprisoned in mountains and those almost impenetrably thick forrests of the seacoast. Joseph Feilds brought me today three eggs of the party coloured corvus,1 1 The common magpie (Pica pica hudsonika) Coues (L. and C., iii, p. 953). they are about the size and shape of those of the pigeon. they are bluish white much freckled with dark redish brown irregular spots, in short it is reather a mixture of those colours in which the redish brown predominates, particularly towards the larger end. This evening Willard and Cruzatte returned from Capt. Clark and brought me a note in which Capt. C. informed me that he had s[t]ill been unsuccessfull having not obtained a single horse as yet from the natives and the state of our stores are so low that I begin to fear we shall not be enabled to obtain as many horses at this place as will convey our baggage and unless we do obtain a sufficient number for that purpose we shall not hasten our progress as a part of our baggage must still be conveyed by water. Capt. C. informed me that he should proceed as far as the Eneshur village today and would return tomorrow and join me at the Skillute village to which place I mean to proceed with the party tomorrow. I dispatched Shannon with a note to Capt. Clark in which I requested him to double the price we have heretofore offered for horses and if possible obtain as many as five, by this means we shall be enabled to proceed immediately with our small canoes and those horses to the villages in the neighbourhood of the musselshell rapid where horses are more abundant and cheaper; with the remainder of our merchandize in addition to the canoes we can no doubt obtain as many horses there as will answer our purposes. delay in the villages at the narrows and falls will be expensive to us inasmuch as we will be compelled to purchase both fuel and food of the indians, and might the better enable them to execute any hostile design should they meditate any against us. all the hunters returned in the evening. Sheilds had killed one deer which he brought with him. the packsaddles were completed this evening. I had some Elkskins put in the water today [to] make harnes for the packhorses but shall not cut them untill I know the number we can obtain. there is a species of hiasinth in these plains the bulb of which the natives eat either boiled baked or dryed in the sun. this bulb is white, not entirely solid, and of a flat form; the bulb of the present year overlays, or crowns that of the last, and seems to be pressed close to it, the old bulb is withered much thiner equally wide with that of the present year and sends fourth from it's sides a number of small radicles. this hiasinth is of a pale blue colour and is a very pretty flower. I preserved a specemine of it.1 1 This is Brodiæa douglasii, Wats. The specimen preserved is dated April 20, 1806.—C. V. Piper. [Clark, first draft:] April 17th. 1806 I rose early and took a position near to the village and exposed the arti[c]les I had for Sale Great numbers of Indians came from different derections; some from below some above and others across the countrey from the Tapteel river see description of the Nations &amp;c. I obtained a Sketch of the Columbia as also Clarks river. See sketch1 1 For this sketch see our atlas volume, map No. 40.—Ed. I made a bargin with the cheif who has more horses than all the village besides for 2 horses. Soon after he canseled his bargin, and we again bargined for 3 horses, they were brought forward, and only one fit for service, the others had such intolerable backs as to render them entirely unfit for service. as I would not take the 3 he would not sell the good one to me, and we were off the bargin. I then packed up and was about setting out for the Falls when one Indian sold me 2 horses and one other one horse, and Some others Said they wished to trade which caused me to conclude to delay here one other night. Maney of the natives from above come and said they would trade, but asked a higher price than I thought I could give or reather more than this nation asked. Great numbers of men. I hed to purchase 3 dogs for the men to eate &amp; some Shap-per-lell. I sent Crusat, Wiser, Willard and Mc.Neal back to Capt Lewis informing him of my ill suck'sess, and adviseing him to proceed on to this place as soon as possible, and my intention of proceeding on to the falls to purchase horses if possible Several Indians arived late this evening. Capt. Lewis sent me a note by Shannon informing me that he would set [off] early on tomorrow morning early &amp;c. &amp;c. I slept in house of the 2d chief and they had not any thing except fish to eate and no wood for fire. those people have a number of buffalow robes. They have great number of skimming nets [Clark:] Thursday 17th.. of April 1806 I rose early after [a] bad nights rest, and took my merchindize to a rock which afforded an eligable situation for my purpose, and at a short distance from the houses, and divided the articles of merchindize into parsels of such articles as I thought best calculated to pleas the Indians. and in each parcel I put as many articles as we could afford to give, and thus exposed them to view, informing the Indians that each parcel was intended for a horse. they tanterlised me the greater part of the day, saying that they had sent out for their horses and would trade as soon as they came. Several parcels of merchindize was laid by for which they told me they would bring horses. I made a bargin with the chief for 2 horses, about an hour after he canseled the bargin and we again bargained for 3 horses which were brought forward, only one of the 3 could be possibly used the other two had such intolerable backs as to render them entirely unfit for service. I refused to take two of them which displeased him and he refused to part with the 3rd. I then packed up the articles and was about setting out for the village above when a man came and sold me two horses, and another man sold me one horse, and several others informed me that they would trade with me if I would continue untill their horses could be drove up. this induced me to continue at this village another day. Maney of the nativs from different villages on the Columbia above offered to trade, but asked such things as we had not and double as much of the articles which I had as we could afford to give. this was a very unfavourable circumstance as my dependance for precureing a sufficiency of horses rested on the suckcess above where I had reasons to believe there were a greater abundance of those animals, and was in hopes of getting them on better terms. I purchased 3 dogs for the party with me to eate and some chap-pa-lell for my self. before precureing the 3 horses I dispatched Crusat, Willard &amp; Mc Neal and Peter Wiser to Capt Lewis at the Rock fort Camp with a note informing him of my ill suckcess in precureing horses, and advised him to proceed on to this place as soon as possible. that I would in the mean time proceed on to the Enesher Nation above the Great falls and try to purchase some horses of that people. Soon after I had dispatched this party the Chief of the Enesher's and 15 or 20 of his people visited me and appeared to be anxious to see the articles I offered for the horses. several of them agreed to let me have horses if I would add sundery articles to those I offered which I agreed to do, and they lay'd those bundles by and informed me they would deliver me the horses in the morning. I proposed going with them to their Town. the chief informed me that their horses were all in the plains with their womin gathering roots. they would Send out and bring the horses to this place tomorrow. this inteligence was flattering, tho' I doubted the sincerity of those people who had several times disapointed me in a similar way. however I deturmined to continue untill tomorrow. in the mean time indust[ri]ously employd. our selves with the great multitude of Indians of differant Nations about us trying to purchase horses. Shabono purchased a verry fine mare for which he gave Hurmen [Ermine], Elks Teeth, a belt and some other articles of no great value. no other purchase was made in the course of this day. in the evening I rec[ei]ved a note from Capt L. by Shannon informing me that he should set out early on tomorrow morning and should proceed up to the bason 2 miles below the Skillute Village, and adviseing me to give double the prices which we had first agreed on for each horse. I observe at every house scooping nets with which they take the Salmon. I was envited into the house of the 2nd.

LATE last evening we were visited by the principal chief of Chilluckkittaquaws and 12 of his nation they remained with us untill 9 OC. when they all departed except the Cheif and two others who slept at my feet. we loaded our vessels and set out after an early breakfast this morning. we gave the indians a passage to the N. shore on which they reside and pursued our rout to the foot of the first rapid at the distance of 4 Ms. here we found it necessary to unload the perogues and canoes and make a portage of 70 paces over a rock; we then drew our vessels up by a cord and the assistance of setingpoles. from hence we proceeded to the bason below the long narrows 5 ms. further and landed on the Lard. side at 1/2 after 3. the Cheif when he left me this morning promised to bring some horses to barter with me at the bason. the long narrows are much more formidable than they were when we decended them last fall there would be no possibility of passind[g] either up or down them in any vessel.1 1 On the etymology of "Dalles," see Bancroft's N. W. Coast, ii, p. 44.—Ed. after unloading the canoes and arranging the camp I walked up to the Skillute Village and jouined Capt. [C.] he had procured four horses only for which a high price had been given, at least more than double that which we had formerly given for those which we purchased from the Shoshonees and the first bands of Flatheads. they have a great abundance of horses but will not dispose of them. we determined to make the portage to the head of the long narrows with our baggage and five small canoes. the 2 perogues we could take no further and therefore cut them up for fuel. in the evening Capt. C. and myself returned to the camp at the bason and left Drewyer and three others with the merchandize at the village, three parsels of which had been laid by at the request of individuals who promised to give us horses for them in the morning. I shot my airgun in the presents of the natives at the village which excited great astonishment. [Clark, first draft:] April 18th. 1806 early this morning I was awoke by a Indian from the neighbourhood of our horses, he arived here yesterday &amp; this morning found a Small bag of powder and ball which had been left when we exposed our goods yesterday and brought it to me. I had a fire made out and exposed the articles &amp; having increased the articles for each horse, and sent out 2 men to hunt the horses bought yesterday. after colecting them Sent Shabono and Frazer with the 4 I had purchased down to Capt. Lewis. and was tanterlised with the expectation of purchaseing more imediately. Great numbers of the Indians from the falls and both above and below. None of them appeared anxious to part with their horses but told me that Several were comeing from the plains about 1 or 2 P M. and laid by 2 parcels of merchendize and told me that they had Sent for their horses. among other Tribes was those of the Skad-datts who bantered the Skillutes to play with them at a Singular kind of a game which was soon made up and 9 of a side Sat down they were some time making up their bets of Beeds, brass thimbles or tubes robes &amp;c. &amp;c. when the bets were all made up the nine on each side took opposides faceing each other at the distance of about 12 feet. in front of each party was placed a long pole on which they struck with a stick and Sung. they made use of 2 small pices of bone in this form and size a bone was given to 2 men of the same party who changed it from hand to hand with great dexterity one hand above the other looking down, and when he was ready for the opposit party to guess he Separated his hands swinging them around the breast looking at the opposit party who waved their hand to the side the bone was in. if the opposit party guessed the hand of each man the bone was given to them. if neither it was nothing. if they guessed one which they might single out if they pleased they recived his bone, and lost on the other as they hapened to fail in guessing they also lose one if the[y] fail [to] guess both The game is plaid at different numbers &amp; each party has 5 sticks. Several of those games were played to day in which the Skillutes won, indeed the[y] won all the beeds and Som robes of the Skaddatts which they had r[i]sked one other game which they also played by 2 men with 4 sticks. 2 black &amp; 2 white under a kind of hat made of bark. as this is a very intrecut game I cannot describe it: the one who holds the sticks places them in different positions, and the opposit party, guess the position of the black sticks by a motion of either one or both of the hands. each man has 4 sticks. this as also the other is accompanied with a kind of song. This hat is about 12 inches [in] diamuter and the sticks about 5 inches long. at 3 P M Sergt Ordway arived with 3 men from Capt Lewis with elk skins and some fiew articles such as a coat &amp; robes. I had 3 dogs purchased, soon after Capt. Lewis came up with J. Fields he had assended the river with much dificuelty to the bason 2 miles below. I left Drewyer, Warner, Shannon &amp; Goodrich with the articles and went down with Capt. Lewis to the bason, cut up 2 of our canoes for fire wood, no horses more Maney nations resort here for trade [Clark:] Friday 18th.. April 1806 Early this morning I was awoke by an indian man of the Chopunnish Nation who informed me that he lived in the neighbourhood of our horses. this man delivered me a bag of powder and ball which he had picked up this morning at the place the goods were exposed yesterday. I had a fire made of some poles purchased of the nativs at a short distance from the houses and the articles exposed as yesterday. Collected the 4 horses purchased yesterday and sent Frazier and Shabono with them to the bason where I expected they would meet Cap L—s and commence the portage of the baggage on those horses, about 10 A. M. the Indians came down from the Eneesher Villages and I expected would take the articles which they had laid by yesterday. but to my estonishment not one would make the exchange to day. two other parcels of goods were laid by, and the horses promised at 2 P.M. I payed but little attention to this bargain, however suffered the bundles to lye. I dressed the sores of the principal Chief gave some small things to his children and promised the chief some Medicine for to cure his sores. his wife who I found to be a sulky Bitch and was somewhat efflicted with pains in her back. this I thought a good oppertunity to get her on my side giveing her something for her back. I rubed a little camphere on her temples and back, and applyed worm flannel to her back which she thought had nearly restored her to her former feelings. this I thought a favourable time to trade with the chief who had more horses than all the nation besides. I accordingly made him an offer which he excepted and sold me two horses. Great numbers of Indians from defferent derections visited me at this place to day. none of them appeared willing to part with their horses, but told me that several were comeing from the plains this evening. among other nations who visit this place for the purpose of trade is the Skad-datt's those people bartered the Skillutes to play at a singular kind of game. in the course of the day the Skillutes won all their beeds skins arrows &amp;c. This game was composed of 9 men on a side. they set down opposit to each other at the distance of about 10 feet. in front of each party a long pole was placed on which they struck with a small stick to the time of their songs. after the bets were made up which was nearly half an hour after they set down, two round bones was produced about the size of a mans little finger or something smaller and 2 1/4 inches in length. which they held in their hands changeing it from one hand to the other with great dexterity. 2 men on the same side performed this part, and when they had the bone in the hand they wished, they looked at their advorsarys swinging arms around their sholders for their advorsary [to] Guess which they performed by the motion the hand either to the right or left. if the opposit party guessed the hand of both of the men who had the bone, the bones were given to them. if neither the bones was retained and nothing counted. if they guessed one and not the other, one bone was delivered up and the party possessing the other bone counted one. and one for every time the advorsary missguessed untill they guessed the hand in which the bone was in. in this game each party has 5 sticks. and one side wins all the sticks, once twice or thrice as the game may be set. I observed another game which those people also play and is played by 2 persons with 4 sticks about the size of a mans finger and about 7 inches in length. two of those sticks are black and the other 2 white and something larger than the black ones. those sticks they place in different positions which they perform under a kind of trencher made of bark round and about 14 inches diameter. this is a very intricate game and I cannot sufficently understand to discribe it. the man who is in possession of the sticks &amp;c places them in different positions, and the opposit party tels the position of the black sticks by a motion of either or both of his hands &amp;c. this game is counted in the same way as the one before mentioned. all their games are accompanied with songs and time. at 3 P.M. Sergt. Ordway &amp; three men arived from Cap Lewis they brought with them several Elk skins, two of my coats and 4 robes of the party to add to the stores I had with me for the purchase of horses. Sgt. O. informed me that Cap L. had arived with all the canoes into the bason 2 miles below and wished some dogs to eate. I had 3 dogs purchased and sent down, at 5 P. M. Capt. Lewis came up. he informed me that he had [passed] the river to the bason with much dificuelty and danger, haveing made one portage. as I had not slept but very little for the two nights past on account of mice &amp; Virmen with which those indian houses abounded, and haveing no blanket with me, and the means of keeping a fire sufficent to keep me worm out [of doors] was too expensive I deturmined to proceed with Capt L. down to camp at the bason. I left the articles of Merchendize &amp;c. with Drewyer, Werner, Shannon &amp; Goodrich untill the morning. at the bason we cut up two of our Canoes for fire wood, verry much to the sagreen [chagrin] of the nativs notwithstanding they would give us nothing for them. In my absence several Inds. visited Capt. Lewis at his camp among others was the great Chief of the Chilluckkitquaw who continued with him untill he left Rock fort camp. Capt. L. had 12 pack saddles completed and strings prepared of the Elk skins for Lashing the loads he also kept out all the hunters who killed just deer enough for the party with him to subsist on. The Chief who had visited Capt Lewis promised him that he would bring some horses to the bason and trade with him. but he was not as good as his word. Capt. Lewis gave a large Kittle for a horse which was offered to him at the bason this evening. [Lewis:] Saturday April 19th. 1806. This morning early we had our small canoes drawn out, and employed all hands in transporting our baggage on their backs and by means of the four pack-horses, over the portage. This labour we had accomplished by 3 P.M. and established our camp a little above the present Skil-lute village which has been removed a few hundred yards lower down the river than when we passed them last fall and like others below have the floors of their summer dwellings on the surface of the earth instead of those cellars in which they resided when we passed them. there was great joy with the natives last night in consequence of the arrival of the Salmon; one of those fish was caught; this was the harbinger of good news to them. They informed us that these fish would arrive in great quantities in the course of about 5 days. this fish was dressed and being divided into small peices was given to each child in the village. this custom is founded in a supersticious opinion that it will hasten the arrival of the salmon. with much difficulty we obtained four other horses from the Indians today, we wer[e] obliged to dispence with two of our kettles, in order to acquire those, we have now only one small kettle to a mess of 8 men. in the evening Capt. Clark set out with four men to the Enesher village at the grand falls in order to make a further attempt to procure horses. these people are very faithless in their contracts; they frequently receive the merchandize in exchange for their horses and after some hours insist on some additional article being given them or revoke the exchange. they have pilfered several small articles from us this evening. I directed the horses to be hubbled &amp; suffered to graize at a little distance from our camp under the immediate eye of the men who had them in charge. one of the men Willard was negligent in his attention to his horse and suffered it to ramble off; it was not to be found when I ordered the others to be brought up and confined to the picquits. this in addition to the other difficulties under which I laboured was truly provoking. I repremanded him more severely for this piece of negligence than had been usual with me. I had the remaining horses well secured by picquits; they were extreemly wrestless and it required the attention of the whole guard through the night to retain them notwithstanding they were hubbled and picquited. they frequently throwed themselves by the ropes by which they were confined. all except one were stone horses for the people in this neighbourhood do not understand the art of gelding them, and this is a season at which they are most vicious. many of the natives remained about our camp all night. [Clark, first draft:] April 19th.. 1806. this morning early had some rain had the small canoes hauled out to dry every man capable of carrying a load comenced the portage and by 5 P. M had every part of our baggage and canoes across the portage. I then took Sgt. Pryor, G. Shannon &amp; Crusat &amp; Labiech and went up to the falls at which place I arived about 8 p.m. in the course of this day I purchased 4 horses at the town &amp; Capt Lewis purchased one. the natives finding that we were about to proceed on by water sold us those fiew horses for which we were compd. to pay them emence prices and the horses were indifferent. Several showers of rain this day. description of those people &amp;c. narrows bad [Clark:] Saturday 19th April 1806. We deturmined to make the portage to the head of the long narrows with our baggage and 5 small canoes, the 2 large canoes we could take no further and therefore cut them up for fuel. we had our small canoes drawn up very early and employed all hands in transporting our baggage on their backs and by means of 4 pack horses, over the portage. This labour we had accomplished by 3. P. M. and established our camp a little above the present Skillute village which has been removed as before observed a fiew hundred yards lower down the river than when we passed it last fall. I left Capt L. at the bason and proceeded to the village early this morning with a view to receive the horses which were promised to be brought this morning for articles laid by last evining. in the course of this day I purchased four horses at the Village, and Capt Lewis one at the bason before he left it. after the baggage was all safely landed above the portage, all hands brought over the canoes at 2 lodes which was accomplished by 5 P.M. as we had not a sufficiency of horses to transport our baggage we agreed that I should proceed on to the Enesher Villages at the great falls of the Columbia and if possible purchase as maney horses as would transport the baggage from that place, and rid us of the trouble and dificuelty of takeing our canoes further. I set out with Serjt Pryor, Geo. Shannon Peter Crusat &amp; Labiech at half past 5 P. M. for the Enesher village at which place I arrived at 8 P.M. Several showers of rain in the after part of to day, and the S W wind very high. there was great joy with the nativs last night in consequence of the arrival of the Salmon; one of those fish was cought, this was the harbenger of good news to them. They informed us that those fish would arive in great quantities in the course of about 5 days. this fish was dressed and being divided into small pieces was given to each child in the village. this custom is founded on a supersticious opinion that it will hasten the arrival of the Salmon. We were oblige[d] to dispence with two of our kittles in order to acquire two of the horses purchased to day. we have now only one small kittle to a mess of 8 men. These people are very fa[i]thless in contracts; they frequently recive the merchindize in exchange for their horses and after some hours insist on some additional article being given them or revoke the exchange. The long narrows are much more formidable than they were when we decended them last fall, there would be no possibility of passing either up or down them in any vessle at this time. I entered the largest house of the Eneeshers Village in which I found all the enhabitants in bead. they rose and made a light of straw, they haveing no wood to burn. Many men collected we smoked and I informed them that I had come to purchase a fiew horses of them. they promused to sell me some in the morning. [Lewis:] Sunday April 20th. 1806. some frost this morning. The Enesher an[d] Skillutes are much better clad than they were last fall, there men have generally legings mockersons and large robes; many of them wear shirts of the same form with those of the Shoshone Chopunnish &amp;c. highly ornamented with porcupine quills. the dress of their women differs very little from those of the great rapids and above. their children frequently wear robes of the large grey squirrel skins, those of the men and women are principally deer skins, some wolf, elk, big horn and buffaloe; the latter they procure from the nations who sometimes visit the Missouri. indeed a considerable p[r]oportion of their wearing apparel is purchased from their neighbours to the N.W. in exchange for pounded fish copper and beads. at present the principal village of the Eneshur is below the falls on. the N. side of the river. one other village is above the falls on the S. side and another a few miles above on the N. side, the first consists of 19, the 2ed. of 11, and the 3rd. of 5 lodges. their houses like those of the Skillutes have their floors on the surface of the ground, but are formed of sticks and covered with mats and straw. they are large and contain usually several families each, for fuel they use straw, small willows and the southern wood.1 1 The "southernwood," also mentioned April 27, post, is the common sage brush (Artemisia tridentata, Nutt.). In many places in the Columbia plains this is still the only fuel of the settlers.—C. V. Piper. they use the silk grass in manufacturing their fishing nets and bags, the bear grass and cedar bark are employed in forming a variety of articles. they are poor, dirty, proud, haughty, inhospitable, parsimonious and faithless in every rispect. nothing but our numbers I beleive prevents their attempting to murder us at this moment.2 2 This paragraph, evidently omitted by Lewis in copying from his notes, is found on p. 150 of Codex K (with reference thereto from p. 72).—Ed. This morning I was informed that the natives had pilfered six tommahawks and a knife from the party in the course of the last night. I spoke to the cheif on this subject, he appeared angry with his people and addressed them but the property was not restored, one horse which I had purchased and paid for yesterday and which could not be found when I ordered the horses into close confinement yesterday I was now informed had been gambled away by the rascal who had sold it to me and had been taken away by a man of another nation. I therefore took the goods back from this fellow. I purchased a gun from the cheif for which I gave him 2 Elkskins. in the course of the day I obtained two other indifferent horses for which I gave an extravigant price. I found that I should get no more horses and therefore resolved to proceed tomorrow morning with those which I had and to convey the baggage in two small canoes that the horses could not carry. for this purpose I had a load made up for seven horses, the eighth Bratton was compelled to ride as he was yet unable to walk. 1 bart[er]ed my Elkskins old irons and 2 canoes for beads. one of the canoes for which they would give us but little I had cut up for fuel. These people have yet a large quantity of dryed fish on hand yet they will not let us have any but for an exorbitant price, we purchased two dogs and some shappellel from them. I had the horses graized untill evening and then picquited and hubbled within the limits of our camp. I ordered the indians from our camp this evening and informed them that if I caught them attempting to perloin any article from us I would beat them severely. they went off in reather a bad humour and I directed the party to examine their arms and be on their guard. they stole two spoons from us in the course of the day. The Scad-dals, Squan-nan-os, Shan-wah-pums and Shallattas reside to the N.W. of these people, depend on hunting deer and Elk and trade with these people for ther pounded fish.1 1 These tribes are usually identified as the Klikitat and Yakima—Shahaptian tribes of eastern Washington. See "Estimate of Western Indians," vol. vi.—Ed. [Clark, first draft:] April 20th. 1806 This morning very cold hills covered with snow. I showed the nativs what I had to give for their horses and attempted to purchase them. they informed me that they would not Sell any horses to me, that their horses were at a [place a] long ways off and they would not trade them. my offer was a blue robe, callico shirt, a handkerchef, 5 parcels of paint a knife, a wampom moon 4 braces of ribin, a pice of Brass and about 6 braces of yellow beeds; and to that amount for what I had I also offered my large blue blanket for one, my coat Sword &amp; Plume none of which seem to entice those people to give horses if they had any. they set in their huts which is of mats supported on poles without fire. at night when they want a light they burn dry straw &amp; some fiew small dry willows. they speak different from those below, have but little to eate, some roots &amp; Dryed fish is to be found in their houses. I am half frozed at this inhospitable village which is moved from its position above the falls to one below and contains 19 large houses, a village is also established on the other side imedeately above the falls. all the natives who was established above the Falls for some distance has removed Those people are much better dressed than they were at the time we went down the river. They have all new Deer, Elk, Ibex Goat &amp; Wolf skin robes, their children also the large squirel skin robes. maney of them have Legins and mockersons, all of which they precure of the Indians at a distance in exchange for their pounded fish &amp; Beeds. they also purchase silk grass of which they make their nets &amp; Sanes [seines] for takeing fish they also purchase Bear grass and maney other things for their fish. those people gave me roots and berries prepared in different ways for which I gave some small articles in return. Great numbers of skiming knets on their houses. Those people are Pore and kind durty &amp; indolent. They ware their hair loose flowing the men cut in the foward [fore head] which the Skilloots do not &amp;c. &amp;c. I could not precure a single horse of those people, dureing this day at any price, they offered me 2 for 2 kittles of which we could not spear. I used every artifice decent &amp; even false statements to enduce those pore devils to sell me horses. in the evening two different men offered to sell me three horses which they informed me was a little distance off and they would bring them imediately. those two persons as I found went imediately off up the river to their tribe without any intention to find or sell their horses. a little before Sunset 3 men arived from some distance above, and informed me that they came to see me. at Sunset finding no probability of Capt Lewis arival, packed up the articles and took them into the lodge in which I lay last night. Great numbers of those people geathered around me to smoke. I gave them 2 pipes and lay down in the back part of the house with Sgt. P. &amp; the men with our arms in a situation as to be ready in case of any alarm. those pore people appear entirely harmless. I purchased a dog and some wood with a little pounded fish and chappalels. made a fire on the rocks and cooked the dogs on which the men breckfast &amp; Dined. wind hard all day cold from N W. [Clark, second draft:] Sunday 20th.. April 1806 a very cold morning the Western mountains covered with snow I shewed the Eneshers the articles I had to give for their horses. they without hezitation informed me that they would not sell me any for the articles I had, if I would give them Kittles they would let me have horses, and not without that their horses were at a long ways off in the planes and they would not send for them &amp;c. My offer was a blue robe, a calleco Shirt, a Silk handkerchief, 5 parcels of paint, a knife, a Wampom moon, 8 yards of ribon, several pieces of Brass, a Mockerson awl and 6 braces of yellow beeds; and to that amount for each horse which is more than double what we gave either the Sohsohne or first flatheads we met with on Clarks river I also offered my large blue blanket, my coat sword &amp; plume none of which seamed to entice those people to sell their horses. notwithstanding every exertion not a single horse could be precured of those people in the course of the day. Those people are much better clad than they were last fall, their men have generally legins mockersons and large robes. maney of them ware shirts of the same form of those of the Chopunnish and Shoshone highly ornimented with porcupine quills. the dress of their wimen differs verry little from those above the great rapids. their children have small robes of the squirel skins. those of the men &amp; women are principally deer, some elk, wolf, Ibix &amp; buffalow which they precure from distant nations who purchase their Pounded fish in exchange for those robes &amp; Beeds. The principal village of the Enesher nation is imediately below the falls on the N. Side. one other village of the same nation above the falls on the opposit side and one other a few miles above on the North Side. The Houses of those people like the Skillutes have the flores of their summer dwelling on the surface of the earth in sted of those sellers in which they resided when we passed them last fall. those houses are covered with mats and straw are large and contain several families each. I counted 19 at this village &amp; 11 on the opposit side. those people are pore durty haughty. they burn straw and small willows. have but little to eate and deer with what they have. they precure the silk grass of which they make their nets, the bear grass for makeing their mats and several other necessary [articles] of the Indians of the following nations who trade with them as also the Skillutes for their pounded fish. Viz. Skad-dats, Squan-nun-os, Shan-wap-poms, Shall-lat-tos, who reside to the north and several bands who reside on the Columbia above. I precured a sketch of the Columbia and its branches of those people in which they made the river which falls into the Columbia imediately above the falls on the South Side to branch out into 3 branches one of which they make head in Mt. Jefferson, one in mount Hood and the other in the S W. range of mountains, and does not water that extensive country we have heretofore calculated on. a great portion of the Columbia and Lewis's river and betwen the same and the waters of Callifornia must be watered by the Multnomah river. See Sketch in the latter part of this book Those people are great jokers and deciptfull in trade. at sunset finding that Capt Lewis would not arrive this evening as I expected, I packed up all the articles which I had exposed, at a situation I had pitched on to Encamp, and at which place we had bought as maney fishing poles as made a fire to cook a dog which I had purchased for the men to eate, and returned to the lodge which I had slept in last night. great number gathered around me to smoke, I gave them two pipes, and then lay my self down with the men to sleep, haveing our merchendize under our heads and guns &amp;c in our arms, as we always have in similar situations. [Lewis:] Monday April 21st. 1806. Notwithstanding all the precautions I had taken with rispect to the horses one of them had broken his cord of 5 strands of Elkskin and had gone off spanseled.1 1 Spancel: to fasten the legs of a horse, to prevent it from kicking (provincial English).—Century Dictionary. I sent several men in surch of the horse with orders to return at 10 A.M. with or without the horse being determined to remain no longer with these villains. they stole another tomahawk from us this morning I surched many of them but could not find it. I ordered all the spare poles, paddles and the ballance of our canoe put on the fire as the morning was cold and also that not a particle should be left for the benefit of the indians. I detected a fellow in stealing an iron socket of a canoe pole and gave him several severe blows and mad[e] the men kick him out of camp.2 2 Wood here is very scarce, as the Columbia plains have commenced. Several of the men went up to the village with their buffaloe robes, to dispose of them for horses. . . . An Indian stole some iron articles from among the men's hands; which so irritated Captain Lewis that he struck him; which was the first act of the kind, that had happened during the expedition. The Indians, however, did not resent it.— Gass (pp. 291, 2, 92). In this connection, Coues says (L. and C., iii, p. 959) that the tribes at the Dalles and the Cascades of the Columbia were always thievish and murderous, since first known by white men, until very recent years; and ascribes this to the advantage given them by the difficulties of navigation at those points. Cf. the similar character of the tribe living at Allumette Island, in the Ottawa River (Jes. Relations, v, p. 291, ix, 247, 271–275, x, 77).—Ed. I now informed the indians that I would shoot Sketch-map, by Clark, "given to me by a Skaddot, a Chopunnish &amp; a Skillute at the Falls of the Columbia, 18 April 1806." the first of them that attempted to steal an article from us. that we were not affraid to fight them, that I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my property alone. that I would take their horses if I could find out the persons who had stolen the tommahawks, but that I had reather loose the property altogether than take the ho[r]se of an inosent person, the chiefs [who] were present hung their heads and said nothing. at 9 A.M. Windsor returned with the lost horse, the others who were in surch of the horse soon after returned also. the Indian who promised to accompany me as far as the Chopunnish country produced me two horses one of which he politely gave me the liberty of packing. we took breakfast and departed a few minutes after 10 OClock. having nine horses loaded and one which Bratton rode not being able as yet to march; the two canoes I had dispatched early this morning. at 1 P.M. I arrived at the Enesher Village where I found Capt. Clark and party; he had not purchased a single horse. he informed me that these people were quite as unfriendly as their neighbours the Skillutes, and that he had subsisted since he left me on a couple of platters of pounded roots and fish which an old man had the politeness to offer him. his party fared much better on dogs which he purchased from those people. the man resided here from whom I had purchased the horse which ran off from me yesterday. I had given him a large kettle and a knife in exchange for that horse which I informed him should be taken from him unles he produced me the lost horse or one of equal value in his stead, the latter he prefered and produced me a very good horse which I very cheerfully received. we soon made the portage with our canoes and baggage and halted about 1/2 a mile above the Village where we graized our horses and took dinner on some dogs which we purchased of these people. after dinner we proceeded on about four miles to a village of 9 mat lodges of the Enesher a little below the entrance of Clark's river (Towanahiooks) [Des Chutes] and encamped; one of the canoes joined us the other not observing us halt continued on. we obtained two dogs and a small quantity of fuel of these people for which we were obliged to give them a higher price than usual. our guide continued with us, he appears to be an honest sincere fellow. he tells us that the indians a little above will treat us with much more hospitality than those we are now with. we purchased another horse this evening but his back is in such a horid state that we can put but little on him; we obtained him for a trifle, at least for articles which might be procured in the U' States for 10 shillings Virga Cory. we took the precaution of piqu[i]ting and spanseling our horses this evening near our camp. [Clark, first draft:] April 21st. 1806 a fair cold morning I find it useless to offer any art[i]cles or attempt to trade at this village and therefore deturmine to [blank space in MS.] before I rose the house was crowded with Indians to smoke I gave them none. they are well supplied with straw &amp; bark bags ready to hold their pounded fish. at 12 oClock the advance of the party from below arived and soon after the canoes all things were taken above the falls &amp; 2 canoes, turned out the horse[s] and cooked &amp; Eat 2 dogs which we purchased of the nativs, purchased one horse for which we are to give a kittle which was given by us to a man for a horse 3 days past &amp;c. the horse was either taken or strayed off. The Chief from below came up and appeared concerned for what had been done at his village (See journal) a[t]'4 P M loaded up &amp; set out the canoes also proceed on about 3 miles opposit to the mouth of Clark river, and an Indian man who has attached himself to us and who has lent us a horse to pack &amp; lives near the Rocky mountains. he told us that as the day was far spent we had better camp at a village of 9 Lodges a little off the road opsd. the River Clarks1 1 This name was added later.—Ed. This river has a great falls above 2 forks on its West side. we formed a camp purchased some wood &amp; 3 dogs for which we gave pewter buttons which buttons we had made &amp;c. but fiew Indians with us to day. this evening purchased an old horse and tied up all the horses when we went to bed Those are the same people with those below at the falls. See journal for the next day Skad-dat a ill looking people reside to the N about 18 or 20 miles they played against the Skillutes a game they call [blank] 9 of a side and took all the beeds &amp; other articles Also a Single game with 2 black &amp; 2 white sticks under a kind of hat. 2 men played this game is intricit and each party has 4 pegs to count it The former game is played with 2 bones or sticks about the size of a large quill and 2 inches long passing from one hand to the other and the adverse party guess. See description before mentioned. The nations above at the falls also play this game and bet high [Clark, second draft:] Monday 21st.. April 1806 A fair cold morning I found it useless to make any further attempts to trade horses with those unfriendly people who only crowded about me to view and make their remarks and smoke, the latter I did not indulge them with to day. at 12 oClock Capt Lewis and party came up from the Skillutes Village with 9 horses packed and one which bratten who was yet too weak to walk, rode, and soon after the two small canoes also loaded with the residue of the baggage which could not be taken on horses. we had every thing imediately taken above the falls. in the mean time purchased 2 Dogs on which the party dined. whilst I remained at the Enesher Village I subsisted on 2 platters of roots, some pounded fish and sun flower seed pounded which an old man had the politeness to give me in return for which I gave him several small articles. Capt. Lewis informed me that imediately after I left him the nativs began to steal and had stolen Tomahawks of the party, and in the course of the night had let our horses loose he had burnt one and sold 2 of the largest canoes for beeds, the other 2 brought on. an indian was detected in stealing a socket and was kicked out of camp. Capt L informed the Indians that the next man who attempted to steal should be shot and thretened them and informed them that he could kill them in a moment and set their town on fire if he pleased. but it was not his desire to hurt them severly if they would let the property of the party along. the Chiefs hung their heads and said nothing. he lost the horse that was given for a large kittle, and a Chopunnish man lent a horse to carry a load and accompanied the party. The man who we had reason to believe had stolen the horse he had given for the Kittle we thretened a little and he produced a very good horse in the place of that one which we chearfully receved. After dinner we proceeded on about 4 miles to a village of 9 Mat Lodges of the Enesher, a little below the enterance of To war nah hi ooks river and encamped: one of the canoes joined us, the other not haveing observed us halt continued on. We obtained 2 Dogs and a small quantity of fuel of those people for which we were obliged to give a higher price than usial, our guide continued with us, he appears to be an honest fellow. he tels us that the indians above will treat us with much more hospitallity than those we are now with. we purchased another horse this evening but his back is in such a horrid state that we can put but little on him; we obtained him for a triffe, at least for articles which might be precured in the U. States for 10/ Virga. currency. we took the precaution of picqueting and Spancelling our horses this evening near our camp. the evenning cold and we could afford only one fire. [Lewis:] Tuesday April 22ed 1806. Last night two of our horses broke loos from the picquits and straggled off some little distance, the men who had charge of them fortunately recovered them early. at 7 A.M. we set out having previously sent on our small Canoe with Colter and Potts. we had not arrived at the top of a hill over which the road leads opposite the village before Charbono's horse threw his load, and taking fright at the saddle and robe which still adhered, ran at full speed down the hill, near the village he disengaged himself from the saddle and robe, an indian hid the robe in his lodge. I sent our guide and one man who was with me in the rear to assist Charbono in retaking his horse which having done they returned to the village on the track of the horse in surch of the lost articles they found the saddle but could see nothing of the robe the Indians denyed having seen it; they then continued on the track of the horse to the place from whence he had set out with the same success, being now confident that the indians had taken it I sent the Indian woman on to request Capt. C. to halt the party and send back some of the men to my assistance being determined either to make the indians deliver the robe or birn their houses. they have vexed me in such a manner by such repeated acts of villany that I am quite disposed to treat them with every severyty, their defenseless state pleads forgivness so far as rispects their lives. with this resolution I returned to their village which I had just reached as Labuish met me with the robe which he informed me he found in an Indian lodg hid behind their baggage. I now returned and joined Capt. Clark who was waiting my arrival with the party. the Indian woman had not reached Capt. C. untill about the time I arrived and he returned from a position on the top of a hill not far from where he had halted the party. from the top of this emmenense Capt. C. had an extensive view of the country. he observed the range of mountains in which Mount Hood stands to continue nearly south as far as the eye could reach. he also observed the snow-clad top of Mount Jefferson which boar S. 10.W. Mount Hood from the same point boar S. 30.W. the tops of the range of western mountains are covered with snow. Capt. C. also discovered some timbered country in a Southern direction from him at no great distance. Clarks river (Towarnahiooks) which mouths immediately opposite this point of view forks at the distance of 18 or 20 miles from hence, the wright hand fork takes it[s] rise in mount Hood, and the main branch continues it's course to the S.E. (10 or 12 miles higher up another fork comes in from Mt. Jefferson)1 1 Probably White River, and Warm Spring River, large western affluents of the Des Chutes. The north fork of the former might have been seen from the outlook; knowledge of the latter doubtless came from Indians.—Ed. we now made the following regulations as to our future order of march (viz) that Capt. C. &amp; myself should devide the men who were disencumbered by horses and march alternately each day the one in front and the other in rear. haveing divided the party agreeably to this arrangement, we proceeded on through an open plain country about 8 miles to a village of 6 houses of the Eneshur nation, here we observed our 2 canoes passing up on the opposite side; the wind being too high for them to pass the river they continued on. we halted at a small run just above the village where we dined on some dogs which we purchased of the Inhabitants and suffered our horses to graize about three hours. there is no timber in this country we are obliged to purchase our fuel of the natives, who bring it from a great distance. while we halted for dinner we purch[ased] a horse. after dinner we proceeded on up the river about 4 miles to a village of 7 mat lodges of the last mentioned nation. here our Chopunnish guide informed us that the next village was at a considerable distance and that we could not reach it tonight. the people at this place offered to sell us wood and dogs, and we therefore thought it better to remain all night.2 2 On the Washington side (Klikitat Co.), a short distance below the John Day River (not to be confounded with another of that name near the mouth of the Columbia).—Ed. a man b[e]longing to the next village above proposed exchanging a horse for one of our canoes, just at this moment one of our canoes was passing, we hailed them and ordered them to come over but the wind continued so high that they could not join us untill after sunset and the Indian who wished to exchange his horse for the canoe had gone on. Charbono purchased a horse this evening, we obtained 4 dogs and as much wood as answered our purposes on moderate terms. we can only afford ourselves one fire, and are obliged to lie without shelter, the nights are cold and days warm. Colter and Pots had passed on with their canoe. [Clark:] Tuesday 22nd.. of April 1806 last night 2 of our horses broke loose and strayed of[f] at a short distance, at 7 oClock we loaded up and set out, haveing previously sent off the canoe with Colter and Potts we had not arived at the top of the hill which is 200 feet before Shabonos horse threw off his load and went with great speed down the hill to the Village where he disengaged himself of his Saddle &amp; the robe which was under it, the Indians hid the robe and delayed Capt. Lewis and the rear party some time before they found the robe which was in a lodge hid behind their baggage, and took possession of it. dureing the time the front of the party was waiting for Cap Lewis, I assended a high hill from which I could plainly see the range of mountains which runs South from Mt. Hood as far as I could see. I also discovered the top of Mt. Jefferson which is covered with snow and is S 10°. W. Mt. Hood is S. 30° W. the range of mountains are covered with timber and also Mt Hood to a sertain hite. The range of mountains has snow on them. I also discovered some timbered land in a S. derection from me, short of the mountains. Clarks river which mouthes imediately opposit to me forks at about 18 or 20 miles, the West fork runs to the Mt Hood and the main branch Runs from S.E. after Capt Lewis came up we proceeded on through a open ruged plain about 8 miles to a Village of 6 Houses on the river. here we observed our 2 canoes passing up on the opposit Side, and the wind too high for them to join us. I halted at the mouth of a run above the village near some good grass to let the horses graze and for the party to dine. Sent to the huts and purchased a dog &amp; some wood. dureing the time the party was takeing dinner we purchased one horse. after we proceeded on up the river about 4 miles to a village of 7 mat Lodges here our Chopunnish Guide informed me that the next Villg was at some distance and that we could not get to it to night, and that there was no wood to be precured on this side. a man offered to sell us a horse for a canoe. just at the moment we discovered one of our canoes on the opposit side. we concluded to camp here all night with the expectation of precureing some horses. Sent and purchased some wood and 4 dogs &amp; Shapellell. Shabono purchased a hors for which he gave a red rapper, shirt, ploom &amp; Tomahawk &amp;c. the party purchased a great quantity of Chapellell and some berries for which they gave bits of Tin and small pieces of cloth &amp; wire &amp;c. had our horses led out and held to grass untill dusk when they were all brought to camp, and pickets drove in the ground and the horses tied up. we find the horses very troublesom perticularly the stud which compose 10/l3 of our number of horses. the air I find extreemly cold which blows continually from Mt. Hoods snowey regions, those Indians reside in small Lodges built of the mats of Grass, flags &amp;c. and crouded with inhabitents, who speak a language somewhat different from those at the falls. their dress habits and appearance appear to be very much the same with those below. we made 14 miles to day with the greatest exertion. Serjt. Gass &amp; R. Fields joined us with one canoe this evening. the other canoe with Colter &amp; pots is a head. [Lewis:] Wednesday April 23rd. 1806. At day light this morning we were informed that the two horses of our Interpreter Charbono were absent; on enquiry it appeared that he had neglected to confine them to picqu[i]ts as had been directed last evening. we immediately dispatched Reubin Feilds and Labuish to assist Charbono in recovering his horses. one of them was found at no great distance and the other was given over as lost. at 8 A.M. Reubin Feilds and Sergt. Gass proceeded in the canoe. at 10 Labuish and Charbono returned unsuccessfull, they had gone back on the road nearly to the last village and su[r]ched the plains on either hand to a considerable distance. our remaining longer would have prevented our making a timely stage which in our situation is all important; we therefore determined to proceed immediately to the next village which from the information of our guide will occupy the greater part of the day to reach. at eleven OCk. we loaded our horses and set out. during the time we were detained this morning we had two packsaddles made. we continued our march along a narrow rocky bottom on the N. side of the river about 12 miles to the Wah-how-pum Village of 12 temperary mat lodges near the Rock rapid.1 1 In the evening, we met the party at a large village of the Wal-la-waltz nation, on the north side of the river.—Gass (p. 294). Coues thinks that the Wah-how-pums were the Klikitats, a Shahaptian tribe. The stream where the party encamped is called Rock Creek.—Ed. these people appeared much pleased to see us, sold us 4 dogs and some wood for our small articles which we had previously prepared as our only resource to obtain fuel and food through those plains. these articles con[s]isted of pewter buttons, strips of tin iron and brass, twisted wire &amp;c. we also obtained some shap-pe-lell newly made from these people. here we met with a Chopunnish man on his return up the river with his family and about 13 head of horses most of them young and unbroken. he offered to hire us some of them to pack as far [as] his nation, but we prefer bying as by hireing his horses we shal have the whole of his family most probably to mentain. at a little distance below this village we passed five lodges of the same people who like those were waiting the arrival of the salmon. after we had arranged our camp we caused all the old and brave men to set arround and smoke with us. we had the violin played and some of the men danced; after which the natives entertained us with a dance after their method. this dance differed from any I have yet seen. they formed a circle and all sung as well the spectators as the dancers who performed within the circle, these placed their sholders together with their robes tightly drawn about them and danced in a line from side to side, several parties of from 4 to seven will be performing within the circle at the same time. the whole concluded with a premiscuous dance in which most of them sung and danced. these people speak a language very similar to the Chopunnish whome they also resemble in their dress their women wear long legings mockersons shirts and robes. their men also dress with legings shirts robes and mockersons. after the dance was ended the indians retired at our request and .we retired to rest. we had all our horses side hubbled and turned out to graize; at this village, a large creek falls in on the N. side which we did not observe as we decended the river, the river is by no means as rapid as when we decended or at least not obstructed with those dangerous rapids the water at present covers most of the rocks in the bed of the river. the natives promised to barter their horses with us in the morning we therefore entertained a hope that we shall be enabled to proceede by land from hence with the whole of our party and baggage. came 12 miles by land. the sands made the march fatieguing. [Clark:] Wednesday 23rd. 1806 At day light this morning we were informed that the two horses of our interpreter Shabono were missing on enquirey we were informed that he had neglected to tie up his horses as derected last evening. we imediately dispatch him, R. Fields &amp; Labiech in serch of the horses, one of them were found at no great distance. the other was not found. R. Fields retd. without finding the horse set out with Sergt Gass in the Small Canoe at about 8 A M. at 10 Shabono and Labiech returned also unsucksessfull they had went on the back tract nearly to the last Village and took a circle around on the hills, as our situation was such that we could not detain for a horse, which would prevent our makeing a timely stage which is a great object with us in those open plains, we concluded to give up the horse and proceed on to the next village which we were informed was at some distance and would take us the greater part of the day. at 11 A.M. we packed up and set out and proceeded up on the N. Side of the Columbia on a high narrow bottom and rockey for 12 miles to the Wah-how-pum village near the rock rapid of 12 temporary mat Lodges, those people appeared pleased to see us. they sold us 4 dogs some shapollell and wood for our small articles such as awls pieces of Tin and brass. we passed several Lodges on the bank of the river where they were fixed waiting for the salmon. I over took a Choponish man whome I had seen at the long [narrows], and who had found a bag of our powder and brought it to me at that place. this man had his family on the [blank space in MS.] and about 13 head of horses which appeared young and unbroke. his spous as also that of the other gave me a cake of Chapellell and proceeded on with me to the Wahhowpum village and formed his camp near us. we caused all the old &amp; brave men to set around and smoke with us. we caused the fiddle to be played and some of the men danced. after them the nativs danced. they dance different from any Indians I have seen. they dance with their sholders together and pass from side to side, defferent parties passing each other. from 2 to 7 and 4 parties danceing at the same time and concluding the dance by passing promiscuisly throu[gh] &amp; between each other, after which we sent of [f] the Indians and retired to bed. Those people speak a language very similar to the Chopunish and with a very inconsiderable difference. their dress and appearance is more like those of the Great falls of the Columbia. we had all our horses side hobbled and let out to feed. at this village a large creek falls in on the N. side which I had not observed as I decended the river. the river is by no means as rapid as it was at the time we decended. The nativs promised to give us a horse for one of our canoes, and offer to sell us another for a scarlet robe which we have not at present. Shabono made a bargin with one of the Indian men going with us, for a horse for which he gave his shirt, and two of the leather sutes of his wife. The sand through which we walked to day is so light that [it] renders the march very fatigueing. made 12 miles by land. [Lewis:] Thursday April 24th. 1806. We were up early this morning and dispatched the men in surch of our horses, they were all found in a little time except McNeal's. we hired an indian to surch for this horse it was one in the evening before he returned with him. in the intermediate time we had 4 packsaddles made purchased three horses of the Wah-howpums, and hired three others of the Chopunnish man who accompanys us with his family and horses. we now sold our canoes for a few strands of beads, loaded up and departed at 2 P. M. the natives had tantalized us with an exchange of horses for our canoes in the first instance, but when they found that we had made our arrangements to travel by land they would give us nothing for them I determined to cut them in peices sooner than leave them on those terms, Drewyer struck one of the canoes and split of [f] a small peice with his tommahawk, they discovered us determined on this subject and offered us several strands of beads for each which were accepted. we proceeded up the river between the hills and it's Northern shore, the road was rocky and sandy alternately, the road difficult and fatieguing. at 12 Ms. we arrived at a village of 5 lodges of the Met-cow-wes, having passed 4 lodges at 4. and 2 at 2 Ms. further. we rem[a]ined all night near the Met-cow-we lodges about 2 miles below our encampment of the [blank space in MS.] of October last;1 1 About opposite present site of Arlington, below Wood Creek. These Indians belonged to the Met' how, a Salishan tribe.—Ed. we purchased three dogs and some shappellel of these people which we cooked with dry grass and willow boughs. many of the natives pased and repassed us today on the road and behaved themselves with distant rispect towards us. most of the party complain of the soarness of their feet and legs this evening; it is no doubt caused by walking over the rough stones and deep sands after b[e]ing for some months passed been accustomed to a soft soil. my left ankle gives me much pain. I baithed my feet in cold water from which I experienced considerable relief. The curloos are abundant in these plains and are now laying their eggs. saw the kildee[r], the brown lizzard, and a Moonax2 2 An appellation of the woodchuck, or marmot (Arctomys monax), current in Virginia and other Southern States. It is also spelled "monax" and "moonack"; said to be an Indian word—probably derived from the Algonquian mona, in allusion to its burrowing habits. Coues regards the animal referred to by Lewis as another species, A. flaviventer.—Ed. which the natives had petted. the winds which set from Mount Hood or in a westerly direction are much more cold than those from the opposite quarter. there are now [no—Biddle] dews in these plains, and from the appearance of the earth there appears to have been no rain for several weeks. we directed that the three horses which we purchased yesterday should be hubbled and confined to a picqut, and that the others should be disposed of in the same manner they were last evening. [Clark:] Thursday 24th. April 1806 rose early this morning and sent out after the horses all of which were found except Mc.Neals which I hired an Indian to find and gave him a Tomahawk had 4 pack saddles made ready to pack the horses which we may purchase, we purchased 3 horses, and hired 3 others of the Chopunnish man who accompanies us with his family, and at 1 P.M. set out and proceeded on through a open countrey rugid &amp; sandy between some high lands and the river to a village of 5 Lodges of the Met-cow-we band haveing passed 4 Lodges at 4 miles and 2 Lodges at 6 miles. Great numbers of the nativs pass us on hors back maney meet us and continued with us to the Lodges. we purchased 3 dogs which were pore, but the fattest we could precure, and cooked them with straw and dry willow. we sold our canoes for a fiew strands of beeds. the nativs had tantelized us with an exchange of horses for our canoes in the first instance, but when they found that we had made our arrangements to travel by land they would give us nothing for them. we sent Drewyer to cut them up, he struck one and split her they discovered that we were deturmined to destroy the canoes and offered us several strans of beeds which were accepted most of the party complain of their feet and legs this evening being very sore. it is no doubt caused by walking over the rough stone and deep sand after being accustomed to a soft soil. my legs and feet give me much pain. I bathed them in cold water from which I experienced considerable relief. we directed that the 3 horses purchased yesterday should be hobbled and confined to pickquets and that the others should be hobbled &amp; spanceled, and strictly attended to by the guard made 12 miles to day. [Lewis:] Friday April 25th. 1806. This morning we collected our horses and set out at 9 A.M. and proceeded on 11 ms. to the Village of the Pish-quit-pahs [Pisquow] of 51 mat lodges where we arrived at 2 P.M. purchased five dogs and some wood from them and took dinner. this village contains about 7 hundred souls. most of those people were in the plains at a distance from the river as we passed down last fall, they had now therefore the gratification of beholding whitemen for the first time. while here they flocked arround us in great numbers tho' treated us with much rispect. we gave two medals of the small size to their two principal Cheifs who were pointed out to us by our Chopunnish fellow traveller and were acknowledged by the nation. we exposed a few old clothes my dirk and Capt. C's swoard to barter for horses but were unsuccessfull these articles constitute at present our principal stock in trade. the Pish-quit-pahs insisted much on our remaining with them all night, but su[n]dry reasons conspired to urge our noncomplyance with their wishes. we passed one house or reather lodge of the Metcowwees about a mile above our encampment of the [blank space in MS.]th of October last, the Pish-quit-pahs, may be considered hunters as well as fishermen as they spend the fall and winter months in that occupation. they are generally pleasently featured of good statu[r]e and well proportioned. both women and men ride extreemly well. their bridle is usually a hair rope tyed with both ends to the under jaw of the horse, and their saddle consists of a pad of dressed skin stuffed with goats hair with wooden stirups. almost all the horses which I have seen in the possession of the Indians have soar backs. the Pishquitpah women for the most part dress with short shirts which reach to their knees long legings and mockersons, they also use large robes; some of them weare only the truss and robe they brade their hair as before discribed but the heads of neither male nor female of this tribe are so much flattened as the nations lower down on this river. at 4 P.M. we set out accompanyed by eighteen or twenty of their young men on horseback. we continued our rout about nine miles where finding as many willows as would answer our purposes for fuel we encamped for the evening. the country we passed through was much as that of yesterday. the river hills are about 250 feet high and generally abrupt and craggey in many places faced with a perpendicular and solid rock. this rock is black and hard. leve[l] plains extend themselves from the tops of the river hills to a great distance on either side of the river. the soil is not as fertile as about the falls, tho' it produces a low grass on which the horses feed very conveniently. it astonished me to see the order of their horses at this season of the year when I knew that they had wintered on the drygrass of the plains1 1 The fact that the Columbia plains bunch-grasses cure standing and retain their nourishment has long been well known. The grass is mainly Agropyron spicatum, (Pursh) Rydt. Lewis deserves credit here for his keen observation.—C. V. Piper. and at the same time road with greater severity than is common among ourselves. I did not see a single horse which could be deemed poor and many of them were as fat as seals. their horses are generally good. this evining after we had encamped, we traded for two horses with nearly the same articles we had offered at the village; these nags Capt. C. and myself intend riding ourselves; haveing now a sufficiency to transport with ease all our baggage and the packs of the men. we killed six ducks in the course of the day; one of them was of a speceis which I had never before seen I therefore had the most material parts of it reserved as a specimine, the leggs are yellow and feet webbed as those of the duckandmallard.2 2 The shoveler duck (Spatula clypeata).—Coues (L. and C., iii, p. 968). saw many common lizzards, several rattlesnakes killed by the party, they are the same common to the U. States. the horned Lizzard is also common. had the fiddle played at the request of the natives and some of the men danced. we passed five lodges of the Wallâh wollâhs at the distance of 4 miles above the Pishquitpâhs. [Clark:] Friday 25th. of April 1806 This morning we collected our horses very conveniently and set out at 9 A M and proceeded on to a village of Pish-quit-pahs of 52 mat Lodges 11 miles this village contains about 700 soles here we turned out our horses and bought 5 dogs &amp; some wood and dined here we met with a Chief and gave him a Medal of the small size. we passed a house a little above the place we encamped on the 20th. of Octr. 1805. we offered to purchase with what articles we had such as old clothes &amp;c. emence numbers of those Indians flocked about us and behaved with distant respect toward us. we attempted to purchase some horses without suckcess. at 4 P. M set out. I was in the rear and had not proceeded verry far before one of the horses which we had hired of the Chopunnish, was taken from Hall who I had directed to ride. he had fallen behind out of my sight at the time. we proceeded on about 9 miles through a country similar to that of yesterday and encamped below the mouth of a small creek we passed at 4 miles a Village of 5 Mat Lodges of the War-war-wa1 1 The Walla Walla.—Ed. Tribe. We made a Chief and gave a Medal to a Chief of each of those two tribes. great numbers of the nativs accompanied us to our encampment. The Curloos are abundant in those places &amp; are now laying their eggs. Saw the Kildee the brown Lizzard, and a Moonax which the nativs had petted. the winds which set from Mount hood or in a westwardly direction are much more cold than those from any other quarter. there are no dews in these plains, and from the appearance of the earth there appears to have been no rain for several weeks. The pish-quit-pahs may be considered as hunters as well as fishermen as they spend the fall &amp; winter months in that occupation. they are generally pleasently featured of good statu[r]e and well proportioned both women and men ride extreamly well. their bridle is usially a hair rope tied with both ends to the under Jaw of the horse, and their saddles consist of a pad of dressed skin stuffed with goats hair with wooden sturreps. almost all the horses I have seen in the possession of the Indians have sore backs. The pishquitpahs women for the most part dress with short shirts which reach to their knees long legins and mockersons, they also use long robes; some of them weare only the truss and robe, they brade their hair as before discribed but the heads of neither the male nor female of this tribe are so much flattened as the nativs lower down on this river. We were accompanied by 18 or 20 young men on horsback. we continued our rout about 9 miles, where finding as maney willows as would answer our purpose for fuel we encamped for the night, the country we passed through was sandy indifferent rocky and hills on the left. proceeded up on the North Side the river hills are about 250 feet high &amp; generally abrupt and craggey in maney places faced with a pirpendicular and solid rock. this rock is black and hard. leavel plains extend themselves from the top of the river hills to a great distance on either side of the river. the soil is not as fertile as about the falls tho it produces low grass on which the horses feed very conveniently. it astonished me to see the order of their horses at this season of the year when I know they had wintered on dry grass of the plains and at the same time rode with greater severity than is common among ourselves. I did not see a single horse which could be deemed pore, and maney of them was verry fat; their horses are generally good. this evening after we had encamped we traded for two horses with nearly the same articles we had offered at the village, these nags Capt. L—s and myself intend rideing ourselves; haveing now a sufficiency to transport with ease all our baggage and the packs of the men. we killed 6 ducks in the course of the day; one of them were of a species I had never before seen. the legs yellow and feet webbed as those of the duckinmallard. Saw great numbers of Common Lizzards. Several rattle snakes, killed by the party, they are the same as those common to the U. States. the Horned Lizzard is also common. a chief over took us. we had the fiddle played by the request of the nativs and some of the men danced. I think those plains are much more sandy than any which I have seen and the road is a bed of loose sand. made 20 miles. [Lewis:] Saturday April 26th. 1806. This morning early we set forward and at the distance of three miles entered a low level plain country of great extent. here the river hills are low and receede a great distance from the river this low country commenced on the S. side of the river about 10 miles below our encampment of last evening. these plains are covered with a variety of herbatious plants, grass, and three speceis of shrubs specimines of which I have preserved. at the distance of twelve miles we halted near a few willows which afforded us a sufficient quantity of fuel to cook our dinner which consisted of the ballance of the dogs we had purchased yesterday evening and some jirked Elk. we were overtaken today by several families of the natives who were traveling up the river with a number of horses; they continued with us much to our annoyance as the day was worm the roads dusty and we could not prevent their horses from crouding in and breaking our order of ma[r]ch without using some acts of severity which we did not wish to commit. after dinner we continued our march through the level plain near the river 16 ms. and encamped1 1 Immediately below the mouth of the Umatilla River, but on the Washington side; at its mouth is a town of the same name.—Ed. about a mile below three lodges of the Wollahwollah nation, and about 7 ms. above our encampment of the 19 of October last. after we encamped a little Indian boy caught several chubbs with a bone in this form which he substituted for a hook. these fish were of about 9 inches long small head large abdomen, small where the tail joined the body, the tail wide long in proportion and forked, the back and ventral fins were equadistant from the head and had each 10 bony rays, the f[i]ns next the gills nine each and that near the tail 12. the upper exceeded the under jaw, the latter is truncate at the extremity and the tonge and pallet are smooth. the colour is white on the sides and belley and a blewish brown on the back. the iris of the eye is of a silvery colour and puple black.2 2 Coues identifies this as Mylochilus caurinus.—Ed. we covered ourselves partially this evening from the rain by means of an old tent. [Clark:] Saturday April 26th 1806 This morning early we proceeded on and at the distance of three miles entered a low leavel plain country of great extent. here the river hills are low and receed a great distance from the river this low country commenced on the South Side about 10 miles below our Encampment of the last night, those plains are covered with a variety of herbatious plants, Grass and 3 species of shrubs. at the distance of 12 miles halted near some willows which afforded us a sufficent quantity of fuel to cook our dinner which consisted of the ballance of the dogs we had purchased yesterday evening and some jerked Elk. we were overtaken to day by several families of the nativs who' were traveling up the river with a Numr. of horses; they continued with us much to our ennoyance as the day was worm the roads dusty and we could not prevent their horses crouding in and breaking our order of March without useing some acts of severity which we did not wish to commit. after dinner we continued our march through a leavel plain near the river 16 miles and encamped about a mile below 3 Lodges of the fritened band of the Wallahwallah nation, and about 7 miles above our encampment of the 19th. of Octr. last. after we encamped a little Indian boy cought several chubbs with a bone in this form which he substituted for a hook. those fish were of about 9 inches long. we covered our selves perfectly this evening from the rain by means of an old tent. Saw a Goat and a small wolf at a distance to day. made 28 miles. [Lewis:] Sunday April 27th. 1806. This morning we were detained untill 9 A.M. in consequence of the absence of one of Charbono's horses. the horse at length being recovered we set out and [passed above our camp a small river called Youmalolam riv. &amp; to] at the distance of fifteen miles passed through a country similar to that of yesterday; the hills at the extremity of this distance again approach the river and are rocky abrupt and 300 feet high. we ascended the hill and marched through a high plain 9 miles when we again returned to the river, I now thought it best to halt as the horses and men were much fatiegued altho we had not reached the Wallahwollah village as we had been led to beleive by our guide who informed us that the village was at the place we should next return to the river, and the consideration of our having but little provision had been our inducement to make the march we had made this morning. we collected some of the dry stalks of weeds and the stems of a shrub which resembles the southernwood; made a small fire and boiled a small quantity of our jerked meat on which we dined; while here the principal Cheif of the Wallahwallahs joined us with six men of his nation. this Cheif by name Yel-lept! had visited us on the morning of the 19 of October at our encampment a little below this place; we gave him at that time a small medal,1 1 "His medal found last year [1891?]on an island about mouth of Wallawalla River." His village was in Yakima Co., Wash., opposite mouth of Walla Walla River, where is town of Wallula.—Coues (L. and C., iii, pp. 970–971). See our vol. iii, pp. 132–134.—Ed. "The Walla Walla tribe are descended from slaves formerly owned and liberated by the Nez Percé Indians. They permitted their slaves to reside and to intermarry in their families, and reasoning on the principles of natural justice, they concluded that it was not right to hold in slavery their own descendants, and liberated them, and they are now a respectable tribe."—Rev. S. Parker (Journal of Exploring Tour, p. 249). and promised him a larger one on our return. he appeared much gratifyed at seeing us return, invited us to remain at his village three or four days and assured us that we should be furnished with a plenty of such food as they had themselves, and some horses to assist us on our journey. after our scanty repast we continued our march accompanyed by Yellept and his party to the village which we found at the distance of six miles situated on the N. side of the river at the lower side of the low country about 12 ms. below the entrance of Lewis's river. This Cheif is a man of much influence not only in his own nation but also among the neighbouring tribes and nations. This Village consists of 15 large mat lodges, at present they seem to subsist principally on a speceis of mullet which weigh from one to three lbs. and roots of various discriptions which these plains furnish them in great abundance, they also take a few salmon trout of the white kind. Yellept haranged his village in our favour intreated them to furnish us with fuel and provision and set the example himself by bringing us an armfull of wood and a platter of 3 roasted mullets, the others soon followed his example with rispect to fuel and we soon found ourselves in possession of an ample stock. they birn the stems of the shrubs in the plains there being no timber in their neighbourhood of any discription. we purchased four dogs of these people on which the party suped heartily having been on short allowance for near two days. the Indians retired when we requested them this evening and behaved themselves in every rispect extreemly well. the indians informed us that there was a good road which passed from the Columbia opposite to this village to the entrance of the Kooskooske on the S. side of Lewis's river; they also informed us, that there were a plenty of deer and antelopes on the road, with good water and grass. we knew that a road in that direction if the country would permit it would shorten our rout at least 80 miles, the indians also informed us that the country was level and the road good, under these circumstances we did not hesitate in pursuing the rout recommended by our guide whos information was corroberated by Yellept &amp; others. we concluded to pass our horses over early in the morning. [Clark:] Sunday April 27th. 1806 This morning we were detained untill 9 A M in consequence of the absence of one of Shabono's horses, the horse being at length recovered we set out and to the distance of 15 miles passed through a country similar to that of yesterday. (passed Muscle Shell rapid) and at the expiration of this distance [the cliffs] again approached the river, and are rocky abrupt and 300 feet high. we assended the hill and marched through a high plain 10 miles where we again returned to the river. we halted, altho we had not reached the Wal-lah-lah-lah Village as we had been led to believe by our guide who informed us that the village was at the place we should next return to the river, and the consideration of our haveing but little provisions had been our inducement to make the march we had made this morning, we collected some of the dry stalks of weeds and the stems of shrubs or weeds which resemble the southern wood; made a small fire and boiled a small quantity of our jerked meat on which we dined; while here we were met by the principal Chief of the Wal-lah-wal-lah Nation and several of his nation, this chief by name Yel-Iep-pet had visited us on the morning of the 19th of Octr. at our encampment imediately opposit to us; we gave him at that time a small medal, and promised him a large one on our return. he appeared much gratified at seeing us return. he envited us to remain at his Village 3 or 4 days and assured us that we should be furnished with a plenty of such food as they had themselves, and some horses to assist us on our journey. after our scanty repast we continued our march accompanied by Yelleppit and his party to the Village which we found at the distance of six miles, situated on the North Side of the river, about 16 miles below the enterance of Lewis's river. This Chief is a man of much influence not only in his own nation but also among the neighbouring tribes and nations. the village consists of 15 large mat Lodges. at present they seam to subsist principally on a species of mullet which weighs from one to 3 pds. and roots of various discriptions which those plains furnish them in great abundance. They also take a fiew salmon trout of the white kind. Yelleppet haranged his village in our favor intreated them to furnish us with fuel &amp; provisions and set the example himself by bringing us an armfull of wood, and a platter with 3 rosted mullets. the others soon followed his example with respect to fuel and we soon found ourselves in possession of an ample stock they burn the stems of the shrubs in the plains, there being no timber In this neighbourhood of any discription. we purchased 4 dogs of those people on which the party suped hartily haveing been on short allowance for near 2 days. the Indians retired when we requested them this evening and behaved themselves in every respect very well. the Indians informed us that there was a good road which passed from the Columbia opposit to this Village to the enterance of Kooskooske on the S. Side of Lewis's river, they also informed us, there were a plenty of Deer and Antilopes on the road with good water and grass. we knew that a road in that direction if the country would permit It would shorten the rout at least 80 miles. the Indians also inform us that the country was leavel and the road good, under those circumstances we did not hesitate in pursueing the rout recommended by our guide and corroberated by Yelleppit and others. we concluded to pass our horses over early in the morning. made 31 miles to day. [Lewis:] Monday April 28th 1806. This morning early Yellept brought a very eligant white horse to our camp and presented him to Capt. C. signifying his wish to get a kettle but on being informed that we had already disposed of every kettle we could possible spear he said he was content with whatever he thought proper to give him. Capt. C. gave him his swoard (for which he had expressed a great desire) a hundred balls and powder and some s[m]all articles with which he appeared perfectly satisfyed. it was necessary before we entered on our rout through the plains where we were to meet with no lodges or resident indians that we should lay in a stock of provision and not depend altogether on the gun. we directed Frazier to whom we have intrusted the duty of making those purchases to lay in as many fat dogs as he could procure; he soon obtained ten. being anxious to depart we requested the Cheif to furnish us with canoes to pass the river, but he insisted on our remaining with him this day at least, that he would be much pleased if we would conse[n]t to remain two or three, but he would not let us have canoes to leave him today. that he had sent for the Chym nap′-pos1 1 A tribe known later as Yakima, resident on the river of that name; both they and the Wallawallas were of the Shahaptian family.—Ed. his neighbours to come down and join his people this evening and dance for us. we urged the necessity of our going on immediately in order that we might the sooner return to them with the articles which they wished but this had no effect, he said that the time he asked could not make any considerable difference. I at length urged that there was no wind blowing and that the river was consequently in good order to pass our horses and if he would furnish us with canoes for that purpose we would remain all night at our present encampment, to this proposition he assented and soon produced us a couple of canoes by means of which we passed our horses over the river safely and hubbled them as usual. we found a Shoshone woman, prisoner among these people by means of whome and Sahcahgarweah we found the means of conversing with the Wallahwallahs. we conversed with them for several hours and fully satisfyed all their enquiries with rispect to ourselves and the objects of our pursuit. they were much pleased. they brought several diseased persons to us for whom they requested some medical aid. one had his knee contracted by the rheumatism, another with a broken arm &amp;c. to all of which we administered much to the gratification of those poor wretches. we gave them some eye-water which I beleive will render them more essential service than any other article in the medical way which we had it in our power to bestoe on them. [Cap C Splintered the arm of the man which was broke.] soar eyes seem to be a universal complaint amonge these people; I have no doubt but the fine sand of these plains and river (fishing on the waters too) contribute much to this disorder, ulsers and irruptions of the skin on various parts of the body are also common diseases among them. a little before sunset the Chymnahpos arrived; they were about 100 men and a few women; they joined the Wallahwollahs who were about the same number and formed a half circle arround our camp where they waited very patiently to see our party dance. the fiddle was played and the men amused themselves with dancing about an hour. we then requested the Indians to dance which they very cheerfully complyed with; they continued their dance untill 10 at night. the whole assemblage of indians about 550 men women and children sung and danced at the same time. most of them stood in the same place and merely jumped up to the time of their music. some of the men who were esteemed most brave entered the spase arrond which the main body were formed in solid column, and danced in a circular manner sidewise. at 10 P.M. the dance concluded and the natives retired; they were much gratifyed with seeing some of our party join them in their dance. [Clark:] Monday April 28th. 1806 This morning early the Great Chief Yelleppet brought a very eligant white horse to our camp and presented him to me, signifying his wish to get a kittle but being informed that we had already disposed of every kittle we could possibly spare he said he was content with whatever I thought proper to give him. I gave him my Swoard, 100 balls &amp; powder and some small articles of which he appeared perfectly satisfied. it was necessary before we entered on our rout through the plains where we were to meet with no lodges or resident Indians that we should lay in a stock of provisions and not depend altogether on the gun. we derected R. Frazer to whome we have intrusted the duty of makeing the purchases, to lay in as maney fat dogs as he could procure; he soon obtained 10, being anxious to depart we requested the Chief to furnish us with canoes to pass the river, but he insisted on our remaining with him this day at least, that he would be much pleased if we would consent to remain two or 3 days, but he would not let us have canoes to leave him this day. that he had sent for the Chim-na-pums his neighbours to come down and join his people this evening and dance for us. We urged the necessity of our proceeding on imediately in order that we might the sooner return to them, with the articles which they wished brought to them but this had no effect, he said that the time he asked could not make any considerable difference. I at length urged that there was no wind blowing and that the river was consequently in good order to pass our horses and if he would furnish us with canoes for that purpose we would remain all night at our present encampment, to this proposition he assented and soon produced a canoe. I saw a man who had his knee contracted who had previously applyed to me for some medisene, that if he would fournish another canoe I would give him some medisene. he readily consented and went himself with his canoe by means of which we passed our horses over the river safely and hobbled them as usial. We found a Sho-sho-ne woman, prisoner among those people by means of whome and Sah-cah-gah-weah, Shabono's wife we found means of converceing with the Wallahwallârs. we conversed with them for several hours and fully satisfy all their enquiries with respect to our Selves and the Objects of our pursute. they were much pleased. they brought several disordered persons to us for whome they requested some medical aid. one had his knee contracted by the Rhumitism (whome is just mentioned above) another with a broken arm &amp;c. to all of whome we administered much to the gratification of those pore wretches, we gave them some eye water which I believe will render them more essential sirvice than any other article in the medical way which we had it in our power to bestow on them sore eyes seam to be a universal complaint among those people; I have no doubt but the fine sands of those plains and the river contribute much to the disorder. The man who had his arm broken had it loosely bound in a piece of leather without any thing to surport it. I dressed the arm which was broken short above the wrist &amp; supported it with broad sticks to keep it in place, put [it] in a sling and furnished him with some lint bandages &amp;c. to Dress it in future. a little before sun set the Chimnahpoms arrived; they were about 100 men and a fiew women; they joined the Wallahwallahs who were about 150 men and formed a half circle arround our camp where they waited verry patiently to see our party dance. the fiddle was played and the men amused themselves with danceing about an hour. we then requested the Indians to dance which they very chearfully complyed with; they continued their dance untill 10 at night. the whole assemblage of Indians about 350 men women and children sung and danced at the same time. Most of them danced in the same place they stood and mearly jumped up to the time of their musick. Some of the men who were esteemed most brave entered the space around which the main body were formed in solid column and danced in a circular manner side wise. at 10 P M. the dance ended and the nativs retired; they were much gratified in seeing some of our party join them in their dance. one of their party who made himself the most conspicious charecter in the dance and songs, we were told was a medesene man &amp; could foretell things. that he had told of our comeing into their country and was now about to consult his God the Moon if what we said was the truth &amp;c. &amp;c. [Lewis:] Tuesday April 29th. 1806. This morning Yellept furnished us with two canoes and we began to transport our baggage over the river; we also sent a party of the men over to collect the horses. we purchased some dogs and shappellell this morning. we had now a store of 12 dogs for our voyage through the plains. by 11 A.M. we had passed the river1 1 At this point was old Fort Wallawalla (also called Fort Nez-percé). This is now the town of Wallula.—Ed. with our party and baggage but were detained several hours in consequence of not being able to collect our horses. our guide now informed us that it was too late in the evening to reach an eligible place to encamp; that we could not reach any water before night. we therefore thought it best to remain on the Wallahwollah river2 2 Here are a great many of the natives encamped on a large creek, which comes in from the south, and those on the north side are moving over as fast as they can. —Gass (p. 298). about a mile from the Columbia untill the morning, and accordingly encamped on that river near a fish wear. this wear consists of two curtains of small willow switches matted together with four lines of withs of the same materials exten[d]ing quite across the river, parrallel with ea[c]h other and about 6 feet assunder. those are supported by several parsels of poles placed in the manner before discribed of the fishingwears. these curtains of willow are either roled at one end for a few feet to permit the fish to pass or are let down at pleasure. they take their fish which at present are a mullet only of from one to five lbs., with small seines of 15 or 18 feet long drawn by two persons; these they drag down to the wear and raise the bottom of the seine against the willow curtain. they have also a small seine maniaged by one person it bags in the manner of the scooping net; the one side of the net is confined to a simicircular bow of half the size of a man's arm and about 5 feet long, the other side is confined to a strong string which being attached to the extremities of the bow forms the cord line to the simicircle. The Wallahwollah river discharges itself into the Columbia on it's S. side 15 miles below the entrance of Lewis's river or the S.E. branch. a high range of hills pass the Columbia just below the entrance of this river. this is a handsome stream about 4 1/2 feet deep and 50 Yds. wide; it's bed is composed of gravel principally with some sand and mud; the banks are abrupt but not high, tho' it dose not appear to overflow; the water is clear. the indians inform us that it has it's s[o]urces in the range of mountains in view of us to the E and S.E. these mountains commence a little to the south of Mt. Hood and extending themselves in a N. Easterly direction terminate near a Southe[r]n branch of Lewis's river short of the Rocky mountains.1 1 These are the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington. —Ed. The Towannahiooks river, river LaPage (You ma lol am R)2 2 These rivers (in same order) are now known as Des Chutes, John Day, and Umatilla.—Ed. and the Wollah-wollah rivers all take their rise on the N side of these mountains; two principal branches of the first of these take their rise in Mountains Jefferson and hood. these [Cascade] mountains are covered with snow at present tho' do not appear high; they seperate the waters of the Multnomah from those of the Columbia river. they appear to be about 65 or 70 miles distant from hence. The Snake indian prisoner informed us that at some distance in the large plains to the South of those [Blue] mountains there was a large river runing to the N.W. which was as wide as the Columbia at this place which is nearly one mile. this account is no doubt some what exagerated but it serves to evince the certainty of the Multnomah being a very large river and that it's waters are seperated from the Columbia by those mountains and that with the aid of a southwardly branch of Lewis's river which passes arrond the eastern extremity of those mountains, it must water that vast tract of country extending from those mountains to the waters of the gulph of California. and no doubt it heads with the Yellowstone river [waters of the Missouri] and the del Nord. we gave small medals to two inferior cheifs of this nation and they each presented us a fine horse in return we gave them sundry articles and among others one of my case pistols and several hundred rounds of amunition. there are 12 other lodges of the Wollah wollah nation on this river a little distance below our camp. these as well as those beyond the Columbia appear to depend on this fishing wear for their subsistence. these people as well as the Chymnahpos are very well dressed, much more so particularly their women than they were as we decended the river last fall most of them have long shirts and leggings, good robes and mockersons. their women wear the truss when they cannot procure the shirt, but very few are seen with the former at this moment. I presume the success of their winters hunt has produced this change in their attire. they all cut their hair in their forehead and most of the men wear the two cews over each sholder in front of the body; some have the addition of a few small plats formed of the earlocks and others tigh a small bundle of the docked foretop in front of the forehead. their ornaments are such as discribed of the nations below and are woarn in a similar manner. they insisted on our dancing this evening but it rained a little the wind blew hard and the weather was cold, we therefore did not indulge them. [Clark:] Tuesday April 29th. 1806 This morning Yelleppit furnished us with 2 canoes, and We began to transport our baggage over the river; we also sent a party of the men over to collect our horses. we purchased some deer [dogs] and chappellell this morning. we had now a store of 12 dogs for our voyage through the plains. by 11 A. M. we had passed the river with our party and baggage but were detained several hours in consequence of not being able to collect our horses. our guide now informed us that it was too late in the evening to reach an eligible place to encamp; that we could not reach any water before night. we therefore thought it best to remain on the Wallahwallah river about a mile from the Columbia untill the morning, accordingly encamped on the river near a fish wear. this weare consists of two curtains of small willows wattled together with four lines of withes of the same materials extending quite across the river, parralal with each other and about 6 feet asunder. those are supported by several parrelals of poles placed in this manner those curtains of willows is either roled at one end for a fiew feet to permit the fish to pass or are let down at pleasure. they take their fish which at present are a mullet only of from one to 5 pounds wt. with small seines of 15 or 18 feet long drawn by two persons; these they drag down to the wear and rase the bottom of the seine against the willow curtain. they have also a small seine managed by one person, it bags in the manner of the scooping nets; the one side of the net is confined to a simicircular bow of half the size of a mans arm and about 5 feet long, the other side is confined to a strong string which being attatched to the extremities of the bow forms the cord line to the simicurcle. The Wallahwallah River discharges it's self into the Columbia on it's South Side 15 miles below the enterance of Lewis's River, or the S. E. branch. a range of hills pass the Columbia just below the entrance of this river. this is a handsom Stream about 4 1/2 feet deep and 50 yards wide; its bead is composed of gravel principally with some sand and mud; the banks are abrupt but not high, tho' it does not appear to overflow; the water is clear. the Indians inform us that it has it's source in the range of Mountains in view of us to the E. and S. E. these mountains commence a little to the South of Mt. Hood and extend themselves in a S Eastwardly direction terminateing near the Southern bank of Lewis's river short of the rockey mountains. To-wan-na-hi-ooks river, river Lapage and [blank space in MS.] River all take their rise in those mountains. the two principal branches of the first of those take their rise in the Mountain's, Jefferson and Hood. those mountains are covered at present with Snow. those S W. mountains are covered with Snow at present tho' do not appear high: they seperate the waters of the Multnomah from those of the Columbia river, they appear to be 65 or 70 miles distant from hence. The Snake Indian prisoner informed us that at some distance in the large plains to the South of those Mountains there was a large river running to the N.W. which was as wide as the Columbia at this place, which is nearly 1 mile. this account is no doubt somewhat exagurated but it serves to evince the certainty of the Multnomah being a very large river and that it's waters are seperated from the Columbia by those mountains, and that with the aid of a Southwardly branch of Lewis's river which pass around the Eastern extremity of those mountains, it must water that vast tract of country extending from those mountains to the Waters of the Gulf of Callifornia. and no doubt it heads with the Rochejhone and Del Nord. We gave small Medals to two inferior Chiefs of this nation, and they each furnished us with a fine horse, in return we gave them Sundery articles among which was one of Capt. Lewis's pistols &amp; several hundred rounds of amunition. there are 12 other Lodges of the Wallahwallah Nation on this river a short distance below our Camp. those as well as those beyond the Columbia appear to depend on their fishing weres [weirs] for their subsistance. those people as well as the Chymnapoms are very well disposed, much more so particular[ly] their women than they were when we decended the river last fall. Most of them have long shirts and leggins, good robes and mockersons. their women were the truss when they cannot precure the shirt, but very fiew are seen with the former at the present. I prosume the suckcess of their winters hunt has produced this change in their attire. they all cut their hair in the forehead. and most of the men ware the two cews over each sholder in front of the body; some have the addition of a fiew small plats formed of the eare locks, and others tigh a small bundle of the docked foretop in front of the forehead, their orniments are such as discribed of the nativs below, and are worn in a similar manner. they insisted on our danceing this evening, but it rained a little the wind blew hard and the weather was cold, we therefore did not indulge them. Several applyed to me to day for medical aide, one a broken arm another inward fevers and several with pains across their loins, and sore eyes. I administered as well as I could to all. in the evening a man brought his wife and a horse both up to me. the horse he gave me as a present and his wife who was verry unwell the effects of violent coalds was placed before me. I did not think her case a bad one and gave such medesene as would keep her body open and raped her in flannel. left some simple medesin to be taken. we also gave some Eye water 1 G[rain] of Ela v V. &amp; 2 grs. of Sacchm Stry to an ounce of water and in that perportion.1 1 2 grs. of Sacchm Stry = a grains of Saccharum Saturni = Sugar of Lead = Acetate of Lead. This chemical was by the early chemists designated sugar of lead, because of its sweet taste, In striking contrast to the acid taste of the acetic acid in which the saturnum or lead oxide was dissolved. The acetate of lead being identified as the second ingredient, the first ingredient, in all probability, is sulphate of zinc. The capital "V" evidently is used as abbreviation for vitriolum or vitriol. The name vitriol was applied to all salts of the common metals possessing a vitreous lustre: blue vitriol = copper sulphate, green vitriol = iron sulphate, white vitriol = zinc sulphate. Inasmuch as white vitriol was made from calamine (zinc carbonate) by dissolving it in oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid), the name calaminae vitriolum follows as another synonym for this substance. The "Ela" may, therefore, be regarded as a corruption of Cal(aminae); the small "v" possibly serves as abbreviation for venale, or commercial, a term commonly used in pharmacy to designate articles that are not pure. Without the "Ela" the "v V" might be interpreted as viride Vitriolum = green vitriol or iron sulphate. This, however, is not probable. Externally, lead and zinc salts are astringents, the latter somewhat less powerful than the former. Of the zinc salts, the most powerful are the "sulphate and acetate; of the lead salts, the acetate is almost exclusively used for this purpose. They act astringently by coagulating the albumin of the discharge, thus forming a protective coat; they also coagulate the albumin in the tissues themselves, and contract the small vessels. Plain solutions of these salts are applied to the eye in conjunctivitis, the inflammation of the mucous membrane covering the anterior portion of the globe of the eye.—Edward Kremers (director of School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin).

This morning we had some difficulty in collecting our horses notwithstanding we had hubbled and picquited those we obtained of these people, we purchased two other horses this morning and several dogs. we exchanged one of our most indifferent horses for a very good one with the Chopunnish man who has his family with him. this man has a daughter new arrived at the age of puberty, who being in a certain situation [mences] is not permitted to ascociate with the family but sleeps at a distance from her father's camp and when traveling follows at some distance behind. in this state I am informed that the female is not permitted to eat, nor to touch any article of a culinary nature or manly occupation. at 10 A.M. we had collected all our horses except the white horse which Yellept had given Capt. C. the whole of the men soon after returned without being able to find this horse. I lent my horse to Yellept to surch Capt. C's about half an hour after he set out our Chopunnish man brought up Capt. C's horse we now determined to leave one man to bring on my horse when Yellept returned and to proceed on with the party accordingly took leave of these friendly honest people the Wollahwollahs and departed at 11 A.M. accompanyed by our guide and the Chopunnish man and family. we continued our rout N.30.E. 14 ms. through an open level sandy plain to a bold Creek 10 yds. wide, this stream is a branch of the Wallahwollah river into which it discharges itself about six miles above the junction of that river with the Columbia. it takes it's rise in the same range of mountains to the East of the sources of the main branch of the same. it appears to be navigable for canoes; it is deep and has a bold current. there are many large banks of pure sand which appear to have been drifted up by the wind to the hight of 15 or 20 feet, lying in many parts of the plain through which we passed today. this plain as usual is covered with arromatic shrubs hurbatious plants and a short grass. many of those plants produce those esculent roots which form a principal part of the subsistence of the natives. among others there is one which produces a root somewhat like the sweet pittaitoe.1 1 This root, also mentioned May 4, 1806, post, may be Lomatium macrocarpum, C. &amp; R.—C. V. Piper. we encamped at the place we intersepted the creek2 2 On Touchet River. The expedition left the Columbia at Wallula, travelling by land N. E. to the Clearwater, by what is generally known as the "overland route" across eastern Washington. It is traced on Stevens's map in his Report Explor. for R. R. to Pacific, vol. xii.—Ed. where we had the pleasure once more to find an abundance of good wood for the purpose of making ourselves comfortable fires, which has not been the case since we left rockfort camp. Drewyer killed a beaver and an otter; a part of the former we reserved for ourselves and gave the indians the ballance. these people will not eat the dog but feast heartily on the otter which is vastly inferior in my estimation, they sometimes also eat their horses, this indeed is common to all the indians who possess this annimal in the plains of the Columbia; but it is only done when necessity compells them. the narrow bottom of this [Wallowwallow] creek is very fertile, tho' the plains are poor and sandy. the hills of the creek are generally abrupt and rocky. there is a good store of timber on this creek at least 20 fold more than on the Columbia river itself. it consists of Cotton wood, birch, the crimson haw,1 1 The birch is Betula fontinalis, Sargent. There are three haws on the Upper Columbia. The common one, Crataegus douglasii, has black berries (the "purple haw" of April 12, 1806); the other two, C. columbiana and C. piperi have red berries. The first mentioned is very common; the other two are rare. I judge most of the references relate to C. douglasii. The identification in Coues (L. and C., iii, p. 1041) is surely wrong.—C. V. Piper. redwillow, sweetwillow, chokecherry yellow currants, goosberry, whiteberryed honeysuckle rose bushes, seven bark, and shoemate [sumac]. I observed the corngrass2 2 See journal for June 5, vol. v, post.—Ed. and rashes in some parts of the bottom. Reubin Feilds overtook us with my horse. our stock of horses has now encresed to 23 and most of them excellent young horses, but much the greater portion of them have soar backs. these indians are cruell horse-masters; they ride hard, and their saddles are so illy constructed that they cannot avoid wounding the backs of their horses; but reguardless of this they ride them when the backs of those poor annimals are in a horrid condition. [Clark:] Wednesday April. 30th. 1806 This morning we had some dificuelty in collecting our horses notwithstanding we had hobbled &amp; Picqueted those we obtained of those people. We purchased two other horses this morning and 4 dogs. we exchanged one of our most indiferent horses for a very good one with the Choponnish man who has his family with him. this man has a doughter now arived at the age of puberty who being a certain situation, is not permited to acoiate with the family but sleeps at a distance from her father's camp, and when traveling follows at some distance behind. in this state I am informed that the female is not permited to eat, nor to touch any article of a culinary nature or manly occupation. at 10 A.M. we had collected all our horses except the white horse which Yelleppit the Great Chief had given me. the whole of the men haveing returned without being able to find this hors, I informed the Chief and he mounted Capt Lewis's horse and went in serch of the horse himself. about half an hour after the Chopunnish man brought my horse. we deturmined to proceed on with the party leaveing one man to bring up Capt L.—s horse when Yelleppit should return. We took leave of those honest friendly people the Wallahwallahs and departed at 11 A.M. accompanied by our guide and the Chopunnish man and family. we continued our rout N. 30°. E. 14 ms. through an open leavel sandy Plain to a bold creek 10 yards wide, this stream is a branch of the Wallahwallah river, and takes its rise in the same range of mountains to the East of the main branch. deep and has a bold current. there are maney large banks of pure sand which appear to have been drifted up by the wind to the hight of 20 or 30 feet, lying in maney parts of the plains through which we passed to day. This plain as usial is covered with arromatic shrubs, hurbatious plants and tufts of short grass. maney of those plants produce those esculent roots which forms a principal part of the subsistance of the nativs. among others there is one which produces a root somewhat like the sweet potato. We encamped at the place we intersepted the creek where we had the pleasure once more to find a sufficency of wood for the purpose of makeing ourselves comfortable fires, which has not been the case since we left rock fort camp below the falls. Drewyer killed a beaver and an otter. the narrow bottoms of this creek is fertile, tho' the plains are pore &amp; sandy. the hills of the creek are generaly abrupt and rocky. there is some timber on this creek. it consists of Cotton wood, birch. the crimson haw, red willow, sweet willow, choke cherry, yellow current, goose berry, white berried honey suckle, rose bushes, seven bark, shoemate &amp;c. &amp;c. rushes in some parts of the bottoms. R. Fields over took us with Capt Lewis's horse. our stock of horses have now increased to 23 and most of them excellent young horses. but much the greatest part of them have sore backs. those Indians are cruel horse masters; they ride hard and their saddles illey constructed. &amp;c. &amp;c. [Lewis:] Thursday May 1st. 1806. We collected our horses tolerably early this morning took breakfast and set out a little after 7 A.M. we pursued the indian road which led us up the creek about nine miles, here the Chopunnish man w[h]o was in front with me informed that an old unbeaten tract which he pointed out to the left was our nearest rout. we halted the party and directed them to unload and let their horses graize untill our guide came up who was at some distance behind. I wished to obtain good information of this newly recommended tract before I could consent to leave the present road which seemed to lead us in the proper direction was level and furnished with wood and water. when the guide arrived he seemed much displeased with the other, he assured us that the rout up the creek was the nearest, and much the best, that if we took the other we would be obliged to remain here untill tomorrow morning, and then travel a whole day before we could reach water, and that there was no wood; the other agreed that this was the case. we therefore did not hesitate to pursue the rout recommended by the guide. the creek, it's bottom lands, and the appearance of the plains were much as those of [y]esterday only with this difference that the latter were not so sandy. we had sent out four hunters this morning two on foot and 2 on horseback they joined us while we halted here. Drewyer had killed a beaver. at 1 P.M. we resumed our march, leaving the Chopunnish man and his family; he had determined to remain at that place untill the next morning and then pursue the rout he had recommended to us. he requested a small quantity of powder and lead which we gave him. we traveled 17 miles this evening, making a total of 26 Ms. and encamped. the first 3 miles of our afternoons march was through a similar country with that of the forenoon; the creek bottoms then became higher and widened to the extent of from 2 to 3 ms. the hills on the N. side were low but those on the opposite side retained their hight. we saw a number of deer of which Labuish killed one. the timber on the creek becomes more abundant and it's extensive bottoms affords a pleasent looking country. the guide informs us that we shall now find a plenty of wood water and game quite to the Kooskooske. we saw a great number of the Curloos, some Grains, ducks, prarie larks and several speceis of sparrows common to the praries. I see very little difference between the apparent face of the country here and that of the plains of the Missouri only that these are not enlivened by the vast herds of buffaloe Elk &amp;c. which ornament the other. the courses and distances of this day are N. 45 E. 9 M. and N. 75. E. 17. M. along the Northern side of this creek to our encampment. some time after we had encamped, three young men arrived from the Wallahwollah village bringing with them a steel trap belonging to one of our party which had been neglegently left behind; this is an act of integrity rarely witnessed among indians. during our stay with them they several times found the knives of the men which had been carelessly lossed by them and returned them. I think we can justly affirm to the honor of these people that they are the most hospitable, honest, and sincere people that we have met with in our voyage. [Clark:] Thursday May 1st.. 1806 This morning we collected our horses and made an early start, haveing preveously sent a hea[d] 4 hunters with directions to proceed up the Creek and kill every Species of game which they might meet with. the Small portion of rain which fell last night caused the road to be much former and better than yesterday. the morning cloudy and cool. we proceeded up the Creek on the N.E. Side through a countrey of less sand and some rich bottoms on the creek which is partially supplyed with small cotton trees, willow, red willow, choke cherry, white thorn, birch, elder, [blank space in MS.] rose &amp; honey suckle. Great portion of these bottoms has been latterly burnt which has entirely distroyed the timbered growth. at the distance of nine miles we over took our hunters, they had killed one beaver only at this place the road forked, one leaveing the creek and the corse of it is nearly North. the Chopunnish who had accompanied us with his family informed us that this was our best way. that it was a long distance without water. and advised us to camp on the creek at this place and in the morning to set out early. This information perplexed us a little, in as much as the idea of going a days march without water, thro an open sandy plain and on a course 50°. out of our derection. we deturmined to unlode and wate for our guide, or the Chopunnish man who had accompanied us from the long Narrows, who was in the rear with Drewyer our interpreter. on his arrival we enquired of him which was the best and most direct road for us to take. he informed us that the road pointed out by his cumerade was through a open hilly and sandy countrey to the river Lewis's River, and was a long ways around, and that we could not git to any water to day. the other roade up the creek was a more direct course, plenty of water wood and only one hill in the whole distance and the road which he had always recomended to us. Some words took place between those two men the latter appeared in great pation mounted his horse and set out up the creek. we sent a man after him and brought him back informed him that we believed what he said and should imediately after dinner proceed on the road up the creek with him. we gave the former man some powder and ball which had been promised him, and after an early dinner set out up the creek with our guide leaveing the Chopunnish man and his family encamped at the forks of the road where they intended to stay untill the morning and proceed on the rout he had recommended to us. We traviled 17 miles this evening makeing a total of 26 mls. and encamped. the first 3 miles of our afternoon march was through a simaler country of that of the fore noon; the Creek bottoms then became higher and wider; to the extent of from 2 to 3 miles. We saw several Deer of which Labiech killed one. the timber on the Creek become more abundant and less burnt, and its extensive bottoms afford a pleasent looking country. We saw a Great number of Curloos, some crains, Ducks, prarie cocks, and several species of sparrows common to the praries. I see very little difference between the apparant face of the country here and that of the plains of the Missouri, only that those are not enlivened by the vast herds of Buffalow, Elk &amp;c. which animated those of the Missouri. The courses &amp; distances of this day are N. 45°. E. 9 mls. &amp; N. 75°. E. 17 Miles allong the North Side of this Creek to our encampment. sometime after we had encamped three young men arrived from the Wallahwallah Village bringing with them a steel trap belonging to one of our party which had been negligently left behind; this is an act of integrity rearly witnessed among Indians. dureing our stay with them they several times found the knives of the men which had been carefully lossed by them and returned them. I think we can justly affirm to the honor of those people that they are the most hospitable, honist and sincere people that we have met with on our Voyage.</field>

THIS morning we dispatched two hunters a head. we had much difficulty in collecting our horses. at 8 A.M. we obtained them all except the horse we obtained from the Chopunnish man whom we seperated from yesterday. we apprehended that this horse would make some attempts to rejoin the horses of this man and accordingly had him as we thought securely hubbled both before and at the side, but he broke the strings in the course of the night and absconded. we sent several men in different directions in surch of him. I engaged one of the young indians who overtook us last evening to return in surch of him. at half after 1 P.M. The indian and Joseph Feilds returned with the horse, they had found him on his way back about 17 Ms. I paid the indian the price stipulated for his services and we immediately loaded up and set forward. steered East 3 M. over a hilly road along the N. side of the Creek, wide bottom on the S. side. a branch falls in on S. side which runs south towards the. S.W. mountains which appear to be about 25 Ms. distant low yet covered with snow. N. 75. E. 7. through an extensive level bottom. more timber than usual on the creek, some pine of the long leafed kind appears on the sides of the creek hills, also about 50 acres of well timbered pine land where we passed the creek at 4 M. on this course. N. 45. E. 9 Ms. repassed the creek at 4 M. and continued up a N. E. branch of the same which falls in about a mile below where we passed the main creek. the bottoms th[r]ough which we passed were wide. the main creek boar to the S. and heads in the Mountains; it's bottoms are much narrower above where we passed it and the hills appear high. we passed the small creek at 8 3/4 from the commencement of this course and encamped on the N. side in a little bottom, having traveled 19 miles today.1 1 This day's camp was on the Pelat Creek; at its junction with the Touchet is Dayton, Wash.—Ed. at this place the road leaves the creek and takes the open high plain. this creek is about 4 yds. wide and bears East as far as I could observe it. I observed considerable quantities of the quâmash in the bottoms through which we passed this evening now in blume. there is much appearance of beaver and otter along these creeks. saw two deer at a distance; also observed many sandhill crains Curloos and other fowls common to the plains. the soil appears to improve as we advance on this road. our hunters killed a duck only. the three young men of the Wallahwollah nation continued with us. in the course of the day I observed them eat the inner part of the young and succulent stem of a large coarse plant with a ternate leaf, the leafets of which are three loabed and covered with a woolly pubersence. the flower and fructification resembles that of the parsnip this plant is very common in the rich lands on the Ohio and it's branches the Mississippi &amp;c. I tasted of this plant found it agreeable and eat heartily of it without feeling any inconvenience.2 2 Heracleum lanatum.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Friday May 2nd 1806. This morning we dispatched two hunters a head. we had much dificuelty in collecting our horses. at 8 A. M. we obtained them all except the horses we obtained from the Chopunnish man whome we seperated from yesterday. we apprehended that this horse would make some attempts to rejoin the horses of this man and accordingly had him as we thought securely hobbled both before and at the side, but he broke the strings in the course of the night and absconded. we sent several men in different directions in serch of him, and hired one of the men who joined us last night to prosue him and over take us &amp; at 1/2 after 1 P.M. the indian and Joseph Fields returned with the horse they had found him on his way back about 17 miles. I paid the Indian the price stipulated for his services and we imediately loaded up and set forward. East 3 miles over a hilly road along the N. Side of the Creek. wide bottoms on the S. Side. a branch falls in on the S. side which runs from the S. W. Mountains, which appear to be about 25 m. distant low yet covered with snow. N. 75° E. 7 m. through an extencive leavel bottom. more timber than usial on the Creek. some pine of the long leaf kind appear on the creek hills. also about 50 acres of well timbered pine land where we passed the creek at 4 m. on the course. N. 45° E. 9 m. passed the creek at 4 m. and continued up on the N. E. Side, the bottoms wide. the main creek bear to the S. and head in the Mountains. we passed a small creek at 8 3/4 m. from the commencement of this course and encamped on the N. Side in a little bottom, haveing traviled 19 miles to day. at this place the road leaves the creek and passes through the open high plains. this creek is 5 yds wide and bears East towards the Mts. I. observed a considerable quantity of the qua mash in the bottoms through which we passed this evening now in blume. there is much appearance of beaver &amp; otter along these creeks. Saw two deer at a distance, also sand hill cranes, Curloos and fowls, common to the plains. the soil appears to improve as we advance on this road. our hunters killed a deer only. The three young men of the Wallahwallah nation continue with us in the course of this day. I observed them cut the inner part of the young and succulent stem of a large corse plant with a ternate Ieaf, the leafets of which are three loabes and covered with woolly puberscence. the flower and fructification resembles that of the parsnip. this plant is very common in the rich lands on the Ohio and its branches. I tasted of this plant found it agreeable and eate hartily of it without feeling any inconveniance. [Lewis:] Saturday May 3rd. 1806. This morning we set out at 7 A.M. steered N. 25. E. 12 Ms. to Kimooenem Creek1 1 Thus named by the explorers on their outward journey; it is now the Tukenon River, a tributary of the Snake. See our vol. iii, p. 112. The expedition struck this river near Marengo. This is not to be confused with the main or south fork of the Snake. See our vol. iii, pp. 101, 105.—Ed. through a high level plain. this creek is about 12 yds. wide pebbly bottom low banks and discharges a considerable body of water it heads in the S.W. mountains and discharges itself into Lewis's river a few miles above the narrows. the bottoms of this creek are narrow with some timber principally Cottonwood and willow. the under brush such as mentioned on N. East Creek. the hills are high and abrupt. the land of the plains is much more fertile than below, less sand and covered with taller grass; very little of the aromatic shrubs appear in this part of the plain. we halted and dined at this creek; after which we again proceeded N. 45. E. 3 M. through the high plain to a small [Pataha] creek 5 yds. wide branch of the Kimooenem C. this stream falls into the creek some miles below. the hills of this creek like those of the Kimooenem are high it's bottoms narrow and possess but little timber. lands of a good quality, a dark rich loam. we continued our rout up this creek, on it's N. side. N. 75. E. 7 Ms. the timber increases in quantity the hills continue high. East 4 Ms. up the creek. here we met with the We-ark-koomt [Weahkoonut—Biddle] whom we have usually distinguished by the name of the bighorn Cheif from the circumstance of his always wearing a horn of that animal suspended by a cord to the left arm. he is the 1st Cheif of a large band of the Chopunnish nation. he had 10 of his young men with him. this man went down Lewis's river by land as we decended it by water last fall quite to the Columbia and I beleive was very instrumental in procuring us a hospitable and friendly reception among the natives. he had now come a considerable distance to meet us. after meeting this cheif we continued still up the creek bottoms N. 75. E. 2 M to the place at which the road leaves the creek and ascends the hills to the plain here we encamped2 2 In Garfield Co., Washington, east of Pomeroy and Patah City.—Ed. in [a] small grove of cottonwood trees which in some measure broke the violence of the wind. we came 28 Ms. today, it rained hailed snowed and blowed with great violence the greater portion of the day. it was fortunate for us that this storm was from the S.W. and of course on our backs. the air was very cold. we divided the last of our dryed meat at dinner when it was consumed as well as the ballance of our dogs nearly we made but a scant supper and had not anything for tomorrow; however We-ark-koomt consoled us with the information that there was an indian lodge on the river at no great distance where we might supply ourselves with provision tomorrow. our guide and the three young Wallahwollahs left us this morning reather abruptly and we have seen nothing of them since. the S.W. mountains appear to become lower as they proceede to the N.E. this creek reaches the mountains. we are nearer to them than we were last evening. [Clark:] Saturday 3rd. May 1806. This morning we set out at 7 A. M. steared N. 25°. E 12 m. to Kimooenimm Creek through a high leavel plain. this Creek is 12 yds. wide pebbly bottom low banks and discharges a considerable quanty of water it heads in the S W. Mountains and discharges it self into Lewis's river a fiew miles above the narrows. the bottoms of this creek is narrow with some timber principally cotton wood &amp; willow. the under brash such as mentioned in the N E. creek. The hills are high and abrupt. the lands of the plains is much more furtile than below, less sand and covered with taller grass; very little of the aramatic shrubs appear in this part of the plain. we halted and dined at this Creek. after which we again proceeded N. 45°. E. 3 ms. through a high plain to a small creek 5 yds. wide, a branch of the Kimooenimm Creek. the hills of this stream like those of the Kimooenimm are high its bottoms narrow and possess but little timber. the land of a good quallity dark rich loam. we continued our rout up this creek on it's N. Side N. 75°. E 7 ms. the timber increas in quantity the hills continue high. we met with the We ark koomt whome we have usially distinguished by the name of the big horn Chief from the circumstance of his always wareing a horn of that animal suspended by a cord to his left arm. he is a 1st. chief of a large band of the Chopunnish Nation. he had ten of his young men with him. this man went down Lewis's river by Land as we decended it by water last fall quite to the Columbia, and I believe was very instrumental in precureing us a hospita[b]l[e] and friendly reception among the nativs. he had now come a considerable distance to meet us. after meeting this Chief we continued still up the creek bottoms N. 75°. E. 2 m. to the place at which the roade leaves the creek and assends the hill to the high plains. here we Encamped in a small grove of Cotton trees which in some measure broke the violence of the wind, we came 28 miles today. it rained, hailed, snowed &amp; blowed with Great Violence the greater portion of the day. it was fortunate for us that this storm was from the S.W. and of course on our backs. the air was very cold. we devided the last of our dried meat at dinner when it was consumed as well as the ballance of our dogs nearly we made but a scant supper, and had not any thing for tomorrow; however We-ark-koomt consoled us with the information that there was an Indian Lodge on the river at no great distance where we might supply ourselves with provisions tomorrow. our guide and the three young Wallahwallah's left us this morning reather abruptly and we have seen nothing of them since. the S W. Mountains appear to become lower as they receed to the N E. This creek reaches the mountains. we are much nearer to them than we were last evening. they are covered with timber and at this time snow. [Lewis:] Sunday May 4th. 1806. Collected our horses and set out early; the morning was cold and disagreeable. we ascended the Lard. hills of the creek and steered N. 60°. E. 4 miles through a high level plain to a ravine which forms the source of a small creek, thence down this creek N. 75. E. 8 Ms. to it's entrance into Lewis's river 7 1/2 ms. below the entrance of the Kooskooske.1 1 Alpowa Creek; at its mouth is Silcott. Biddle's text states (erroneously) that this creek joined the Snake above the mouth of the Kooskooskee.—Ed. on the river a little above this creek we arrived at a lodge of 6 families of which We-ark-koomt had spoken. we halted here for breakfast and with much difficulty purchase[d] 2 lean dogs. the inhabitants were miserably poor. we obtained a few large cakes of half cured bread made of a root which resembles the sweet potatoe, with these we made some soope and took breakfast. the lands through which we passed today are fertile consisting of a dark rich loam. the hills of the river are high and approach it nearly on both sides. no timber in the plains. the S. W. Mountains which appear to be about 15 Ms. above us still continue to become lower they are covered with snow at present nearly to their bases. Lewis's river appea[r]s to pass through these Mots. near their N. Eastern extremity. these hills terminate in a high level plain between the Kooskooske and Lewis's river. these plains are in many places well covered with the Longleafed pine, with some Larch and balsom fir. the soil is extreemly fertile no[r] dose it appear so thi[r]sty as that of the same apparent texture of the open plains. it produces great quantities of the quawmash a root of which the natives are extreemly fond. a great portion of the Chopunnish we are informed are now distributed in small vilages through this plain collecting the quawmash and cows;2 2 Cows or cous seems to be a generic term for the roots of various species of Lomatium. The most valuable is L. cous, Watson, gathered in great quantities by the Nez Percés.—C. V. Piper. See also U. S. Department of Agriculture Report, 1870, p. 407 (with illustration, but differently identified). For quamash see our vol. iii. p. 78, note 1.—Ed. the salmon not yet having arrived to call them to the river. the hills of the creek which we decended this morning are high and in most parts rocky and abrupt. one of our packhorses sliped from one of those hights and fell into the creek with it's load consisting principally of ammunition but fortunately neith[er] the horse nor load suffered any material injury. the amunition being secured in canisters the water did not effect it. after dinner we continued our rout up the West side of the river 3 Ms opposite to 2 lodges the one containing 3 and the other 2 families of the Chopunnish nation; here we met with Te-toh-ar-sky, the youngest of the two cheifs who accompanied us last fall [to] the great falls of the Columbia we also met with our pilot who decended the river with us as far as the Columbia. these indians recommended our passing the river at this place and ascending the Kooskooske on the N.E. side. they said it was nearer and a better rout to the forkes of that river where the twisted hair resided in whose charge we had left our horses; thither they promised to conduct us. we determined to take the advice of the indians and immediately prepared to pass the river which with the assistance of three indian canoes we effected in the course of the evening, purchased a little wood and some bread of cows (a root) from the natives and encamped having traveled 15 Ms. only today. We-ark-koomt whose people resided on the West side of Lewis's river above left us when we determined to pass the river and went on to his lodg. the evening was cold and disagreeable, and the natives crouded about our fire in great numbers insomuch that we could scarcely cook or keep ourselves warm. at all these lodges of the Chopunnish I observe an appendage of a small lodg with one fire which seems to be the retreat of their women in a certain situation [Si M] the men are not permitted to approach this lodge within a certain distance and if they have anything to convey to the occupants of this little hospital they stand at the distance of 50 or 60 paces and throw it towards them as far as they can and retire. [Clark:] Sunday May 4th. 1806. Collected our horses and set out early; the morning was cold and disagreeable. we assended the Larboard Hill of the Creek and Steared N 60°. E 4 m. through a high leavil plain to a revine which forms the source of a small creek, thence down the Creek N 75°. E. 8 ms. to it's enterance into Lewis's river 7 1/2 ms. below the enterance of Kooskooske. on the river a little above this Creek we arived at a lodge of 6 families of which We-ark′-koomt had spoken. We halted here for brackfast and with much dificuelty purchased 2 lean dogs. the inhabitants were miserably pore. we obtained a fiew large cakes of half cured bread made of a root which resembles the sweet potatoe, with these we made some soope and took brackfast. the lands through which we passed to day are fertile consisting of a dark rich loam. the hills of the river are high and abrupt approaching it nearly on both sides. no timber in the plains. the S. W. Mountains which appear to be about 15 miles from us still continue to become lower, they are covered with snow at present nearly to their bases. Lewis's river appear to pass through those Mountains near the N Eastern extremity. those hills termonate in a high leavil plain between the Kooskoske &amp; Lewis's river. these plains are in maney places well covered with the long leafed pine and some balsom fir. the soil is extreamly fertile. no[r] does it appear so thirsty as that of the same apparrant texture of the open plains. it produces great quantities of the quawmash a root of which the nativs are extreemly fond. a Great portion of the Chopunnish we are informed are now distributed in small Villages through this plain Collecting the Cowse a white meley root which is very fine in soup after being dried and pounded; the Salmon not yet haveing arived to call them to the river. The hills of the Creek which we decended this morning are high and in most parts rocky and abrupt. one of our pack horses sliped from one of those hights and fell into the Creek with it's load consisting principally of amunition, but fortunately neither the horse nor load suffered any material injury. the amunition being secured in canisters the water did not effect it. after dinner we continued our rout up the West Side of the river 3 ms opposit 2 Lodges the one containing 3 and the other 2 families of the Chopunnish Nation; here we met with Te-toh-ar-sky the oldest of the two Chiefs who accompanied us last fall to the Great falls of the Columbia. here we also met with our old pilot who decended the river with us as low as the Columbia these indians recommended our passing the river at this place and going up on the N E Side of the Kooskoske. they sayed it was nearer and a better rout to the forks of that river where the twisted hair resided in whose charge we had left our horses; thither they promised to conduct us. we determined to take the advise of the indians and imediately prepared to pass the river which with the assistance of three indian canoes we effected in the course of the evening, purchased a little wood, some Cows bread and encamped, haveing traveled 15 miles to day only. We-ark-koomt whose people reside on the West Side of Lewis's river above left us when we deturmined to pass the river. before he left us he expressed his concern that his people would be deprived of the pleasure of seeing us at the forks at which place they had assembled to shew us sivilities &amp;c. I gave him a small piece of tobacco and he went off satisfied. the evening was cold and disagreeable, and the nativs crouded about our fire in great numbers in so much that we could scercely cook or keep ourselves worm. at all those Lodges of the Chopunnish I observe an appendage of a small lodge with one fire, which seames to be the retreat of their women in a certain situation. the men are not permited to approach this Lodge within a certain distance, and if they have any thing to convey to the occupents of this little hospital they stand at the distance of 50 or 60 paces and throw it towards them as far as they can and retire. [Lewis:] Monday May 5th. 1806. Collected our horses and set out at 7 A.M. at 4 1/2 miles we arrived at the entrance of the Kooskooske, up the N. Eastern side of which we continued our march 12 Ms. to a large lodge of 10 families having passed two other large mat lodges the one at 5 and the other at 8 ms. from the mouth of the Kooskooske but not being able to obtain any provision at either of those lodges continued our march to the third where we arrived at 1 P.M. &amp; with much difficulty obtained 2 dogs and a small quan[ti]ty of root bread and dryed roots. at the second lodge we passed an indian man [who] gave Capt. C. a very eligant grey mare for which he requested a phial of eyewater which was accordingly given him. while we were encamped last fall at the entrance of the Chopunnish river Capt. C. [with much seremony washed &amp; rubd.] gave an indian man some volitile linniment to rub his k[n]ee and thye for a pain of which he complained [and was well, but had not walked for many months], the fellow soon after recovered and has never ceased to extol the virtues of our medicines and the skill of my friend Capt. C. as a phisician. this occurrence added to the benefit which many of them experienced from the eyewater we gave them about the same time has given them an exalted opinion of our medicine. my friend Capt. C. is their favorite phisician and has already received many applications. in our present situation I think it pardonable to continue this deseption for they will not give us any provision without compensation in merchandize and our stock is now reduced to a mere handfull. We take care to give them no article which can possibly injure them. we fou[n]d our Chopunnish guide at this lodge with his family. the indians brought us Capt. Clark's horse from the oposite side of the river and delivered him to us while here1 1 The old chief who is now with us says that the Snake guide, who deserted us last fall, stole and took two of our horses with him.—Gass (p. 303). . this horse had by some accedent seperated from our other horses above and had agreeably to indian information been in this neighbourhood for some weeks. while at dinner an indian fellow verry impertinently threw a poor half starved pappy nearly into my plait by way of derision for our eating dogs and laughed very heartily at his own impertinence; I was so provoked at his insolence that I caught the puppy and th[r]ew it with great violence at him and stru[c]k him in the breast and face, siezed my tomahawk and shewed him by signs if he repeated his insolence I Would tommahawk him, the fellow withdrew apparently much mortifyed and I continued my repast on dog without farther molestation. after dinner we continued our rout 4 miles to the entrance of Colter's Creek about 1/2 a mile above the rapid where we sunk the 1st. canoe as we decended the river last fall2 2 See our vol. iii, 99.—Ed. . we encamped on the lower side of this creek at a little distance from two lodges of the Chopunnish nation having traveled 20 1/2 Ms. today. one of these lodges contained eight families the other was much the largest we have yet seen. it is 156 feet long and about 15 wide built of mats and straw. in the form of the roof of a house having a number of small doors on each side, is closed at the ends and without divisions in the intermediate space this lodge contained at least 30 families.1 1 This lodge is built much after the form of the Virginia fodder-houses; is about fifty yards long, and contains twenty families.—Gass (p. 304). their fires are kindled in a row in the center of the house and about 10 feet assunder. all the lodges of these people are formed in this manner. we arrived here extreemly hungry and much fatiegued, but no articles of merchandize in our possession would induce them to let us have any article of provision except a small quantity of bread of cows and some of those roots dryed. we had several applications to assist their sick which we refused unless they would let us have some dogs or horses to eat. a man [Chief] whose wife had an absess formed on the small of her back promised a horse in the morning provided we would administer to her accordingly Capt. C. opened the absess introduced a tent and dressed it with basilicon; [Capt. C soon had more than 50 applications] I prepared some dozes of the flour of sulpher and creem of tarter which were given with directions to be taken on each morning. a little girl and sundry other patients were offered for cure but we postponed our operations untill morning; they produced us several dogs but they were so poor that they were unfit for use. This is the residence of one of 4 principal Cheifs of the nation whom they call Neesh-ne,-park-ke-ook or the cut nose from the circumstance of his nose being cut by the snake indians with a launce in battle. to this man we gave a medal of the small size with the likeness of the President. he may be a great cheif but his countenance has but little inteligence and his influence among his people seems but inconsiderable. a number of indians beside the inhabitants of these lodges geathered about us this evening and encamped in the timbered bottom on the creek near us. we met with a snake indian man at this place through whome we spoke at some length to the natives this evening with rispect to the objects which had induced us to visit their country. this address was induced at this moment by the suggestions of an old man who observed to the natives that he thought we were bad men and had come most probably in order to kill them. this impression if really entertained I beleive we effaced; they appeared well satisfyed with what we said to them, and being hungry and tired we retired to rest at 11 OClock. We-ark-koomt rejoined us this evening. this man has been of infinite service to us on several former occasions and through him we now offered our address to the natives. [Clark:] Monday May 5th. 1806 Collected our horses and set out at 7 A. M. at 4 1/2 ms. we arived at the enterance of Kooskooske, up the N E Side of which we continued our march 12 miles to a large lodge of 10 families haveing passed two other large Mat Lodges the one at 5 and the other at 8 miles from the Mouth of the Kosskooske, but not being able to obtain provisions at either of those Lodges continued our march to the 3rd. where we arived at 1 P. M. and with much dificuelty obtained 2 dogs and a small quantity of bread and dryed roots. at the second Lodge of Eight families Capt L. &amp; myself both entered smoked with a man who appeared to be a principal man. as we were about to leave his lodge and proceed on our journey, he brought forward a very eligant Gray mare and gave her to me, requesting some eye water. I gave him a phial of Eye water a handkerchief and some small articles of which he appeared much pleased. while we Were encamped last fall at the enterance of Chopunnish river, I gave an Indian man some Volitile liniment to rub his knee and thye for a pain of which he complained, the fellow soon after recovered and have never seased to extol the virtue of our medicines. near the enterance of the Kooskooske, as we decended last fall I met with a man, who could not walk with a tumure on his thye, this had been very bad and recovering fast. I gave this man a jentle pirge cleaned &amp; dressed his sore and left him some casteel soap to wash the sore which soon got well. this man also assigned the restoration of his leg to me. those two cures has raised my reputation and given those nativs an exolted oppinion of my skill as a phi[si]cian. I have already received maney applications. in our present situation I think it pardonable to continue this deception for they will not give us any provisions without compensation in merchendize, and our stock is now reduced to a mear handfull. We take care to give them no article which can possibly injure them, and in maney cases can administer &amp; give such medicine &amp; sirgical aid as will effectually restore in simple cases &amp;c. We found our Chopunnish Guide with his family. the Indians brought my horse which was left at the place we made canoes, from the opposit side and delivered him to me while here. this horse had by some accident seperated from our other horses above, and agreeably to indian information had been in this neighbourhood some weeks. while at dinner an indian fellow very impertinently threw a half starved puppy nearly into the plate of Capt. Lewis by way of derision for our eating dogs and laughed very hartily at his own impertinence; Capt L.—was so provoked at the insolence that he cought the puppy and threw it with great violence at him and struck him in the breast and face, seazed his toma-hawk, and shewed him by sign that if he repeeted his insolence that he would tomahawk him, the fellow withdrew apparently much mortified and we continued our Dinner without further molestation. after dinner we continued our rout 4 miles to the enterance of Colter's Creek about 1/2 a mile above the rapid where we sunk the 1st. canoe as we decended the river last fall. We encamped on the lower side of this creek a little distance from two Lodges of the Chopunnish nation haveing traviled 20 1/2 miles to day one of those Lodges contained 8 families, the other was much the largest we have yet seen. it is 156 feet long and about 15 feet wide built of Mats and straw, in the form of the roof of a house haveing a number of small dores on each side, is closed at the ends and without divisions in the intermediate space. this lodges at least 30 families. their fires are kindled in a row in the center of the Lodge and about 10 feet assunder. all the Lodges of these people are formed in this manner. we arrived here extreemly hungary and much fatigued, but no articles of merchindize in our possession would induce them to let us have any article of Provisions except a small quantity of bread of Cows and some of those roots dryed. We had several applications to assist their sick which we refused unless they would let us have some dogs or horses to cat. a man whose wife had an abcess formed on the small of her back promised a horse in the morning provided we would administer to her, 1 examined the abcess and found it was too far advanced to be cured. I told them her case was desperate. agreeably to their request I opened the abcess. I then introduced a tent and dressed it with bisilican; and prepared some dozes of the flour of sulpher and creem of tarter which were given with directions to be taken on each morning. a little girl and sundery other patients were brought to me for cure but we posponed our opperations untill the morning; they produced us several dogs but they were so pore that they were unfit to eat. This is the residence of one of four principal Cheafs of the nation whome they call Neesh-ne-park-ke-ook or the Cut nose from the circumstance of his nose being cut by the Snake Indians with a launce battle. to this man we gave a Medal of the small size with a likeness of the President. he may be a great Chief but his countinance has but little inteligence and his influence among his people appears very inconsiderable. a number of Indians besides the inhabitents of these Lodges gathered about us this evening and encamped in the timbered bottom on the creek near us. We met with a Snake indian man at this place through whome we spoke at some length to the nativs this evening with respect to the objects which had enduced us to visit their country. this address was induced at this moment by the Suggestions of an old man who observed to the nativs that he thought we were bad men and had come most probably in order to kill them. this impression if really entertained I believe we effected [effaced]; they appeared well satisfied with what we said to them, and being hungary and tired we retired to rest at 11 oClock. We-ark-koomt rejoined us this evening. this man has been of infinate service to us on several former occasions and through him we now offered our address to the nativs. [Lewis:] Tuesday May 6th. 1806. This morning the husband of the sick woman was as good as his word, he produced us a young horse in tolerable order which we immediately killed and butchered. the inhabitants seemed more accomodating this morning; they sold us some bread. we received a second horse for medicine and prescription for a little girl with the rheumatism. Capt. C. dressed the woman again this morning who declared that she had rested better last night than she had since she had been sick. sore eyes is an universal complaint with all the natives we have seen on the west side of the Rocky mountains. Capt. C. was busily engaged for several hours this morning in administering eye-water to a croud of applicants. we once more obtained a plentifull meal, much to the comfort of all the party. I exchanged horses with We-ark′-koomt and gave him a small flag with which he was much gratifyed. the sorrel I obtained is an eligant strong active well broke horse perfictly calculated for my purposes. at this place we met with three men of a nation called the Skeets-so-mish1 1 A Salishan tribe, identified by Hale and Gibbs as the Skitsuish or Cœur Al?ne Indians; they resided around Lake Cœur d' Alêne and on the Spokane River and its tributary the Latah. For much interesting information, with careful citations from many authors, regarding all the tribes encountered by Lewis and Clark west of the Rocky Mountains, see H. H. Bancroft, Native Races of the Pacific States (San Francisco, 1874), i, PP. 150–321.—Ed. who reside at the falls of a large river dis[c]harging itself into the Columbia on it's East side to the North of the entrance of Clark's river, this river they informed us headed in a large lake in the mountains and that the falls below which they resided was at no great distance from the lake. these people are the same in their dress and appearance with the Chopunnish, tho' their language is intirely different a circumstance which I did not learn untill we were about to set out and it was then too late to take a Vocabulary. The river here called Clark's river is that which we have heretofore called the Flathead river. I have thus named it in honour of my worthy friend and fellow traveller Capt. Clark. for this stream we know no indian name and no white man but ourselves was ever on it's principal branches, the river which Fidler calls the great lake river may possibly be a branch of it but if so it is but a very inconsiderable branch and may as probably empty itself Into the Skeets-somish as into that river. the stream which I have heretofore called Clark's river had it's three principal sources in mountains Hood, Jefferson &amp; the Northern side of the S.W. mountains and is of course a short river. this river I shall in future call the To-wanna-hiooks river it being the name by which it is called by the Eneshur nation. The Kooskooske river may be safely navigated at present all the rocks of the shoals and rapids are perfectly covered; the current is strong, the water clear and cold. this river is rising fast. The timber of this river which consists principally of the longleafed pine commences about 2 miles below our present camp on Colter's [Potlatch] Creek. it was two oclock this evening before we could collect our horses. at 3 P.M. we set out accompanyed by the brother of the twisted hair1 1 A friendly Chopunnish chief encountered by the expedition in September, 1805. See our vol. iii, pp. 82–94—Ed. and Wearkkoomt. I directed the horse which we had obtained for the purpose of eating to be led as it was yet unbroke, in performing this duty a quarrel ensued between Drewyer and Colter. we continued our march this evening along the river 9 miles to a lodge of 6 families, built of sticks mats &amp; dryed hay in the same form of those heretofore discribed. we passed a lodge of 3 families at 4 ms. on the road. no provision of any description was to be obtained of these people. a little after dlasark our young horse broke the rope by which he was confined and made his escape much to the chagrine of all who recollected the keenness of their appetites last evening. the brother of the twisted hair and Wearkkoomt with 10 or 12 others encamped with us this evening. the natives have a considerable salmon fishery up Colter's Creek. this stream extends itself to the [s]pirs of the rocky mountain and in much the greater part of it's course passes through a well timbered pine country it is 25 yds. wide and discharges a large body of water. the banks low and bed formed of pebbles. had a small shower of rain this evening. [Clark:] Tuesday May 6th 1806 This morning the husband of the sick woman was as good as his word. he produced us a young horse in tolerable order which we imediately had killed and butchered. the inhabitents seemed more accommodating this morning, they sold us some bread. we received a second horse for medecine &amp; pro[s]cription to a little girl with the rhumitism whome I had bathed in worm water, and anointed her a little with balsom capivia. I dressed the woman again this morning who declared that she had rested better last night than she had since she had been sick. sore Eyes is an universal complaint among all the nations which we have seen on the West Side of the rocky Mountains. I was busily imployed for several hours this morning in administering eye water to a crowd of applicants. we once more obtained a plentiful meal, much to the comfort of all the party. Capt Lewis exchanged horses with We ark koomt and gave him a small flag with which he was much pleased and gratifyed. the sorrel which Cap L. obtained is a strong active well broke horse. At this place we met with three men of a nation called the Skeets-so-mish who reside at the falls of a small river dischargeing Itself Into the Columbia on its East Side to the South of the enterance of Clarks river, this river they Informed us headed in a large lake in the mountains and that the falls below which they reside was at no great distance from the lake. these people are the same in their dress and appearance with the Chopunnish, tho' their language Is entirely different. one of them gave me his whip which was a twisted stick 18 Ins. in length at one end a pice of raw hide split so as to form two Strings about 20 inches in length as a lash, to the other end a string passed through a hole and fastened at each end for a loope to slip over the wrist. I gave in return for this whip a fathom of narrow binding. The River here calld. Clarks river is that which we have heretofore called Flathead river. Capt. Lewis has thought proper to call this after myself. for this stream we know no indian name and no white man but our selves was ever on this river. The river which Fiddler call's the great Lake river may possiably be a branch of it, but if so it is but a very inconsiderable branch, and may as probably empty itself into the Columbia above as into Clarks river. the Stream which the party has heretofore called Clark river imedeately above the great falls, has it's three principal branches in Mountains Jefferson, Hood and the Northern Side of the S. W. Mountains and is of course a short river. this river is called by the Skillutes &amp; Eneshure Nations Towannahhiooks which is also the name they call those bands of Snake indians who come on this river every spring to catch the C[s]almon. The Kooskooske river may be safely navigated at present all the rocks of the sholes and rapids are perfectly covered; the current is strong, the water clear and cold. this river is riseing fast. The timber of this river which consists principally of the long leafed pine which commences about 2 miles below our present encampment on Colters Creek. it was 2 P M. this evening before we could collect our horses. at 3. P. M. we set out accompanied by the brother of the twisted hair and We-ark-koomt. we derected the horse which I had obtained for the purpose of eateing to be led as it was unbroke, in performing this duty a quarrel ensued between Drewyer and Colter. We continued our march along the river on its North Side 9. miles to a lodge of 6 families built of sticks mats and dryed Hay, of the same form of those heretofore discribed. We passed a Lodge of 3 families at 4 ms. on the river, no provisions of any discription was to be obtained of these people. a little after dark our young horse broke the rope by which he was confined and made his escape much to the chagrin of all who recollected the keenness of their appetites last evening. the brother of the twisted hair &amp; Wearkkoomt with 10 others encamped with us this evening. The nativs have a considerable Salmon fishery up Colters Creek. this stream extends itself to the spurs of the Rocky Mountain and in much the greater part of its course passes through a well timbered pine country, it is 25 yds. wide and discharges a large body of water. the banks low and bead formed of pebbles. had a small shower of rain this evening. The Chopunnish about the mouth of the Kooskooske bury their dead on stoney hill sides generally, and as I was informed by an Indian who made signs that they made a hole in the Grown[d] by takeing away the stones and earth where they wished to deposit the dead body after which they laid the body which was previously raped in a robe and secured with cords, over the body they placed Stones so as to form a sort of arch on the top of which they put stones and earth so as to secure the body from the wolves and birds &amp;c. they sometimes inclose the grave with a kind of sepulcher like the roof of a house formed of the canoes of the disceased. they also sacrifice the favorite horses of the disceased, the bones of many of which we see on and about the graves. [Lewis:] Wednesday May 7th. 1806. This morning we collected our horses and set out early accompanyed by the brother of the twisted hair as a guide; Wearkkoomt and his party left us. we proceeded up the river 4 miles to a lodge of 6 families just below the entrance of a small creek1 1 Apparently Bed Rock Creek, which the expedition passed on its way down Oct. 7, 1805.—Ed. , here our guide recommended our passing the river. he informed us that the road was better on the South side and that game was more abundant also on that side near the entrance of the Chopunnish river.2 2 Referring to the North Fork of the Clearwater (Kooskooske) River.—Ed. we determined to pursue the rout recommended by the guide and accordingly unloaded our horses and prepared to pass the river which we effected by means of one canoe in the course of 4 hours. a man of this lodge produced us two canisters of powder which he informed us he had found by means of his dog where they had been buried in a bottom near the river some miles above, they were the same which we had buryed as we decended the river last fall. as he kept them safe and had honesty3 3 All the Indians from the Rocky Mountains to the falls of Columbia are an honest, ingenuous, and well-disposed people; but from the falls to the sea-coast, and along it, they are a rascally, thieving set.—Gass (p. 304). enough to return them to us we gave him a fire steel by way of compensation. during our detention at the river we took dinner, after which or at 3 P.M. we renewed our march along the river about 2 Ms over a difficult stony road, when we left the river and asscended the hills to the wright which are here mountains high. the face of the country when you once have ascended the river hills is perfectly level and partially covered with the long-leafed pine. the soil is a dark rich loam thickly covered with grass and herbatious plants which afford a delightfull pasture for horses. in short it is a beautifull fertile and picturesque country. Neeshneparkeeook overtook us and after riding with us a few miles turned off to the wright to visit some lodges of his people who he informed me were geathering roots in the plain at a little distance from the road. our guide conducted us through the plain and down a steep and lengthey hill to a creek which we called Musquetoe Creek in consequence of being infested with swarms of those insects on our arrival at it. this is but an inconsiderable stream about 6 yds. wide heads in the plains at a small distance and discharges itself into the Kooskoo[s]ke 9 miles by water below the entrance of the Chopunnish river. we struck this creek at the distance of 5 ms. from the point at which we left the river our cour[s]e being a little to the S. of East. ascending .the creek one mile on the S.E. side we arrived at an indian incampment of six lodges which appeared to have been recently evacuated. here we remained all night 1 1 About five miles below the place where we made our canoes in October last.— Gass (p. 305). having traveled 12 miles only. the timbered country on this side of the river may be said to commence near this creek, and on the other side of the river at a little distance from it the timber reaches as low as Colter's Creek. the earth in many parts of these plains is thrown up in little mounds by some animal whose habits are similar to the Sallemander, like that animal it is also invisible;2 2 A species of pocket-gopher (Thomomys); also called "camass-rat," on account of its fondness for the roots of the camass. The camp this day was on Jack's Creek. —Coues (L. and C., iii, pp. 993, 994). notwithstanding I have observed the work of this animal th[r]oughout the whole course of my long tract from St. Louis to the Pacific ocean I have never obtained a view of this animal. the Shoshone man of whom I have before made mention overtook us this evening with Neeshneparkeeook and remained with us this evening. we suped this evening as we had dined on horse-beef. we saw several deer this evening and a great number of the tracks of these animals we determined to remain here untill noon tomorrow in order to obtain some venison and accordingly gave orders to the hunters to turn out early in the morning. The Spurs of the Rocky Mountains which were in view from the high plain today were perfectly covered with snow. the Indians inform us that the snow is yet so deep on the mountains that we shall not be able to pass them untill the next full moon or about the first of June; others set the time at still a more distant period. this [is] unwelcom inteligence to men confined to a diet of horsebeef and roots, and who are as anxious as we are to return to the fat plains of the Missouri and thence to our native homes. The Chopunnish bury their dead in Sepulchres formed of boards like the roofs of houses. the corps[e] is rolled in skin and laid on boards above the surface of the earth. they are laid in several teer [tiers] one over another being seperated by a board only above and below from other corps. I did observe some instances where the body was laid in an indifferent wo[o]den box which was placed among other carcases rolled in skin in the order just mentioned. they sacrifice horses canoes and every other speceis of property to their ded. the bones of many horses are seen laying about those sepulchres. this evening was cold as usual. [Clark:] Wednesday May 7th. 1806. This morning we collected our horses and set out early accompanied by the brother of the twisted hair as a guide; Wearkkoomt and his party left us. we proceeded up the river 4 miles to a lodge of 6 families just below the enterance of a small Creek, here our guide recommended our passing the river, he informed us that the road was better on the South Side, and that game was more abundant also on that side near the enterance of Chopunnish river. we deturmined to pursue the rout recommended by the guide, and accordingly unloaded our horses and prepared to pass the river which we effected by means of one canoe in the course of 4 hours. a man of this lodge produced us two canisters of Powder which he informed us he had found by means of his dog where they had been berried in the bottom near the river a fiew miles above. they were the same which we had berried as we decended the river last fall. as he had kept them safe and had honisty enough to return them to us, we gave him a fire Steel by way of compensation. dureing our detention at the river we took dinner. after which we renewed our march along the S.E. side of the river about 2 miles over a dificuelt stoney road, when we left the river and assended the hills to the right which are here mountains high. the face of the country when you have once assended the river hills, is perfectly level and partially covered with the long leafed pine. the soil is a dark rich loam, thickly covered with grass and herbatious plants which afford a delightful pasture for horses. in short it is a butifull fertile picteresque country. Neeshneparkeeook overtook us and after rideing with us a fiew miles turned off to the right to visit some lodges of his people who he informed us were gathering roots in the plains at a little distance from the road. our guide conducted us through the plain and down a steep and lengthy hill to a creek which we call Musquetoe Creek in consequence of being infested with sworms of those insects on our arival at it. this is but an inconsiderable stream about 6 yards wide heads in the plains at a short distance and discharges itself into the Kooskooske 9 ms. by water below the forks. we struck this Creek at the distance of 5 miles from the point at which we left the river, our course being a little to the S. of East. we proceeded up the Creek one mile and on the S. E. Side we arived at an old Indian incampment of Six Lodges which appeared to have been recently evacuated. here we remained all night haveing traveled 12 ms. only. the timbered country on this side of the river may be said to commence a short distance below this creek, and on the other side of the river at a little distance from it the timber reaches as low as Colter's Creek. the earth in maney parts of those plains is th[r]own up in little mounds by some animal whose habits are similar to the Sallemander, like that animal it is also invisible; notwithstanding I have observed the work of this animal throughout the whole course of my trail from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocian, I have never obtained a view of this animal. The Shoshone man of whome I have before mentioned over took us this evening with Neeshneparkeeook or Cut nose and remained with us this evening. we suped this evening as we had done on horse beef. we saw several deer this evening, and a great number of the tracks of these animals we deturmined to remain here untill noon tomorrow in order to obtain some venison, and accordingly gave orders to the hunters to turn out early in the morning. The spurs of the rocky mountains which were in view from the high plain to day were perfectly covered with snow. The Indians inform us that the snow is yet so deep on the mountains that we shall not be able to pass them untill after the next full moon or about the first of June. others set the time at a more distant period. this [is] unwelcom intiligence to men confined to a diet of horsebeef and roots, and who are as anxious as we are to return to the fat plains of the Missouri, and thence to our native homes. The Chopunnish bury their dead in different ways as I have obse[r]ved, besides that already discribed they scaffold some and deposit others in sepulchers, those are rearly to be seen in this upper part of the Columbian Watters. the one already discribed is the most common. they all sacrifice horses, canoes and every Species of property to the dead. the bones of maney horses are seen lyeing about those repositaries of the dead &amp;c. I observed in all the Lodges which we have passed since we crossed Lewis's river decoys, or stocking [stalking] heads as they are sometimes called. these decoys are for the deer and is formed of the skin of the head and upper portion of the neck of that animale extended in the nateral shape by means of a fiew little sticks placed within. the hunter when he sees a deer conseals himself and with his hand givs to the decoy the action of a deer at feed, and this induces the deer within arrow-shot; in this mode the Indians near the woody country hunt on foot in such places where they cannot pursue the deer with horses which is their favourite method when the grounds will permit. The orniments worn by the Chopunnish are, in their nose a single shell of Wampom, the pirl &amp; beeds are suspended from the ears. beads are worn arround their wrists, neck and over their sholders crosswise in the form of a double sash. the hair of the men is cewed in two rolls which hang on each side in front of the body. Collars of bears claws are also common; but the article of dress on which they appear to bestow most pains and orniments is a kind of collar or brest-plate; this is most commonly a strip of otter skins of about six inches wide taken out of the center of the skin it's whole length including the head. this is dressed with the hair on. this is tied around the neck &amp; hangs in front of the body the tail frequently reaching below their knees; on this skin in front is attatched pieces of pirl, beeds, wampom, pices of red cloth and in short whatever they conceive most valuable or ornamental.
