      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION PREVIOUS EXPLORATIONS Spain SLOWLY pushing northward from Mexico, Spaniards had by the close of the seventeenth century established towns and Indian missions at many points in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona—a slender chain, stretching across the continent from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. By the opening of our Revolutionary War, their mission villages, with an aggregate population of over thirteen thousand barbarian converts, extended upwards through California to San Francisco and Monterey; Spanish mariners, seeking vainly for a waterway through to the Atlantic, that should furnish a short route between Spain and India, had by this time become familiar with the coast as far north as the modern Sitka, and developed a considerable trade with the natives, chiefly at Nootka Sound, on Vancouver's Island; while adventurous Spanish missionaries had contemporaneously penetrated eastward to the Great Basin. New France The pioneers of New France, on their part seeking a transcontinental waterway from the east, had throughout the first two-thirds of the eighteenth century made several costly attempts to discover and surmount the great divide. Upon New Year's day, 1743, the Chevalier de la Vérendrye, journeying overland from his fur-trading post on the Assiniboin River, sighted the Wind River Range. Affairs moved slowly, under the French régime; but yearly the prospect was growing brighter of reaching the Pacific by way of a chain of posts across the Canadian Rockies, via the Assiniboin and Saskatchewan, when the victory of Wolfe cut short these ambitious projects, and England succeeded both to the responsibilities and the dreams of New France. England The Hudson's Bay Company, organized in London in 1667, had long held actual dominion over the sub-arctic regions to the north of New France; and on paper claimed the far-stretching lands to the south and west, upon which the more adventurous French had actively ranged from Lake Superior westward to the headwaters of the Saskatchewan—a distance of twelve hundred miles. At first disinclined to explore beyond the sphere of influence immediately exerted by her profitable posts on Hudson and James bays, "the old lady of Fenchurch Street" was early in the eighteenth century forced by public opinion in England to make a show of seeking from the East the waterway which Sir Francis Drake, in the "Golden Hind," had sought from the Pacific as early as 1579, and for which both Spain and France were still vainly striving. The company's spasmodic, apathetic, and fruitless searches for the "Northwest Passage" extended through half a century. When New France fell, both independent and organized English and Scotch fur-traders, with headquarters at Montreal and Mackinac, disregarding the claims of the Hudson's Bay Company at once occupied the vast country through which Vérendrye and his compatriots had so long conducted their wilderness barter. The story of the rival trading corporations —chiefly the Hudson's Bay Company on the one hand, and the North West Company (1783) on the other—although with occasional disruptions of the latter, and several kaleidoscopic reshiftings and amalgamations—is a stirring and sometimes bloody chapter in the history of the continental interior. The situation cultivated mighty passions within strong men. One of these, Samuel Hearne, in the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company, stirred by great ambitions, descended the Coppermine River in 1770, and reached the Arctic Ocean. Nineteen years later (1789), Alexander Mackenzie, a "Nor' Wester" in charge of the Athabasca department, reached the Arctic Ocean by way of Mackenzie River; in 1793, after almost incredible difficulties, he crossed the Canadian Rockies and descended Fraser River to the Pacific, a feat preceding Lewis and Clark's venture by a dozen years. Missouri River Expeditions While these various hardy enterprises were in progress in the North, many deemed the Missouri River the most feasible gateway to the Pacific. There long existed a tradition among Indians living upon the Mississippi, that the Missouri sprung from a low-lying watershed that might easily be portaged to some stream flowing into the Western Ocean. Joliet and Marquette (1673) had at first hoped that the Mississippi might be found emptying into the Pacific; but ascertaining that its flood was received by the Gulf of Mexico, they looked upon the Missouri as the undoubted highway to the Ocean of the West. Thirty years later, charts were published in Europe which showed west-flowing waters interlocking with the Missouri. Several French expeditions were organized for exploring the Missouri and some of its lower affluents—La Harpe and Du Tisné (1719), De Bourgmont (1722), and Mallet (1739); but they accomplished little more than obtaining a knowledge of the country for a few hundred miles above the mouth, with side ventures upon the South Fork of the Platte, the Arkansas, and the plains southwestward to the Spanish seat of Santa Fé. French traders and trappers Upon the eve of the downfall of New France, the crafty Louis XV, in order to prevent England from obtaining them, ceded to Spain (November, 1762) the town and neighborhood of New Orleans and the broad possessions of France west of the Mississippi. But the Spaniards who came to New Orleans and St. Louis were in the main only public officials. French habitans occupied their little waterside villages, as of old; being joined in the closing decade of the century by Kentuckians like Boone, who, weary of the legal and social restraints of growing American settlements, were willing to accept Spanish land grants with their promise of a return to primitive conditions, in which farming operations alternated with hunting. French trappers, many of them blood relatives of the red men, and now released from the tyranny of the fur-trade monopoly of New France freely plied their nomadic calling upon the lower reaches of the Missouri and its branches, and even up the Platte and Arkansas to the bases of the Rockies. French and half-breed fur-traders—either on their own account or, in the northern regions, as agents of the warring British companies—wandered far and near among the tribesmen, visiting them in their permanent villages and accompanying them upon hunting-, fishing-, and war-parties. Their long journeyings by land and water occasionally carried them as far afield as the great northern bend of the Missouri, where were the villages of the trade-loving Mandans, who bartered indiscriminately with Gauls from St. Louis and Britons from the Assiniboin. Jefferson's dream Such was the situation when the United States was born, and when Thomas Jefferson—philosopher, seer, statesman— always interested in the Middle West, first felt within him yearnings for a more intimate knowledge of the spacious territory of Louisiana, lying beyond the great river. The country belonged to Spain, but this fact gave him no pause; he felt that so long as British traders were profitably exploiting the trans-Mississippi, Americans might be excused for opening through it a trade route to the Pacific, and incidentally extending the bounds of human knowledge, in geography and the natural sciences. Proposition to G. R. Clark In 1783 he proposed to General George Rogers Clark, the hero of Kaskaskia and Vincennes, to lead an expedition "for exploring the country from the Missisipi to California;" he intimated that a similar enterprise was being broached in England—"they pretend it is only to promote knoledge. I am afraid they have thoughts of colonising into that quarter."1 1 See Appendix for facsimile of this document, the original of which is in the Draper MSS. Collection, Wisconsin Historical Library. Nothing came of this suggestion —possibly Clark did not reply; or very likely Jefferson, just then in private life, thought that the necessary funds could not be raised. Ledyard's project Three years later, when minister to Paris, Jefferson met John Ledyard, a Connecticut adventurer who had been a petty officer with Captain James Cook on the latter's third voyage around the world (1778), and had written a widely-read account of that enterprise. Ledyard agreed to cross Europe and Asia to Kamchatka, thence embarking on a Russian vessel trading to Nootka Sound, from which he was to find his way to the sources of the Missouri, whose current was to be descended to the American settlements. But Ledyard, when within a few days of the Kamchatka port, was arrested by imperial orders from St. Petersburg, and ignominously carried back to Poland, where, "disappointed, ragged, and penniless," he was dismissed. Armstrong's attempt In 1789, General Henry Knox, Washington's secretary of war, ordered General Josiah Harmar, commanding the Western frontier at Cincinnati, to "devise some practicable plan for exploring that branch of the Mississippi called the Messouri, up to its source," and possibly beyond to the Pacific. Captain John Armstrong, then in command at Louisville, was despatched upon this adventure in the spring of 1790. Entirely alone in a canoe, he "proceeded up the Missouri some distance above St. Louis . . . but, meeting with some French traders, was persuaded to return in consequence of the hostility of the Missouri bands to each other, as they were then at war, and he could not safely pass from one nation to the other." The Michaux plan Jefferson was the next to make a venture in transcontinental exploration. This time (1793) in his capacity as a vice president of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia, he made an arrangement therefor with André Michaux, a distinguished French botanist then herborizing in the United States. A small subscription was raised by the society, to which many of the prominent men of the day contributed, and detailed instructions for Michaux were drafted by Jefferson.1 1 See Appendix, for this document. The intending explorer was to "cross the Mississippi and pass by land to the nearest part of the Missouri above the Spanish settlements, that you may avoid the risk of being stopped;" he was then to "pursue such of the largest streams of that river as shall lead by the shortest way and the lowest latitudes to the Pacific ocean." The previous year, Captain Robert Gray, of Boston, had discovered the mouth of the Columbia, and Jefferson hoped that this stream might be found to interlock with the sources of the Missouri. Just then, however, there had arrived in the United States Charles Genet, minister of the French Republic, who was charged with the secret mission of forming a fillbustering army of American frontiersmen in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Kentucky to attack Spanish possessions on the Gulf of Mexico and beyond the Mississippi. Michaux was selected by Genet as his agent to deal with the Kentuckians, led by George Rogers Clark, who had proposed, under the banner of France, to descend the Mississippi with fifteen hundred borderers and attack New Orleans. Michaux tarried in Kentucky to carry out these ill-fated plans, with the result that his project of exploration was abandoned.1 1 Several important documents connected with these early American projects in transcontinental exploration, will be found in the Appendix to the present work. For a fuller narrative, see Thwaites, Rocky Mountain Exploration (N. Y., 1994), chap. iv. On the Northwest Coast Meanwhile, there had been important developments upon our Northwest Coast. We have seen that by the opening of the Revolutionary War the Spanish had explored the whole extent of this shore, nearly up to the site of the modern Sitka. In 1778 Captain Cook was here, on behalf of England, searching for the Northwest Passage, a movement which induced fresh zeal on the part of Spanish navigators, and watchfulness on the part of the Russians in Alaska. Eight years later, the French navigator and scientist, Count de la Pérouse, visited these shores and gave to the world its first definite knowledge of Spain's California missions. English fur-trading vessels now appeared on the scene, bartering with the natives for furs, which were carried to China, to be there exchanged for teas, silks, spices, and other Oriental wares. Friction between Spanish and English trading interests at Nootka Sound—where the latter had made small settlements—led to a spirited controversy that might readily have precipitated war, but which ended peacefully in the withdrawal of Spain (1795). By this time, American trading craft were sharp competitors for the China-American fur traffic of the Northwest Coast. Owing to the monopoly of the East India Company in British trade on the Pacific Ocean, most of the Englishmen gradually withdrew: thus for some twenty years leaving New England navigators almost complete masters of the situation. When Thomas Jefferson became president of the United States, perhaps two score American trading vessels were annually visiting Nootka Sound and the mouth of the Columbia; British overland traders were operating among the Mandans and their neighbors, at and below the great bend of the Missouri; French and half-breed trappers and traders, together with a few expatriated Kentuckians, were familiar with the Missouri and its lower affluents; upon St. Peter's River (near the Minnesota), British free-traders were profitably operating among the Sioux, a proximity which caused much uneasiness among Americans in the West. As yet, few citizens of the United States were operating in the vast territory of Louisiana, which Napoleon, dreaming of another New France in North America, had now (October 1, 1800) obliged Spain to retrocede to him; but of which he had not thus far taken formal possession. Congressional aid secured Amidst the manifold duties of his great office, Jefferson had not forgotten his early scheme for exploring the trans-Mississippi. Greater opportunity now presented itself —he possessed influence to secure governmental aid, and recognized the existence of a stronger public spirit. The lapse in the winter of 1802–03 of an "act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes," was made the occasion for addressing (January 18) a secret message to Congress,1 1 See Appendix, for this document. in which he urged the importance of reaching out for the trade of the Indians on the Missouri River, that thus far had in large measure been absorbed by English companies; and suggested an exploring party as the best means of accomplishing this object. He recognized that the country which he thus proposed to enter was the property of France, although still governed by Spain; but thought that as the latter nation's interests were now waning, she would not be disposed to jealousy and would regard the enterprise merely "as a literary pursuit." An estimate of the necessary expenses was placed at only $2,500; but the correspondence which we give in the Appendix, shows that Jefferson intended that the exploring party should, while still in the United States, be subsisted by the War Department; and in addition thereto we shall see that he issued in their favor a general letter of credit, which proved of no avail, but further demonstrates the fact that the explorers were not expected to limit themselves to the appropriation. MERIWETHER LEWIS Early years Congress having proved complaisant, in secretly giving the necessary authority and passing the modest appropriation, Jefferson at once appointed his private secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, as head of the proposed expedition. Lewis was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, August 18th, 1774, his people being prominent in colonial and Revolutionary affairs. His father, William, died when Meriwether, named for his mother's family, was a child. The boy came under the guardianship of his uncle Nicholas, who had in 1776 commanded a regiment in the campaign against the Cherokees; but his education remained under the direction of his mother, a woman of capacity and judgment. When but eight years of age, the lad had established a local reputation as a hunter; and until his thirteenth year, when he was sent to a Latin school, had ample opportunity to satisfy his adventurous cravings in this direction. After five years of tuition, he returned to his mother's farm, where the succeeding two years were spent in careful attention to the details of husbandry, in the course of which he acquired some skill in botany, that was to stand him well in stead during the great expedition of a few years later. Military experiences In 1794, when Lewis was twenty years of age, the so-called Whisky Rebellion, against a federal excise tax, broke out in Western Pennsylvania, and threatened to spread into Virginia and Maryland. President Washington issued a requisition for some thirteen thousand militia from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, and this force promptly marched towards the seat of disturbance, thus speedily causing the subsidence of what was practically an insurrection against the national government. Lewis enlisted as a private in this little army, and at the close of the disturbance was given employment in the regular service — originally as ensign in the First Infantry (May 1, 1795), later as first lieutenant, and then captain (1797) in the same regiment. He served with distinction under General Wayne, in the latter's Northwestern campaigns, and in the first year of his captaincy was in charge of the infantry in Captain Isaac Guion's expedition to take over the Spanish posts in Mississippi.1 1 See Claiborne, Mississippi (Jackson, 1880), p. 184, note. He also was for several years the paymaster of his regiment.2 2 A manuscript book in the possession of the American Philosophical Society, containing Lewis's meterological and natural history data, also has a few brief records of his accounts as paymaster in 1800. In that year he made an extended official tour by land and water to the posts at Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Fort Wayne, and Detroit, visiting Limestone (Maysville, Ky.), Chillicothe, and Wheeling on route. Selected to command Expedition Captain Lewis appears early to have won the esteem and confidence of his distinguished neighbor, Thomas Jefferson; and in the spring of 1801 the latter, as president of the United States, appointed him as his private secretary.3 3 The original of Jefferson's letter to Lewis, offering this appointment (dated Washington, February 23, 1801), is in the Bureau of Rolls, Department of the Interior, Washington, where its press-mark is "Jefferson Papers, 2d series, vol. 51, doc. 110." Jefferson writes that the salary is but $500, "scarcely more than an equivalent for your pay &amp; rations" in the army; but it is an easier office, would give him opportunity to meet distinguished people, and he could board and lodge with the president's family, free of charge. The original of Lewis's letter of acceptance, dated Pittsburg, March 10th, may be found in ibid, doc. 95. We have already seen that in 1783 Jefferson, not then in official life, suggested to George Rogers Clark an exploration of the trans-Mississippi country, and that his subsequent negotiations with Ledyard (1788) and Michaux (1793) came to naught. The last-named mission had been unsuccessfully sought by his adventurous young friend Lewis, although but nineteen years old. When, apparently as early as July, 1802, President Jefferson revived his long-considered project, he offered the post of leader to his private secretary, who, now having attained the age of twenty-eight, had again pleaded for this honor. In his Memoir of Lewis,1 1 Introduction to Biddle edition, pp. xi, xii. the president pays him this generous tribute: I had now had opportunities of knowing him intimately. Of courage undaunted; possessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing but impossibilities could divert from its direction; careful as a father of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance of order and discipline; intimate with the Indian character, customs, and principles; habituated to the hunting life; guarded, by exact observation of the vegetables and animals of his own country, against losing time in the description of objects already possessed; honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding, and a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever he should report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves— with all these qualifications, as if selected and implanted by nature in one body for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in confiding the enterprise to him. The President had at first sought as commandant a scientist who possessed, in addition to his scholarly attainments, the necessary "courage, prudence, habits &amp; health adapted to the woods &amp; some familiarity with the Indian character."2 2 Jefferson's letter to Dr. Caspar Wistar, in Appendix. Failing in this, Captain Lewis was chosen as being, in his chief's opinion, "brave, prudent, habituated to the woods, &amp; familiar with Indian manners and character. He is not regularly educated, but he possesses a great mass of accurate observation on all the subjects of nature which present themselves here, &amp; will therefore readily select those only in his new route which shall be new."3 3 Jefferson's letter to Dr. Benjamin Rush, in Appendix. In training In order to acquire "a greater familiarity with the technical language of the natural sciences, and readiness in the astronomical observations necessary for the geography of his route," Lewis proceeded to Philadelphia,4 4 Jefferson's Memoir of Lewis does not mention that Lewis went to Philadelphia as early as July, 1802; but his letter to Lewis, dated January 22d, 1803 (see Appendix), indicates that such was the fact. where he received instruction in the rudiments of the sciences from several eminent specialists—that city being the home of the American Philosophical Society, and then the principal seat of learning in the country. His correspondence with Jefferson during this period, which is given in our Appendix, abounds in allusions to scientific and practical details, showing him to have been not only an apt pupil, but already possessed of a large fund of information of the sort essential to the equipment of an explorer. WILLIAM CLARK Early in the course of these preparations Lewis determined, with Jefferson's consent, to secure a companion who should share his honors and responsibilities. His choice fell upon Captain William Clark, four years his senior, but who had been the friend of his boyhood in Virginia, and his comrade in Wayne's Indian campaigns. A notable family The Clarks, a large and now widely-ramified family group, had long lived in Albermarle County, Virginia, near the seat of the Lewis family, and here were born the two oldest children of John Clark and his wife Ann Rogers —Jonathan (1750–1816) and George Rogers (1752–1818). In 1754 John Clark removed to the neighborhood of Charlottesville, Caroline County, where William, their ninth child, was born August 1st, 1770. This branch of the family—preceded several years by George Rogers Clark, who had become famous because of his campaign against Kaskaskia and Vincennes—moved to Kentucky in 1784, their estate being Mulberry Hill, on Beargrass Creek, near Louisville. The Clark home was the centre of hospitality and sociability for the region roundabout. It was frequented not only by sturdy pioneers of the Kentucky movement, with their tales of Indian warfare, and other perils and hardships of the early settlements; but the second generation of Kentucky emigrants also found here a welcome—gentlemen and lawyers of the new settlements, Revolutionary soldiers seeking homes in the growing West, men of enterprise, culture, and promise, permanent founders of a new civilization. Military services Among them all, young "Billy" was a marked favorite. In his nineteenth year he marched in the ranks of Colonel John Hardin's expedition against the tribesmen north of the Ohio River; the following year he was despatched upon a mission to the Creeks and Cherokees; and in 1791 was ensign and acting lieutenant on the Wabash Indian expedition, under General Scott. "Your brother William," writes one of the family friends,1 1 Dr. James O'Fallen to Colonel Jonathan Clark, Caroline County, Virginia, May 30th, 1791.— Draper MSS., 2 L 28. "is gone out as a cadet with Genl. Scott on the Expedition. He is a youth of solid and promising parts, and as brave as Cæsar." Two years later (1793) we find him commissioned as a first lieutenant in the Fourth sub-legion, in General Anthony Wayne's Western Army. After being engaged as an engineer in constructing forts along the line of advance, he was, late in the season, sent upon a perilous expedition up the Wabash as far as Vincennes, during which his progress was for several weeks blocked by ice. The next year (1794) we read of him as being in charge of a train of seven hundred pack-horses and eighty men, transporting supplies to Fort Greenville. Attacked by the savages, he lost five men, but gallantly repulsed the enemy and won praise from Wayne, under whom he later (August 20) fought in the Battle of Fallen Timbers. Twice (1795) he was entrusted by his general with important commissions to the Spaniards, an account of which is to be found in the Spanish Papers of the Draper Manuscripts, in the Wisconsin Historical Library. It is said that no officer impressed the Spanish with a more wholesome respect than young Lieutenant William Clark. His four years' service in the Western Army had familiarized him with the methods of handling large bodies of men under military discipline, and given him opportunity to exercise the courage and resource needed to deal with savage foes; and it put him in touch with the prominent men of his time. It had also—an important consideration, in view of his subsequent career—once more thrown him into the company of Meriwether Lewis, now a fellow campaigner, and upon at least one expedition he was Lewis's superior officer.1 1 Much confusion has arisen because three William Clarks were prominent in the West, in those stirring days. (1) Judge William Clark, of Indiana Territory, who died at Vincennes in 1802; (2) William Clark, the son of Benjamin, and a cousin of George Rogers Clark; and (3) the subject of this sketch. Confusion between Nos. 2 and 3 has been especially common, among historians; Coues's sketch, in his Lewis and Clark (i, pp. lxviii, lix) is an instance—the "captain of militia," whose commission is given on the latter page, undoubtedly being William No. 1. In the Draper MSS., in the Wisconsin Historical Library, the papers of these two men have been indiscriminately commingled. This was the more natural, because the signatures of the two are so similar that it would require an expert to differentiate them. William No. 2 was one of the most efficient officers in the Illinois campaigns. He must have been quite young at the time; but in the later period of the Revolutionary War was entrusted with various important commissions. When Fort Jefferson was built in 1780, near the mouth of the Ohio, Lieutenant William Clark was sent with a convoy from Kaskaskia to provision it, and late the following year he removed to the Falls of Ohio, where Louisville now stnads. He was here employed in garrison duty and in protecting the new settlement against its Indian foes. So valuable were his services, that on the reduction of the regiment in February, 1783, he was one of three officer, retained in the service; and was only finally mustered out by the order of the governor in 1784. About this time a large tract of land (150,000 acres) was assigned to the Illinois regiment in return for its services, and laid off on the Indiana side of the Ohio River, opposite Louisville. Clark was appointed one of the allotment commissioners, also principal surveyor of the grant. From that time until his death in 1791, he was chiefly occupied in the business of this office. A man of good habits, kind heart, courage, and resource, he was popular and successful among the early inhabitants of that country. He was on intimate terms with his more illustrious cousins, and it is to be conjectured that he was particularly admired by William Clark No. 3, just then growing into manhood. He never married, and at his death left a considerable landed property to his brothers and sisters, most of whom had not yet removed from Virginia. Retiring from the army in 1796—apparently with the brevet rank of captain, for thereafter he was given that title— William Clark lived quietly at home with his family, chiefly occupied in seeking to adjust the tangled affairs of his brother, George Rogers, who had been sued by many persons for supplies furnished in the Illinois campaigns. In the attempted settlement of these claims, William not only gave his time and effort, but sacrificed the small estate he had himself accumulated. Lewis's invitation Such was the situation of his affairs when, on the sixteenth of July, 1803, he received a letter from his friend Captain Lewis2 2 See Appendix, for the correspondence in full. —dated Washington, June 19th—in which the latter, after giving confidential information of the projected expedition to the Pacific, proposed that Clark "participate with me in it's fatiegues, it's dangers and it's honor," assuring him that "there is no man on earth with whom I should feel equal pleasure in sharing them as with yourself." Clark promptly responded to this cordial offer, saying, "as my situation in life will admit of my absence the length of time necessary to accomplish such an undertaking, I will cheerfully join you." It will be seen that Lewis's letter, owing to the slowness of Western mails, was nearly a month in reaching Clark. Failing to hear from his comrade as soon as he had expected, and fearing that he could not go, Lewis opened tentative negotiations with Lieutenant Moses Hooke of his own regiment (the First Infantry), who was then in charge of military stores at Pittsburg. In a letter to Jefferson (July 26, 1803)1 1 For text, see Appendix. Lewis describes him as a young man "about 26 years of age, endowed with a good constitution, possessing a sensible well informed mind, is industrious, prudent and persevering and withall intrepid and enterprising." A few days later, however (August 3), Lewis, then at Pittsburg, anxiously waiting for his keel-boat to be completed, received Clark's acceptance, and promptly expressed to the latter that he felt "much gratifyed with your decision; for I could neither hope, wish, or expect from a union with any man on earth, more perfect support or further aid in the discharge of the several duties of the mission, than that, which I am confident I shall derive from being associated with yourself." THE EXPEDITION The Louisiana Purchase It will be remembered that when Jefferson instituted the ambitious enterprise, the original records of which we are here publishing for the first time, the trans-Mississippi was the property of France, although still in the hands of Spain. This fact gave rise to the secrecy with which the preparations were invested. But upon the second of May, 1803,1 1 The actual date of signing, although the treaty was dated April 30th. the American commissioners in Paris had signed a treaty with Napoleon by which Louisiana was sold to the United States.2 2 See Thwaites, Rocky Mountain Exploration, chap. v, for account of the Louisiana Purchase. Lewis's invitation to Clark shows that some inkling of this unexpected and startling negotiation had reached Jefferson by that date (June 19); but the official news thereof did not arrive in Washington until the first days in July. The circumstance in no way altered Lewis's arrangements, save that it was no longer necessary to maintain that privacy as to the purpose of the exploration, which had been hitherto enjoined upon him. Personelle At River Dubois Camp Organized as a military detachment, under the orders of the secretary of war—although President Jefferson remained the moving spirit—the party, when complete, consisted of twenty-nine persons officially recognized on the rolls; with French and half-breed interpreters, Clark's negro slave York, and the Indian woman Sacajawea as super-numeraries —forty-five in all, including the two captains.3 3 The number during the first year out (1804); but there were some changes in the spring of 1805. See list in note on p. 12 of the present volume; also the rolls in the Orderly Book, on pp. 13, 14, 30, 31, post. Lewis —who had bidden good-bye to his friends at the White House on the morning of July 5th—embarked at Pittsburg on the thirty-first of August; but owing to shallows in the Ohio River, and the necessity of stopping at some of the forts to obtain volunteers from their garrisons, his passage was slow, At Louisville he picked up Clark and several young Kentucky recruits. December was a third spent, before the expedition went into winter camp at River Dubois, in Illinois, opposite the mouth of the Missouri, where the men were rigorously drilled both as soldiers and frontiersmen. It had been Lewis's intention to camp at some distance up the Missouri; but the lateness of the season, the technical objections raised by Spanish officials, and Jefferson's characteristic suggestion4 4 Letter to Lewis, of November 16th, 1803, in Appendix. that a camp on the east side, in American territory, would save the appropriation by allowing the men to draw their winter's rations from the War Department, induced him to stop at River Dubois. The journals show that the winter was a busy one—Clark being engaged at camp for the most part, in organizing and disciplining the party, and accumulating stores and boats for the long up-river journey; while Lewis was often in St. Louis, consulting with French fur-traders and others who knew the country. On March 9th and 10th, 1804, we find him the chief official witness at the formal transfer of Upper Louisiana— at first from Spain to France, and then from France to the United States. The first season The expedition started from Camp River Dubois on May 14th, "in the presence of many of the neighboring inhabitants, and proceeded on under a jentle brease up the Missouri." The long and painful up-stream journey during the summer and autumn of 1804 was followed by a winter spent in log huts enclosed by a stout palisade, among the Mandan Indians not far from the present Bismarck, North Dakota. Making a fresh start from Fort Mandan, upon the seventh of April, 1805, there ensued a toilsome experience all the way to the headspring of Jefferson Fork of the Missouri, which was reached August 12th. Then came the crossing of the rugged, snow-clad Bitterroot Mountains, which here constitute the divide, and the descent of the foaming rapids and cataracts of the Columbia, until the Pacific Coast was reached in November. By Christmas the party were safely housed within Fort Clatsop, a rude structure—like Fort Mandan, log huts within a palisade covering a plot of ground some fifty feet square.1 1 See plan of the fort, in chapter xxi, vol. iii of the present work. At Fort Clatsop Another dreary but busy winter was spent in studying the natives and making other scientific observations in the neighborhood, and filling their large note-books with these interesting data. This was not the season, however, for meeting any of the numerous trading mariners who frequented the Northwest Coast; thus the letter of credit which Jefferson had given to Lewis proved of no avail, and for several months the explorers were obliged to exercise great ingenuity in making trinkets with which to obtain supplies from the natives, who exhibited an avaricious temperament. The return Leaving Fort Clatsop the twenty-third of March, 1806, the return of the expedition was delayed by heavy snows on the mountainous divide, and much hardship was experienced. The actual crossing of the range commenced June 15th. By the first of July the party had arrived at Travellers' Rest Creek, where the native trails converged, and here they divided into two sections—Lewis's party going direct to the Falls of the Missouri, and afterwards exploring Maria's River with a view to ascertaining its availability as a fur-trade route to the north; Clark and his contingent proceeding to the head of navigation of the year before, and then crossing over to the Yellowstone and descending that stream to its junction with the Missouri. Parting company on the third of July, it was the twelfth of August before the two branches of the expedition reunited on the Missouri, several days below the mouth of the Yellowstone. Their final happy arrival at St. Louis, on the twenty-third of September, after an absence of two years, four months, and nine days, is one of the familiar events in American history. THE STORY OF LEWIS AND CLARK'S JOURNALS The final entry in the journal of Captain Clark is significant: Friday 25th [26] of Septr. 1806 a fine morning   we commenced wrighting &amp;c. This shows that on the third day after their return to civilization, the commanders began placing its literary records into definitive form. The history of these records, thus promptly commenced, proved to be almost as romantic as that of the great discovery itself. Jefferson's concern In his detailed instructions to Lewis (June 20, 1803),1 1 For this document, see Appendix. President Jefferson had displayed particular concern for the journals of the proposed expedition to the Pacific, which with all possible scientific data were to be prepared "with great pains &amp; accuracy, to be entered distinctly, &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself." The notes of the two captains were to be guarded against loss by making copies of them— "one of these copies [to] be written on the paper of the birch, as less liable to injury from damp than common paper."1 1 This suggestion was not adopted, in practice. Not only were Lewis and Clark to keep such journals, but they were to encourage their men to do likewise. Jefferson especially requested of Lewis that "several copies of . . . your notes should be made at leisure times &amp; put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants, to guard by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed." The captain was reminded that "in the loss of yourselves, we should lose also the information you will have acquired;" and as a further precaution was required "to communicate to us, at reasonable intervals, a copy of your journal, notes &amp; observations of every kind, putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed"—for we have seen that at the time these instructions were written the country to be explored and thus opened to American trade, was in the hands of the Spanish, whose suspicions must not be aroused. The various journals The two leaders faithfully performed their duty in this regard, and the four sergeants— Charles Floyd, Patrick Gass, John Ordway, and Nathaniel Pryor—also wrote journals.2 2 In the camp orders issued by Lewis and Clark, May 26th, 1804 (see post, p. 11), occurs this sentence: "The serg.ts in addition to those [other] duties are directed to keep a separate journal from day to day of all passing occurrences, and such other observations on the country &amp;c. as shall appear to them worthy of notice. Tradition has it that at least three of the twenty-three privates (Robert Frazier, Joseph White-house, and possibly George Shannon) were, as well, diarists upon the expedition—but the only private's note-book now known to us is that of Whitehouse. Journalizing methods It was the daily custom of the captains to make rough notes, with rude outline maps, plans, and miscellaneous sketches,3 3 Clark was the draughtsman of the party. His maps, sketches of birds, fishes, leaves, etc., in the note-books of both Lewis and himself, and on separate sheets of paper (for which latter, see our atlas volume), are worthy of an engineer with better training than he had received. They are all carefully reproduced in the prevent work. in field-books which they doubtless carried in their pockets. When encamped for a protracted period, these were developed into more formal records. In this development, each often borrowed freely from the other's notes— Lewis, the better scholar of the two, generally rewriting in his own manner the material obtained from Clark; while the latter not infrequently copied Lewis practically verbatim, but with his own phonetic spelling. Upon returning to St. Louis, these individual journals were for the most part transcribed by their authors into neat blank books—bound in red morocco and gilt-edged—with the thought of preparing them for early publication. After this process, the original field-books must have been cast aside and in large measure destroyed; for but one of these1 1 By Clark, dated Sept. 13th-Dec. 31st, 1805, and described post. is now known to exist. There have come down to us, however, several note-books which apparently were written up in the camps. Collectively, these journals of the captains cover each and every day the expedition was out— largely a double record, although there are occasional periods when we have the journal of but one of them.2 2 We have much more of Clark in these journals, than of Lewis. The lacunæ in the Lewis manuscripts, as compared with the dates covered by Clark, are as follows: 1804May 14, 16–19, 21-September 15; September 18-December 31 = 228 days. 1805January 1–February 2; February 14–April 6; August 27–September 8; September 11–17, 23-November 28; December 1–31 = 168 days. 1806August 13-September 26 = 45 days. But during much of this period Lewis was disabled from a wound, and therefore unable to write. The only apparent gap in the Clark journals, is the brief period from February 3 to 12 (inclusive), 1805 = 10 days. But the omission is only nominal, for under February 13th he gives a summary of events during this period of absence; see vol. i, p. 253, note, and pp. 259–261. Actually, we have from Clark a perfect record of his movements day by day throughout the expedition. Whether the missing Lewis entries (441 days, as compared with Clark; but we may eliminate 41 for the period when he was disabled, thus leaving 400) are still in existence or not, is unknown to the present writer. There appears to be no doubt that he regularly kept his diary. It is possible that the missing notes, in whole or in part, were with him when he met his death in Tennessee, and were either accidentally or purposely destroyed by others. The manuscripts well exemplify the habits and characteristics of the two men— Clark, the more experienced frontiersman of the two, expressing himself sententiously with Doric simplicity and vigor of phrase, and often amusingly eccentric orthography; Lewis, in more correct diction, inclined to expatiate on details, especially with regard to Indians and natural history, and frequently revealing a poetic temperament and a considerable fund of humor. The first news In February, 1806, when the expedition was upon the Pacific coast, President Jefferson sent to Congress a message enclosing, among other matters, a letter from Lewis, dated at Fort Mandan in the previous April, just as the explorers were leaving for the upper country,1 1 For this document, see Appendix. at that point the party had passed their first winter. This communication, describing the experiences of the expedition as far as Fort Mandan, was accompanied by brief reports of explorations on the Red and Washita rivers by Dr. Sibley, Dr. Hunter, and William C. Dunbar, together with statistics of the Western tribes and other data of the kind; the illassorted whole being promptly printed as a public document.2 2 See first item in Bibliographical Data, in the present volume, post. Based upon this fragmentary publication there soon sprung up, both in England and America, a long list of popular corn-pilations telling the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition during its first year, expanded with miscellaneous information about the Western Indians, picked up here and there— some of it singularly inaccurate.3 3 See "Counterfeit Publications," in Bibliographical Data. Gass's Journal A year later (early in 1807), only a few months after the return of the party, there was published at Philadelphia the first detailed report of the entire tour; being the journal of Sergeant Patrick Gass, an observant man, whose rough but generally accurate notes had been expanded with small regard to literary style, by an Irish schoolmaster, named David McKeehan, of Wellsburg, West Virginia. This little volume of about 83,000 words,4 4 See Bibliographical Data, for description of the various editions of Gass's Journal. with its curiously crude illustrations, was reprinted in London in 1808, while new American editions appeared at Philadelphia in 1810, 1811, and 1812, and a French translation at Paris in 1810. It is now, in any form, a rarity. Lewis's prospectus, 1807 It had been the intention of Lewis and Clark to publish their own journals; they had presented no official detailed report to the government, it being left with them by Jefferson, as we shall see, to make such literary use of their material as they saw fit. During the year following the return, and the one in which Gass's Journal had appeared, Lewis issued a prospectus announcing the speedy publication of the official narrative by C. &amp; A. Conrad, of Philadelphia. The first volume was to contain the "narrative of the voyage," the second to be devoted chiefly to an account of "the Indian nations distributed over that vast region," and the third "exclusively to scientific research." Apart from this, was to be published "Lewis and Clark's Map of North America, from longitude 9 west to the Pacific Ocean, and between 36 and 52 north latitude, with extensive marginal notes, dimensions five feet eight inches by three feet ten inches, embracing all their late discoveries, and that part of the continent heretofore the least known."1 1 See Appendix, for this prospectus. Delayed by public duties Unfortunately for this enterprise, both explorers soon after their return had received, together with commissions as generals, important government appointments: Lewis being made governor of Louisiana Territory, and Clark its superintendent of Indian affairs and brigadier-general of militia.2 2 Upon the execution, Lewis held a captaincy in the First Infantry; Clark had been commissioned as second lieutenant of artillery. On their return they both resigned from the army—Clark on February 27th, 1807, and Lewis on March 2d following. March 3d, Jefferson signed Lewis's commission, and nine days later Clark's. The onerous duties appertaining to these offices, in the new and vast territory through which they had journeyed, were necessarily absorbing; and neither being a literary man, the task of publication under such circumstances was easily deferred. Lewis's death Urged by Jefferson—who from the first had been keenly desirous to have the records of the exploration as soon as possible made the common property of the world—it was in 1809 agreed that General Lewis should in earnest undertake the work. He was travelling on horseback through Tennessee, on his way to Washington, intending thereafter to go to Philadelphia to enter upon this editorial task, when he lost his life during the night of October 11th. A guest, at the time, of a wayside settler some sixty miles southwest of Nashville, it was reported that he had committed suicide—a theory which Jefferson, probably his closest friend, accepted without question; but it was and still is believed by many that he was murdered for the small sum of money upon his person at the time.1 1 See discussion in Coues, Lewis and Clark, i, pp, xl-lvii; and Wheeler, The Trail of Lewis and Clark (New York, 1904), i, pp. 61–74. Clark engages Biddle Clark, now the sole surviving head of the expedition, prompted by the indefatigable Jefferson, appears to have soon sought the assistance of an editor in bringing out the proposed publication. It seems that, probably early in 1810, overtures were made to him from some literary person in Richmond, Virginia;2 2 See Biddle-Clark correspondence in Coues, Lewis and Clark, i, pp. lxxxii et seq. but these he rejected, and earnestly solicited the aid of Nicholas Biddle, of Philadelphia. Biddle, who was descended from one of the oldest Philadelphia families, had graduated from Princeton in his sixteenth year (1801); he had been secretary to John Armstrong, our minister to France (1804), and while in Paris bad superintended the payment of American claims growing out of the Louisiana Purchase —in this capacity greatly surprising the French officials both by his brilliancy and his youth-After travelling extensively in Europe, he became secretary to Mr. Monroe while the latter was minister to Great Britain but in 1807 returned to practise law in Philadelphia. At the time of Clark's invitation, Biddle was but twenty-four years of age; nevertheless he had already attained considerable reputation as a financier, lawyer, and man of letters— in the last-named field being editor of the Port-folio—and socially was by many considered both the handsomest and the most charming man in Philadelphia, as he certainly was one of the most cultivated. It is small wonder that Clark selected him as the writer of the narrative. In his second letter to Biddle, dated February 20th, 1810, from the home of his father-in-law, Colonel George Hancock, near Fincastle, Virginia—then being visited by the general— he invites his correspondent to come to him at that place, "where I have my books and memorandoms and stay with me a week or two; read over &amp; make yourself thereby acquainted with everything which may not be explained in the Journals. . . . Such parts as may not be full, I can explain, and add such additional matter as I may recollect. I brought the Books with me to Copy such parts as are intended for the Botanical work which I shall send to Doctr Barton, and will deliver the Books to you if you will engage to write the naritive &amp;c." On the third of March Biddle replied to Clark, regretting "that it will be out of my power to undertake what you had the politeness to offer;" explaining that "My occupations necessarily confine me to Phila. and I have neither health nor leisure to do sufficient justice to the fruits of your enterprize and ingenuity. You cannot be long however without making a more fortunate selection. Two weeks later, however (March 17), he again addressed Clark—who was still at Fincastle—and reports having been seen by some of the latter's friends in Philadelphia; the result of the conference being that he "will therefore very readily agree to do all that is in my power for the advancement of the work; and I think I can promise with some confidence that it shall be ready as soon as the publisher is prepared to print it. Having made up my mind today, I am desirous that no delay shall occur on my part." He therefore will soon visit the general at Fincastle. The latter replied (March 25) with "most sincere acknowledgements for the friendly sentiments," and urged an immediate visit, "as my business calls me to Louisiana; and nothing detains me, but the business l wish with you Biddle at work Biddle made the trip to Fincastle, noted Clark's oral statements, and carried back with him to Philadelphia the journals and maps of the expedition, from which he at once began to prepare its history. In May, Clark sent to the editor George Shannon1 1 Shannon was born in Pennsylvania, of a good family, in 1787. After the return of the expedition he lost a leg as the result of a wound at the hands of Indians, the amputation having taken place at St. Charles, Mo. Soon after serving Biddle, he was admitted to the bar at Louisville, Ky.; becoming a circuit judge in Kentucky, a state senator in Missouri, and U. S. district attorney for Missouri. He died suddenly in court in 1836, aged forty-nine years. who when a lad of sixteen years, had creditably served as one of the privates in the detachment. Then twenty-three years old, and studying for the law, Shannon appears to have remained in Philadelphia during most of the time spent in draughting the narrative, and to have materially assisted Biddle both in interpreting the note-books and giving personal recollections of the tour. Not only did Clark tender the services of Shannon, but he himself was in frequent correspondence with the editor,2 2 The following memoranda, found in Clark-voorhis note-book No. 4, were evidently made by General Clark at this time: "Mem. Enquire at St Louis into the Situation &amp; number of the Crow Indians &amp; which, if either, of their bands is called the Paunch Indians. Also for some Indian speeches. Story of the Osage on the subject of the Beaver. Send to Mr. Biddle every thing authentic &amp; not yet published on the subject of the Fur Trade. Get an Indain song about the Fur Trade Fur Compy"—Ed. and purchased and forwarded to him the journal of Sergeant Ordway. The journal of Sergeant Gass being already in print, was of course also accessible to Biddle. The talented young editor at once surrendered himself almost completely to the difficult task before him; he had promised Clark that the narrative should be ready for the press within twelve months. By the seventh of July he appears to have finished the story up to July 7th, 1805, above the Falls of the Missouri; for in a note to his distinguished correspond ent, chiefly concerning the maps for the publication 3 3 Which were being prepared by F. R. Hassier, of Schenectady, N. Y. he playfully says: "Today I have sent you and ten men up into a bottom to look for wood to make canoes after the unhappy failure of your iron boat." A year later (July 8, 1811) he wrote to Clark, informing him that he had "completed the work agreeable to our engagement," and was "ready to put it to the press whenever Mr. Conrad chose." Wanted: a publisher In our day, a manuscript of this character would eagerly be sought by publishers. Stanley, Nordenskjöld, Nansen, and Hedin have had but to choose among applicants from the book trade. Ninety years ago, the situation was far different. John Conrad, a prominent publisher of his day, was finaily prevailed upon to undertake the work, the financial outcome of which seemed to some others doubtful. He appears to have entered into the project with much interest; but by the time Biddle was ready, Conrad had fallen into financial straits, and in due course was plunged into bankruptcy; for this was the period of the second war with England, and business was unsettled. Biddle accordingly writes to Clark, July 4th, 1811, stating the facts in the case, and incidentally mentioning that "Last winter I was prevented from going to the legislature chiefly by a desire to stay &amp; superintend the printing." He has, however, made an arrangement with Thomas Bradford, "one of the best booksellers here," and hopes that "we can proceed vigorously &amp; soon get the volumes out" Despite Biddle's optimism affairs dragged slowly, for Bradford's terms were unsatisfactory. Over a year later (September 5 1812), we find Clark offering Biddle "the half of every profit arising from it, if you will attend to it, have it Completed as far as it is possible and necessary, printed published &amp;c. including the advances which have and may be necessary &amp;c." Biddle does not appear to have accepted this financial proposi tion; familiar with the book market, he probably anticipated the failure of the project. Throughout the course of the work Conrad continued his friendly concern, and assisted Biddle in his strenuous search for a publisher. November 12th, he writes Biddle that he has tried Johnson &amp; Warner without success; that firm "seem to have so incorrect an idea of the value of the work and probable profits arising from the publication of it." He advises Biddle to "agree to Mr. Bradfords offer. It is I am confident the best bargain you can make for Genl Clarke. The copyright I presume will be in him (Genl. C.) &amp; I suppose he will derive the entire benefit of the sale of the M. S. in England." A publisher found This advice Biddle in due time felt impelled to accept, and February 23d, 1813, tells Clark that having found Bradford's terms "not such as I thought advantageous I made proposals to all the booksellers in town. The stagnation in that branch of business was so great that no one was willing to embark in it, and after a great deal of fruitless negociation I was obliged to return and on the advice of Mr. Conrad accept Mr. Bradford's proposals. . . I now wait only for the engravers who will soon I hope finish their work and then we can strike off the printing immediately &amp; in a little time the work will be published." Nevertheless a year was spent in the mechanical execution of the two small volumes. Meanwhile the publishing firm of Bradford &amp; Inskeep, who had undertaken the work, in their turn became insolvent and at the actual time of publication (February 20, 1814)1 1 The date of the first sale of volumes. See Coues, Lewis and Clark, i, pp. xci, xcii, for detailed statement of the financial outcome of the enterprise. were in the bankruptcy court. Paul Allen's revision Just before going to press, Biddle was elected to the legislature, in which he soon won an enviable reputation for statesmanlike qualities. Being thus prevented from paying that attention to the book which he thought it deserved, he engaged Paul Allen, a Philadelphia newspaper writer, to supervise the issue. In a letter to Clark (March 23), reviewing some of the circumstances of the publication, Biddle says: "The gentleman who received and prepared it for the press, Mr. Allen, is a very capable person, and as I did not put the finishing hand to the volumes I did not think it right to take from him the credit of his own exertion and care by announcing personally the part which I had in the compilation. I am content that my trouble in the business should be recognized only by the pleasure which attended it and also by the satisfaction of making your acquaintance, which I shall always value. I could have wished that your time had permitted you to revise the whole of the work, as no doubt some errors and inadvertencies have from the nature of the volumes and the circumstances attending the publication crept into them. I hope however that you will not find them very numerous or important . . . Henceforth you may sleep upon your fame, which must last as laong as books can endurc. Mr. Bradford has I presume sent you a copy of the work." Despite Biddle's determination to claim no credit for the narrative which has long been regarded a classic in American history, it is quite apparent that Allen's connection with the enterprise was but that of reviser for the press. He himself frankly states in the Preface, that he does not wish "to arrogate anything from the exertions of others;" that "he found but little to change, and that his labor has been principally confined to revising the manuscript, comparing it with the original papers, and inserting such additional matter as appears to have been intentionally deferred by the writer [Mr. Biddle] till the period of a more mature revisal." Allen secured from President Jefferson an admirable memoir of Lewis; possibly, he also blocked out the chapters; and in a measure the mechanical form may be due to him. His labors were doubtless important from the typographical and clerical side; but of course the credit for the enterprise should chiefly rest with Biddle. That the latter had finished the work, ready for the final touches of a practical reviser for the press, is evident from his own letters to Clark, as well as the confirmatory statement which has come down to us from Conrad. In his richly annotated edition of theTravels (N. Y., 1893, 4 vols.) Dr. Elliott Coues spends much space and energy in persistently heaping vituperation on Allen for fathering a work mainly performed by another. Biddle had the undoubted right to withdraw his name from public connection with the narrative. We may consider his reasons Quixotish, but he was entitled to be guided by them, and they certainly bespeak a nature more generous than we are accustomed to meet. As for Allen, it is evident that he did his part with becoming modesty; no doubt he well earned the fee of $500—partly taken out in trade—with which he was rewarded by the publishers. Press-revision and proof-reading are no light tasks; although we might wish that, while he was at it, he had also given us an index. A profitless undertaking The size of the edition was, apparently, 2,000 copies1 1 In this, I follow Coues. Of these it would seem that 583 were either lost in some manner— "supposed to be destroyed in binder's or printer's hands"—or were defective from lacking plates; this would leave for sale only 1,417 perfect copies, which explains why the book is now rare. The net profits on the enterprise were computed at $154.10, of which neither Clark nor Biddle appears to have received a penny. The copper plates of the engraved maps became the property of the latter, and are now owned by his son, the Hon. Craig Biddle, of Philadelphia. The Clark was left the copyright. As for the heirs of Lewis, we find them2 2 Cours, L. and C., i. pp. xciii, xciv. as late as 1816–17 making application to Clark for their share of the carnings, "persuaded that profit arising from that work has been received. "and being informed by the latter of the dismal result of the enterprise. Over two and a half years after the publication, a letter from Clark to Jefferson (October 10, 1816)3 3 Published in our Appendix. reveals the fact that the explorer had himself "not been so fortunate as to procure a single volume, as yet"—thus showing that Bradford, in the midst of his financial troubles, had not carried out the abovementioned agreement with Biddle, to transmit a copy of the work to the man chiefly concerned in its appearance. Difficulty of Biddle's task The service of Biddle in editing the journals of the Lewis and Clark expendition, was a far more difficult literary undertaking than is commonly supposed. The entire mass of notes which he had before him may be thus roughly computed: Lewis and Clark journals (Amer. Philosophical Society codices) 900,000 words Gass Journal (as printed) 83,000 " Ordway Journal—unknown, but possibly 100,000 " 1,083,000 Barton's proposed work To this we should add about 160,000 words in the Clark-Voorhis collection, later to be described, and undoubtedly at one time in Biddle's hands; and whatever additional notes he may himself have made during conversations with Clark and Shannon, or as the result of correspondence with the former — and they must have been copious. A large proportion of the scientific matter of the Lewis and Clark note-books, howover, which may have aggregated a fourth of the journals as a whole, had at the outset been eliminated by Clark and Biddle. This material, carefully copied out, was sent to Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton, an eminent naturalist in Philadelphia.1 1 A professor of medicine in the University of Pennsylvania, and a vice-president of the American Philosophical Society. Dr. Barton agreed to edit a special volume,"which was to have been (by contract) prepared in six months from the time" of the appearance of the narrative of the journey. Owning to Barton's illness and consequent death, this "cientific part"2 2 Clark's letter to Jefferson, dated St. Louis, Oct. 10, 1816, given in our Appendix. was not written. Thus, while the Biddle narrative gives a popular account of some of the principal discoveries, the scientific data so laboriously kept by Lewis and Clark, chiefly the former, has not heretofore been published. A successful paraphrase It was Biddle's task to weave this mass of heterogeneous data into a readable paraphrase which should have unity and a simple and forceful literary style. Adopting so far as possible the language of the original journals, where essential he amplifies and explains them from his additional data—Clark and Shannon's verbal statements, and the Ordway and Gass journals, assisting him to a more complete understanding. The nearly 1,500,000 words of manuscript he condensed into 370,000 printed words. The first person plural is used, save where the captains are individually mentioned, and then we have the third person singular. So skilfully is the work done, that probably few have realized that they had not before them the veritable journals of the explorers themselves, written upon the spot. The result will always remain one of the best digested and most interesting books of American travel, comparable in many respects with Astoria and Bonneville's Adventures—of course lacking Irving's charm of style, but possessing what Irving's two Western classics do not, the ring of truth, which never fails to appeal to those who love a tale of noble adventure in the cause of civilization.1 1 For a bibliographical account of the Biddle paraphrase, see Mr. Paltsits's Bibliographical Data in the present volume. Jefferson dissatisfied We have seen that Jefferson, who set on foot the expedition, had from the first expressed much concern in its records, both in the making and the publication. He had urged their early printing, and on Lewis's death spurred Clark to action; with what result, has been related The dilatoriness of that performance—for which Clark, how-ever, was only partly responsible—fretted the great man. December 6th, 1813, he wrote to Baron von Humboldt: "You will find it inconceivable that Lewis's journey to the Pacific should not yet have appeared; nor is it in my power to tell you the reason. The measures taken by his surviving companion, Clark, for the publication, have not answered our wishes in point of dispatch. I think, however, from what I have heard, that the mere journal will be out within a few weeks in two volumes, 8vo. These I will take care to send you with the tobacco seed you desired, if it be possible for them to escape the thousand ships of our enemies spread over the ocean. The botanical and zoological discoveries of Lewis will probably experience greater delay, and become known to the world through other channels before that volume will be ready. The Atlas, I believe, waits on the leisure of the engraver"2 2 See full text, in Appendix. Nearly a hundred years have elapsed, and until the present work neither scientific data nor atlas has been given to the public. Jefferson's search for Original Journals Three years later (1816), we find Jefferson instituting a search for the manuscript journals of the explorers, with a view of placing them in the archives of the American Philosophical Society. He writes (April 26)3 3 The correspondence here cited is given in full in the Appendix. to Prof. Joseph F. Correa da Serra, a botanist then holding membership in the Society, asking him in the cause of science to interest himself in the matter, and describing in some detail the character of the documents— with which he was himself familiar, for he had handled them at Monticello. These papers, he informs Da Serra, "are the property of the government, the fruits of the expedition undertaken at such expence of money and risk of valuable lives. They contain exactly the whole of the information which it was our object to obtain for the benefit of our own country and of the world, but we were willing to give to Lewis and Clarke whatever pecuniary benefits might be derived from the publication, and therefore left the papers in their hands, taking for granted that their interests would produce a speedy publication, which would be better if done under their direction. but the death of Cap.t Lewis, the distance and occupations of General Clarke, and the bankruptcy of their bookseller, have retarded the publication, and rendered necessary that the government should attend to the reclamation &amp; security of the papers. their recovery is now become an imperious duty. their safest deposit as fast as they can be collected, will be the Philosophical society, who no doubt will be so kind as to recieve and preserve them, subject to the order of government. . . . As to any claims of individuals to these papers, it is to be observed that, as being the property of the public, we are certain neither Lewis nor Clarke would undertake to convey away the right to them, and that they could not convey them, had they been capable of intending it. . . . my interference will, I trust, be excused, not only from the portion which every citizen has in whatever is public, but from the peculiar part I have had in the design and execution of this expedition." It appears that Biddle, who still held the majority of the note-books, was disinclined to surrender them to Jefferson save on order of Clark. September 8th, Jefferson wrote to the general, soliciting such an order, to "be given in favor either of the War office or myself. . . . I should receive them only in trust for the War office to which they belong, and take their orders relating to them." He wishes to deposit with the Philosophical Society "for safekeeping the travelling pocket journals as originals to be recurred to on all interesting questions arising out of the published journal;" his desire being to secure "to the world all the beneficial results we were entitled to expect from it [the expedition], and which would so fully justify the expences of the expedition incurred by the United States in that expectation." October 10th, Clark responds to Jefferson by enclosing "an Order on my friend Mr. Biddle for the papers in his possession," Biddle being at the same time instructed, as his agent, "to collect all the Books, papers, specimens, &amp;c." in the hands of Dr. Barton's heirs or others. Clark expresses interest in Jefferson's desire to collect the papers, and adds: "From the mortification of not haveing succeeded in giving to the world all the results of that expedition, I feel Relief &amp; greatitude for the interest which you are willing to take, in effecting what has not been in my power to accomplish." Nevertheless, we shall presently see that Clark had retained in his possession at St. Louis five of his own original journals, nearly all the maps made by him upon the expedition, and many miscellaneous documents concerning the enterprise; these he did not surrender. Jefferson now writes to Dr. John Vaughan of the Society (June 28, 1817), saying that although Da Serra had obtained several note-books from Mr. Biddle and Mrs. Barton, considerable difficulty is being experienced in collecting all the documents. Evidently much annoyed, he proposes to bring pressure to bear, through the secretary of war, "that office having some rights to these papers." The further suggestion is made, that the Society publish "in their Transactions or otherwise," a digest of the "zoological, vegetable &amp; mineralogical papers &amp; subjects." Biddle surrenders note-books On the eighth of April, 1818, we learn from the manuscript minutes of the corporation that "Mr. Nicholas Biddle deposited the original journals of Lewis and Clark, with an account of them and of those journals and documents which he was not possessed of." The deposit consisted of eighteen note-books and twelve parcels of loose sheets; of these, thirteen are in red-morocco covers— seven by Lewis and six by Clark.1 1 The correspondence touching upon this event will be found in full in the Appendix. Used by Coues Here the records of Jefferson's search suddenly cease. Neither the federal government nor the American Philosophical Society having decided to publish them, these precious manuscripts slumbered untouched for nearly seventy-five years in the library vault of the Society, practically unknown to historical scholars outside of that institution. In 1892, Dr. Elliott Coues, eminent as a scientist and traveller, as well as an editor of American historical sources, was engaged in preparing the new edition of Biddle, to which frequent reference has already been made. Most if not all of his matter was before him in galley proofs, when he learned for the first time of the existence of the original manuscripts in Philadelphia. Armed with a letter from the explorer's son, Jefferson Kearny Clark, of St. Louis, Coues requested the loan of the note-books from their custodian. This was granted by the Society (vote of December 16), and the manuscripts were accordingly sent to him at Washington. Concluding that it was too late to block out the work afresh and discard Biddle's text, he compromised by enriching his notes with many citations from the originals—unfortunately freely modernized, as was his custom with all the Western manuscripts which he edited; and from them he also compiled a new chapter in the Biddle style, which he inserted into the body of the book, as though a part of the Biddle text. His modified excerpts but served to whet the appetites of students of American history, and thus led to the project for their eventual publication in extenso and with literal accuracy. Coues's report on codices In returning the journals to the Society, Coues transmitted therewith a detailed report upon their scope and condition.1 1 Published in American Philosophical Proceedings, xxi (No. 140), pp. 17–33; reprinted, in abbreviated form, in our Appendix. While in his possession, he attached to each codex (note-book) a memorandum summarizing its contents, and to each gave an identifying letter, running from A to T. This was commendable; but certain other liberties which he took with the manuscripts merit our condemnation —for in many codices he freely interlined the text with his own verbal changes and comments; and in general appeared to treat the material as though mere copy for the printer, which might be revised by him with impunity. Apparently the codices remained unopened after their return; for it was not until the summer of 1903 that the Society authorities were made aware, by one who was examining them in detail, of the surprising treatment to which they had been subjected. Philosophical Society concludes to publish The next chapter in the story opened in the spring of 1901, when the Society's Committee on Historical Manuscripts determined—in view of the forthcoming centennial of the Louisiana Purchase—at last to carry out Jefferson's suggestion, and secure the publication of the Lewis and Clark journals direct from the original manuscripts in their custody. They interested in this project the present publishers, who in turn engaged the writer as Editor of the work. In the course of consequent investigation into the sources, there came to view in the Society's library a few other Lewis and Clark items, besides the codices handled and labelled by Coues; these were chiefly statistical tables regarding the Western Indians, a meteorological record, and a list of the explorers' specimens sent from Fort Mandan to the Society1 1 See Appendix, for this document. —matters of considerable although not commanding importance.2 2 Several copies of the Indian vocabulary blank prepared by Jefferson are also in the possession of the American Philosophical Society, having been presented by him in October, 1820. It consists of a sheet 7 3/4 × 19 1/4″, printed on both sides— although there are some which were printed on but one side of a sheet twice this width, the two pages standing side by side. Those filled out represent, among others, the Miami, Micmac, Shawnee, Chippewa, and Lenâpe languages; while several are still blank. In the collection are no vocabularies which appear to have emanated from the Lewis and Clark expedition. Search for Ordway Journal In Coues's report on the codices, occurs this note: "One of Clark's Journals is now in the possession of his son, [the late] Mr. Jefferson K. Clark, of St. Louis. I am not informed of the date covered by this volume, nor of the nature of its contents." Upon assuming charge of the proposed publication, the present writer at once approached the heirs of General William Clark for permission to use the Ordway Journal, in case it could be found among the family papers. As the result of protracted negotiations, an unexpected situation was revealed. The third son and fourth child of General Clark and his first wife, Julia Hancock, was George Rogers Hancock Clark, born at St. Louis in 1816 and dying in 1858. This son was his father's executor, and as such came into possession of the explorer's papers and many other family relics, which he appears to have arranged and labelled with some care. Upon his death they descended to his eldest child, now Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis of New York City, whose proprietary rights are at present shared with her daughter, Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis. The Voorhis collection It appears that a few years ago Mrs. Voorhis began the examination of the collection with a view to selecting therefrom, for a projected compilation of her own, certain documents which pertained to the public careers of various members of the Clark family, particularly William and George Rogers. This examination was still privately in progress when, in the autumn of 1903, the present Editor— quite unconscious of the existence of other historical manuscripts at the Voorhis home—appeared upon the scene with his application for the Ordway Journal. Indeed, the ladies themselves were as yet unaware of the full significance of their treasures, especially those appertaining to the great expedition. The result was that the writer in several visits personally completed the examination of the collection, with the papers of the expedition especially in view; and arrangements were concluded between the proprietors of the documents and the publishers, by which all those essential to the complete narrative of the Lewis and Clark exploration are to be published in the present work. The Voorhis collection of Lewis and Clark material is of surprising richness, and consists of the following items: Clark Journals Red morocco note-book No. 1—Diary, April 7–July 3, 1805; 38,000 words, with 3 maps of the Falls of the Missouri. Field-book, bound in a rude piece of elk skin, secured by a thong and button, and undoubtedly carried in Clark's pocket upon the expedition —Diary, Sept. 11–Dec. 31, 1805; 20,000 words, with over a dozen full-page sketch-maps of the trail over the mountains, and the neighborhood of Fort Clatsop, interwoven with the badly blurred text. On the skin cover is a rude plan of the fort itself. Red morocco note-book No. 2—Diary, Jan. 30–April 3, 1806; 41,000 words, with numerous pen sketches of canoes, birds, dwellings, tools, etc. by the same hand (Clark's) as those contained in Lewis's codices of similar dates, in the American Philosophical Society's collection. Red morocco note-book No. 3—Diary, April 4–June 6, 1806; 35,000 words, with some sketch-maps. Fragment of Journal—Detached leaves, giving evidently first draft of entries, April 16–21, 1806; 2,300 words. Red morocco note-book No. 4—No diary, but containing sundry notes and tables of weather, distances, astronomical and ethnological data—all covered, however, in more finished manuscripts in the American Philosophical Society's collection. There are also in this book four excellent colored maps. Miscellaneous Material An orderly book, by several hands, running from April 1 to Oct. 13, 1804, and a detached entry for Jan. 1, 1806; detached orders promulgated at River Dubois camp, Feb. 20 and March 4, 1804; also a few detached orders issued during the expedition. Ten letters (some of them drafts)—Lewis offering (June 19, 1803) Clark an equal partnership in command of the expedition; Clark's acceptance thereof (July 17); Clark's letter to President Jefferson (July 24), informing him of this fact; Lewis to Clark (Aug. 3), expressing his gratification at the latter's favorable response; six others, chiefly by Clark, relating to various phases of the expedition. Letter of Clark to "Mr. Hugh Henry at the N. W. Co. establishments on the Assiniboin River," written from the Yellowstone, July 20, 1806 (2,000 words); and Clark's order to Sergeant N. Pryor, dated July 25, 1806, directing him to take the aforesaid letter to Henry, together with twelve or fourteen horses (320 words). An address from the citizens of Fincastle and its vicinity to Captains Lewis and Clark, dated January 8, 1807 (300 words); and Clark's undated answer thereto (300 words). Numerous other letters and memoranda—among them the original of Jefferson's letter of credit; Clark's various military commissions, before, during, and after the expedition; fragmentary records of courses and distances, Indian tribes, weather data, and the like; information concerning the Assiniboin country obtained from British traders at Fort Mandan; and one of Clark's speeches to the Indians, in 1806. Maps Most important of all are about sixty detailed maps, for the most part made by Clark while on the trip, he being engineer of the detachment. Collectively, these illustrate the greater part of the journey both going and returning, indicate camping-places, and contain many interesting comments on the country and the Indians. These charts vary in size from eight inches square to several feet long. In addition to the above manuscripts, there are in this collection several oil paintings of the Clarks—chiefly George Rogers and William—together with numerous valuable relics of these men, making of the Voorhis home a museum of great interest to students of Western history. An interesting query Neglected manuscripts Why did not General Clark surrender this wealth of manuscripts either to the American Philosophical Society or to Jefferson, when the latter was searching for all the documents of the expedition, stoutly claiming them as the undoubted property of the government? The probable answer is, that Biddle found the four Clark-Voorhis morocco note-books of no service to him; for practically all the facts contained in them are either in Lewis's journals of similar dates or in other drafts by Clark. He doubtless returned the books to Clark, in the early stages of the work, keeping only those which later were placed in the Society's archives. It is probable, also, that the engraver having completed such maps as he deemed necessary for the publication, all the charts made upon the expedition were returned to Clark. As for the skin-bound field-book, this having already been transcribed into a red morocco note-book, very likely the original did not go to Biddle at all; the orderly book, the various fragments, the Lewis-Clark correspondence, and the letter of credit, were doubtless also retained at St. Louis as being deemed, for Biddle's purpose of a popular narrative, unusable material. On his part, it is probable that Clark had either forgotten the existence of these documents, or, like Biddle, considered them as of relatively slight historical value. His seemingly careless treatment of them would appear to bear out the last conclusion. In all events, they remained among his papers untouched, until tied into packets and labelled by his son and executor, George Rogers Hancock Clark.1 1 General William Clark's appointment as Superintendent of Indian Affairs and Brigadier General of Militia for the Territory of Louisiana (1807) has already been noted in the text. In this dual part, he was eminently successful. Governor Lewis had been succeeded in that office by Benjamin Howard, and the following year (1810)' the name of the territory was changed to Missouri. July 1, 1813, Clark was appointed by President Madison as governor of Missouri Territory, being several times recommissioned as such—in 1816, 1817, and 1820. In the last-named year, Missouri entered the Union, and Clark was a candidate for the first State governor, but was defeated in the election by Alexander McNair. In 1820, President Monroe appointed him to the newly created office of federal Superintendent of Indian Affairs; two years later, he was commissioned as Surveyor General for the States of Illinois and Missouri and the Territory of Arkansas. He died at St. Louis, September 1st, 1838, in his sixty-ninth year, and was given an impressive funeral, in which the entire community took part. Governor Clark was twice married—first, at Fincastle, Virginia, January 5, 1808, to Julia Hancock, who died in 1820, leaving four sons and a daughter; second, at St. Louis, November 28, 1821, to Mrs. Harriet Kennerly Radford, who died in 1831, leaving one son by William Clark. The manuscripts again suffered a long period of neglect, and eventually were sent to New York, where they became the property of Mrs. Voorhis, the story of whose connection with them has already been told. Pryor, Floyd, Frazier, and Woodhouse Journals It has often been asserted that Sergeant Pryor wrote a journal of the expedition, and some have assumed that Biddle used it in preparing the narrative of 1814; but evidence to this effect is wanting—in any event, no one now seems to know the whereabouts of this manuscript. The journal (12,500 words, covering the dates March 13 — August 18, 1804) of Sergeant Floyd, the only man of the party to meet death during the trip,2 2 Floyd, aged about twenty years (possibly twenty-three), died near the site of the present Sioux City, Iowa, May 14th, 1804, and was buried on the top of a neighboring bluff. The site is now marked by a stately stone monument dedicated (May 30, 1901) to his memory by the Floyd Memorial Association. See Reports of the association—First, 1897; Second, 1901. The Floyds were prominent Kentucky pioneers. Colonel John Floyd, the head of the family, was a friend and contemporary of Daniel Boone and George Rogers Clark. But little is known of the young sergeant's personal history, save that his father, also Charles, was a surveyor and a friend of Boone. Governor John Floyd, of Virginia, father of John B. Floyd, Buchanan's secretary of war, was a first cousin of the sergeant. Much prominence has been given to Sergeant Floyd, because he was the only man to suffer death upon this expedition, because it is thought that he was the first United States soldier to lose his life west of the Mississippi River, and because his captains praised him as a faithful man—see entry by Clark, post, under date August 20th, 1804. Floyd's Journal —which was discovered by the present writer among hitherto-neglected papers of the late Dr. Lyman C. Draper, in February, 1893 —has of course greatly added to his reputation, and made of him a far more important character in the annals of the expedition than he otherwise would have been. was in the spring of 1805 sent from Fort Mandan to his parents in Kentucky, and eventually became the property of the Wisconsin Historical Society. With many textual errors in transcription, it was published in 1894 in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, with an introduction by Dr. James Davie Butler. Soon after the return of the expedition, Robert Frazier, one of the privates, solicited subscriptions in Vermont for a publication of his journal, to be "contained in about 400 pages octavo;" but it did not appear, and the present writer has no knowledge of the manuscript.1 1 See Appendix, for Frazier's prospectus. The existence of a journal by Private Joseph Whitehouse was unknown until recently. It was purchased in San Francisco by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., to be published in connection with the Original Journals of Lewis and Clark; after having been edited for the press, the manuscript (containing 67,000 words, covering the dates May 14, 1804–November 6, 1805) was acquired from the publishers by Edward E. Ayer, the well known Chicago collector.2 2 Nothing appears to be known concerning the history of Joseph Whitehouse, save that he was one of the nine young Kentuckians whom Clark recruited for the expedition. The manuscript of his journal was purchased by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. from Mrs. Gertrude Haley (widow of Captain John Haley), of San Francisco, from whom it has been impossible for the present Editor to obtain any very definite information concerning its career. According to Mrs. Haley's statements, obtained only after a protracted correspondence with her, it would appear that Whitehouse, when upon his death-bed (date unknown), gave the journal to his confessor, Canon de Vivaldi, who subsequently (1860) went as a Roman Catholic missionary to Patagonia. Upon leaving the United States, Vivaldi deposited the manuscript with the New York Historical Society, in whose museum it rested until 1893. In that year, Vivaldi was in Los Angeles, California. Captain and Mrs. Haley were stopping at the same hotel. Mrs. Haley says that her husband advanced money to the missionary, and was in return given an order on the New York Society for the journal, which the historian, Hubert Bancroft, had told them was of great value. Haley obtained the document in 1894, and it remained Mrs. Haley's property until sold to the present publishers. The Editor's attention had been directed to the manuscript because of its being offered to the Library of Congress. That institution declined to pay the price asked for it, and Dodd, Mead &amp; Co.'s successful negotiations followed. The authenticity of the journal is self evident, and its historical value is considerable. While for the most part in the writing of Whitehouse, many entries are in other hands as will be noted in the publication of the document itself, in vol. vi of the present work. All records now in sight Thus, seventy-five years after Jefferson's quest, and within the centennial year of the departure of the Lewis and Clark expedition from their preliminary camp on River Dubois, there have at last been located presumably all the literary records now extant, of that notable enterprise in the cause of civilization. The Original Journals, now definitively published to the world, in a dress which surely would have satisfied Jefferson, must create a new interest in the deeds of Lewis and Clark. They are, in the mass, much more extensive than the Biddle narrative; the voluminous scientific data here given—in botany, zoölogy, meteorology, geology, astronomy, and ethnology —is almost entirely a fresh contribution; and we obtain from the men's note-books as written from day to day, a far more vivid picture of the explorers and their life, than can be seen through the alembic of Biddle's impersonal condensation. A new view of Lewis and Clark The pages of the journals are aglow with human interest. The quiet, even temper of the camp; the loving consideration that each of the two leaders felt for the other; the magnanimity of Lewis, officially the leader, in equally dividing every honor with his friend, and making no move without the latter's consent; the poetic temperament of Lewis, who loved flowers and animals, and in his notes discoursed like a philosopher who enjoyed the exercise of writing; the rugged character of Clark, who wrote in brief, pointed phrase, and, less educated of the two, spelled phonetically, capitalized chaotically, and occasionally slipped in his grammar—all these and more, are evident on every page; causing the reader deeply to admire the men, and to follow them in their often thrilling adventures with the keenest sympathy and anticipation. We shall henceforth know Lewis and Clark as we never knew them before. The Biddle narrative will no doubt continue to live as the brief popular account of an exploration fraught with great consequence to American expansion; but at least the student of history will feel that the original records, as the men wrote them on the spot, are by far the more satisfying of the two. Editorial problems In preparing for the press these Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, many editorial problems have arisen, which it is unnecessary here to discuss in detail. In brief, it may be said that the abundance of material has in itself often proved an embarrassment. As already stated, the two captains frequently rewrote their records; for the most part, only the definitive form remains to us, but there are long periods for which we have two or more drafts. Then again, each leader freely copied from the other, although generally with some variation. In the case of the narrative proper, the Editor has, with a few exceptions, thought best to retain the several drafts in the order of their preparation; this method involves occasional repetition of statement, but in a publication of the original records it appears advisable to exhibit the literary methods of the explorers. With regard, however, to the statistical and scientific material, it has not seemed essential to publish the different drafts—the best only has been presented. In the department of Scientific Data, it will be noted that in a few instances some of the tabular matter has been co-ordinated, the sources being indicated either by differentiation in type or by explanatory foot-notes. Some of the tables were prepared by the explorers in a manner quite impossible of reproduction in type. But wherever practicable, we have sought to imitate the original as closel as the limitations of typography will allow. We have seen that the codices in the possession of the American Philosophical Society contain many erasures, interlineations, and emendations—by Clark, Biddle, Coues, and an unknown hand. The scientific entries were generally crossed in red ink, with the note, "Copy for Dr. Barton;" this meant that such matter was to be reserved for Barton's proposed volume on the scientific results of the expedition, which, however, was not prepared. The present Editor has disregarded marks of this character. His method of indicating to the reader the various emendations, is explained in the foot-note to page 11 of the present volume, post. The arrangement of chapters follows the Biddle edition of 1814. In that narrative the chapters were of proper and nearly equal length; whereas in this, owing to the greater extent of material, they are unequal and some of them abnormally extended. A new system of chaptering would have obviated this difficulty and thus presented a better mechanical appearance. Nevertheless, it has been deemed best to retain the Biddle chapters—they are convenient chronological and geographical divisions; they are familiar to scholars, and thus have acquired a certain historical and bibliographical standing; moreover, comparisons between the Biddle paraphrase and the Original Journals will be facilitated by their retention. Acknowledgments A work of this character, involving so wide a range of territory, interests, and studies, must in considerable measure be co-operative in its character. The Editor's requests for advice and assistance have on every hand met with most cordial responses, for which a mere enumeration of names seems only cold acknowledgment; it is hoped that each of his correspondents and colleagues will between the lines read a heartier appreciation than to others may be apparent. The Bibliographical Data contributed to the present work by Mr. Victor Hugo Paltsits, of the New York Public Library, is a work of great value; like the Original Journals themselves, this chapter on the literature of the subject will doubtless prove definitive. The officers of the American Philosophical Society, particularly the secretary, Dr. I. Minis Hays, have been kindness itself. Valuable notes on the scientific results of the expedition have been freely contributed by Dr. William Trelease, Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden at St. Louis; Messrs. Stewardson Brown and Witmer Stone, assistants to the curators of the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia; Mr. James Newton Baskett, of Mexico, Missouri; Professor Edwin H. Barbour, of the University of Nebraska; Professor E. E. Blackman, archæologist for the Nebraska Historical Society; Professor Charles V. Piper, botanist and entomologist of the Washington (State) Agricultural and Experiment Station at Pullman; and Professor Franklin H. King, of the United States Department of Agriculture. Detailed information concerning the over-mountain trail of the expedition has been obtained from Mr. Olin D. Wheeler, of the General Passenger and Ticket Department of the Northern Pacific Railway, whose two-volume work, The Trail of Lewis and Clark, will prove of much practical value to American historians; and Professor F. G. Young, of the University of Oregon. Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, of Oregon City, Oregon, has contributed most liberally from the surprisingly rich store of historical materials which, with remarkable enterprise and perseverance, she accumulated during her preparation for the writing of The Conquest; her persistent helpfulness has laid the Editor under unusual obligations. Courtesies of various kinds have also been received from the following persons—to mention but a few of the many who, throughout the past two years, have aided the publication: Hon. Pierre Chouteau, and Hon. Walter B. Douglas, of St. Louis, members of the Missouri Historical Society, and the society's librarian, Miss Mary Louise Dalton; Hon. Craig Biddle, of Philadelphia; Mrs. Laura E. Howey, secretary and librarian of the Historical and Miscellaneous Department of the Montana State Library; Mrs. S. Lou Monroe-Farmer, of Portland, Oregon; Mr. Peter Koch, of Bozeman, Montana; Mr. Charles H. Conover, of Chicago; Mr. J. W. Cheney, librarian of the War Department, Mr. Robert Chapman, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, Mr. C. H. Lincoln, of the Manuscripts Division of the Library of Congress, and Major William Hancock Clark, of Washington, D. C.; Mr. C. H. Anderson, of Ivy Depot, Virginia; Hon. Nathaniel P. Langford, of St. Paul; and Mr. William Harvey Miner, of Cleveland. Emma Helen Blair, A.M., editorial assistant upon The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents and now one of the editors of The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898, assisted materially upon a majority of the annotations; further help in this direction, as well as in the difficult work of comparing transcriptions with the original manuscripts, has been rendered by Louise Phelps Kellogg, Ph.D., of the Manuscripts Division of the Wisconsin Historical Library. Finally, the Editor takes especial pleasure in acknowledging the patient and kindly cooperation of the Publishers, who have exhibited the deepest interest in every detail of the work, which owes much to their many suggestions and their generous determination to leave nothing undone that might add to its scholarly value and artistic embellishment.

      <field name="fulltext">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL DATA By VICTOR HUGO PALTSITS APART from a few insignificant references in the prefaces or introductions of some of the earlier editions of Lewis and Clark, the first attempt to record the publications related to the expedition of those explorers was made by Joseph Sabin in his Dictionary of Books relating to America, vol. vi, P. 443, under William Fisher; vol. vii, p. 181, under Patrick Gass; and vol. x, pp. 310–113, under Merriwether Lewis. Unfortunately Sabin read into his record several titles or editions that never existed, and in his descriptions committed a number of egregious errors, which have been only too freely copied and perpetuated by others. An incomplete list was given by Field in his Essay towards an Indian Bibliography (New York, 1873). The late Elliott Couse made the first comprehensive bibliographical study of these problematic books in his An Account of the various publications relating to the Travels of Lewis and Clarke (sic), printed in the "Bulletin of the Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories" (Hayden's), Second Series, No. 6, published by the Department of the Interior in 1876. A few copies thereof were also issued as separates. This material Coues "recast and improved" for his 1893 edition of the Lewis and Clark History; it appears in vol. i, pp. cvii–cxxxii. In many respects it is a worthy endeavor, especially if regarded as a pioneer effort; yet it must be admitted that it teems with errors, some of which are inexplicable. There are some brief bibliographical notes in Hubert Howe Bancroft's Northwest Coast, vol. ii. pp. 7, 8, 31, which present some inaccuracies. The same may be said of Justin Winsor's Narrative and Critical History of America, vol. vii, PP. 556–558. The latest attempt to cover the subject was made by William Harvey Miner, in The Literary Collector, vol. iii (1902), pp. 204–209. The form is poor; the collations are not nearly accurate, and numerous errors perpetuated from Coues and Sabin, as well as some omissions, detract from its usefulness as a bibliography. In order to serve its real purpose—namely, to afford the scholar, the librarian, and the collector media for determining what is a complete work—a monographic bibliography must give in minutest detail an analysis of each volume. Only by this method can imperfections and variations be determined. Starting out with this ideal in view, I have endeavored to find and examine one or more copies of every work related to the expedition. This task was great, but an insatiable appetite would not permit deviation from this plan. If the results attained prove at all of service, the compiler will consider himself rewarded for his arduous labor. The material is arranged in five chronological groups, namely: Jefferson's Message (1806–1808); Counterfeit Publications (1809–1851); Gass (1807–1904); Genuine History (1814–1904); Miscellanea (1804–1904). Only a few analytical references have been included, on account of their special importance, and magazine articles have intentionally been barred. The various editions of Jefferson's Writings and Works, edited by Washington and by Ford, are worth consulting for valuable materials. References to the official publications of the government of the United States, not included here, are given by another hand at the end of my bibliography.

This is the first Gass which has piates, as follows: Frontispiece, to p. 220, "A Canoe striking on a Tree"; opp. p. 26, "Captains Lewis &amp; Clark holding a Council with the Indians"; opp. p. 60, "Captain Clark &amp; his men building a line of Huts"; opp. p. 95, "Captain Clark and his men shooting Bears"; opp. p. 239, "An American having struck a Bear but not killed him, escapes into a Tree"; opp. p. 245, "Captain Lewis shooting an Indian." These cuts are very crude, artistically considered, and are insets. The subject-matter and location of the plates in Carey's three edition, 1810, 1811, 1812, are the same, but the plates as engraved differ in each edition. For example, the bear in the plate to page 239 of the 1810 edition looks like a Newfoundland dog; in the other editions he looks either like a pig or anything other than a bear. On the whole, the best illustrations are those of the 1812 edition, and this has a map of Louisiana not in the preceding editions. The three editions are typographically different.

This is a translation made from the French edition (Paris, 1810), and is so uncommon in the United States that Dr. Coues had never seen it, and was unable to identify it. I have not traced a copy in any of the many large libraries which I have consulted, and it was only after some difficulty that I succeeded in obtaining a copy from Germany which contains a later map. Subsequently, by good fortune, I procured a perfect copy with the correct map. This chart measures 7 1/2 by 9 1/4 inches, and is entitled: "Carte ? Pour Servir au Voyage ? des Capes. Lewis et Clarke, ? à l'Océan Pacifique." The similar map in the French edition was engraved by Tardieu, but no engraver's name is attached to the German copy. In my other copy of the book, this map is replaced by a much larger colored map, possibly designed for a reissue of the book, and is entitled: "Nord ? America ? entworfen u. gezeichnet ? von ? C. F. Weiland. ? Weimar ? im Verlage des Geograph. Instituts. ? 1839." It measures 12 1/2 by 14 1/4 inches, and was probably also included in Stieler's atlas of the period. There is a copy of the book in the British Museum. In Germany it is classed as "Selten" (rare). The German translator, Philipp Christoph Weyland, in his preface refers to Gass as "Sir Patrick Gass." Weyland was the translator of several works of travel. 1847 Lewis and Clarke's ? Journal ? to the ? Rocky Mountains ? In the years 1804, –5, –6; ? as related by ?

It is a curious fact that all of the editions which I have seen, even those of a late date, perpetuate an error in the stereotype plates, namely "unimportant" on the title-pages, which is given as "umimportant." By the kindness of Mr. A. V. S. Anthony, of Harper and Brothers, I have been able to test my record of subsequent editions by the books of the publishers. He also states that "several small editions have been published since 1891, of which no record was kept." The following is a conspectus of the issues of this oft-printed work, brought out originally in Harpers' popular "Family Library": — September, 1842; January, 1843; May, 1843; January, 1844; July, 1845; April, 1847; May, 1850; August, 1851; June, 1855; April, 1858; November, 1860; February, 1868; March, 1871 (vol. II); April, 1872 (vol. I); February, 1874 (vol. II); December, 1875 (vol. I); 1876 (copy in NYHS, but publishers have no record); February, 1881; March, 1882; July, 1883; April, 1886; February, 1887; June, 1891; June, 1901; several undated editions of late publication (one such in NYHS). Sabin in his Dictionary of Books relating to America mentions a London, 1842, edition of McVickar, but it is not in the British Museum. I have not been able to verify his statement, yet it is not unlikely that the American publishers may have made up some sets for the English market. 1893 History of the Expedition ? under the command of ?

No signatures. The edition consisted of one thousand copies, of which Nos. 1 to 200 were printed on handmade paper, and Nos. 201 to 1000 on fine book paper. Dr. Coues did not believe in strictly adhering to the text of the 1814 edition. "I have not found it necessary to make a fetich of that text", is his declaration. So in his other edited works he took liberties with originals; for example, in Larpenteur he tells us that "there was scarcely a sentence in it all that did not need to be recast to some extent in preparing the manuscript for publication. But this is a mere matter of grammar; I have simply helped the author to express himself; the sense and sentiment are his own, if the style is not." Of the Lewis and Clark he says, "I have punctiliously preserved the orthography of proper names in all their variance and eccentricity; and wherever I have amplified any statement in the text, or diverted the sense of a passage by a hair's breadth, square brackets indicate the fact. Yet I have not hesitated to touch the text here and there in a mere matter of grammar or punctuation. For the rest, I have prepared new titles and synopses of the chapters, and new headlines of the pages; one new chapter is interpolated, by digesting the Clatsop diary for that purpose. Excepting in these several respects, the present edition is literally true to the original. Nothing whatever is omitted."

This Frazer enlisted under Capt. Lewis, and his name was given to a rapid and a creek near the head-waters of the Missouri. Before Frazer's return to St. Louis, my uncle himself had removed thither and was managing the hotel to which Frazer came for entertainment. Each recognized the other, and my uncle had no difficulty in collecting his debt. But Frazer proved to be one of the seven journalists [of the Lewis and Clark expedition] and purposed to print his journal, he having, as well as Gass, obtained permission from Capt. Lewis. His prospectus, which of necessity was written, since there was no printing in St. Louis till 1808, shows beautiful chirography, and promised a volume of four hundred pages. A copy of it is in my hands, which came to my father in Vermont from his brother at the West.— James Davie Butler, in "The New Found Journal of Charles Floyd", Proceedings of American Antiquarian Soc., April 25th, 1894. Later, Professor Butler presented this MS. prospectus to the Wisconsin Historical Society, as above. Apparently there was insufficient patronage, for the proposed book was not published. The whereabouts of the Frazer Journal is unknown to the present Editor.—Ed. [From a MS. in the Library of the Wisconsin Historical Society.] Proposals for publishing by subscription Robert Frazer's Journal, from St. Louis in Louisiana to the Pacific ocean,—containing an accurate description of the Missouri and its several branches, of the mountains separating the eastern from the western waters, of the Columbia River and the Bay it forms on the Pacific ocean, of the face of the country in general; of the several tribes of Indians on the Missouri and Columbia rivers; of the vegetable, animal [and mineral] productions discovered in those extensive regions, the latitudes and longitudes of some of the most remarkable places,—together with a variety of curious and interesting occurrences during a voyage of 2 years 4 months and 9 days, conducted by Captains Lewis and Clark.

North America, shewing their rank, with some remarks on their respective merits and services", signed with Meriwether Lewis's name, and dated at "City of Washington, January 15, 1807." Copies: BPL; C; CHS; WD. 1808, etc. The Navigator, published in many editions at Pittsburgh, by Zadok Cramer, contains in an appendix to some of the editions a short account of the expedition of Lewis and Clark. This work is a composite, mostly devoted to "directions for navigating the Monongahela, Allegheny, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers", together with correlative matter. Its structure is crude. The first edition appeared in 1801. It was in its inception a small pamphlet, devoted solely to the Ohio. So far as I can ascertain, the Lewis and Clark appeared for the first time in the "Sixth Edition" of 1808, on pp. 146–156, based on Gass, etc. It is entitled, "A brief account of the Missouri river, and the extensive and fertile country through which it winds, as traversed by captain Lewis and captain Clark —A short notice of the Indians and their customs—different kinds of wild animals— fowls—fish—curiosities &amp;c. And of the Columbia river." In the "Advertisement" of "The Editor", this part purports to have been "collected from the letters of captain Clark and other publications since the return of the party". The "Seventh Edition" (1811) reproduced this text on pp. 254–268. Beginning with the "Eighth Edition" (1814), pp. 343– 349, the text is very different from that of the sixth and seventh editions. All of these subsequent editions have a mere summary headed, "Abridgment of Lewis and Clark's Expedition." I have seen the editions of 1802 (third), 1808 (sixth), 1811 (seventh), 1814 (eighth), 1817 (ninth), 1818 (tenth), and 1821 (eleventh); but there were others. 1830 Tales of Travels ? west of the Mississippi ?

DORSEY, Gillespie, Ill. where they formed their party, Composed of robust helthy hardy young men, recomended [Sentence unfinished.—Ed.].2 2 This unfinished memorandum is found on the fly-leaf at beginning of the small note-book designated by Elliott Coues—in his report upon the journals, made to the American Philosophical Society, Jan. 20, 1893, and reprinted in our Appendix, post —as "Codex A," from which book is here reproduced Clark's journal of the expedition from May 13 to August 14, 1804. Occasional entries, written by Lewis during that period, will be here designated by his name within brackets at the beginning of such matter. As stated in the Introduction to the present volume, there are two collections of original journals of the explorers—that made by Thomas Jefferson and now in the custody of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia; and that owned by Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis, of New York—granddaughter and great grand-daughter, respectively, of William Clark. In all references to the Philadelphia codices, we shall for convenience give Coues's lettered designations thereof (e.g., "Codex A"); the four Voorhis note-books will be designated by their Arabic numerals (e. g., "Clark-Voorhis note-book, No.1"). Other Clark manuscripts in the Voorhis collection will be specifically alluded to, as they appear in our volumes.—Ed. [The following memoranda of events in the history of the expedition prior to its departure from River Dubois, May 14, 1804, are selected from a record, mainly of natural phenomena, kept by Clark, which is written near the end of Codex C; this begins at p. 231, and continues (the pages being in reverse order) to p. 216, covering the time from Jan. 1, 1804 to April 7, 1805.

[DISCIPLINE AND ORGANIZATION] [The following "Detachment Orders" are in the Voorhis collection of Lewis and Clark manuscripts—see note 2, p. 3, ante. The documents show that the "robust helthy hardy young men," many of them fresh from the Kentucky woods, found it not easy to accustom themselves to the rigid discipline of a military corps; and illustrate the difficulties which beset the two captains during the first winter camp. The orders relating to the personnel of the expedition, with the organization of the messes, etc., are especially interesting and suggestive.—Ed.]2 2 The first two orders (Lewis) are on separate sheets of paper. The others are contained in a pocket note-book, which we designate as the "Orderly Book." This book (at first in Clark's hand, and then for the most part in that of Sergeant John Ordway, with a few entries by Lewis) covers the dates April 1-October 13, 1804. It is but a fragment; the remaining leaves are missing, save those containing an entry dated Fort Clatsop, January, 1, 1806. After the start of the expedition from River Dubois camp, we have incorporated into the text the several entries from this document, designating them as "[Orderly Book :]".—Ed. . [Lewis:] Detatchment Orders Camp River Dubois, Febr. 20th. 1804. The Commanding officer directs that During the absence of himself and Capt. Clark from Camp, that the party shall consider themselves under the immediate command of Sergt. Ordway, who will be held accountable for the good poliece and order of the camp during that period, and will also see the subsequent parts of this order carried into effect. The sawyers will continue their work untill they have cut the necessary quantity of plank, the quantity wanting will be determined by Pryor; during the days they labour they shall recieve each an extra gill of whiskey pr. day and be exempt from guard duty; when the work is accomplished, they will join the party and do duty in common with the other men. The Blacksmiths will also continue their work untill they have completed the articles contained in the memorandom with which I have furnished them, and during the time they are at work will recieve each an extra gill of whiskey pr. day and be exempt from guard duty; when the work is completed they will return to camp and do duty in common with the detatc[h]ment. The four men who are engaged in making sugar will continue in that employment untill further orders, and will recieve each a half a gill of extra whiskey pr. day and be exempt from guard duty. The practicing party will in futer discharge only one round each pr. day, which will be done under the direction of Sergt. Ordway, all at the same target and at the distance of fifty yards off hand. The prize of a gill of extra whiskey wil1 be recieved by the person who makes the best shot at each time of Practice. Floyd will take charge of our quarte[r]s and store and be exempt from guard duty untill our return, the commanding Officer hopes that this proof of his confidence will be justifyed by the rigid performance of the orders given him on that subject. No man shal absent himself from camp without the knowlege and permission of Sergt. Ordway, other than those who have obtained permission from me to be absent on hunting excurtions, and those will not extend their absence to a term by which they may avoid a tour of guard duty, on their return they will report themselves to Sergt. Ordway and receive his instructions. No whiskey shall in future be delivered from the Contractor's store except for the legal ration, and as appropriated by this order, unless otherwise directed by Capt. Clark or myself. Meriwether Lewis Capt. 1st U. S. Regt. Infty. Sergt. Ordway will have the men paraded this evening and read the inclosed orders to them. M. Lewis [Indorsed:] to Floyd [Lewis:] Detatchment Orders March 3rd. 1804. The Commanding officer feels himself mortifyed and disappointed at the disorderly conduct of Reubin Fields, in refusing to mount guard when in the due roteen of duty he was regularly warned; nor is he less surprised at the want of discretion in those who urged his oposition to the faithfull discharge of his duty, particularly Shields, whose sense of propryety he had every reason to believe would have induced him reather to have promoted good order, than to have excited disorder and faction among the party, particularly in the absence of Capt. Clark and himself: The Commanding officer is also sorry to find any man, who has been engaged by himself and Capt. Clark for the expedition on which they have entered, so destitute of understanding, as not to be able to draw the distinction between being placed under the command of another officer, whose will in such case would be their law, and that of obeying the orders of Capt. Clark and himself communicated to them through Sergt. Ordway, who, as one of the party, has during their necessary absence been charged with the execution of their orders; acting from those orders expressly, and not from his own caprice, and who, is in all respects accountable to us for the faithfull observance of the same. A moments reflection must convince every man of our party, that were we to neglect the more important and necessarry arrangements in relation to the voyage we are now entering on, for the purpose merely of remain[in]g at camp in order to communicate our orders in person to the individuals of the party on mear points of poliece, they would have too much reason to complain; nay, even to fear the ultimate success of the enterprise in which we are all embarked. The abuse of some of the party with respect [to the] prevelege heretofore granted them of going into the country, is not less displeasing; to such as have made hunting or other business a pretext to cover their design of visiting a neighbouring whiskey shop, he cannot for the present extend this previlege; and dose therefore most positively direct, that Colter, Bolye, Wiser, and Robinson do not recieve permission to leave camp under any pretext whatever for ten days, after this order is read on the parade, unless otherwise directed hereafter by Capt. Clark or himself. The commanding officers highly approve of the conduct of Sergt. Ordway. The Carpenters Blacksmiths, and in short the whole party (except Floid who has been specially directed to perform other duties) are to obey implicitly the orders of Sergt. Ordway, who has recieved our instructions on these subjects, and is held accountable to us for their due execution. Meriwether Lewis. Capt. 1st. U. S. Regt. Infty Comdg Detatchment [Indorsed:] Sergt.

In 1893, Elliott Coues also made emendations in the Philadelphia codices; and there are some erasures and interlineations by an unknown hand. In seeking to reproduce the manuscripts with fidelity, the present Editor has deemed it desirable to retain all emendations made by contemporaries, although he has ignored many made by Coues, who often sought to correct and modernize the spelling of proper names. Words reproduced by us in ltalics enclosed by parentheses, are corrections in red ink, presumably by Biddle—e.g. (Moses B. Read); those set in Italics enclosed by brackets, are in black ink and by several persons—Clark, Coues, or an unknown hand—e. g. [Petite côte]; words in Italics, unenclosed, were underlined by the author himself; the present Editor's signed or unsigned emendations are in Roman, bracketed—e. g. [Lewis); plain parentheses (enclosing matter in Roman type) are as in the text.—Ed. who whilst they remain with the Detachment shall be incorperated with the second, and third squads of the same, and are to be treated in all respects as those men who form the Permonant detachment except with reguard to an advance of Pay, and the distrebutions of Arms and Accoutrements intended for the expedition. The following persons (viz Charles Floyd, John Ordway, and Nathaniel Pryor are this day appointed Sergeants, with equal Powers (unless when otherwise specially ordered). The authority, Pay, and emouliments, attached to the Said rank of Sergeants in the Military Service of the United States, and to hold the Said appointments, and be respected Accordingly, dureing their good behaviour or the Will and pleasure of the sd. Commanding officers.1 1 The above spelling is somewhat erratic. Following is the now generally accepted list of members of the expedition, as verified by the official pay-roll at the close of the venture: Meriwether Lewis, Captain in 1st Reg. U. S. Infantry, commanding; William Clark, and Lieutenant in U. S. Artillery; sergeants—John Ordway, Nathaniel Pryor, Charles Floyd, Patrick Gass; and privates—William Bratton, John Colter, John Collins, Peter Cruzatte, Reuben Fields, Joseph Fields, Robert Frazier, George Gibson, Silas Goodrich, Hugh Hall, Thomas P. Howard, Francis Labiche, Hugh McNeal, John Potts, George Shannon, John Shields, John B. Thompson, William Werner, Joseph Whitehouse, Alexander Willard, Richard Windsor, Peter Wiser. Besides these men, the party included two interpreters, George Drewyer (or Drouillard) and Toussaint Charbonneau; an Indian woman, Sacajawea ("Bird-woman"). Charbonneau's wife; and a negro slave of Captain Clark's, named York. Two soldiers, John Newman and M. B. Reed, who had set out with the expedition, were punished for misconduct, and sent back to St. Louis on April 7, 1805. Baptiste Lepage was enlisted in Newman's place, at Fort Mandan, Nov. 2, 1804, and remained with the expedition until the discharge of its men at St. Louis, Nov. 10, 1806. Fort more detailed information regarding them, see Coues's Lewis and Clark, i, pp. 253–259.—Ed. To insure order among the party, as well as to promote a regular Police in Camp, The Commanding Officers have thought proper to devide the detachment into three Squads and to place a Sergeant in Command of each, who are held imediately responsible to the Commanding officers, for the regular and orderly deportment of the individuls Composeing their respective Squads. The following individuals after being duly balloted for, have fallen in the several Squads as hereafter stated, and are Accordingly placed under the derection of the Sergeants whose names preceeds those of his squad.

Mr. Choteau[,] Grattiot, Deloney, Laberdee, Rankin. Dr. Sodrang1 1 Louisiana (retroceded by Spain to France in 1800) was sold by Napoleon Bonaparte (April 30, 1803) to the United States; and Captain Amos Stoddard was the commissioner appointed by Jefferson to receive the upper portion of the territory from the Spanish authorities. France never having taken actual possession of Louisiana, the transfer frorn Spain to France took place at St. Louis, March 9, 1804, Lewis being chief official witness; the transfer from France to the United States occurred the following day; and Stoddard became military governor of Upper Louisiana, pending its reorganization by Congress, which took effect on October 1 of that year. One of his officers was Lieutenant Worrall (the name spelled Worriss by Clark); another was named Milford (Minford, in Clark). Pierre and Auguste Chouteau were among the earliest settlers of St. Louis, and the Chouteau family has always been prominent in its annals; Pierre was the son of its founder, Pierre Laclede. Their sister Victoire was the wife of Charles Gratiot, who was engaged in the Indian trade in the Illinois country from 1774, settling at St. Louis, in 1781; upon the organization of the District of Louisiana (1804), Gratiot was appointed the first presiding justice of the new Court of Quarter Sessions at St. Louis. afterward filling various public offices. Another sister, Pelagie Chouteau, married Sylvester Labbadie (misspelled Laberdee by Clark). David Delaunay was an associate justice in the above-mentioned court. James Rankin was another early settler of St. Louis. Dr. Antoine François Saugrain (the "Sodrang" of Clark) was a French chemist and mineralogist, who had made several voyages to America, for scientific purposes, from 1784 to 1788. In 1790, he was one of the French colonists who settled at Gallipolis, O., and finally located with his family at St. Louis, where he practised medicine until his death in 1820. See W. V. Byars's Memoir of Saugrain's life (St. Louis, 1903). For detailed accounts of these and other early settlers of St. Louis, see Scharf's Saint Louis, pp. 167–202; and Billon's Annals of St. Louis, pp. 389–492.—Ed. rained the greater part of this evening, .Suped with Mr. Charles Tayon, the late Comdr. of Sr. Charles a Spanish Ensign. [Lewis:] Sunday May 20th 1804. The morning was fair, and the weather pleasent; at 10 OCk. A M. agreably to an appointment of the preceeding day, I was joined by Capt Stoddard, Lieuts Mi1ford &amp; Worrell together with Messrs. A. Chouteau, C. Gratiot, and many other rispectable inhabitants of St. Louis, who had engaged to accompany me to the Vilage of St. Charles; accordingly at 12 OCk., after bidding an affectionate adieu to my Hostis, that excellent woman the spouse of Mr. Peter Chouteau, and some of my fair friends of St. Louis, we set forward to that vilage in order to join my friend companion and fellow labourer Capt. William Clark, who had previously arrived at the place with the party destined for the discovery of the interior of the continent of North America the first 5 miles of our rout laid through a beatifull high leavel and fertile prarie which incircles the town of St. Louis from N. W. to S. E. the lands through which we then passed are somewhat broken less fertile the plains and woodlands are here indiscriminately interspersed untill you arrive within three miles of the vilage when the woodland commences and continues to the Missouri the latter is extreemly fertile. At half after one P. M. our progress was interrupted by the near approach of a violent thunder-storm from the N. W. and concluded to take shelter in a little cabbin hard by untill the rain should be over; accordingly we alighted and remained about an hour and a half and regailed ourselves with a could collation which we had taken the precaution to bring with us from St. Louis. The clouds continued to follow each other in rapaid succession, insomuch that there was but little prospect of it's ceasing to rain this evening; as I had determined to reach St. Charles this evening and knowing that there was now no time to be lost I set forward in the rain, most of the gentlemen continued with me, we arrived at half after six and joined Capt Clark, found the party in good health and sperits. Suped this evening with Monsr. Charles Tayong a Spanish Ensign &amp; late Commandant of St. Charles at an early hour I retired to rest on board the barge. St. Charles is situated on the North bank of the Missouri 21 miles above it's junction with the Mississippi, and about the same distance N. W. from St. Louis; it is bisected by one principal street about a mile in length runing nearly parallel with the river, the plain on which it stands is narrow tho' sufficiently elivated to secure it against the annual inundations of the river, which usually happen in the month of June, and in the rear it is terminated by a range of small hills, hence the appellation of petit Cote, a name by which this vilage is better known to the French inhabitants of the Illinois than that of St. Charles. The Vilage contains a Chappel, one hundred dwelling houses, and about 450 inhabitants; their houses are generally small and but illy constructed; a great majority of the inhabitants are miserably pour illiterate and when at home excessively lazy, tho' they are polite hospitable and by no means deficient in point of natural genious, they live in a perfect state of harmony among each other, and plase as implicit confidence in the doctrines of their speritual pastor, the Roman Catholic priest, as they yeald passive obedience to the will of their temporal master the commandant. a small garden of vegetables is the usual extent of their cultivation, and this is commonly imposed on the old-men and boys; the men in the vigor of life consider the cultivation of the earth a degrading occupation, and in order to gain the necessary subsistence for themselves and families, either undertake hunting voyages on their own account, or engage themselves as hirelings to such persons as possess sufficient capital to extend their traffic to the natives of the interior parts of the country; on those voyages in either case, they are frequently absent from their families or homes the term of six twelve or eighteen months and alwas subjected to severe and incessant labour, exposed to the ferosity of the lawless savages, the vicissitudes of weather and climate, and dependant on chance or accident alone for food, raiment or relief in the event of malady. These people are principally the decendants of the Canadian French, and it is not an inconsiderable proportion of them that can boast a small dash of the pure blood of the aboriginies of America. On consulting with my friend Capt C. I found it necessary that we should pospone our departure untill 2 P. M. the next day and accordingly gave orders to the party to hold themselves in readiness to depart at that hour. Capt. Clark now informed me that having gotten all the stores on board the Barge and perogues on the evening of the 13th. of May he determined to leave our winter cantoonment at the mouth of River Dubois the next day, and to ascend the Missouri as far as the Vilage of St. Charles, where, as it had been previously concerted between us, he was to wait my arrival; this movement while it advanced us a small distance on our rout, would also enable him to determine whether the vessels had been judiciously loaded and if not timely to make the necessary alterations; accordingly [at 4 P. M. on Monday the 14th. of May 1804, he embarked with the party in the presence of a number of the neighbouring Citizens who had assembled to witness his departure. During the fore part of this Day it rained excessively hard. In my last letter to the President dated at St. Louis I mentioned the departure of Capt. Clark from River Dubois] on the 15th. Inst, which was the day that had been calculated on, but having completed the arrangements a day earlyer he departed on the 14th. as before mentioned. On the evening of the 14th. the party halted and encamped on the upper point of the first Island which lyes near the Larbord shore, on the same side and nearly opposite the center of this Island a small Creek disimbogues called Couldwater.

Wide &amp; the other is 70 yds. wd. and heads Close to the R. Dumons [des Moines] The Aieways [Ayauway] Nation have a Village on the head of these Rivers.1 1 The name Charleton now appears on maps as Chariton. The etymology of Des Moines is suggested in the form used by Clark, "Dumons" This river was formerly named (from the tribe dwelling on its shores) Rivière des Moihgonans—a name soon abbreviated to Moins, and that to River Des Moins (with many variants, of which Clark's is one). Aieway and Ayauway are among the many variants of the name of a Siouan tribe, now known as the Iowa, from whom a State and river are named. Biddle says that the Iowas numbered 300 men.—Ed. they run through an even Countrey [a broken rich thickly timbered country] and is navagable for Perogues Cap Lewis took Medn. altd. of ? U.

S. a heavy rain came on &amp; lasted a Short time, we came to on the S. S. in a Prarie at the place where Mr. Mackey lais down a old french fort,1 1 Lewis's map of 1806 indicates "Mr. J. Mackay's route," which embraces most of the valley of the Niobrara River; this Mackay may be the person referred to in the text. Biddle's narrative mentions (i, p. 44) a man of this name who had in 1795–96 a trading establishment farther up the Missouri. The French fort was probably the post (Fort Orleans) established by Bourgmont (1723) not far (according to Coues) from the Malta Bend of the Missouri (see Margry's Découvertes et établissements, vi, p. 393; Le Page du Pratz's Louisiane, i, p. 324; and Coues's L. and C., i, p. 24, note 51). The exact site of Fort Orleans is not definitely known, and there are diverse opinions regarding it. Hon. Walter B. Douglas, of St. Louis, thinks that the fort was on "the north bank of the Missouri, above the mouth of Wakenda Creek, in what is now Carroll County, and 15 to 20 miles above the town of Brunswick, which stands a little below the place where was the old mouth of Grand River (about six or seven miles from its present entrance). The action of the river-current has caused great changes in the course of both rivers, even within the last thirty years." Later there was another French post upon the river at a village of the Kansas Indians, not far from the present site of Fort Leavenworth.—Ed. I could See no traces of a Settlement of any kind, in the plain I discovered a kind of Grass resembling Timothey which appeared well Calculated for Hay. this Plain is verry extensive in the evening I walked on the S.

The men Sent to the Mahar Town last evining has not returned we Conclude to send a Spye to Know the Cause of their delay, at about 12 oClock the Party returned and informd. us that they Could not find the Indians, nor any fresh Sign, those people have not returned from their Buffalow hunt. Those people haveing no houses no Corn or anything more than the graves of their ansesters to attach them to the old Village, Continue in purseute of the Buffalow longer than others who has greater attachments to their native village. The ravages of the Small Pox (which Swept off [about 4 years ago] 400 men &amp; Womin &amp; children in perpopotion) has reduced this nation not exceeding 300 men and left them to the insults of their weaker neighbours, which before was glad to be on friendly turms with them. I am told when this fatal malady was among them they Carried their franzey to verry extroadinary length, not only of burning their Village, but they put their wives &amp; children to Death with a view of their all going together to some better Countrey. they burry their Dead on the top of high hills and rais Mounds on the top of them. The cause or way those people took the Small Pox is uncertain, the most Probable, from Some other nation by means of a warparty. August 15th, Wednesday, 1804.1 1 With this entry Codex B commences, continuing until Oct. 3, 1804.—Ed. Camp three Miles N. E. of the Mahar Village I went with ten men to a Creek Damed by the Beavers about half way to the Village, with Some small Willows &amp; Bark we made a Drag and hauled up the Creek, and Cought 318 fish of different kind i.e. Pike, Bass, Salmon, perch, red horse, small cat, and a kind of perch Called Silver fish, on the Ohio.

Lewis Sent Mr. Durione the Souix interpeter &amp; three men to examine a fire which threw up an emence Smoke from the Praries on the NE. Side of the River and at no great distance from Camp. the Object of this party was to find Some Bands of Seouex which the intptr. thought was near the Smoke and get them to come in. in the evening this Party returned and informed, that the fire arose from Some trees which had been left burning by a small party of Seoux, who had passed [by that place] Several Days. the wind Setting from that point, blew the Smoke from that pt. over our Camp. our party all in health and Sperrits. The men Sent to the Ottoes &amp; in pursute of the Deserter Reed has not yet returned or joined our party. 16th August Thursday 1804. Fishing Camp 3 Ms. N.

B. Reed and the 3 principal Chiefs of the Nations. La Liberty they cought but he decived them and got away. the object of those Chiefs comeing forward is to make a peace with the Mahars thro: us. as the Mahars are not at home this great Object cannot be accomplished at this time. Set the Praries on fire to bring the Mahars &amp; Soues if any were near, this being the useal Signal. a cool evening two Beaver cought to day. 18th August, Sat'day 1804.— a fine morning. Wind from the S.

The 3 Chiefs and all the men or warriors made short Speeches approving the advice &amp; Council their great father had Sent them, and concluded by giving themselves some Credit for their acts. We then brought out the presents and exchanged the Big horses Meadel and gave him one equal to the one Sent to the Little Thief &amp; gave all Some Small articles &amp; 8 Carrots of Tobacco, we gave one Small Meadel to one of the Chiefs and a Sertificate to the others of their good intentions.

He was buried at a spot which is now in the southern part of Sioux City, Ia. The inroads of the Missouri River having partly washed away Floyd's grave, his remains were reburied (May 28, 1857) in a safer place, some 200 yards back of the original grave; and on Aug. 20, 1895, the spot was marked with a slab. A monumental shaft to his memory was erected May 30, 1901. See Reports of Floyd Memorial Association (Sioux City, 1897, 1901).—Ed. .

Capt. Lewis in proveing the quality of those minerals was Near poisoning himself by the fumes &amp; tast of the Cobalt which had the appearance of Soft Isonglass. Copperas &amp; alum is verry pisen,1 1 Biddle here says (i, p. 50): "The appearance of these mineral substances enabled us to account for disorders of the stomach with which the party had been affected since they left the river Sioux;" the men had used the water of the Missouri, on which floated a scum proceeding from these rocks. By dipping from below, and avoiding this scum, they obtained pure water, and their maladies soon ceased.—Ed. Above this Bluff a Small Creek coms in from the L.

Those Bluffs appear to have been laterly on fire, and at this time is too hot for a man to bear his hand in the earth at any Debth1 1 The heated bluffs here mentioned are ascribed by Coues (L. and C. i, p. 84) to volcanic action; they were called by the French voyageurs côtes brulées, or "burnt bluffs." Brackenridge, who was at this place in 1811, ascribes this phenomenon to the burning of coal (Louisiana, pp. 232, 233).— Ed. At Ionia, Dixon County, is found the Nebraska "volcano" or "burning hill." Though declining in activity, this hill was once an object of considerable interest, especially after freshets in the Missouri River. Though not visited personally, the smoking or steaming seems to be due to the decomposition of pyrite in the damp shales. It seems that sufficient chemical heat is produced to make the hill-top steam and even to fuse some of the sand and clay. It bears no relation whatever to a volcano.—Erwin H. Barbour, geologist of University of Nebraska. , Great appearance of Coal, an emence quantity of Cobalt or a Cristolised Substance which answers its description is on the face of the Bluff.

Lewis &amp; Myself concluded to go and See the Mound which was Viewed with Such turror by all the different Nations in this quarter, we Selected Shields; J. Fields, W. Bratten, Sergt. Ordway, J. Coller, Carr, and Corpl. Worbington &amp; Frasure, also G. Drewyer and droped down to the Mouth of White Stone River, where we left the Perogue with two men and at 200 yards we assended a riseing ground of about Sixty feet, from the top of this High land the Countrey is leavel &amp; open as far as can be Seen, except Some few rises at a great Distance, and the Mound which the Indians Call Mountain of little people or Spirits, this Mound appears of a conic form &amp; is N. 20°. W. from the mouth of the Creek,1 1 Known locally, and named on some maps, as Spirit Mound. For description of its more recent appearance, see Amer. Antiquarian, Sept. 1891, p. 289.—Ed. we left the river at 8 oClock, at 4 miles we Crossed the Creek 23 yards wide in an extensive Valley and Contin[u]ed on at two miles further our Dog was so Heeted and fatigued we was obliged [to] Send him back to the Creek, at 12 oClock we arrived at the hill Capt. Lewis much fatigued from heat the day it being verry hot &amp; he being in a debilitated State from the Precautions he was obliged to take to prevent the effects of the Cobalt, &amp; Min1 Substance which had like to have poisoned him two days ago, his want of water, and Several of the men complaining of Great thirst, determined us to make for the first water which was the Creek in a bend N. E. from the Mound, about 3 miles. after a Delay of about 1 hour &amp; a half to recrut our party we set out on our return down the Creek thro: the bottom of about 1 mile in width, crossed the creek 3 times to the place we first struck it, where we gathered some delisious froot such as Grapes, Plumbs, &amp; Blue Currents after a Delay of an hour we set out on our back trail &amp; arrived at the Perogue at Sun set. We proceeded on to the Place we Campd last night and Stayed all night. This Mound is Situated on an elivated plain in a leavel and extensive prarie, bearing N. 20° W. from the Mouth of White Stone Creek nine miles, the base of the Mound is a regular parallelagram the long Side of which is about 300 yards in length the Shorter 60 or 70 yards. from the longer Side of the Base it rises from the North &amp; South with a Steep assent to the hight of 65 or 70 feet, leaveing a leavel Plain on the top of 12 feet in width &amp; 90 in length. The North &amp; South part of this Mound is join[ed] by two regular rises, each in Oval forms of half its hight, forming three regular rises from the Plain the assent of each elivated part is as Suden as the principal mound at the narrower sides of its Base. The reagular form of this hill would in Some measure justify a belief that it owed its orrigin to the hand of man; but as the earth and loos pebbles and other substances of which it was Composed, bore an exact resemblance to the Steep Ground which border on the Creek in its neighbourhood we concluded it was most probably the production of nature. The only remarkable Charactoristic of this hill admiting it to be a natural production is that it is insulated or Seperated a considerable distance from any other, which is verry unusial in the natural order or disposition of the hills. The Surrounding Plains is open Void of Timber and leavel to a great extent, hence the wind from whatever quarter it may blow, drives with unusial force over the naked Plains and against this hill; the insects of various kinds are thus involuntaryly driven to the Mound by the force of the wind, or fly to its Leeward Side for Shelter; the Small Birds whoes food they are, Consequently resort in great numbers to this place in Surch of them; Perticularly the Small brown Martin of which we saw a vast number hovering on the Leward Side of the hill, when we approached it in the act of catching those insects; they were so gentle that they did not quit the place untill we had arrivd within a fiew feet of them. One evidence which the Inds- give for believeing this place to be the residence of Some unusial Sperits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds about this Mound [this] is in my opinion a Sufficent proof to produce in the Savage Mind a Confident belief of all the properties which they ascribe [to] it. from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions; the Plain to North N. W. &amp; N. E. extends without interuption as far as Can be seen. From the Mound to the Mouth of Stone River is S. 20° E. 9 Miles. to the woods near the mouth of River Jacque is West. to the Highland near the mouth of Soues River is S. 70°. E. to the highland opposit side or near the Maha Town is S. 45 E. Some high lands to be seen from the Mound at a Great distance to the N. E. some nearer to the N. W. No woods except on the Missourie Points. if all the timber which is on the Stone Creek was on 100 acres it would not be thickly timbered, the Soil of those Plains are delightfull. Great numbers of Birds are seen in those Plains, Such as black bird, ren, [wren] or Prarie burd, a kind of larke about the sise of a Partridge with a Short tail, &amp;c., &amp;c., 25th Augt— the Boat under the Comd of Serjt.

The commanding officers have thought proper to appoint Patric Gass, a Sergeant in the corps of volunteers for North Western Discovery; he is therefore to be obeyed and respected accordingly. Sergt. Gass is directed to take charge of the late Sergt. Floyd's mess, and immediately to enter on the discharge of such other duties, as have by their previous orders been prescribed for the government of the Sergeants of this corps. The Commanding officers have every reason to hope from the previous faithfull services of Sergt. Gass, that this expression of their approbation will be still further confirmed by his vigilent attention in future to his duties as a Sergeant. the Commanding officers are still further confirmed in the high opinion they had previously formed of the capacity, deligence and integrety of Sergt. Gass, from the wish expressed by a large majority of his comrades for his appointment as Sergeant. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st U. S. Regt. Infty. Wm″ Clark Cpt. &amp;c.

I will here remark a SOCIETY1 1 The "society" of warriors here described was one of the branches of "the military and social organization which existed among the Blackfeet, Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, and probably all the prairie tribes except the Comanche in the South," according to Mooney (U. S. Bur. Ethnol. Rep., 1892–93, pp. 986–989), who describes it as it existed among the Arapaho. —Ed. which I had never before this day heard was in any nation of Indians, four of which is at this time present and all who remain of this Band. Those who become Members of this Society must be brave active young men who take a Vow never to give back let the danger be what it may, in War Parties they always go forward without screening themselves behind trees or anything else to this Vow they Strictly adhier dureing their Lives. an instance which happened not long sence, on a party in Crossing the R Missourie on the ice, a whole was in the ice imediately in their Course which might easily have been avoided by going around, the foremost man went on and was lost the others wer draged around by the party. in a battle with the Crow2 2 The Crows are a Hidatsa tribe, allied to the Minitaree, and originally located on the Yellowstone River; in later years, they have been gathered on the Crow reservation in Montana.—Ed.

Chief rose and made a short speech Ar ea we char che (the half man) 3rd. Chief rose &amp; Spoke at some length much to the [same] purpose.1 1 The names of these chiefs are thus given by Biddle: Weucha ("Shake Hand;" called by the French Le Libeateur); Mahtoree ("White Crane"); Pawnawneahpahbe ("Struck by the Pawnee"); and Aweawechache ("Half Man")—explained as probably originating in its owner's modesty, "who on being told of his exploits, would say, 'I am no warrior: I am only half a man.'" These speeches are given by Biddle in more detail.—Ed. The other Cheif said but little One of the Warriers Spoke after all was don &amp; promissed to Support the Cheifs, the[y] promisd to go and See their Great father in the Spring with Mr. Dorion, and to do all things we had advised them to do. and all concluded by telling the distresses of their nation by not haveing traders, &amp; wished us to take pity on them, the[y] wanted Powder Ball, &amp; a little Milk [rum; milk of great father means spirits.] last night the Indians Danced untill late in their Dances we gave them [throw into them as is usual] Som Knives Tobacco &amp; bells &amp; tape &amp; Binding with which they wer Satisfied.2 2 The entry for Aug. 31 to this point is misplaced in the MS.; it is found on pp. 58–60 of Codex A, preceded by this memorandum: "omited to put in the 31st of August in Place."—Ed.

Clark and myself kiled each a buck immediately on landing near our encampment; the deer were very gentle and in great numbers in this bottom which had more timber on it than any part of the river we had seen for many days past, consisting of Cottonwood Elm, some indifferent Ash and a considerable quan[ti]ty of a small species of white oak which [was]3 3 These two words in brackets are conjectural readings, the MS. being torn where they occur. —Ed. loaded with acorns of an excellent flavor [having]3 very little of the bitter roughness of the nuts of most species of oak, the leaf of this oak is small pale green and deeply indented, (not copied for Dr. Barton) it seldom rises higher than thirty feet is much branched, the bark is rough and thick and of a light colour; the cup which contains the acorn is fringed on it's edges and imbraces the nut about one half; the acorns were now falling, and we concluded that the number of deer which we saw here had been induced thither by the acorns of which they are remarkably fond. almost every species of wild game is fond of the acorn, the Buffaloe Elk, Deer, bear, turkies, ducks, pigians and even the wolves feed on them; we sent three hunters out who soon added eight deer and two Buffalo to our strock of provisions; the Buffaloe were so pour that we took only the tongues skins and marrow bones; the skins were particularly acceptable as we were in want of a covering for the large perogue to secure the baggage; the clouds during this day and night prevented my making any observations. Sergt. Gass and Reubin Fields whom we had sent out yesterday to explore the White river returnd at four oclock this day and reported that they had followed the meanders of that stream about 12 miles it's general course [is] West, the present or principal channel 150 yards wide; the coulour of the water and rapidity and manner of runing resembled the Missouri precisely; the country broken on the border of the river about a mile, when the level planes commence and extend as far as the eye can reach on either side; as usual no timber appeared except such as from the steep declivities of hills, or their moist situations, were sheltered from the effects of the fire. these extensive planes had been lately birnt and the grass had sprung up and was about three inches high. vast herds of Buffaloe deer Elk and Antilopes were seen feeding in every direction as far as the eye of the observer could reach.

[Lewis:] Monday September 17th. 1804. Having for many days past confined myself to the boat, I determined to devote this day to amuse myself on shore with my gun and view the interior of the country lying between the river and the Corvus Creek, accordingly before sunrise I set out with six of my best hunters, two of whom I dispatched to the lower side of Corvus creek, two with orders to hunt the bottums and woodland on the river, while I retained two others to acompany me in the intermediate country. one quarter of a mile in rear of our camp which was situated in a fine open grove of cotton wood passed a grove of plumb trees loaded with fruit and now ripe, observed but little difference betwen this fruit and that of a similar kind common to the Atlantic States. the trees are smaller and more thickly set. this forrest of plumb trees garnish a plain about 20 feet more elivated than that on which we were encamped; this plain extends back about a mile to the foot of the hills one mile distant and to which it is gradually ascending this plane extends with the same bredth from the creek below to the distance of near three miles above parrallel with the river, and it is intirely occupyed by the burrows of the barking squiril hertefore described; this anamal appears here in infinite numbers and the shortness and virdu[r]e of grass gave the plain the appearance throughout it's whole extent of beatifull bowling-green in fine order. it's aspect is S. E. a great number of wolves of the small kind, halks [hawks—Ed.] and some pole-cats were to be seen. I presume that those anamals feed on this squirril. found the country in every direction for about three miles intersected with deep revenes and steep irregular hills of 100 to 200 feet high; at the tops of these hills the country breakes of[f] as usual into a fine leavel plain extending as far as the eye can reach. from this plane I had an extensive view of the river below, and the irregular hills which border the opposite sides of the river and creek. the surrounding country had been birnt about a month before and young grass had now sprung up to hight of 4 Inches presenting the live green of the spring to the West a high range of hills, strech across the country from N. to S. and appeared distant about 20 miles; they are not very extensive as I could plainly observe their rise and termination no rock appeared on them and the sides were covered with virdu[r]e similar to that of the plains this senery already rich pleasing and beatiful was still farther hightened by immence herds of Buffaloe, deer Elk and Antelopes which we saw in every direction feeding on the hills and plains. I do not think I exagerate when I estimate the number of Buffaloe which could be compre[hend]ed at one view to amount to 3000. my object was if possible to kill a female Antelope having already procured a male; I pursued my rout on this plain to the west flanked by my two hunters untill eight in the morning when I made the signal for them to come to me which they did shortly after. we rested our selves about half an hour, and regailed ourselves on half a bisquit each and some jirks of Elk which we had taken the precaution to put in our pouches in the morning before we set out, and drank of the water of a small pool which had collected on this plain from the rains which had fallen some days before. we had now after various windings in pursuit of several herds of antelopes which we had seen on our way made the distance of about eight miles from our camp. we found the Antelope extreemly shye and watchfull insomuch that we had been unable to get a shot at them; when at rest they generally seelect the most elivated point in the neighbourhood, and as they are watchfull and extreemly quick of sight and their sense of smelling very accute it is almost impossible to approach them within gunshot; in short they will frequently discover and flee from you at the distance of three miles. I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility and the superior fleetness of this anamal which was to me really astonishing. I had pursued and twice surprised a small herd of seven, in the first instance they did not discover me distinctly and therefore did not run at full speed, tho' they took care before they rested to gain an elivated point where it was impossible to approach them under cover, except in one direction and that happened to be in the direction from which the wind blew towards them; bad as the chance to approch them was, I made the best of my way towards them, freqeuntly peeping over the ridge with which I took care to conceal myself from their view the male, of which there was but one, frequently incircled the summit of the hill on which the females stood in a group, as if to look out for the approach of danger. I got within about 200 paces of them when they smelt me and fled; I gained the top of the eminence on which they stood, as soon as possible from whence I had an extensive view of the country the antilopes which had disappeared in a steep reveene now appeared at the distance of about three miles on the side of a ridge which passed obliquely across me and extended about four miles, so soon had these antelopes gained the distance at which they had again appeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the same that I had just surprised, but my doubts soon vanished when I beheld the rapidity of their flight along the ridge before me it appeared reather the rappid flight of birds than the motion of quadrupeds. I think I can safely venture the asscertion that the speed of this anamal is equal if not superior to that of the finest blooded courser. this morning I saw1 1 The sentence remains unfinished.

Chief was verry insolent both in words &amp; justures (pretended Drunkenness &amp; staggered up against me) declareing I should not go on, Stateing he had not receved presents sufficent from us, his justures were of Such a personal nature I felt My self Compeled to Draw my Sword (and Made a Signal to the boat to prepare for action) at this Motion Capt. Lewis ordered all under arms in the boat, those with me also Showed a Disposition to Defend themselves and me, the grand Chief then took hold of the roap &amp; ordered the young Warrers away, I felt My Self warm &amp; Spoke in verry positive terms.

[Interpreters] to the boat, the perogue Soon returned with about 12 of our determined men ready for any event. this movement caused a no: of the Indians to withdraw at a distance, (leaving their chiefs &amp; soldiers alone with me). Their treatment to me was verry rough &amp; I think justified roughness on my part, they all lift my Perogue, and Councild. with themselves the result I could not lern and nearly all went off after remaining in this Situation Some time I offered my hand to the 1. &amp; 2.

Cheif at their head, about 200 men appeared and after about 1/2 hour returned all but about 60 men who continued on the bank all night, the Cheifs Contd. all night with us. This allarm I as well as Capt. Lewis Considered as the Signal of their intentions (which was to Stop our proceeding on our journey and if Possible rob us) we were on our Guard all night, the misfortune of the loss of our Anchor obliged us to Lay under a falling bank much exposd. to the accomplishment of their hostile intentions. P. C. our Bowman who cd.

Powell thinks that these savages, having early separated from their kindred at the North, forced their way through hostile tribes, across the Missouri, into the Black Hills country—thus locating between the Siouan and the Shoshonean tribes.

In a rare pamphlet entitled Adventures of Zenas Leonard (Clearfield, Pa., 1839) —for information regarding which see Chittenden's Amer. Fur Trade, i, p. 397— is an account of a negro residing (1832–34) in the Crow village at the junction of Bighorn and Stinking rivers, who apparently was Clark's servant York. He told Leonard that he first went to that country with Lewis and Clark, with whom he returned to Missouri; that he afterward accompanied a trader up the Missouri, and had remained with the Indians ever since (about ten or twelve years). He had, when Leonard saw him, four Indian wives, and possessed much reputation and influence among the Crows, from whom he secured the return of some horses which they had stolen from Leonard's party.—Walter B.

The Nation of the Rickerries (Rickaras) is about 600 men (Mr. Taboe says, I think 500 men) (Mr. Tabat is right) able to bear arms a Great perpotion of them have fusees they appear to be peacefull, their men tall and perpotiend,2 2 Gass says of the Arikara (pp. 73, 74) that "they are the best-looking, most cleanly, most friendly and industrious Indians I have ever seen on the voyage."—Ed. womin Small and industerous, raise great quantities of Corn Beens Simnins3 3 A form of "Simlin" or "simnel," a name used in the Southern States for summer squashes.—Ed. &amp;c. also Tobacco for the men to Smoke they collect all the wood and do the drugery as Common amongst Savages. This nation is (two villages are) made up of 10 (nine) Different Tribes of the Pania (Panies), who had formerly been Seperate, but by Commotion and war with their neighbours have Come reduced and compelled to come together for protection, The curruption of the language of those different Tribes has So reduced the language that the Different Villages do not understan all the words of the others. Those people are Durtey, Kind, pore, &amp; extravigent. pursessing national pride, not beggarley recive what is given with great pleasure, Live in warm houses, large and built in an oxigon [octagon] form forming a cone at top which is left open for the smoke to pass, those houses are Generally 30 or 40 foot Diamiter, Covd. with earth on poles willows &amp; grass to prevent the earths passing thro'1 1 Cf. the more detailed descriptions of these huts given by Biddle (i, p. I06) Gass (p. 72), and Brackenridge (Louisiana, p. 248).—Ed. . Those people express an inclination to be at peace with all nations. The Seaux who trade the goods which they get of the Britush Traders for their Corn,2 2 The English traders not only traffic with the Indians about the shining [Rocky] mountains, but they have extended it to the Mandans on the Missouri, and to several other tribes both above and below them. The Spaniards also from Santa Fé occassionally traffic with the Indians about the waters of the Kansas, as likewise with those on the river Platte.—Stoddard(Louisiana, pp. 453, 454). and [have] great influence over the Rickeres, poison their minds and keep them in perpetial dread. I saw Some of the Chien (Chyenne) or Dog Indians, also a man of a nation under the Court Nue, This nation is at war with the Crow Indians &amp; have 3 children prisoners. a curious custom with the Souix as well as the rickeres is to give handsom squars to those whome they wish to Show some acknowledgements to. The Seauex we got clare of without taking their squars, they followed us with Squars two days. The Rickores we put off dureing the time we were at the Towns but 2 [handsom young] Squars were Sent by a man to follow us, they came up this evening, and pursisted in their civilities.3 3 Brackenridge says (Louisiana, p. 247) : "It is part of their hospitality, to offer the guest their wife, sister, or maid servant, according to the estimation in which the guest is held, and to refuse, is considered as treating the host with contempt." This was a custom widely prevalent among Indian tribes, especially those of the Far West. Biddle says (i, p. 105) that Arikara regarded such intercourse with strangers as disgraceful, when occurring without the husband's or brother's consent.—Ed. Dress of the men of this nation is Simply a pr. mockerson, Leagin, flap in front &amp; a Buffalow roabe, with ther hair arms &amp; ears Deckorated. The womin, wore Mockersons leagins fringed and a Shirt of Goat Skins, Some with Sleaves this garment is longe &amp; Genly. white &amp; fringed, tied at the waste[,] with a roabe, in Summer without hair.

N W D [Engineer North Western Discovery.—Ed.] [Lewis:] In conformity to the above order the Court martial convened this day for the trial of John Newman, charged with "having uttered repeated expressions of a highly criminal and "mutinous nature; the same having a tendency not only to "distroy every principle of military discipline, but also to "alienate the affections of the individuals composing this "detatchment to their officers, and disaffect them to the ser"vice for which they have been so sacredly and solemnly "engaged." The Prisonar plead not guil[t]y to the charge exhibited against him. The court after having duly considered the evidence aduced, as well as the defence of the said prisonor, are unanimously of opinion that the prisonor John Newman is guilty of every part of the charge exhibited against him, and do sentence him agreeably to the rules and articles of war, to receive seventy five lashes on his bear back, and to be henceforth discarded from the perminent party engaged for North Western discovery; two thirds of the Court concurring in the sum and nature of the punishment awarded. the commanding officers approve and confirm the sentence of the court, and direct the punishment take place tomorrow between the hours of one and two P.M.

In 1783–84 some of the leading Montreal merchants organized a rival association, known as the North West Company; but after a long and fierce competition for supremacy in the fur trade, the Hudson's Bay Company finally absorbed its rival (March 26, 1821). Hugh McCracken was an Irish "free trader," usually employed by the North West Company, who had accompanied David Thompson and Alexander Henry in their journeys through the Upper Missouri region.—Ed. this man Came nine Days ago to trade for horses &amp; Buffalow robes,— one other man came with him. the Indians continued on the banks all day. but little wood on this part of the river, many Sand bars and bad places, water much devided between them We came too and camped on the L.

The 3 consist) of about 600 men, hunt in the Plains &amp; winter and trade on the Ossiniboin River, (here decribe all Assns) they are the Decendants of the Seaux and Speake their language, they come to the nations in this quarter to trade or (make preasents) for horses1 1 La Vérendrye, who visited the Mandan in 1738, thus speaks of their relations with their northern neighbors: "The Assiliboille [Assiniboin], although numerous, and strong and robust men, are not brave; they are in great fear of the Sioux, whom they regard as braver. The Mantannes [Mandan] know their weakness, and profit by [it] on occasion. . . . Public notice was given throughout the village, warning every one to be ready to march on the second day after, the 30th of the month; this made some further delay among the Mantannes, who knew well how to profit thereby in trading their grain, tobacco, peltries, and painted feathers, which they know the Assiliboille highly value. The latter had brought, and were now giving in exchange, muskets, axes, kettles, powder, bullets, knives, and bodkins. The Mantannes are far more crafty in trade, and in all other relations, than are the Assiliboille, who are constantly duped by them. . . . The Assiliboille had purchased everything which their means permitted, such as painted buffalo-robes; skins of deer and antelope well dressed, and ornamented with fur; bunches of painted feathers; peltries; wrought garters, headdresses, and girdles. These people [the Mandan] dress leather better than do any other tribes, and do very fine work on furs and feathers, which the Assiliboille are not capable of doing. They are cunning traders, despoiling the Assiliboille of all that they may possess."—See his "Journal," in Canad.

The Ossiniboins &amp;c. have the trade of those nations in their power and treat them badly, as the Soux does the Ricarees,2 2 Biddle adds: "By their vicinity to the British [at Hudson Bay] they get all the supplies, which they withhold or give at pleasure to the remoter Indians."—Ed. and they cannot resent, for fear of loseing their trade. 19th Nov.

The river Clear of ice, &amp; riseing a little.2 2 At this point Biddle describes (i, pp. 129-132) the location, history, and mutual relations of the tribes about Fort Mandan. There are five villages, "the residence of three distinct nations: the Mandans, the Ahnahaways, and the Minnetarees." The Mandan may number about 350 warriors. The Ahnahaway ("the people whose village is on a hill") live at the mouth of Knife River, in a village called Mahaha; "they are called by the French, Soulier Noir or Shoe Indians, by the Mandans Wattasoons; and their whole force is about fifty men." Half a mile above Mahaha on the Knife River is a village of the Minitaree surnamed Metaharta ("of the willows"), numbering 150 warriors; and farther up that stream is another, of the Minitaree proper, who have 450 men. "These Minnetarees are part of the great nation called Fall Indians, who occupy the intermediate country between the Missouri and the Saskaskawan. The name of Grosventres, or Bigbellies, is given to these Minnetarees, as well as to all the Fall Indians." Mooney says (U. S. Bur. Ethnol. Rep., 1892-93, p. 955) that Grosventres signifies "belly-people" (i. e., grasping and selfish, "spongers"); that the Arapaho division of that name are the "Gros Ventres of the Prairie"; while the Hidatsa or Minitaree with whom Lewis and Clark wintered, are sometimes called "Gros Ventres of the Missouri." See McGee's interpretation of the term Grosventres (ut supra, 1893-94, p. 197). Valuable information regarding all these tribes is given by Washington Matthews, in his Ethnography and Philology of the Hidatsa Indians.—Ed. 22nd.. of November Thursday 1804— a fine morning Dispatched a perogue and 5 men under the Derection of Sergeant Pryor to the 2nd. Village for 100 bushels of Corn in ears which Mr. Jessomme, let us have [did not get more than 30 bushels]. I was allarmed about 10 oClock by the Sentinal, who informed that an Indian was about to kill his wife in the interpeters fire about 60 yards below the works, I went down and Spoke to the fellow about the rash act which he was like to commit and forbid any act of the kind near the fort. Some misunderstanding took place between this man &amp; his fife [wife] about 8 days ago, and she came to this place, &amp; continued with the Squars of the interpeters, (he might lawfully have killed her for running away) 2 days ago She returned to the vill'ge. in the evening of the Same day She came to the interpeters fire appearently much beat, &amp; Stabed in 3 places. We Derected that no man of this party have any intercourse with this woman under the penalty of Punishment. he the Husband observed that one of our Serjeants Slept with his wife &amp; if he wanted her he would give her to him, We derected the Serjeant (Odway) to give the man Some articles, at which time I told the Indian that I believed not one man of the party had touched his wife except the one he had given the use of her for a nite, in his own bed, no man of the party Should touch his squar, or the wife of any Indian, nor did I believe they touch a woman if they knew her to be the wife of another man, and advised him to take his squar home and live hapily together in future, at this time the Grand Chief of the nation arrived, &amp; lectured him, and they both went off apparently dis (dissatisfied) The Grand Chief continued (with us) all day, a warm Day fair afternoon many Indian aneckdotes our Chief &amp; his family stay all night. 23rd..— a fair warm Day, wind from the S.E.

Lewis with a conviction on the minds of the Indians of the falsity of those reports. the Indians in all the towns &amp; Camps treated Capt. Lewis &amp; the party with Great respect, except one of the principal Chiefs Mar-par-pa-parra-pas-a-too or (Horned Weasel) who did not chuse to be Seen by the Capt. &amp; left word that he was not at home &amp;c.

Kensey) was informed of the Conduct of their interpeter &amp; the Consequences if they did not put a Stop to unfavourable &amp; ill founded assursions &amp;c. &amp;c.1 1 The names of these traders were : François Antoine Larocque (in charge of this trading expedition), Charles McKenzie, Baptiste Lafrance, and four voyageurs. The journals of both Larocque and McKenzie have been published by L. R. Masson, in his Bourgeois de la Compagnie du Nord-Ouest (Quebec, 1889), i, pp. 299–393; they mention their relations with Lewis and Clark, near whom they remained during that winter. Larocque describes the objects and policy of the Americans, and says : " During the time I was there a very grand plan was schemed, but its being realized is more than I can tell, although the Captains say they are well assured it will. . . . The fort is made so strong as to be almost cannon-ball proof. . . . They have a very expert smith who is always employed making different things, and working for the Indians, who are grown very fond of them, although they disliked them at first." But McKenzie says : "The Indians accepted of clothing, but, notwithstanding, they could not be reconciled to like these 'strangers,' as they called them."—Ed. The two Chiefs much pleased with ther treatment &amp; the Cherefullness of the party, who Danced to amuse them &amp;c. &amp;c.

Nord-Ouest, i, p. 304), and adds : "As I had neither flags nor medals, I ran no risk of disobeying those orders, of which I assured them." The interpreter lent to the British was Charboneau. McKenzie thus describes (ut supra, p. 336) the method of Lewis and Clark's communications with the Indians : "A mulatto, who spoke bad French and worse English, served as interpreter to the Captains, so that a single word to be understood by the party required to pass from the Natives to the woman [Sacajawea, Indian wife of Charboneau, who could not speak English], from the woman to the husband, from the husband to the mulatto, from the mulatto to the captains."—Ed.

Viz: "five men of the Mandan nation out hunting in a S.W. derection about Eight Leagues, was Suprised by a large party of Seeoux &amp; Panies, one man was Killed and two wounded with arrows &amp; 9 Horses taken, 4 of the We ter soon nation was missing, and they expected to be attacked by the Souex &amp;c. &amp;c. we thought it well to Show a Disposition to ade and assist them against their enemies, perticularly those who Came in oppersition to our Councels; and I Deturmined to go to the town with Some men, and if the Seeoux were comeing to attact the Nation to Collect the worriers from each Village and meet them, those Ideas were also those of Capt Lewis, I crossed the river in about an hour after the arrival of the Indian express with 23 men including the interpeters and flankd the Town &amp; came up on the back part. The Indians not expecting to receive Such Strong aide in So Short a time was much supprised, and a littled allarmed at the formadable appearence of my party. The principal Chiefs met me Some Distance from the town (say 200 yards) and invited me in to town. I ord[ered] my pty into dift. lodges &amp;c. I explained to the nation the cause of my comeing in this formadable manner to their Town, was to assist and Chastise the enemies of our Dutifull Children, I requested the Grand Cheif to repeat the Circumstancies as they hapined, which he did as was mentioned by the express in the morning. I then informed them that if they would assemble their warrers and those of the Different Towns, I would [go] to meet the Army of Souex &amp;c. chastise them for takeing the blood of our dutifull Children &amp;c. after a conversation of a fiew minits amongst themselves, one Chief. the Big Man (Cien) (a Chayenne). Said they now Saw that what we hade told them was the trooth, when we expected the enemies of their Nation was Comeing to attact them, or had Spilt their blood [we] were ready to protect them, and kill those who would not listen to our Good talk. his people had listened to what we had told them and cearlessly went out to hunt in Small parties believing themselves to be Safe from the other nations, and have been killed by the Panies &amp; Seauex, "I knew Said he that the Panies were liers, and told the old Chief who Came with you (to Confirm a piece with us) that his people were liers and bad men and that we killed them like the Buffalow, when we pleased, we had made peace several times and you Nation have always commenced the war, we do not want to kill you, and will not Suffer you to kill us or Steal our horses, we will make peace with you as our two fathers have derected, and they Shall See that we will not be the Ogressors, but we fear the Ricares will not be at peace long. "My father those are the words I spoke to the Ricare in your presents. you See they have not opened their ears to your good Councels but have Spuilt our blood." two Ricaries whom we sent home this day for fear of our peoples killing them in their greaf, informed us when they came here Several days ago, that two Towns of the Ricares were makeing their Mockersons, and that we had best take care of our horses &amp;c." a numbers "of Seauex were in their Towns, and they believed not well disposed towards us. four of the Wetersoons are now absent they were to have been back in 16 days, they have been out 24 we fear they have fallen.

I told this nation that we should be always willing and ready to defend them from the insults of any nation who would dare to Come to doe them injury dureing the time we would remain in their neighbourhood, and requstd. that they would inform us of any party who may at any time be discovered by their Patroles or Scouts; I was sorry that the snow in the Plains had fallen so Deep Sence the Murder of the young Chief by the Sieoux as prevented their horses from traveling. I wished to meet those Seeoux &amp; all others who will not open their ears, but make war on our dutifull Children, and let you see that the Wariers of your Great father will chastize the enimies of his dutifull Children the Mandans, Wetersoons &amp; Winetarees, who have opend. their ears to his advice. you say that the Panies or Ricares were with the Seeaux, some bad men may have been with the Seeaux you know there is bad men in all nations, do not get mad with the recarees untill we know if those bad men are Counternancd. by their nation, and we are convsd those people do not intend to follow our Councils. You know that the Seeaux have great influence over the ricarees, and perhaps have led Some of them astray you know that the Ricarees, are Dependant on the Seeaux for their guns, powder, &amp; Ball, and it was policy in them to keep on as good tirms as possible with the Seaux untill they had Some other means of getting those articles &amp;c. &amp;c. You know yourselves that you are compelled to put up with little insults from the Christinoes &amp; Ossinaboins (or Stone Indd.) because if you go to war with those people, they will provent the traders in the North from bringing you Guns, Powder &amp; Ball and by that means distress you verry much, but whin you will have certain Supplies from your Great American father of all those articles you will not Suffer any nation to insult you &amp;c. after about two hours conversation on various Subjects all of which tended towards their Situation &amp;c. I informed them I should return to the fort, the Chief said they all thanked me verry much for the fatherly protection which I shewed towards them, that the village had been crying all the night and day for the death of the brave young man, who fell but now they would wipe away their tears, and rejoice in their fathers protection, and cry no more.

The messenger's name appears in the L. and C. MSS. as Henny, Henry and Haney. His real name was Hugh Henney, a trader for the Hudson's Bay Company. Larocque mentions his arrival (Masson's Bourg. Nord-Ouest, i, p. 307). Mrs. E. E. Dye cites to the Editor from a MS. journal of a Hudson's Bay Company trader (1812–16) the additional fact that he was head of the Pembina and Red River (of the North) district as late as 1812, when he was superseded by Peter Fidler, with whose earlier exploration Lewis and Clark were acquainted.—Ed. Mr. C. in his letter expressed a great anxiety to Serve us in any thing in his power.2 2 The object of the visits we received from the N. W. Company, was to ascertain our motives for visiting that country, and to gain information with respect to the change of government.—GASS (p. 92). * a root Discribed by Mr. Henny for the Cure of a Mad Dog [blank in MS.— Ed.] Mr. LeRock a clerk, of the NW.

They assumed feminine garb and occupations, for the entire span of life, and were regarded with the utmost contempt by their tribesmen. For accounts of this strange custom, see Lafitau's Mœurs des sauvages, i, pp. 52, 53; Long's Expedition, i, p. 129; Carr's Mounds of Miss. Valley, p. 33; Catlin's N. Amer.

Gass says : "Flour, dried apples, pepper, and other articles were distributed in the different messes to enable them to celebrate Christmas in a proper and social manner." Three rations of brandy were served during the day, which was mainly spent in dancing; no women were present save Charboneau's three wives, who were only spectators.—Ed. 26th.. Decr.

Mackenzie says (Masson's Bourg. Nord-Ouest, i, p. 330), of the Indian opinion regarding Lewis and Clark: "The Indians admired the air gun, as it could discharge forty shots out of one load, but they dreaded the magic of the owners. 'Had I these white warriors in the upper plains,' said the Gros Ventres chief, 'my young men on horseback would soon do for them, as they would do for so many wolves, for,' continued he, 'there are only two sensible men among them, the worker of iron and the mender of guns."' —Ed.

He gives interesting details as to the territorial claims of the United States, saying: "They include in their territory as far north as River Qui appelle, for, as it was impossible for a line drawn west from the west end of Lac des Bois to strike the Mississippi, they make it run till it strikes its tributary waters, that is, the north branches of the Missouri and from thence to the Pacific."—Ed. 8th.. of January Tuesday 1805 — a cold Day but fiew indians at the fort to day wind from the N.W. one man at the Village 2 2 Biddle here describes another licentious ceremony, called "the medicine-dance." —Ed. 9th.. of January Wednesday 1805 a Cold Day Themometer at 21°. below 0, great numbers of indians go to kill Cows,3 3 The buffaloes were usually called by the French hunters "wild cows" or "wild cattle," a term often adopted by the English.—Ed.

The man was a person of no distinction, yet the whole village was full of anxiety for his safety."—Ed. about 10 oClock the boy about 13 years of age Came to the fort with his feet frosed and had layed out last night without fire with only a Buffalow Robe to Cover him, the Dress which he wore was a pr. of Cabra (antelope) Legins, which is verry thin and mockersons we had his feet put in cold water and they are Comeing too.

This Chief who is a young man 26 yr. old replied that if his going to war against the Snake indians would be displeasing to us he would not go, he had horses enough. We observed that what we had said was the words of his great father, and what we had Spoken to all the Nations which we Saw on our passage up, they all promis to open their ears, and we do not know as yet if any of them has Shut them (we are doubtfull of the Soues) if they do not attend to what we have told them their great father will open their ears. This Chief Said that he would advise all his nation to stay at home untill we Saw the Snake Indians &amp; Knew if they would be friendly, he himself would attend to what we had told him. 17th..

They treated us friendly and gave us victuals. After we were done eating they presented a bowlful to a buffaloe head, saying, "eat that," Their superstitious credulity is so great, that they believe by using the head well, the living buffaloe will come, and that they will get a supply of meat.—Gass (pp. 98, 99). 21st Monday January 1805 a number of Indians here to day a fine day nothing remarkable one ban [man] verry bad with the pox. 22nd..

We refused, and gave reassons, which he verry readily assented to, and promised to open his ears to all We Said this Man is young and named (Seeing Snake)-Mar-book, She-ah-O-ke-ah. this mans Woman Set out &amp; he prosued her, in the evening 2nd.. of February Satturday 1805 a fine Day, one Deer killed our interpeter Still unwell, one of the wives of the Big belley interpetr Sick. Mr. Larocke leave us to day (this man is a Clerk to the NW. Company, &amp; verry anxious to accompany us) [Lewis:] 3rd of February Sunday 1805.1 1 From this point to the 13th of February, the journal is written by Lewis, during Clark's absence on a hunting expedition (Feb. 4–12). This is the only hiatus in Clark's regular journalizing, throughout the entire expedition; but under date of February 13th, pp. 259–261, post, after his return, he gives a brief summary of the events of each day during his trip, so that his record is practically complete.—Ed. a fine day; the blacksmith again commences his opperations. we were visited by but few of the natives today. the situation of our boat and perogues is now allarming, they are firmly inclosed in the Ice and almost covered with snow— the ice which incloses them lyes in several stratas of unequal thicknesses which are seperated by streams of water. this [is] peculiarly unfortunate because so soon as we cut through the first strata of ice the water rushes up and rises as high as the upper surface of the ice and thus creates such a debth of water as renders it impracticable to cut away the lower strata which appears firmly attatched to, and confining the bottom of the vessels. the instruments we have hitherto used has been the ax only, with which, we have made several attempts that proved unsuccessfull from the cause above mentioned. we then determined to attempt freeing them from the ice by means of boiling water which we purposed heating in the vessels by means of hot stones, but this expedient proved also fruitless, as every species of stone which we could procure in the neighbourhood partook so much of the calcarious genus that they burst into small particles on being exposed to the heat of the fire. we now determined as the dernier resort to prepare a parsel of Iron spikes and attatch them to the end of small poles of convenient length and endeavour by means of them to free the vessels from the ice. we have already prepared a large rope of Elk-skin and a windless by means of which we have no doubt of being able to draw the boat on the bank provided we can free [it] from the ice. 4th. February, Monday 1805. This morning fair tho' could the thermometer stood at 18°. below Naught, wind from N.W. Capt Clark set out with a hunting party consisting of sixteen of our command and two frenchmen who together with two others, have established a small hut and resided this winter within the vicinity of Fort Mandane under our protection. visited by many of the natives today. our stock of meat which we had procured in the Months of November &amp; December is now nearly exhausted; a supply of this articles is at this moment peculiarly interesting as well for our immediate consumption, as that we may have time before the approach of the warm season to prepare the meat for our voyage in the spring of the year. Capt. Clark therefore determined to continue his rout down the river even as far as the River bullet1 1 The Cannon-ball River, which empties into the Missouri near Fort Rice, N. D. The expedition had reached the mouth of this stream on Oct. 18.— Ed. unless he should find a plenty of game nearer. the men transported their baggage on a couple of small wooden Slays drawn by themselves, and took with them 3 pack horses which we had agreed should be returned with a load of meat to fort mandane as soon as they could procure it. no buffaloe have made their appearance in our neighbourhood for some weeks (time shorter); and I am informed that our Indian neighbours suffer extreemly at this moment for the article of flesh. Shields killed two deer this evening, both very lean—one a large buck, he had shed his horns. 5th. February Tuesday 1805. — Pleasent morning wind from N.W. fair; visited by many of the natives who brought a considerable quanty of corn in payment for the work which the blacksmith had done for them they are pecu[1]arly attatched to a battle ax formed in a very inconvenient manner in my opinion. it is fabricated of iron only, the blade is extreemly thin, from 7 to nine inches in length and from 4 ¾, to 6 Inches on it's edge, from whence the sides proceed nearly in a straight line to the eye where it's width is generally not more than an inch. the eye is round &amp; about one inch in diameter, the handle seldom more than fourteen inches in length, the whole weighing about one pound the great length of the blade of this ax, added to the small size of the handle renders a stroke uncertain and easily avoided, while the shortness of the handel must render a blow much less forceable if even well directed, and still more inconvenient as they uniformly use this instrument in action on horseback. The oalder fassion is still more inconvenient, it is somewhat in the form of the blade of an Espantoon1 1 A rare and practically obsolete form of spontoon, a word itself now little used. The implement meant is the half-pike, a sort of halberd formerly used by certain officers of the British army.—Coues (L. and C., i, p. 230). but is attatchd. to a helve of the dementions before discribed the blade is sometimes by way of ornament purforated with two three or more small circular holes the following is the general figure it is from 12 to 15 inces in length 6th. February Wednesday 1805. Fair morning Wind from N.W. had a sley prepared against the return of the horses which Capt Clark had promised to send back as soon as he should be able to procure a load of meat. visited by many of the natives among others the Big white, the Coal, big-man, hairy horn and the black man, I smoked with them, after which they retired, a deportment not common, for they usually pester us with their good company the ballance of the day after once being introduced to our apartment. Shields killed three antelopes this evening. the blacksmiths take a considerable quantity of corn today in payment for their labour. the blacksmith's have proved a happy reso[r]ce to us in our present situation as I believe it would have been difficult to have devised any other method to have procured corn from the natives. the Indians are extravegantly fond of sheet iron of which they form arrow-points and manufacter into instruments for scraping and dressing their buffaloe robes. I permited the blacksmith to dispose of a part of a sheet iron callaboos (camboose,2 2 This is an unusual form of caboose, from the Dutch mariners' name of the cook's galley.—Ed. stove) which had been nearly birnt out on our passage up the river, and for each piece about four inches square he obtained from seven to eight gallons of corn from the natives who appeared extreemly pleased with the exchange 7th. February Thursday 1805. This morning was fair Thermometer at 18°. above naught much warmer than it has been for some days; wind S.E. continue to be visited by the natives. The Sergt. of the guard reported that the Indian women (wives to our interpreters) were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their Indian visitors, I therefore directed a lock to be put to the gate and ordered that no Indian but those attatched to the garrison should be permitted to remain all night within the fort or admitted during the period which the gate had been previously ordered to be kept shut, which was from sunset untill sunrise. 8th. February Friday 1805. This morning was fair wind S.E. the weather still warm and pleasent. visited by the black-Cat the principal chief of the Roop-tar-he, or upper mandane village. this man possesses more integrety, firmness, inteligence and perspicuety of mind than any indian I have met with in this quarter, and I think with a little management he may be made a usefull agent in furthering the views of our government. The black Cat presented me with a bow and apologized for not having completed the shield he had promised alledging that the weather had been too could to permit his making it, I gave him som small shot 6 fishing-hooks and 2 yards of ribbon his squaw also presented me with 2 pair of mockersons for which in return I gave a small lookingglass and a couple of nedles. the chief dined with me and left me in the evening. he informed me that his people suffered very much for the article of meat, and that he had not himself tasted any for several days. 9th. February Saturday 1805. The morning fair and pleasent, wind from S.E. visited by Mr. McKinzey one of the N.W. Company's clerks. this evening a man by the name of Howard whom I had given permission to go [to] the Mandane vilage returned after the gate was shut and reather than call to the guard to have it opened scaled the works an indian who was looking on shortly after followed his example. I convinced the Indian of the impropryety of his conduct, and explained to him the risk he had run of being severely treated, the fellow appeared much allarmed, I gave him a small piece of tobacco and sent him away Howard I had comitted to the care of the guard with a determineation to have him tryed by a Court-martial for this offence. this man is an old soldier which still hightens this offince. 10th February Sunday 1805. This Morning was Cloudy after a slight Snow which fell in the course of the night the wind blue very hard from N.W. altho' the thermometer stood at 18°. above naught the violence of the wind caused a degree of could that was much more unpleasent than that of yesterday when thermometer stood at 10°. only above the same point. Mr. Mc.Kinzey left me this morning. Charbono returned with one of the Frenchmen, and informed me that he had left the three Horses and two men with the meat which Capt. Clark had sent at some distance below on the river he told me that the horses were heavy loaded and that not being shod it was impossible for horses to travel on the ice. I determined to send down some men with two small slays for the meat and accordingly I gave orders that they should set out early the next morning. two men were also sent to conduct the horses by way of the plain. 11th. February Monday 1805. The party that were ordered last evening set out early this morning, the weather was fair and could wind N.W. about five Oclock this evening one of the wives of Charbono was delivered of a fine boy.1 1 This was Sacajawea, the Shoshone captive purchased by Charboneau, who had two other wives among the Mandan. Sacajawea was the only woman taken upon the Expedition.—Ed. it is worthy of remark that this was the first child which this woman had boarn, and as is common in such cases her labour was tedious and the pain violent; Mr. Jessome informed me that he had freequently admininstered a small portion of the rattle of the rattle-snake, which he assured me had never failed to produce the desired effect, that of hastening the birth of the child; having the rattle of a snake by me I gave it to him and he administered two rings of it to the woman broken in small pieces with the fingers and added to a small quantity of water. Whether this medicine was truly the cause or not I shall not undertake to determine, but I was informed that she had not taken it more than ten minutes before she brought forth perhaps this remedy may be worthy of future experiments, but I must confess that I want faith as to it's efficacy. 12th. February Tuesday 1805. The morning was fair tho' could, thermometer at 14°. below naught wind S.E. ordered the Blacksmith to shoe the horses and some others to prepare some gears in order to send them down with three slays to join the hunting party and transport the meat which they may have procured to this place the men whom I had sent for the meat left by Charbono did not return untill 4 OClock this evening. Drewyer arrived with the horses about the same time, the horses appeared much fatieged I directed some meal brands [bran] given them moisened with a little water but to my astonishment found that they would not eat it but prefered the bark of the cotton wood which forms the principall article of food usually given them by their Indian masters in the winter season; for this purpose they cause the tree to be felled by their women and the horses feed on the boughs and bark of their tender branches. the Indians in our neighbourhood are freequently pilfered of their horses by the Recares, Souixs and Assinniboins and therefore make it an invariable rule to put their horses in their lodges at night. in this situation the only food of the horse consists of a few sticks of the cottonwood from the size of a man's finger to that of his arm. the Indians are invariably severe riders, and frequently have occasion for many days together through the whole course of the day to employ their horses in pursueing the Buffaloe or transporting meat to their vilages during which time they are seldom suffered to tast food; at night the Horse returned to his stall where his food is what seems to me a scanty allowance of wood. under these circumstances it would seem that their horses could not long exist or at least could not retain their flesh and strength, but the contrary is the fact, this valuable anamall under all those disadvantages is seldom seen meager or unfit for service. A little after dark this evening Capt. Clark arrived with the hunting party since they set out they have killed forty Deer, three buffaloe bulls, &amp; sixteen Elk, most of them were so meager that they were unfit for uce, particularly the Buffaloe and male Elk the wolves also which are here extreemly numerous helped themselves to a considerable proportion of the hunt. if an anamal is killed and lyes only one night exposed to the wolves it is almost invariably devoured by them. 13th. February Wednesday 1805. The morning cloudy thermometer 2°. below naught wind from S.E. visited by the Black-Cat gave him a battle ax with which he appeared much gratifyed. [Clark:] I1 1 Clark here resumes the record, and the remainder of the journal in Codex C is (with the exception of one entry) in his handwriting.—Ed. returned last Night from a hunting party much fatigued, haveing walked 30 miles on the ice and through Points of wood land in which the Snow was nearly Knee Deep The 1st. day [Feb 4] I left the fort proceeded on the ice to new Mandan Island, 22 miles &amp; camped, killed nothing, &amp; nothing to eat, The 2d. day—the morning verry Cold &amp; Windey. I broke thro the ice and got my feet and legs wet, Sent out 4 hunters thro' a point to kill a Deer &amp; cook it by the time the party should get up, those hunters killed a Deer &amp; 2 Buffalow Bulls the Buffalow too Meagur to eat, we eate the Deer &amp; proceeded on to an old Indian Lodge, Sent out the hunters &amp; they brought in three lean Deer, which we made use of for food, walking on uneaven ice has blistered the bottoms of my feat, and walking is painfull to me. 3rd. day—cold morning the after part of the Day worm, Camped on a Sand point near the mouth of a Creek on the SW.

Day—hunted the two bottoms near the Camp Killed 9 Elk, 18 Deer, brought to camp all the meat fit to eate, &amp; had the bones taken out. every man ingaged either in hunting or Collecting &amp; packing the meat to Camp 5th. Day—Despatched one of the party our interpeter &amp; 2 french men with the 3 horses loaded with the best of the meat to the fort 44 miles Distant, the remaining meat I had packed on the 2 Slays &amp; drawn down to the next point about 3 miles below, at this place I had all the meat collected which was killed yesterday &amp; had escaped the Wolves, Ravin &amp; Magpie; (which are verry noumerous about this place) and put into a close pen made of logs to secure it from the wolves &amp; birds &amp; proceeded on to a large bottom nearly opposit the Chisscheter (heart) River, in this bottom we found but little game, Great No. of Wolves, on the hills Saw Several parsels of Buffalow. Camped. I killed a Buck 6th. Day—The Buffalow Seen last night provd to be Bulls. lean &amp; unfit for to make use of as food, the Distance from Camp being nearly 60 miles and the packing of meat that distance attended with much dificuelty Deturmined me to return and hunt the points above, we Set out on our return and halted at an old Indian lodge 40 miles below Fort Mandan Killed 3 Elk, &amp; 2 Deer. 7th. Day—a cold Day wind blew hard from the N.W. J Fields got one of his ears frosed deturmined to lay by and hunt to day Killed an Elk &amp; 6 deer, all that was fit for us [of] this meat I had Boned and put into a Close pen made of logs. 8th. Day—the air keen halted at the old Camp we staye in on the 2d night after we left the Fort, expecting to meat the horses at this Place, killed 3 Deer, Several men being nearly out of Mockersons, &amp; the horses not returning deturmined me to return to the Fort on tomorrow. 9th. day.—Set out early, Saw great numbers of Grouse feeding on the young Willows, on the Sand bars, one man I sent in persute of a gangue of Elk Killed three near the old Ricara Village, and joined at the fort, Sent him back to secure the meat, one man with him. The ice on the Parts of the river which was verry rough, as I went down, was Smoothe on my return, This is owing to the rise and fall of the water, which takes place every day or two, and Caused by partial thaws, and obstructions in the passage of the water thro the Ice, which frequently attaches itself to the bottom, the water when riseing forses its way thro the cracks &amp; air holes above the old ice, &amp; in one night becomes a Smothe Surface of ice 4 to 6 Inchs thick, the River falls &amp; the ice Sink in places with the water and attaches itself to the bottom, and when it again rises to its former hite, frequently leavs a Valley of Several feet to Supply with water to bring it on a leavel Surfice. The water of the Missouri at this time is Clear with little tingue. I saw Several old Villages near the Chisscheter River on enquirey found they were Mandan Villages destroyed by the Sous &amp; Small Pox, they [were] noumerous and lived in 6 (9) Villages near that place. 14th.. of February Thursday 1805. The Snow fell 3 inches Deep last Night, a fine morning, Despatched George Drewyer &amp; 3 men, with two Slays drawn by 3 horses for the Meat left below. 15th.. of February Friday 1805 at 10 oClock P M. last night the men that [were] despatched yesterday for the Meat, returned and informed us that as they were on their march down at the distance of about 24 miles below the Fort (G. Drewyer Frasure, S Gutterage, &amp; Newmon1 1 These men were George Drouillard, Robert Frazier, Silas Goodrich, and John Newman.—Ed. with a broken Gun). about 105 Indians which they took to be Soues rushed on them and cut their horses from the Slays, two of which they carried off in great hast, the 3rd. horse was given up to the party by the intersetion of an Indian who assumd. Some authority on the occasion, probably more thro fear of himself or Some of the Indians being killed by our men who were not disposed to be Robed of all they had tamely, they also forced 2 of the mens knives &amp; a tamahauk, the man obliged them to return the tamahawk [, but] the knives they ran off with We dispatched two men to inform the Mandans, and if any of them chose to pursue those robers, to come down in the morning, and join Capt Lewis who intended to Set out with a party of men Verry early, by 12 oClock the Chief of the 2nd. Village Big White came down, and Soon after one other Chief and Several men. The Chief observed that all the young men of the 2 Villages were out hunting, and but verry fiew guns were left, Capt. Lewis Set out at Sunrise with 24 men, to meet those Soues &amp;c. Several Indians accompanied him Some with Bows &amp; arrows Some with Spears &amp; Battle axes, 2 with fuzees (fusils).1 1 Flint-lock muskets.—Ed. the morning fine The Thermometer Stood at 16°. below 0, Nought, visited by 2 of the Big Bellies this evening, one Chief of the Mandans returned from Capt Lewises Party nearly blind, this Complaint is as I am informd. Common at this Season of the year and caused by the reflection of the Sun on the ice &amp; Snow, it is cured by "jentilley swetting the part affected, by throwing Snow on a hot Stone." a Verry Cold part of the night one man Killed a verry large Red Fox to day. 16th.. of February Saturday 1805 a fine morning, visited by but fiew Indians to day, at Dusk two of the Indians who wint down with Capt. Lewis returned, Soon after two others and one man (Howard) with his feet frosted, and informed that the Inds. who Commited the roberry of the 2 horses was So far a head that they could not be overtaken, they left a number of pars of Mockersons which, the Mandans knew to be Soues Mockersons, This war party camped verry near the last Camp I made when on my hunting party, where they left Some Corn, as a deception, with a view to induce a belief that they were Ricarras. Capt Lewis &amp; party proceeded on down the meat I left at my last Camp was taken. 17th.. of February Sunday 1805 this morning worm &amp; a little Cloudy, the Coal &amp; his Son visited me to day with a about 30lb. of dri[e]d Buffalow meat, &amp; Some Tallow Mr. Mc. Kinsey one of the NW. Compys. Clerks visited me (one of the ho[r]ses the Sous robed a fiew Days past. belonged to this man) The after part of the day fair. 18th.. of February Monday 1805 a cloudy morning Some Snow, Several Indians here to day Mr. Mc Kinsey leave me, the after part of the day fine I am much engaged makeing a descriptive List of the Rivers from Information1 1 See "Scientific Data: Summary Statement of Rivers"—Clark's draft; especially the information collected during winter of 1804–05 of streams above Fort Mandan flowing into the Missouri.—Ed. our Store of Meat is out to day. 19th.. of February Tuesday 1805 a fine Day visited by Several of the Mandans to day, our Smiths are much engaged mending and makeing Axes for the Indians for which we get Corn 20th. February Wednesday 1805 a Butifull Day, visited by the Little raven verry early this mornning I am informed of the Death of an old man whome I saw in the Mandan Village this man, informed me that he "was 120 winters old, he requested his grand Children to Dress him after Death &amp; Set him on a Stone on a hill with his face towards his old Village or Down the river, that he might go Streight to his brother at their old village under ground"2 2 Referring to the myth of their tribal origin, as having come from an underground region. For a minute account of this belief, written from the recital made by a prominent Mandan, see Prince Maximilian's Voyage, ii, pp. 431–436.—Ed. I observed Several Mandans verry old chiefly men3 3 Whose robust exercises fortify the body, while the laborious occupations of the women shorten their existence.—Biddle (i, p. 163). 21st.. February Thursday 1805 a Delightfull Day put out our Clothes to Sun. Visited by the big White &amp; Big Man they informed me that Several men of their nation was gone to Consult their Medison Stone about 3 day march to the South West to know what was to be the result of the ensuing year. They have great confidence in this stone, and say that it informs them of every thing which is to happen, &amp; visit it everry Spring &amp; Sometimes in the Summer. "They haveing arrived at the Stone give it smoke and proceed to the Wood at Some distance to Sleep the next morning return to the Stone, and find marks white &amp; raised on the stone representing the peece or War which they are to meet with, and other changes, which they are to meet" This Stone has a leavel Surface of about 20 feet in Surcumfrance, thick and porus," and no doubt has Some mineral quallites effected by the Sun.1 1 See descriptions of this "medicine stone," and of the ceremonies with which the Indians invoked the spirit supposed to dwell there, in Long's Expedition, i, pp. 273, 274; and Maximilian's Voyage, ii, pp. 459, 460.

Mr. Garrow show's us the way the recaras made their large Beeds. [Lewis:]1 1 This entry, written by Lewis under date of March 16, is in the MS. inserted after the entry for March 21.—Ed. Mr. Garrow a Frenchman who has lived many years with the Ricares &amp; Mandans shewed us the process used by those Indians to make beads. the discovery of this art these nations are said to have derived from the Snake Indians who have been taken prisoners by the Ricaras. the art is kept a secret by the Indians among themselves and is yet known to but few of them. the Prosess is as follows.—Take glass of as many different colours as you think proper, then pound it as fine as possible, puting each colour in a seperate vessel. wash the pounded Glass in severtal waters throwing off the water at each washing, continue this opperation as long as the pounded glass stains or colours the water which is poured off and the residuum is then prepared for uce. you then provide an earthen pot of convenient size say of three gallons which will stand the fire; a platter also of the same material sufficiently small to be admitted in the mouth of the pot or jar. the pot has a nitch in it's edge through which to watch the beads when in blast. You then provide some well seasoned clay with a proportion of sand sufficient to prevent it's becoming very hard when exposed to the heat. this clay must be tempered with water untill it is about the consistency of common doe. of this clay you then prepare, a sufficient number of little sticks of the size you wish the hole through the bead, which you do by roling the clay on the palm of the hand with your finger. this done put those sticks of clay on the platter and expose them to a red heat for a few minutes when you take them off and suffer them to cool. the pot is also heated to cles [cleanse] it perfectly of any filth it may contain. small balls of clay are also mad[e] of about an ounce weight which serve each as a pedestal for a bead. these while soft ar destributed over the face of the platter at su[c]h distance from each other as to prevent the beads from touching. some little wooden paddles are now provided from three to four inches in length sharpened or brought to a point at the extremity of the handle. with this paddle you place in the palm of the hand as much of the wet pounded glass as is necessary to make the bead of the size you wish it. it is then arranged with the paddle in an oblong from [from], laying one of those little stick of clay crosswise over it; the pounded glass by means of the paddle is then roped in cilindrical form arround the stick of clay and gently roled by motion of the hand backwards an forwards untill you get it as regular and smooth as you conveniently can. if you wish to introduce any other colour you now purforate the surface of the bead with the pointed end of your little paddle and fill up the cavity with other pounded glass of the colour you wish forming the whole as regular as you can. a hole is now made in the center of the little pedestals of clay with the handle of your shovel sufficiently large to admit the end of the stick of clay arround which the bead is formed. the beads are then arranged perpendicularly on their pedestals and little distance above them supported by the little sticks of clay to which they are attatched in the manner before mentioned. thus arranged the platter is deposited on burning coals or hot embers and the pot reversed with the apparture in its edge turned towards covers the whole. dry wood pretty much doated (doughted)1 1 A variant of "doted," which Century Dictionary regards as an English provincialism; it means "decayed," or "rotted." Coues states that he had heard this word in North Carolina, applied to trees dead at the top, also to lumber prepared from unsound trees.—Ed. is then plased arron [around] the pot in sush manner as compleatly to cover it [It] is then set on fire and the opperator must shortly after begin to watch his beads through the apparture of the pot le[s]t they should be distroyed by being over heated. he suffers the beads to acquire a deepred heat from which when it passes in a small degree to a pailer or whitish red, or he discovers that the beads begin to become pointed at their upper extremities he removes the fire from about the pot and suffers the whole to cool gradually. the pot is then removed and the beads taken out. the clay which fills the hollow of the beads is picked out with an awl or nedle. the bead is then fit for uce. The Indians are extreemly fond of the large beads formed by this process. they use them as pendants to their years, or hair and sometimes wear them about their necks.2 2 Catlin also mentions this manufacture of glass beads by the Mandans, and their exclusive possession of the art (N. Amer. Inds., ii, p. 261). But Matthews says that the Arikara women also have it; he thinks that these peoples made "glazed earthen ornaments before the whites came among them" (Hidatsa, pp. 22, 23).—Ed.

It is true, Captain Lewis could not make himself agreeable to us. He could speak fluently and learnedly on all subjects, but his inveterate disposition against the British stained, at least in our eyes, all his eloquence.

Mackenzie (ut supra, p. 337) states that the Indians on the Missouri also search eagerly for the carcasses of buffaloes and other drowned animals that float down the river in the spring season; these, although rotten and of intolerable stench, "are preferred by the Natives to any other kind of food. . . . So fond are the Mandanes of putrid meat that they bury animals whole in the winter for the consumption of the spring."—Ed. many of the cakes of ice which they pass over are not two feet square. The Plains are on fire in View of the fort on both Sides of the River, it is Said to be common for the Indians to burn the Plains near their Villages every Spring for the benefit of their hors[e]s, (Qu) and to induce the Buffalow to come near to them. 31st.

[Lewis:] Fort Mandan April 7th. 1805.1 1 At this point begins Codex D, which is entirely in Lewis's handwriting, and continues the journal of the expedition until May 23, 1805.—Ed. Having on this day at 4. P.M. completed every arrangement necessary for our departure, we dismissed the barge and crew with orders to return without loss of time to St. Louis, a small canoe with two French hunters accompanyed the barge; these men had assended the missouri with us the last year as engages.2 2 These were François Rivet and Philippe Degie, whom the explorers met on their return journey Aug. 21, 1806. Mrs. E. E. Dye writes to us that they afterwards went to Oregon and settled in Champoeg, and were locally celebrated as being men who had been with Lewis and Clark. —Ed. The barge crew consisted of six soldiers and two [blank space in MS.] Frenchmen; two Frenchmen and a Ricara Indian also take their passage in her as far as the Ricara Vilages, at which place we expect Mr. Tiebeau [Tabeau] to embark with his peltry who in that case will make an addition of two, perhaps four men to the crew of the barge. We gave Richard Warfington, a discharged Corpl., the charge of the Barge and crew, and confided to his care likewise our dispatches to the government, letters to our private friends, and a number of articles to the President the United States.3 3 Coues (L. and C., i, pp. 253–260) gives in his notes on this entry all the information he could gather regarding the personnel of the party which left Fort Mandan to continue the transcontinental explorations; he also cites a letter by Lewis, which explains how Corporal Warfington came to be retained on the muster-roll after his term of service had expired. He was the only one of the party returning to St. Louis whom Lewis could entrust with his despatches to the government, and his commander praises his fidelity.—Ed. One of the Frenchmen by the Name of (Joseph) Gravline an honest discrete man and an excellent boat-man is imployed to conduct the barge as a pilot; we have therefore every hope that the barge and with her our dispatches will arrive safe at St.. Louis. Mr. Gravlin who speaks the Ricara language extreemly well, has been imployed to conduct a few of the Recara Chiefs to the seat of government who have promised us to decend in the barge to St: Liwis with that view. At same moment that the Barge departed from Fort Mandan, Capt. Clark emba[r]ked with our party and proceeded up the River. as I had used no exercise for several weeks, I determined to walk on shore as far as our encampment of this evening; accordingly I continued my walk on the N. side of the River about six miles, to the upper Village of the Mandans, and called on the Black Cat or Pose-cop′-se-ha′, the great chief of the Mandans; he was not at home; I rested myself a [few] minutes, and finding that the party had not arrived I returned about 2 miles and joined them at their encampment on the N. side of the river opposite the lower Mandan village. Our part[y] now consisted of the following Individuals. Sergts. John Ordway, Nathaniel Prior, &amp; Patric Gass; Privates, William Bratton, John Colter, Reubin, and Joseph Fields, John Shields, George Gibson, George Shannon, John Potts, John Collins, Joseph Whitehouse, Richard Windsor, Alexander Willard, Hugh Hall, Silas Goodrich, Robert Frazier, Peter Crouzatt, John Baptiest la Page, Francis Labiech, Hue Mc.. Neal, William Warner, Thomas P. Howard, Peter Wiser, and John B. Thompson. Interpreters, George Drewyer and Tauasant Charbono also a Black man by the name of York, servant to Capt. Clark, an Indian Woman wife to Charbono with a young child, and a Mandan man who had promised us to accompany us as far as the Snake Indians with a view to bring about a good understanding and friendly intercourse between that nation and his own, the Minetares and Ahwahharways. Our vessels consisted of six small canoes, and two large perogues. This little fleet altho' not quite so rispectable as those of Columbus or Capt. Cook, were still viewed by us with as much pleasure as those deservedly famed adventurers ever beheld theirs; and I dare say with quite as much anxiety for their safety and preservation. we were now about to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on which the foot of civilized man had never trodden; the good or evil it had in store for us was for experiment yet to determine, and these little vessells contained every article by which we were to expect to subsist or defend ourselves. however, as the state of mind in which we are, generally gives the colouring to events, when the immagination is suffered to wander into futurity, the picture which now presented itself to me was a most pleasing one. enterta[in]ing as I do, the most confident hope of succeeding in a voyage which had formed a da[r]ling project of mine for the last ten years, I could but esteem this moment of my departure as among the most happy of my life. The party are in excellent health and sperits, zealously attached to the enterprise, and anxious to proceed; not a whisper of murmur or discontent to be heard among them, but all act in unison, and with the most perfict harmony. I took an early supper this evening and went to bed. Capt. Clark myself the two Interpretters and the woman and child sleep in a tent of dressed skins. this tent is in the Indian stile, formed of a number of dressed Buffaloe skins sewed together with sinues.1 1 Catlin enumerates (N. Amer. Inds., i, p. 262) the many uses made by the Indians of the buffalo in their domestic economy—for food, clothing, implements, weapons, etc.—Ed. it is cut in such manner that when foalded double it forms the quarter of a circle, and is left open at one side here it may be attatched or loosened at pleasure (Qu) by strings which are sewed to its sides for the purpose. to erect this tent, a parsel of ten or twelve poles are provided, fore or five of which are attatched together at one end, they are then elivated and their lower extremities are spread in a circular manner to a width proportionate to the demention of the lodge; in the same position orther poles are leant against those, and the leather is then thrown over them forming a conic figure. [Clark:] 7th. of April Satturday [Sunday] 18052 2 We obtain Clark's journal from April 7–July 3, 1805 (except where otherwise noted) from Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 1; save that the first Clark entry of April 7 is from Codex C of the Philadelphia collection.—Ed. — a windey day, The Interpreter we Sent to the Villages returned with Chief of the Ricara's &amp; 3 men of that nation, this Chief informed us that he was Sent by his nation to know the despositions of the nations in this neighbourhood in respect to the recara's Settleing near them, that he had not yet made those arrangements, he request that we would speek to the Assinniboin, &amp; Crow Inds. in their favour, that they wished to follow our directions and be at peace with all, he viewed all nations in this quarter well disposed except the Sioux. The wish of those recaras appears to be a junction with the Mandans &amp; Minetarras in a Defensive war with the Sioux who rob them of every Spece [species] of property in Such a manner that they cannot live near them any longer. I told this Chief we were glad to See him, and we viewed his nation as the Dutifull Children of a Great father who would extend his protection to all those who would open their ears to his good advice, we had already Spoken to the Assinniboins, and should Speeke to the Crow Indians if we should see them &amp;c. as to the Sioux their Great father would not let them have any more good Guns &amp;c. would take care to prosu Such measurs as would provent those Sioux from Murd[er]ing and taking the property from his dutyfull red Children &amp;c. we gave him a certificate of his good Conduct &amp; a Small Medal, a Carrot of Tobacco and a String of Wompom. he requested that one of his men who was lame might decend in the boat to their nation and returned to the Mandans well Satisfied. The name of this Chief of War is Kah-kah, We-to—Raven brave. This Cheif delivered us a letter from Mr. Taboe. informing us of the wish of the Grand Chiefs of the Recarras to visit their Great father and requesting the privolage of put'g on board the boat 3000lb. of Skins &amp;c. &amp; adding 4 hands and himself to the party. this preposeal we Shall agree to, as that addition will make the party in the boat 15 Strong and more able to defend themselves from the Seoux &amp;c.1 1 Here ends the daily record kept by Clark, as contained in Codex C. The rest of the codex is occupied with matter outside of that record, which will be found in "Scientific Data."

Sah-kah-gar we â [Lewis:] April 8th. Set out early this morning, the wind blew hard against us, from the N.W. we therefore traveled very slowly. I walked on shore, and visited the black Cat, took leave of him after smoking a pipe as is their custom, and then proceeded on slowly by land about four miles where I wated the arrival of the party, at 12 Oclock they came up and informed me that one of the small canoes was behind in distress. Capt. Clark returned fou[n]d she had filled with water and all her loading wet. we lost half a bag of bisquit, and about thirty pounds of powder by this accedent; the powder we regard as a serious loss, but we spread it to dry immediately and hope we shall still be enabled to restore the greater part of it. this was the only powder we had which was not perfectly secure from geting wet. we took dinner at this place, and then proceed on to oure encampment, which was on the N. side opposite to a high bluff.1 1 Near the present Hancock, N. D.—Ed. the Mandan man came up after we had encamped and brought with him a woman who was extreemly solicitous to accompany one of the men of our party, this however we positively refused to permit.

Set out as early as it was possible to see this morning and proceed about five miles where we halted and took beakfas the Indian man who had promised us to accompany us as far as the Snake Indians, now informed us of his intention to relinquish the journey, and accordingly returned to his village. we saw a great number of brant passing up the river, some of them were white, except the large feathers in the first and second joint of the wing which are black. there is no other difference between them and the common gray brant but that of their colour—their note and habits are the same, and they are freequently seen to associate together. I have not yet positively determined whether they are the same, or a different species. Capt Clark walked on shore to-day1 1 That Lewis occupied himself with writing his journal is evidenced by the entry in his weather diary for this date (Codex Fe, p. 4): "The perogue is so unsteady that I can scarcely write."—Ed. and informed me on his return, that passing through the prarie he had seen an anamal that precisely resembled the burrowing squrril, accept in point of size, it being only about one third as large as the squirrel, and that it also burrows. I have observed in many parts of the plains and praries, the work of an anamal of which I could never obtain a view. their work resembles that of the salamander common to the sand hills of the States of South Carolina and Georgia, and like that anamal also it never appears above the ground. the little hillocks which are thrown up by these anamals have much the appearance of ten or twelve pounds of loose earth poared out of a vessel on the surface of the plain. in the state they leave them you can discover no whole through which they throw out this earth; but by removing the loose earth gently you may discover that the soil has been broken in a circle manner for about an inch and a half in diameter; where it appears looser than the adjacent surface, and is certainly the place through which the earth has been thrown out, tho' the operation is performed without leaving any visible aperture. the Bluffs of the river which we passed today were upwards of a hundred feet high, formed of a mixture of yellow clay and sand— many horizontal stratas of carbonated wood, having every appearance of pitcoal at a distance; were seen in the the face of these bluffs. these stratas are of unequal thicknesses from 1 to 5 feet, and appear at different elivations above the water some of them as much as eighty feet.2 2 The so-called "coal" near Fort Mandan was lignite, extensive beds of which exist in that region.—Ed. the hills of the river are very broken, and many of them have the apearance of having been on fire at some former period. considerable quantities of pumice stone and lava appear in many parts of these hills where they are broken and washed Down by the rain and melting snow. when we halted for dinner the squaw busied herself in serching for the wild artichokes which the mice1 1 Probably gophers; Coues thinks that the burrowing animal just described by Lewis is the pouched rat or pocket-gopher (either Geomys or Thomomys).—Ed. collect and deposit in large hoards. this operation she performed by penetrating the earth with a sharp stick about some small collections of drift wood. her labour soon proved successful, and she procured a good quantity of these roots. the flavor of this root resembles that of the Jerusalem Artichoke, and the stalk of the weed which produces it is also similar, tho' both the root and stalk are much smaller than the Jerusalem Artichoke. the root is white and of an ovate form, from one to three inches in length and usually about the size of a man's finger. one stalk produces from two to four, and somitimes six of these roots. at the distance of 6 miles passed a large wintering or hunting camp of the Minetares on the Stard side. these lodges about thirty in number are built of earth and timber in their usual stile. 2 1/4 miles higher we passed the entrance of Miry Creek, which discharges itself on the Stard side. this creek is but small,—takes it's rise in some small lakes near the Mouse river and passes in it's course to the Missouri, through beatifull, level, and fertile plains, intirely destitute of timber. Three miles above the mouth of this creek we passed a hunting camp of Minetares who had prepared a park and were wating the return of the Antelope; which usually pass the Missouri at this season of the year from the Black hills on the South side, to the open plains on the north side of the river; in like manner the Antelope repasses the Missouri from N. to South in the latter end of Autumn, and winter in the black hills, where there is considerable bodies of woodland. we proceed on 11 1/2 miles further and encamped on the N. side in a most beatifull high extensive open bottom.2 2 Not far above the present Fort Stevenson.—Ed.

I saw a Musquetor to day great numbers of Brant flying up the river, the Maple, &amp; Elm has buded &amp; cotton and arrow wood beginning to bud. I saw in the prarie an animal resembling the Prarie dog or Barking Squirel &amp; burrow in the same way, this animal was about 1/3 as large as the barking Squirel.

Set out at an early hour this morning, at the distance of three miles passed some Minetares who had assembled themselves on the Lard [larboard] shore to take a view of our little fleet. Capt Clark walked on shore to-day, for several hours, when he returned he informed me that he had seen a gang of Antelopes in the plains but was unable to get a shoot at them, he also saw some geese and swan. the geese are now feeding in considerable numbers on the young grass which has sprung up in the bottom praries. the Musquetoes were very troublesome to us to-day. The country on both sides of the missouri from the tops of the river hills, is one continued level fertile plain as far as the eye can reach, in which there is not even a solitary tree or shrub to be seen, except such as from their moist situations or the steep declivities of hills are sheltered from the ravages of the fire. at the distance of 12 miles from our encampment of last night we arrived at the lower point of a bluff on the Lard side; about 1 1/2 miles down this bluff from this point, the bluff is now on fire and throws out considerable quantities of smoke which has a strong sulphurious smell. the appearance of the coal in the blufs continues as yesterday.1 1 This region "is the fringe of the well-known mauvaises terres ['Bad Lands'] to the south, through the heart of which the Little Missouri flows. . . . The country is underlaid with vast beds of lignite coal, which has burned out over wide areas. . . . Coal veins form lines plainly distinguishable in the hills bordering the river, and . . . some of these veins are [even now] burning, and emit sulphurous odors." —Olin D. Wheeler. at 1. P.M. we overtook three french hunters who had set out a few days before us with a view of traping beaver; they had taken 12 since they left Fort Mandan. these people avail themselves of the protection which our numbers will enable us to give them against the Assinniboins who sometimes hunt on the Missouri; and intend ascending with us as far as the mouth of the Yellow stone river and continue there hunt up that river. this is the first essay of a beaver hunter of any discription on this river. the beaver these people have already taken is by far the best I have ever seen. the river bottoms we have passed to-day are wider and possess more timber than usual. the courant of the Missouri is but moderate, at least not greater than that of the Ohio in high tide; it's banks are falling in but little; the navigation is therefore comparitively with it's lower portion easy and safe. we encamped this evening on a willow point, Stard. side just above a remarkable bend in the river to the S.W. which we called the little bason.2 2 Not far from the site of Fort Berthold, built by the American Fur Company in 1845.

Set out at an early hour; I proceeded with the party and Capt. Clark with George Drewyer walked on shore in order to procure some fresh meat if possible. we proceeded on abot five miles, and halted for breakfast, when Capt. Clark and Drewyer joined us; the latter had killed, and brought with him a deer, which was at this moment excep[t]able, as we had had no fresh meat for several days. the country from fort Mandan to this place is so constantly hunted by the Minetaries that there is but little game. we halted at two P.M. and made a comfortable dinner on a venison stake and beavers tales with the bisquit which got wet on the 8th. inst. by the accident of the canoe filling with water before mentioned. the powder which got wet by the same accedent, and which we had spread to dry on the baggage of the large perogue, was now examined and put up; it appears to be almost restored, and our loss is therefore not so great as we had at first apprehended. the country much the same as yesterday. on the sides of the hills and even the banks of the rivers and sandbars, there is a white substance t[h]at appears in considerable quantities on the surface of the earth, which tastes like a mixture of common salt and glauber salts. many of the springs which flow from the base of the river hills are so strongly impregnated with this substance that the water is extreemly unpleasant to the taste and has a purgative effect.1 1 The famous "alkali" of the West, often rendering the water undrinkable, and covering great areas like snow. It consists largely or mainly of sulphate of soda.—ED. saw some large white cranes pass up the river —these are the largest bird of that genus common to the country through which the Missouri and Mississippi pass. they are perfectly white except the large feathers of the two first joints of the wing which are black. we encamped this evening on the Stard. shore just above the point of woodland which formed to extremity of the last course of this day. there is a high bluff opposite to us, under which we saw some Indians, but the river is here so wide that we could not speake to them; suppose them to be a hunting party of Minetares. we killed two gees to-day.

Set out at an early hour. our peroge and the Canoes passed over to the Lard side, in order to avoid a bank which was rappidly falling in on the Stard.. the red perogue contrary to my expectation or wish passed under this bank by means of her toe line; where I expected to have seen her carried under every instant. I did not discover that she was about to make this attempt untill it was too late for the men to reembark, and retreating is more dangerous than proceeding in such cases; they therefore continued their passage up this bank, and much to my satisfaction arrived safe above it. this cost me some moments of uneasiness, her cargo was of much importance to us in our present advanced situation. We proceeded on six miles and came too on the lower side of the entrance of the little Missouri on the Lard shore in a fine plain where we determined to spend the day for the purpose of celestial observation. we sent out 10 hunters to procure some fresh meat. at this place made the following observations.

George Drewyer shot a Beaver this morning, which we found swiming in the river a small distance below the entrance of the little Missouri. the beaver being seen in the day, is a proof that they have been but little hunted, as they always keep themselves closly concealed during the day where they are so. found a great quantity of small onions in the plain where we encamped; had some of them collected and cooked, found them agreeable. the bulb grows single, is of an oval form, white, and about the size of a small bullet; the leaf resem[bles] that of the shive, and the hunters returned this ev[en]ing with one deer only. the country about the mouth of this river had been recently hunted by the Minetares, and the little game which they had not killed and frightened away, was so extreemly shy that the hunters could not get in shoot of them. The little Missouri disembogues on the S. side of the Missouri 1693 miles from the confluence of the latter with the Mississippi, it is 134 yards wide at it's mouth, and sets in with a bould current but it's greatest debth is not more than 2 1/2 feet. it's navigation is extreemly difficult, owing to it's rapidity, shoals and sand bars it may however be navigated with small canoes a considerable distance. this river passes through the Nothern extremity of the black hills where it is very narrow and rapid and it's banks high an[d] perpendicular. it takes it's rise in a broken country West of the Black hills with the waters of the yellow stone river, and a considerable distance S.W. of the point at which it passes the black hills. the country through which it passes is generally broken and the highlands possess but little timber. there is some timber in it's bottom lands, which consists of Cottonwood red Elm, with a small proportion of small Ash and box alder. the under brush is willow, red wood, (sometimes called red or swamp willow1 1 This is not a willow, but a cornel (Cornus stolonifera); its bark is used in the preparation of kinnikinick. —Ed. ) the red burry, and Choke cherry the country is extreamly broken about the mouth of this river, and as far up on both sides, as we could observe it from the tops of some elivated hills, which stand betwen these two rivers, about 3 miles from their junction. the soil appears fertile and deep, it consists generally of a dark rich loam intermixed with a small proportion of fine sand. this river in it's course passes near the N.W. side of the turtle mountain, which is said to be no more than 4 or 5 leagues distant from it's entrance in a straight direction, a little to the S. of West. this mountain and the knife river have therefore been laid down too far S.W. the colour of the water, the bed of the river, and it's appearance in every respect, resembles the Missouri; I am therefore induced to believe that the texture of the soil of the country in which it takes it's rise, and that through which it passes, is similar to the country through which the Missouri passes after leaving the woody country, or such as we are now in. on the side of a hill not distant from our camp I found some of the dwarf cedar of which I preserved a specimen (See N° 2.) this plant spreads it's limbs alonge the surface of the earth, where they are sometimes covered, and always put forth a number of roots on the under side, while on the upper there are a great number of small shoots which with their leaves seldom rise higher than 6 or eight inches. they grow so close as perfectly to conceal the ea[r]th. it is an evergreen; the leaf is much more delicate than the common Cedar, and it's taste and smell the same. I have often thought that this plant would make very handsome edgings to the borders and walks of a garden; it is quite as handsom as box, and would be much more easily propegated. the appearance of the glauber salts and Carbonated wood still continue. Cou[r]se and distance of this day was. N. 80°. W. to the entrance of the little Missouri—4m1/2 [Clark:] 12th April Friday 1805 a fine morning Set out verry early. the murcury stood 56° above 0. proceeded on to the mouth of the Little Missouri river and formed a camp in a butifull elivated plain on the lower side for the purpose of takeing Some observations to fix the Latitude &amp; Longitude of this river. this river falls in on the L. Side and is 134 yards wide and 2 feet 6 Inches deep at the mouth, it takes its rise in the N W extremity of the black mountains, and [runs] through a broken countrey in its whole course washing the N W base of the Turtle Mountain which is Situated about 6 Leagues S W of its mouth, one of our men Baptiest who came down this river in a canoe informs me that it is not navagable, he was 45 days descending. One of out men Shot a beaver swimming below the mouth of this river. I walked out on the lower Side of this river and found the countrey hilley the soil composed of black mole &amp; a small perportion of sand containing great quantity of Small peable some limestone, black flint, &amp; sand Stone I killed a Hare changeing its colour some parts retaining its long white fur &amp; other parts assumeing the short grey, I saw the Magpie in pars, flocks of Grouse. the old field lark &amp; crows, &amp; observed the leaf of the wild chery half grown, many flowers are to be seen in the plains, remains of Minetarra &amp; Ossinneboin hunting camps are to be seen on each side of the two Missouris The wind blew verry hard from the S. all the after part of the day, at 3 oClock PM. it became violent &amp; blowey accompanied with thunder and a little rain. We examined our canoes &amp;c found Several men which had already commenced cutting our bags of corn &amp; parched meal, the water of the little Missouri is of the same texture colour &amp; quallity of that of the Big Missouri the after part of the day so cloudy that we lost the evening observation. Course &amp; Distance of the 12th. N. 80°. W. 4 1/2 miles to the mouth of the Little Missouri River on the S.S. [Lewis:] Saturday April 13th.. Being disappointed in my observations of yesterday for Longitude, I was unwilling to remain at the entrance of the river another day for that purpose, and therefore determined to set out early this morning; which we did accordingly; the wind was in our favour after 9 A.M. and continued favourable untill three 3. P. M. we therefore hoisted both the sails in the White Perogue, consisting of a small squar sail, and spritsail, which carried her at a pretty good gate, untill about 2 in the afternoon when a suddon squall of wind struck us and turned the perogue so much on the side as to allarm Sharbono who was steering at the time, in this state of alarm he threw the perogue with her side to the wind, when the spritsail gibing was as near overseting the perogue as it was possible to have missed. the wind however abating for an instant I ordered Drewyer to the helm and the sails to be taken in, which was instant[ly] executed and the perogue being steered before the wind was agin plased in a state of security. this accedent was very near costing us dearly. beleiving this vessell to be the most steady and safe, we had embarked on board of it our instruments, Papers, medicine and the most valuable part of the merchandize which we had still in reserve as presents for the Indians. we had also embarked on board ourselves, with three men who could not swim and the squaw with the young child, all of whom, had the perogue overset, would most probably have perished, as the waves were high, and the perogue upwards of 200 yards from the nearest shore; however we fortunately escaped and pursued our journey under the square sail, which shortly after the accident I directed to be again hoisted. our party caught three beaver last evening; and the French hunters 7. as there was much appearance of beaver just above the entrance of the little Missouri these hunters concluded to remain some days, we therefore left them without the expectation of seeing them again. just above the entrance of the little Missouri the great Missouri is upwards of a mile in width, tho' immediately at the entrance of the former it is not more than 200 yards wide and so shallow that the canoes passed it with seting poles. at the distance of nine miles passed the mouth of a creek on the Stard. side which we called onion creek from the quantity of wild onions which grow in the plains on it's borders. Capt. Clark who was on shore informed me that this creek was 16 yards wide a mile &amp; a half above it's entrance, discharges more water than creeks of it's size usually do in this open country, and that there was not a stick of timber of any discription to be seen on it's borders, or the level plain country through which it passes. at the distance of 10 Miles further we passed the mouth of a large creek, discharging itself in the center of a deep bend. of this creek and the neighbouring country, Capt. Clark who was on shore gave me the following discription. "This creek I took to be a small river from it's size, and the quantity of water which it discharged; I ascended it 1 1/2 miles, and found it the discharge of a pond or small lake, which had the appearance of having formerly been the bed of the Missouri. several small streams discharge themselves into this lake. the country on both sides consists of beautifull level and elivated plains; asscending as they recede from the Missouri; there were a great number of Swan and gees in this lake and near it's borders I saw the remains of 43, temperary Indian lodges, which I presume were those of the Assinniboins who are now in the neighbourhood of the British establishments on the Assinniboin river" This lake and it's discharge we call goos Egg from the circumstance of Capt. Clark shooting a goose while on her nest in the top of a lofty cotton wood tree, from which we afterwards took one egg. the wild gees frequently build their nests in this manner, at least we have already found several in trees, nor have we as yet seen any on the ground, or sand bars where I had supposed from previous information that they most commonly deposited their eggs. saw some Buffaloe and Elk at a distance to-day but killed none of them. we found a number of carcases of the Buffaloe lying along shore, which had been drowned by falling through the ice in winter and lodged on shore by the high water when the river broke up about the first of this month. we saw also many tracks of the white bear of enormous size, along the river shore and about the carcases of the Buffaloe, on which I presume they feed. we have not as yet seen one of these anamals, tho' their tracks are so abundant and recent. the men as well as ourselves are anxious to meet with some of these bear. the Indians give a very formidable account of the streng[t]h and ferocity of this anamal, which they never dare to attack but in parties of six eight or ten persons; and are even then frequently defeated with the loss of one or more of their party. the savages attack this anamal with their bows and arrows and the indifferent guns with which the traders furnish them, with these they shoot with such uncertainty and at so short a distance, that (unless shot thro' head or heart wound not mortal) they frequently mis their aim &amp; fall a sacrefice to the bear. two Minetaries were killed during the last winter in an attack on a white bear. this anamall is said more frequently to attack a man on meeting with him, than to flee from him. When the Indians are about to go in quest of the white bear, previous to their departure, they paint themselves and perform all those supersticious rights commonly observed when they are about to make war uppon a neighbouring nation. O[b]served more bald eagles on this part of the Missouri than we have previously seen. saw the small hawk, frequently called the sparrow hawk, which is common to most parts of the U. States. great quantities of gees are seen feeding in the praries. saw a large flock of white brant or gees with black wings pass up the river; there were a number of gray brant with them; from their flight I presume they proceed much further still to the N.W. we have never been enabled yet to shoot one of these birds, and cannot therefore determine whether the gray brant found with the white, are their brude of the last year or whether they are the same with the grey brant common to the Mississippi and lower part of the Missouri. we killed 2 antelopes to-day which we found swiming from the S. to the N. side of the river; they were very poor. We encamped this evening on the Stard. shore in a beautifull plain, elivated about 30 feet above the river. The courses and distances of this day are as follow. miles.

Cought 3 beaver this morning, at 9 miles passed the mouth of a Creek on the S.S. on the banks of which there is an imense quantity of wild onions or garlick, I was up this Creek 1/2 a m[ile] and could not See one Stick of timber of any kind on its borders, this creek is 16 yds wide 1/2 a mile up it and discharges more water than is common for Creeks of its Size. at about 10 miles higher we pass a creek about 30 yards wide in a deep bend to the N W. This creek I took to be a Small river from its size &amp; the quantity of water which it discharged, I assended it 1 1/2 miles and found it the discharge of a pond or Small Lake which has appearance of haveing been once the bead of the river. Some small streams discharge themselves into this Lake. the countery on both sides is butifull elevated plains assending in Some parts to a great distance near the aforesaid Lake (what we call Goose egg L from a circumstance of my shooting a goose on her neast on some sticks in the top of a high cotton wood tree in which there was one egg) We saw 8 buffalow at a distance which were verry wild, I saw near the Lake the remains of 43 lodges, which has latterly been abandoned I suppose them to have been Ossinniboins and now near the british establishments on the Ossinniboin River tradeing. we camped on the S.S. in a butifull Plain. I observe more bald Eagles on this part of the Missouri than usial also a small Hawk Killed 2 Antelopes in the river to day. Course distance &amp;c. the 13th. of April 1805 N. 18°.

[Lewis:] Sunday April 14th 1805. One of the hunters saw an Otter last evening and shot at it, but missed it. a dog came to us this morning, which we supposed to have been lost by the Indians who were recently encamped near the lake that we passed yesterday. the mineral appearances of salts, coal and sulphur, together with birnt hills &amp; pumice stone still continue. while we remained at the entrance of the little Missouri, we saw several pieces of pumice stone floating down that stream, a considerable quant[it]y of which had lodged against a point of drift wood a little above it's entrance. Capt. Clark walked on shore this morning, and on his return informed me that he had passed through the timbered bottoms on the N. side of the river, and had extended his walk several miles back on the hills; in the bottom lands he had met with several uninhabited Indian lodges built with the boughs of the Elm, and in the plains he met with the remains of two large encampments of a recent date, which from the appearance of some hoops of small kegs, seen near them we concluded that they must have been the camps of the Assinniboins, as no other nation who visit this part of the missouri ever indulge themselves with spirituous liquor. of this article the Assinniboins are pationately fond, and we are informed that it, forms their principal inducement to furnish the British establishments on the Assinniboin river with the dryed and pounded meat and grease which they do. they also supply those establishments with a small quantity of fur, consisting principally of the large and small wolves and the small fox1 1 The kit fox (Vulpes velox).—Ed. skins. these they barter for small kegs of rum which they generally transport to their camps at a distance from the establishments, where they revel with their friends and relations as long as they possess the means of intoxication, their women and children are equally indulged on those occations and are all seen drunk together. so far is a state of intoxication from being a cause of reproach among them, that with the men, it is a matter of exultation that their skill and industry as hunters has enabled them to get drunk frequently. in their customs, habits and dispositions these people very much resemble the Siouxs from whom they have descended. The principal inducement with the British fur companies, for continuing their establishments on the Assinniboin river, is the Buffaloe meat and grease they procure from the Assinniboins, and Christanoes, by means of which, they are enabled to supply provision to their engages on their return from rainy Lake to the English river and the Athabaskey country where they winter; without such resource those voyagers would frequently be straitened for provision, as the country through which they pass is but scantily supplyed with game, and the rappidity with which they are compelled to travel in order to reach their winter stations, would leave them but little leasure to surch for food while on their voyage. The Assinniboins have so recently left this neighbourhood, that the game is scarce and very shy. the river continues wide, and not more rapid than the Ohio in an averge state of it's current. the bottoms are wide and low, the moister parts containing some timber; the upland is extreemly broken, chonsisting of high gaulded nobs as far as the eye can reach on ether side, and entirely destitute of timber. on these hills many aromatic herbs are seen; resembling in taste, smel and appearance, the sage, hysop, wormwood, southernwood,1 1 Probably the common sage-brush (Artemisia tridentata), which Lewis is comparing to all these garden herbs which he names. The identity of the two other plants is not plain.—Ed. and two other herbs which are strangers to me; the one resembling the camphor in taste and smell, rising to the hight of 2 or 3 feet; the other about the same size, has a long, narrow, smo[o]th, soft leaf of an agreeable smel and flavor; of this last the A[n]telope is very fond; they feed on it, and perfume the hair of their foreheads and necks with it by rubing against it. the dwarf cedar and juniper is also found in great abundance on the sides of these hills. where the land is level, it is uniformly fertile consisting of a dark loam intermixed with a proportion of fine sand. it is generally covered with a short grass resembling very much the blue grass. the miniral appearances still continue; considerable quantities of bitumenous water, about the colour of strong lye trickles down the sides of the hills; this water partakes of the taste of glauber salts and slightly of allumn. while the party halted to take dinner today Capt. Clark killed a buffaloe bull; it was meagre, and we therefore took the marrow bones and a small proportion of the meat only. near the place we dined, on the Lard. side, there was a large village of burrowing squirrels. I have remarked that these anamals generally celect a South Easterly exposure for their residence, tho' they are sometimes found in the level plains. passed an Island, above which two small creeks fall in on Lard. side; the upper creek largest, which we called Sharbono's Creek, after our interpreter who encamped several weeks on it with a hunting party of Indians. this was the highest point to which any whiteman had ever ascended except two Frenchmen (one of whom Lapage was now with us. See at Mandan) who having lost their way had straggled a few miles further, tho' to what place precisely I could not learn.1 1 Lewis and Clark here distinctly state that they have now passed beyond the highest point on the Missouri heretofore explored by white men. Chaboneau had been as far as the creek named for him (probably Indian Creek of to-day), and Lepage, another recruit from the Mandan towns, had, with one other Frenchman, gone a few miles farther; but beyond that they were entering virgin territory. This is important, for it shows that the quest for furs had not yet been pushed appreciably west of the Mandan villages by the British fur companies. —O. D. Wheeler. I walked on shore above this creek and killed an Elk, which was so poor that it was unfit for uce; I therefore left it, and joined the party at their encampment on the Stard. shore a little after dark. on my arrival Capt. Clark informed me that he had seen two white bear pass over the hills shortly after I fired, and that they appeared to run nearly from the place where I shot. the lard. shore on which I walked was very broken, and the hills in many places had the appearance of having sliped down in masses of several acres of land in surface. we saw many gees feeding on the tender grass in the praries and several of their nests in the trees; we have not in a single instance found the nest of this bird on or near the ground. we saw a number of Magpies their nests and eggs. their nests are built in trees and composed of small sticks leaves and grass, open at top, and much in the stile of the large blackbird comm to the U.'States. the egg is of a bluish brown colour, freckled with redish brown spots. one of the party killed a large hooting owl; I observed no difference between this bird and those of the same family common to the U.'States, except that this appeared to be more booted and more thickly clad with feathers.

I saw the remains of two Indian incampmints with wide beeten tracks leading to them. those were no doubt the camps of the Ossinnaboin Indians (a Strong evidence is hoops of Small Kegs were found in the incampments) no other nation on the river above the Sioux make use of Spiritious licquer. The Ossinniboins is said to be pasionately fond of Licquer, and is the principal inducement to their putting themselves to the trouble of catching the fiew wolves and foxes which they furnish, and receive their [liquor] always in small Kegs. The Ossinniboins make use of the Same kind of Lodges which the Sioux and other Indians on this river make use of. Those lodges or tents are made of a number of dressed buffalow Skins sowed together with sinews &amp; deckerated with the tales, &amp; Porcupine quils, when open it forms a half circle with a part about 4 Inches wide projecting about 8 or 9 Inches from the center of the Streight Side for the purpose of attaching it to a pole to it the hight they wish to raise the tent, when the[y] errect this tent four poles of equal length are tied near one end, those poles are elevated and 8, 10 or 12 other poles are anexed forming a circle at the ground and lodging in the forks of the four attached poles, the tents are then raised, by attaching the projecting part to a pole and incumpassing the poles with the tent by bringing the two ends together and attached with a cord, on land as high as is necessary, leaveing the lower part open for about 4 feet for to pass in &amp; out, and the top is generally left open to admit the smoke to pass. The Borders of the river has been so much hunted by those Indians who must have left it about 8 or 10 days past and I prosume are now in the neighbourhood of British establishments on the Ossinniboin; the game is scerce and verry wild. The River continues wide and the current jentle not more rapid than the current of the Ohio in middle State. The bottoms are wide and low and the moist parts of them contain Som wood such as cotton Elm &amp; small ash, willow rose bushes &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp; next to the hills Great quantity of wild Isoop, [hyssop] the hills are high broken in every direction, and the mineral appearance of Salts continue to appear in a greater perportion, also Sulpher, coal &amp; bitumous water in a smaller quantity, I have observed but five burnt hills, about the little Missouri, and I have not seen any Pumey stone above that River I saw Buffalow on the L.S. crossed and dureing the time of dinner killed a Bull, which was pore, we made use of the best of it, I saw a village of Burrowing dogs on the L. S. passed a Island above which two small creeks falls in on the L.S. the upper of which is the largest and we call Shabonas Creek after our interpreter who incamped several weeks on this creek and is the highest point on the Missouri to which a white man has been previous to this time. Capt. Lewis walked out above this creek and killed an Elk which he found so meager that it was not fit for use, and joined the boat at Dusk at our camp on the S.S. opposit a high hill several parts of which had sliped down. on the side of those hills we Saw two white bear running from the report of Capt. Lewis Shot, those animals assended those Steep hills with supprising ease &amp; verlocity, they were too far to discover their prosise colour &amp; size.

Set out at an early hour this morning. I walked on shore, and Capt. Clark continued with the party it being an invariable rule with us not to be both absent from our vessels at the same time. I passed through the bottoms of the river on the Stard. side. they were partially covered with timber, were extensive, level and beatifull. in my walk which was about 6 miles I passed a small rivulet of clear water making down from the hills, which on tasting, I discovered to be in a small degree brackish. it possessed less of the glauber salt, or alumn, than those little streams from the hills usually do. in a little pond of water fromed by this rivulet where it entered the bottom, I heard the frogs crying for the first time this season; their note was the same with that of the small frogs which are common to the lagoons and swam[p]s of the U. States. I saw great quantities of gees feeding in the bottoms, of which I shot one. saw some deer and Elk, but they were remarkably shy. I also met with great numbers of Grouse or prarie hens as they are called by the English traders of the N.W. these birds appeared to be mating; the note of the male, is kuck, kuck, kuck, coo, coo, coo. the first part of the note both male and female use when flying. the male also dubbs (drums with his wings) something like the pheasant, but by no means as loud. After breakfast Capt. Clark walked on the Std. shore, and on his return in the evening gave me the following account of his ramble. "I assended to the high country, about 9 miles distant from the Missouri. the country consists of beatifull, level and fertile plains, destitute of timber. I saw many little dranes, which took their rise in the river hills, from whence as far as I could see they run to the N. E." these streams we suppose to be the waters of Mous river a branch of the Assinniboin which the Indians informed us approaches the Missouri very nearly, about this point. "I passed," continued he, a Creek about 20 yards wide, which falls into the Missouri; the bottoms of this creek are wide level and extreemly fertile, but almost entirely destitute of timber. the water of this creek as well as all those creeks and rivulets which we have passed since we left Fort Mandan was so strongly impregnated with salts and other miniral substances that I was incapable of drinking it. I saw the remains of several camps of the Assinniboins; near one of which in a small ravene, there was a park which they had formed of timber and brush, for the purpose of taking the cabrie1 1 A common name for the American antelope; corrupted from Spanish cabra, "goat."—Ed. or Antelope. it was constructed in the following manner. a strong pound was first made of timbers, on one side of which there was a small apparture, sufficiently large to admit an Antelope; from each side of this apparture, a curtain was extended to a considerable distance, widening as they receded from the pound." we passed a rock this evening standing in the middle of the river, and the bed of the river was formed principally of gravel. we encamped this evening on a sand point on Lard. side. a little above our encampment the river was confined to a channel of 80 yards in width.

S. and off from the Missouri about three miles the countrey is butifull open fertile plain the dreans [drains] take theer rise near the clifts of the river and run from the river in a N E derection as far as I could See, this is the part of the River which Mouse river the waters of Lake Winnipec approaches within a fiew miles of Missouri, and I believe those dreans lead into that river. we passed a creek about 20 yds. wide on the S. S. the bottoms of this creek is extensive &amp; fertile, the water of this as also, all the Streams which head a fiew miles in the hills discharge water which is black &amp; unfit for use (and can safely say that I have not seen one drop of water fit for use above fort Mandan except Knife and the little Missouris Rivers and the Missouri, the other Streams being so much impregnated with mineral as to be verry disagreeble in its present state. I saw the remains of Several camps of ossinniboins, near one of those camps &amp; at no great distance from the mouth of the aforesaid creek, in a hollow, I saw a large Strong pen made for the purpose of catching the antelope, with wings projecting from it widining from the pen. Saw several gangs of Buffalow and som elk at a distance, a black bear seen from the Perogues to day. passed a rock in the Middle of the river, some smaller rocks from that to the L.

Clark walked on shore this morning, and killed an Antelope, rejoined us at 1/2 after eight A.M. he informed me that he had seen many Buffaloe Elk and deer in his absence, and that he had met with a great number of old hornets nests in the woody bottoms through which he had passed. the hills of the river still continue extreemly broken for a few miles back, when it becomes a fine level country of open fertile lands. immediately on the river there are many fine leavel extensive and extreemly fertile high plains and meadows. I think the quantity of timbered land on the river is increasing. the mineral appearances still continue. I met with several stones today that had the appearance of wood first carbonated and then petrefyed by the water of the river, which I have discovered has that effect on many vegitable substances when exposed to it's influence for a length of time. I believe it to be the stratas of coal seen in those hills which causes the fire and birnt appearances frequently met with in this quarter. where those birnt appearances are to be seen in the face of the river bluffs, the coal is seldom seen, and when you meet with it in the neighbourhood of the stratas of birnt earth, the coal appears to be presisely at the same hight, and is nearly of the same thickness, togeter with the sand and a sulphurious substance which ususually accompanys it. there was a remarkable large beaver caught by one of the party last night. these anamals are now very abundant. I have met with several trees which have been felled by them 20 Inches in diameter. bark is their only food; and they appear to prefer that of the Cotton wood and willow; as we have never met with any other species of timber on the Missouri which had the appearance of being cut by them. we passed three small creeks on the Stard. side. they take their rise in the river hills at no great distance. we saw a great number of geese today, both in the plains and on the river I have observed but few ducks, those we have met with are the Mallard and blue winged Teal.

A delightfull morning, set out at an erly hour. the country th[r]ough which we passed to day was much the same as that discribed of yesterday; there wase more appearance of birnt hills, furnishing large quanties of lava and pumice stone; of the latter some pieces were seen floating down the river. Capt. Clark walked on shore this morning on the Stard. side, and did not join us untill half after six in the evening. he informed me that he had seen the remains of the Assinniboin encampments in every point of woodland through which he had passed. we saw immence quantities of game in every direction around us as we passed up the river; consisting of herds of Buffaloe, Elk, and Antelopes with some deer and woolves. tho' we continue to see many tracks of the bear we have seen but very few of them, and those are at a great distance generally runing from us; I the[re]fore presume that they are extreemly wary and shy; the Indian account of them dose not corrispond with our experience so far. one black bear passed near the perogues on the 16th. and was seen by myself and the party but he so quickly disappeared that we did not shoot at him. at the place we halted to dine on the Lard. side we met with a herd of buffaloe of which I killed the fatest as I concieved among them, however on examining it I found it so poar that I thought it unfit for uce and only took the tongue; the party killed another which was still more lean. just before we encamped this evening we saw some tracks of Indians who had passed about 24 hours; they left four rafts of tim[ber] on the Stard. side, on which they had passed. we supposed them to have been a party of the Assinniboins who had been to war against the rocky Mountain Indians, and then on their return. Capt. Clark saw a Curlou to-day. there were three beaver taken this morning by the party. the men prefer the flesh of this anamal, to that of any other which we have, or are able to procure at this moment. I eat very heartily of the beaver myself, and think it excellent; particularly the tale, and liver we had a fair wind today which enabled us to sail the greater part of the distance we have travled, encamped on the Lard. shore the extremity of the last course.

[Lewis:] Thursday April 18th 1805. A fine morning, set out at an early hour. one Beaver caught this morning by two traps, having a foot in each; the traps belonged to different individuals, between whom, a contest ensued, which would have terminated, most probably, in a serious rencounter had not our timely arrival at the place prevented it. after breakfast this morning, Capt. Clark walked on Stad. shore. while the party were assending by means of their toe lines, I walked with them on the bank; found a species of pea hearing a yellow flower, and now in blume; it seldom rises more than 6 inches high, the leaf &amp; stalk resembles that of the common gardin pea, the root is perenial. (see specimen of vegitables No. 3.) I also saw several parsels of buffaloe's hair hanging on the rose bushes, which had been bleached by exposure to the weather and became perfectly white, it [had] every appearance of the wool of the sheep, tho' much finer and more silkey and soft. I am confident that an excellent cloth may be made of the wool of the Buffaloe. the Buffaloe I killed yesterday had cast his long hare, and the poil which remained was very thick, fine, and about 2 inches in length. I think this anamal would have furnished about five pounds of wool.1 1 When Jolliet first encountered the buffalo, he observed the possibility of using its wool—"with the wool of these oxen he could make cloth, much finer than most of that which we bring from France." Marest says that the Illinois made from this hair various articles, as leggings, girdles, and pouches. See Jes. Relations, lviii, p. 107; lxvi, p. 231. Catlin recommends (N. Amer. Inds., i, p. 263) the utilization of the buffalo's hair for woollen manufactures.—Ed. we were detained to-day from one to five P. M. in consequence of the wind which blew so violently from N. that it was with difficulty we could keep the canoes from filling with water altho' they were along shore; I had them secured by placing the perogues on the out side of them in such manner as to break the waves off them. at 5 we proceed, and shortly after met with Capt. Clark, who had killed an Elk and a deer and was wating our arrival. we took the meat on board and continued our march until nearly dark when we came too on the Stard. side under a boald well-timbered bank which sheltered us from the wind which had abated but not yet ceased. here we encamped, it being the extremity of the last course of this day.

See "Scientific Data: Botany," in vol. vi, post.—Ed. it seldom rises higher then 3 feet. the wind detained us through the couse of this day, tho' we were fortunate in having placed ourselves in a safe harbour, the party killed one Elk and a beaver today. The beaver of this part of the Missouri are larger, fatter, more abundant and better clad with fur than those of any other part of the country that I have yet seen; I have remarked also that their fur is much darker.

The wind continued to blow tolerably hard this morning but by no means as violently as it did yesterday; we determined to set out and accordingly departed a little before seven. I walked on shore on the N. side of the river, and Capt Clark proceeded with the party. the river bottoms through which I passed about seven miles were fertil and well covered with Cottonwood some Boxalder, ash and red Elm. the under brush, willow, rose bushes Honeysuccles, red willow, goosbury, currant and servicebury &amp; in the open grounds along the foot of the river hills immence quantities of the hisop.1 1 In the MS. occurs here a red-ink interlineation (cancelled, however, by another pen), "copy this for Dr. Barton."

The latter failed to do this; and the often elaborate observations of Lewis and Clark on the fauna, flora, and silva of the Great West have therefore been hitherto practically lost to the scientific world.—Ed. in the course of my walk I killed two deer, wounded an Elk and a deer; saw the remains of some Indian hunting camps, near which stood a small scaffold of about 7 feet high on which were deposited two doog slays with their harnis. underneath this scaffold a human body was lying, well rolled in several dressed buffaloe skins and near it a bag of the same materials conta[in]ing sundry articles belonging to the disceased; consisting of a pare of mockersons, some red and blue earth, beaver's nails, instruments for dressing the Buffalo skin, some dryed roots, several platts of the sweet grass, and a small quantity of Mandan tobacco. I presume that the body, as well as the bag containing these articles, had formerly been placed on the scaffold as is the custom of these people, but had fallen down by accedent. near the scaffold I saw the carcase of a large dog not yet decayed, which I supposed had been killed at the time the human body was left on the scaffold; this was no doubt the reward, which the poor doog had met with for performing the [blank space in MS.] friendly office to his mistres of transporting her corps to the place of deposit, it is customary with the Assinniboins, Mandans, Minetares &amp;c who scaffold their dead, to sacrefice the favorite horses and doggs of their disceased relations, with a view of their being servicable to them in the land of sperits. I have never heard of any instances of human sacrefices on those occasions among them. The wind blew so hard that I concluded it was impossible for the perogues and canoes to proceed and therefore returned and joined them about three in the evening. Capt. Clark informed me that soon after seting out, a part of the bank of the river fell in near one of the canoes and had very nearly filled her with water, that the wind became so hard and the waves so high that it was with infinite risk he had been able to get as far as his present station, the white perogue and several of the canoes had shiped water several times but happily our stores were but little injured; those which were wet we put out to dry and determined to remain untill the next morning, we sent out four hunters who soon added 3 Elk 4 gees and 2 deer to our stock of provisions. the party caught six beaver today which were large and in fine order. the Buffaloe, Elk and deer are poor at this season, and of cours are not very palitable, however our good health and apetites make up every necessary deficiency, and we eat very heartily of them. encamped on Stard side; under a high well timbered bank.

Set out at an early hour this morning. Capt Clark walked on shore; the wind tho' a head was not violent, the country through which we passed is very simelar in every respect to that through which we have passed for several days. We saw immence herds of buffaloe Elk deer &amp; Antelopes. Capt. Clark killed a buffaloe and 4 deer in the course of his walk today; and the party with me killed 3 deer, 2 beaver, and 4 buffaloe calves. the latter we found very delicious. I think it equal to any veal I ever tasted. the Elk now begin to shed their horns. passed one large and two small creeks on the Lard. side, tho' neither of them discharge any water at present. the wind blew so hard this evening that we were obliged to halt several hours, we reached the place of incampment after dark, which was on the Lard. side a little above White earth river which discharges itself on the Stard. side. immediately at the mouth of this river it is not more then 10 yards wide being choked up by the mud of the Missouri; tho' after leaving the bottom lands of this river, or even sooner, it becomes a boald stream of sixty yards wide and is deep and navigable. the course of this river as far as I could see from the top of Cut bluff, was due North. it passes through a beatifull level and fertile vally about five miles in width. I think I saw about 25 miles up this river, and did not discover one tree or bush of any discription on it's borders. the vally was covered with Elk and buffaloe, saw a great number of gees today as usual, also some swan and ducks.

Set out at an early hour this morning; proceeded pretty well untill breakfa[s]t, when the wind became so hard a head that we proceeded with difficulty even with the assistance of our toe lines. the party halted and Cpt. Clark and myself walked to the white earth river which approaches the Missouri very near at this place, being about 4 miles above it's entrance, we found that it contained more water than streams of it's size generally do at this season. the water is much clearer than that of the Missouri. the banks of the river are steep and not more than ten or twelve feet high; the bed seems to be composed of mud altogether, the salts which have been before mentioned as common on the Missouri, appears in great quantities along the banks of this river, which are in many places so thickly covered with it that they appear perfectly white. perhaps it has been from this white appearance of it's banks that the river has derived it's name. this river is said to be navigable nearly to it's source, which is at no great distance from the Saskashawan, and I think from it's size the direction which it seems to take, and the latitude of it's mouth, that there is very good ground to believe that it extends as far North as latitude 50°1 1 White Earth River rises in the Coteau du Missouri, near the 49th parallel.—Ed. . this stream passes through an open country generally. the broken hills of the Missouri about this place exhibit large irregular and broken masses of rocks and stones; some of which tho' 200 feet above the level of the water seem at some former period to have felt it's influence, for they appear smoth as if woarn by the agetation of the water. this collection consists of white &amp; grey gannite, a brittle black rock, flint, limestone, freestone, some small specimens of an excellent pebble and occasionally broken stratas of a stone which appears to be petrefyed wood; it is of a black colour, and makes excellent whetstones. Coal or carbonated wood pumice stone lava and other mineral apearances still continue, the coal appears to be of better quality; I exposed a specimen of it to the fire and found that it birnt tolerably well, it afforded but little flame or smoke, but produced a hot and lasting fire. I asscended to the top of the cutt bluff this morning, from whence I had a most delightfull view of the country, the whole of which except the vally formed by the Missouri is void of timber or underbrush, exposing to the first glance of the spectator immence herds of Buffaloe, Elk, deer, &amp; Antelopes feeding in one common and boundless pasture, we saw a number of bever feeding on the bark of the trees alonge the verge of the river, several of which we shot, found them large and fat. walking on shore this evening I met with a buffaloe calf which attatched itself to me and continued to follow close at my heels untill I embarked and left it.2 2 Catlin mentions (N. Amer. Inds., i, 255, 256) the docile and affectionate disposition of the buffalo calf; he was able to lure to his camp a dozen of them, who were successfully fed on the milk of a domestic cow. He succeeded in transporting one of these to the Chouteau farm near St. Louis, where it throve well.—Ed. it appeared allarmed at my dog which was probably the cause of it's so readily attatching itself to me. Capt Clark informed me that he saw a large drove of buffaloe pursued by wolves today, that they at length caught a calf which was unable to keep up with the herd. the cows only defend their young so long as they are able to keep up with the herd, and seldom return any distance in surch of them.

Capt. Lewis &amp; my self walked to the River which is near the Missouri four miles above its mouth, this river is 60 yards wide and contains a greater perportion of water at this time than is common for Rivers of its size it appears navagable as fur as any of the party was, and I am told to near its source in morrasses in the open Plains, it passes (as far as we can see which is 6 or 7 Leagus) thro' a butifull extinsive vallee, rich &amp; fertile and at this time covered with Buffalow, Elk &amp; antelopes, which may be Seen also in any other direction in this quarter, this river must take its rise at no great distance East of the Saskashawan, and no doubt as far N. as Latd. 50°.

Set out at an early hour this morning, about nine A.M. the wind arose, and shortly after became so violent that we were unabled to proceed, in short it was with much difficulty and some risk that I was enabled to get the canoes and perogues into a place of tolerable safety, there being no timber on either side of the river at this place, some of the canoes shiped water, and wet several parsels of their lading, which I directed to be opened and aired. we remained untill five in the evening when the wind abating in some measure, we reloaded, and proceeded, shortly after we were joined by Capt. Clark who had walked on shore this morning, and passing through the bottom lands had fallen on the river some miles above, and concluding that the wind had detained us, came down the river in surch of us. he had killed three black-taled, or mule deer, and a buffaloe Calf, in the course of his ramble, these hard winds, being so frequently repeated, become a serious source of detention to us. incamped on the Stard. side.1 1 This was above Painted Wood Creek.—Ed.

The wind blew so hard during the whole of this day, that we were unable to move, notwithstanding that we were sheltered by high timber from the effects of the wind, such was it's violence that it caused the waves to rise in such manner as to wet many articles in the small canoes before they could be unloaded, we sent out some hunters who killed 4 deer &amp; 2 Elk, and caught some young wolves of the small kind. Soar eyes is a common complaint among the party. I believe it origenates from the immence quantities of sand which is driven by the wind from the sandbars of the river in such clouds that you are unable to discover the opposite bank of the river in many instances, the particles of this sand are so fine and light that they are easily supported by the air, and are carried by the wind for many miles, and at a distance exhibiting every appearance of a collumn of thick smoke. so penitrating is this sand that we cannot keep any article free from it; in short we are compelled to eat, drink, and breath it very freely. my pocket watch, is out of order, she will run only a few minutes without stoping. I can discover no radical defect in her works, and must therefore attribute it to the sand, with which, she seems plentifully charged, notwithstanding her cases are double and tight. [Clark:] 24th of April Wednesday 1805 The wind rose last night and continued blowing from the N. &amp; N W. and sometimes with great violence, untill 7 oClock P.M, Several articles wet in the Perogues by their takeing water &amp;c. as the wind was a head we could not move to day Sent out hunters, they killed 4 Deer 2 Elk &amp; cought some young wolves of the small kind, The party complain much of the Sand in their eyes, The sand is verry fine and rises in clouds from the Points and bars of the river, I may say that dureing those winds we eat Drink &amp; breeth a preportion of sand. [Lewis:] Thursday April 25th. 1805. The wind was more moderate this morning, tho' still hard; we set out at an early hour.1 1 I remarked, as a singular circumstance, that there is no dew in this country, and very little rain. Can it be owing to the want of timber?—Gass (p. 114). the water friezed on the oars this morning as the men rowed, about 10 oclock A.M. the wind began to blow so violently that we were obliged to lye too. my dog had been absent during the last night, and I was fearfull we had lost him altogether, however, much to my satisfaction he joined us at 8 oclock this morning. The wind had been so unfavorable to our progress for several days past, and seeing but little prospect of a favourable chang; knowing that the river was crooked, from the report of the hunters who were out yesterday, and beleiving that we were at no very great distance from the Yellow stone River; I determined, in order as much as possible to avoid detention, to proceed by land with a few men to the entrance of that river and make the necessary observations to determine it's position, which I hoped to effect by the time that Capt. Clark could arrive with the party; accordingly I set out at 11 OCk. side, accompanyed by four men, we proceeded about four miles, when falling in with some buffaloe I killed a yearling calf, which was in good order; we soon cooked and made a hearty meal of a part of it, and renewed our march. our rout lay along the foot of the river hills. when we had proceeded about four miles, I ascended the hills from whence I had a most pleasing view of the country, particularly of the wide and fertile vallies formed by the missouri and the yellowstone rivers, which occasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders disclose their meanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull tracts of country. I could not discover the junction of the rivers immediately, they being concealed by the wood; however, sensible that it could not be distant I determined to encamp on the bank of the Yellow stone river which made it's appearance about 2 miles South of me. the whol face of the country was covered with herds of Buffaloe, Elk &amp; Antelopes; deer are also abundant, but keep themselves more concealed in the woodland. the buffaloe Elk and Antelope are so gentle that we pass near them while feeding, without apearing to excite any alarm among them; and when we attract their attention, they frequently approach us more nearly to discover what we are, and in some instances pursue us a considerable distance apparenly with that view. in our way to the place I had determined to encamp, we met with two large herds of buffaloe, of which we killed three cows and a calf. two of the former, wer but lean, we therefore took their tongues and a part of their marrow-bones only. I then proceeded to the place of our encampment with two of the men, taking with us the Calf and marrowbones, while the other two remained, with orders to dress the cow that was in tolerable order, and hang the meat out of the reach of the wolves, a precaution indispensible to it's safe keeping, even for a night. we encamped on the bank of the yellow stone river, 2 miles South of it's confluence with the Missouri. On rejoining Capt. Clark, the 26th. in the evening, he informed me, that at 5. P.M. after I left him the wind abated in some measure and he proceeded a few miles further and encamped.

Lewis concluded to go by land as far as the Rochejhone or yellow Stone river, which we expect is at no great distance by land and make Some Selestial observations to find the situation of its mouth, and by that measure not detain the Perogues at that place any time for the purpose of makeing those necessary observations he took 4 men &amp; proceeded on up the Missouri on the L.

This morning I dispatched Joseph Fields up the yellow-stone river with orders to examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; two others were directed to bring in the meat we had killed last evening, while I proceeded down the river with one man in order to take a view of the confluence of this great river with the Missouri, which we found to be two miles distant on a direct line N.W. from our encampment, the bottom land on the lower side of the yellowstone river near it's mouth, for about one mile in width appears to be subject to inundation; while that on the opposite side of the Missouri and the point formed by the junction of these rivers is of the common elivation, say from twelve to 18 feet above the level of the water, and of course not liable to be overflown except in extreem high water, which dose not appear to be very frequent, there is more timber in the neighbourhood of the junction of these rivers, and on the Missouri as far below as the White-earth river, than there is on any part of the Missouri above the entrance of the Chyenne river to this place. the timber consists principally of Cottonwood, with some small elm, ash and boxalder. the under growth on the sandbars and verge of the river is the small leafed willow; the low bottoms, rose bushes which rise to three or four fe[e]t high, the redburry, servicebury, and the redwood; the high bottoms are of two discriptions, either timbered or open; the first lies next to the river and it's under brush is the same with that of the low timbered bottoms with the addition of the broad leafed willow, Goosbury, choke cherry, purple currant, and honeysuckle bushis; the open bottoms border on the hills, and are covered in many parts by the wild hyssop which rises to the hight of two feet. I observe that the Antelope, Buffaloe Elk and deer feed on this herb; the willow of the sandbars also furnish a favorite winter food to these anamals as well as the growse, the porcupine, hare, and rabbit. about 12 O[c]lock I heard the discharge of several guns at the junction of the rivers, which announced to me the arrival of the pa[r]ty with Capt Clark; I afterwards learnt that they had fired on some buffaloe which they met with at that place, and of which they killed a cow and several Calves; the latter are now fine veal. I dispatched one of the men to Capt Clark requesting him to send up a canoe to take down the meat we had killed and our baggage to his encampnt, which was accordingly complyed with. after I had completed my observations in the evening I walked down and joined the party at their encampment on the point of land formed by the junction of the rivers; found them all in good health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for spot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which seemed to pervade our little community, we ordered a dram to be issued to each person; this soon produced the fiddle, and they spent the evening with much hilarity, singing &amp; dancing, and seemed as perfectly to forget their past toils, as they appeared regardless of those to come. in the evening, the man I had sent up the river this morning returned, and reported that he had ascended it about eight miles on a streight line; that he found it crooked, meandering from side to side of the valley formed by it; which is from four to five miles wide. the corrent of the river gentle, and it's bed much interrupted and broken by sandbars; at the distance of five miles he passed a large Island well covered with timber, and three miles higher a large creek falls in on the S.E. side above a high bluff in which there are several stratas of coal, the country bordering on this river as far as he could percieve, like that of the Missouri, consisted of open plains. he saw several of the bighorned anamals in the cou[r]se of his walk; but they were so shy that he could not get a shoot at them; he found a large horn of one of these anamals which he brought with him. the bed of the yellowstone river is entirely composed of sand and mud, not a stone of any kind to be seen in it near it's entrance. Capt Clark measured these rivers just above their confluence; found the bed of the Missouri 520 yards wide, the water occupying 330. it's channel deep. the yellowstone river including it's sandbar, 858 yds. of which, the water occupyed 297 yards; the depest part 12 feet; it was falling at this time &amp; appeard to be nearly at it's summer tide. the Indians inform that the yellowstone river is navigable for perogues and canoes nearly to it's source in the Rocky Mountains, and that in it's course near these mountains it passes within less than half a day's march of a navigable part of the Missouri. it's extreem sources are adjacent to those of the Missouri. river platte, and I think probably with some of the South branch of the Columbia river.1 1 The name Yellowstone is simply the English of the French name Roche Jaune, itself without doubt translated from an earlier Indian appellation. Chittenden thinks that this name originated from the yellow color of the rocks which form the walls of the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone; see his Yellowstone National Park (Cincinnati, 1895), pp. 1–7. The name Yellowstone appears to have been first recorded (1798) by David Thompson, the British explorer.—Ed. the first part of its course lies through a mountanous rocky country tho' well timbered and in many parts fertile; the middle, and much the most extensive portion of the river lies through a delightfull rich and fertile country, well covered with timber, intersperced with plains and meadows, and well watered; it is some what broken in many parts. the lower portion consists of fertile open plains and meadows almost entirely, tho' it possesses a considerable proportion of timber on it's borders. the current of the upper portion is extreemly rappid, that of the middle and lower portions much more gentle than the Missouri. the water of this river is turbid, tho' dose not possess as much sediment as that of the Missouri. this river in it's course recieves the waters of many large tributary str[e]ams principally from the S.E. of which the most considerable are the Tongue and bighorn rivers (&amp; Clark's fork) the former is much the largest, (rather the smallest—next in size Clarkes fork, and the Big horn the largest by much.) and heads with the river Platte and Bighorn river, as dose the latter with the Tongue river and the river Platte. a suficient quantity of limestone may be readily procured for building near the junction of the Missouri and yellowstone rivers. I could observe no regular stratas of it, tho' it lies on the sides of the river hills in large irregular masses, in considerable quantities; it is of a light colour, and appears to be of an excellent quality.

The clay of the bluffs appear much whiter than below, and contain several Stratums of coal, on the hill sides I observe pebbles of different size &amp; colour. The river has been riseing for several days, &amp; raised 3 inches last night, at 12 oClock arrived at the forks of the Roche Johne &amp; Missouri and formed a camp on the point. Soon after George Drewyer came from Capt Lewis &amp; informed me that he was a little way up the Rochejohne and would join me this evining, I sent a canoe up to Capt Lewis and proceeded [to] measure the width of the [river], and find the debth. The Missouri is 520 yards wide above the point of Yellow Stone and the water covers 330 yards, the YellowStone River is 858 yards wide includeing its sand bar, the water covers 297 yards and the deepest part is 12 feet water, it is at this time falling, the Missouri rising The Indians inform that the Yellow Stone River is navagable for Perogues to near its source in the Rocky Mountains, it has many tributary streams, principally on the S.E. side, and heads at no great distance from the Missouri, the largest rivers which fall into it is Tongue river which heads with the waters of River Platt, and Bighorn river which also heads with Platt &amp; Tongue R the current of this river is said to be rapid near its mouth it is verry jentle, and its water is of a whitish colour much clearer of Sediment than the Missouri, the Countrey on this river is said to be broken in its whole course &amp; contains a great deel of wood, the countrey about its mouth is verry fine, the bottoms on either side is wooded with Cotton wood, ash, Elm, &amp;c. near the banks of the river back is higher bottoms and covered with red berry, Goose berry &amp; rose bushes &amp;. interspersed with small open Glades, and near the high land is Generally open rich bottoms. at our arrival at the forks I observed a Drove of Buffalow Cows &amp; Calves on a sand bar in the point, I directed the men to kill the fattest Cox, and 3 or 4 calves, which they did and let the others pass, the cows are poor, calves fine veele.

Altitude by Sextant 49. 56. 30. This morning I walked through the point formed by the junction of the rivers; the woodland extends about a mile, when the rivers approach each other within less than half a mile; here a beatifull level low plain commences and extends up both rivers for many miles, widening as the rivers recede from each other, and extending back half a mile to a plain about 12 feet higher than itself; the low plain appears to be a few inches higher than high water mark and of course will not be liable to be overflown; tho' where it joins the high plain a part of the Missouri when at it's greatest hight, passes through a channel of 60 or 70 yards wide and falls into the yellowstone river. on the Missouri about 2 1/2 miles from the entrance of the yellowstone river, and between this high and low plain, a small lake is situated about 200 yards wide extending along the edge of the high plain parallel with the Missouri about one mile. on the point of the high plain at the lower extremity of this lake I think would be the most eligible site for an establishment between this low plain and the Yellow stone river their is an extensive body of timbered land extending up the river for many miles. this site recommended is about 400 yards distant from the Missouri and about double that distance from the river yellow stone; from it the high plain, rising very gradually, extends back about three miles to the hills, and continues with the same width between these hills and the timbered land on the yellowstone river, up that stream, for seven or eight miles; and is one of the ha[n]dsomest plains I ever beheld. on the Missouri side the hills sircumscribe it's width, &amp; at the distance of three miles up that river from this cite, it is not more than 400 yards wide. Capt Clark thinks that the lower extremity of the low plane would be most eligible for this establishment; it is true that it is much nearer both rivers, and might answer very well, but I think it reather too low to venture a permanent establishment, particularly if built of brick or other durable materials, at any considerable expence; for so capricious, and versatile are these rivers, that it is difficult to say how long it will be, untill they direct the force of their currents against this narrow part of the low plain, which when they do, must shortly yeald to their influence; in such case a few years only would be necessary, for the annihilation of the plain, and with it the fortification.1 1 A conclusion justified by the notable changes which have occurred during the century past, in the courses of these rivers at their confluence.—Ed. I continued my walk on shore; at 11. A. M. the wind became very hard from N.W. insomuch that the perogues and canoes were unable either to proceede or pass the river to me; I was under the necessity therefore of shooting a goose and cooking it for my dinner, the wind abated about 4. P.M. and the party proceeded tho' I could not conveniently join them untill night, altho' game is very abundant and gentle, we only kill as much as is necessary for food. I believe that two good hunters could conveniently supply a regiment with provisions, for several days past we have observed a great number of buffaloe lying dead on the shore, some of them entire and others partly devoured by the wolves and bear, those anamals either drownded during the winter in attempting to pass the river on the ice during the winter or by swiming acr[o]ss at present to bluff banks which they are unable to ascend, and feeling themselves too weak to return remain and perish for the want of food; in this situation we met with several little parties of them, beaver are very abundant, the party kill several of them every day. The Eagles, Magpies, and gees have their nests in trees adjacent to each other; the magpy particularly appears fond of building near the Eagle, as we scarcely see an Eagle's nest unaccompanyed with two or three Magpies nests within a short distance. The bald Eagle are more abundant here than I ever observed them in any part of the country. Courses and distances 27th. April 1805. Miles N . 9°.

SET out this morning at an early hour; the wind was favourable and we employed our sails to advantage. Capt Clark walked on shore this morning, and I proceeded with the party. the country through which we passed today is open as usual and very broken on both sides near the river hills, the bottoms are level fertile and partially covered with timber. the hills and bluffs exhibit their usual mineral appearances, some birnt hills but no appearance of Pumicestone; coal is in great abundance and the salts still increase in quantity; the banks of the river and sandbars are incrusted with it in many places and appear perfectly white as if covered with snow or frost. the woods are now green, tho' the plains and meadows appear to abate of the verdure those below exhibited some days past. we past three small runs today, two falling in on the Stard. and one on the Lard. side, they are but small afford but little water and head a few miles back in the hills. we saw great quantities of game today; consisting of the common and mule deer, Elk, Buffaloe, and Antelopes; also four brown bear, one of which was fired on and wounded by one of the party but we did not get it; the beaver have cut great quantities of timber; saw a tree nearly 3 feet in diameter that had been felled by them.

Set out this morning at the usual hour; the wind was moderate; I walked on shore with one man, about 8. A.M. we fell in with two brown or yellow [white] bear; both of which we wounded; one of them made his escape, the other after my firing on him pursued me seventy or eighty yards, but fortunately had been so badly wounded that he was unable to pursue so closely as to prevent my charging my gun; we again repeated our fir[e] and killed him. it was a male not fully grown, we estimated his weight at 300 lbs. not having the means of ascertaining it precisely. The legs of this bear are somewhat longer than those of the black, as are it's tallons and tusks incomparably larger and longer, the testicles, which in the black bear are placed pretty well back between the thyes and contained in one pouch like those of the dog and most quadrupeds, are in the yellow or brown bear placed much further forward, and are suspended in separate pouches from two to four inches asunder; it's colour is yellowish brown, the eyes small, black, and piercing; the front of the fore legs near the feet is usually black; the fur is finer thicker and deeper than that of the black bear, these are all the particulars in which this anamal appeared to me to differ from the black bear;1 1 By "white bear," here and elsewhere in Lewis and Clark's journals, must not be understood the white or polar bear of Arctic regions, but the animal now known as "grizzly bear" (Ursus horribilis), first adequately described by our explorers. It was technically named in 1815.—Ed. it is a much more furious and formidable anamal, and will frequently pursue the hunter when wounded, it is asstonishing to see the wounds they will bear before they can be put to death. the Indians may well fear this anamal equiped as they generally are with their bows and arrows or indifferent fuzees, but in the hands of skillfull riflemen they are by no means as formidable or dangerous as they have been represented.2 2 As no wound except through the head or heart is mortal, they frequently fall a sacrifice if they miss their aim. He rather attacks than avoids a man, and such is the terror which he has inspired, that the Indians who go in quest of him paint themselves and perform all the superstitious rites customary when they make war on a neighboring nation.—Biddle (i, p. 200). game is still very abundant we can scarcely cast our eyes in any direction without percieving deer Elk Buffaloe or Antelopes. The quantity of wolves appear to increase in the same proportion; they generally hunt in parties of six eight or ten; they kill a great number of the Antelopes at this season; the Antelopes are yet meagre and the females are big with young; the wolves take them most generally in attempting to swim the river; in this manner my dog caught one drowned it and brought it on shore; they are but clumsey swimers, tho' on land when in good order, they are extreemly fleet and dureable, we have frequently seen the wolves in pursuit of the Antelope in the plains; they appear to decoy a single one from a flock, and then pursue it, alturnately relieving each other untill they take it, on joining Capt Clark he informed me that he had seen a female and faun of the bighorned anamal; that they ran for some distance with great aparent ease along the side of the river bluff where it was almost perpendicular; two of the party fired on them while in motion without effect. we took the flesh of the bear on board and proceeded. Capt. Clark walked on shore this evening, killed. a deer, and saw several of the bighorned anamals. there is more appearance of coal today than we have yet seen, the stratas are 6 feet thick in some instances; the earth has been birnt in many places, and always appears in stratas on the same level with the stratas of coal. we came too this evening in the mouth of a little river, which falls in on the Stard. side, this stream is about 50 yards wide from bank to bank; the water occupyes about 15 yards. the banks are of earth only, abrupt, tho' not high—the bed, is of mud principally. Capt Clark, who was up this streeam about three miles, informed me that it continued about the same width, that it's current was gentle and it appeared navigable for perogues it meanders through an extensive, fertile, and beautifull vally as far as could bee seen about N. 30° W. there was but one solitary tree to be seen on the banks of this river after it left the bottom of the Missouri. the water of this river is clear, with a brownish yelow tint. here the highlands receede from the Missouri, leaving the vally formed by the river from seven to eight miles wide, and reather lower then usual. This stream my friend Capt. C. named Marthas river.1 1 In the MS. here follows a line afterward crossed out, "in honour of Miss M.," followed by another initial which cannot be deciphered—but in Clark's entry, post, we read, "in honor to the Selebrated M.

Capt. Lewis &amp; one man walkd on shore and he killed a yellow Bear &amp; the man with him wounded one other, after getting the flesh of the bear on bord which was not far from the place we brackfast, we proceeded on Saw 4 gangus of buffalow and great numbers of antelopes in every direction also saw Elk and several wolves, I walked on Shore in the evening &amp; killed a Deer which was so meager as to be unfit for use. The hills contain more coal, and has a greater appearance of being burnt that [than] below, the burnt parts appear on a parrilel with the stratiums of coal, we came too in the mouth of a Little river on the S.S. which is about 50 or 60 yards from banks to bank, I was up this Stream 3 miles it continues its width and glides with a gentle current, its water is about 15 yards wide at this time, and appears to be navagable for canoes &amp;c. it meanders through a butifull &amp; extencive vallie as far as can be Seen about N 30° W. I saw only a single tree in this fertile vallie The water of the River is clear of a yellowish colour, we call this river Martheys river in honor to the Selebrated M.F. Here the high land widen from five to Eight miles and much lower than below. Saw several of the big horn animals this evening. The Wolves distroy great numbers of the antilopes by decoying those animals singularly out in the plains and prosueing them alternetly, those antelopes are curious and will approach any thing which appears in motion near them &amp;c.

Set out at sunrise. the wind blew hard all last night, and continued to blow pretty hard all day, but not so much, as to compell us to ly by. the country as usual is bare of timber; the river bottoms are level and fertile and extensive, but possess but little timber and that of an indifferent quality even of it's kind; principally low cottonwood, either too small for building, or for plank, or broken and dead at top and unsound in the center of the trunk. saw great quantities of game as usual. Capt. Clark walked on shore the greater part of the day, the Interpreter, Charbono and his Indian woman attended him. past some old Indian lodges built of drift wood; they appear to be of antient date and not recently inhabited. I walked on shore this evening and killed a buck Elk, in tolerable order; it appeared to me to be the largest I had seen, and was therefore induced to measure it; found it five feet three inches from the point of the hoof, to the top of the sholders; the leg and hoof being placed as nearly as possible in the same position they would have been had the anamal been standing.

I walked on Shore to day our interpreter &amp; his squar followed, in my walk the squar found &amp; brought me a bush something like the currunt, which she said bore a delicious froot and that great quantitis grew on the Rocky Mountains. This shrub was in bloom has a yellow flower with a deep cup, the froot when ripe is yellow and hangs in bunches like cheries, Some of those berries yet remained on the bushes. The bottoms above the mouth of the last river is extencive level &amp; fertile and covered with indifferent timber in the points, the upland appear to rise gradually, I saw Great numbers of antelopes, also scattering Buffalow, Elk, Deer, wolves, Gees, ducks &amp; Crows.

Set out this morning at an early [hour], the wind being favourable we used our sales which carried us on at a good pace untill about 12 OCk. when the wind became so high that the small canoes were unable to proceed one of them which seperated from us just befor the wind became so violent, is now lying on the opposite side of the river, being unable to rejoin us in consequence of the waves, which during those gusts run several feet high. we came too on the Lard. shore in a handsome bottom well stocked with cottonwood timber; here the wind compelled us to spend the ballance of the day. we sent out some hunters who killed a buffaloe, an Elk, a goat and two beaver. game is now abundant. the country appears much more pleasant and fertile than that we have passed for several days; the hills are lower, the bottoms wider, and better stocked with timber, which consists principally of cottonwood, not however of large size; the under-growth willow on the verge of the river and sandbars, rose bushes, red willow and the broad leafed willow in the bottom lands; the high country on either side of the river is one vast plain, intirely destitute of timber, but is apparently fertile, consisting of a dark rich mellow looking lome. John Shields sick today with the rheumatism. Shannon killed a bird of the plover kind. weight one pound. it measured from the tip of the toe, to the extremity of the beak, 1. foot 10. Inches; from tip to tip of wings when extended 2 F. 5 I.; Beak 3 5/8 inches; tale 3 1/8 inches; leg and toe 10 Ins. the eye black, piercing, prominent and moderately large. the legs are flat thin, slightly imbricated and of a pale sky blue colour, being covered with feathers as far as the mustle extends down it, which is about half of it's length. it has four toes on each foot, three of which, are connected by a web, the fourth is small and placed at the heel about the 1/8 of an inch up the leg. the nails are black and short, that of the middle toe is extreemly singular, consisting of two nails the one laping on or overlaying the other, the upper one somewhat the longest and sharpest. the tale contains eleven feathers of equal length, &amp; of a bluish white colour. the boddy and underside of the wings, except the large feathers of the 1st. &amp; 2nd. joints of the same, are white, as are also the feathers of the upper part of the 4th. joint of the wing and part of those of the 3rd. adjacent thereto. the large feathers of the 1st or pinion and the 2nd. joint are black; a part of the larger feathers of the 3rd. joint on the upper side and all the small feathers which cover the upper part of the wings are black, as are also the tuft of long feathers on each side of the body above the joining of the wing, leaving however a stripe of white between them on the back. the head and neck are shaped much like the grey plover, and are of a light brickdust brown; the beak is black and flat, largest where it joins the head, and from thence becoming thiner and tapering to a very sharp point, the upper chap being 1/8 of an inch the longest turns down at the point and forms a little hook. the nostrils, which commence near the head are long, narrow, connected and paraellel with the beak; the beak is much curved, the curvature being upwards in stead of downwards as is common with most birds; the substance of the beak precisely resembles whalebone at a little distance, and is quite as flexable as that substance. their note resembles that of the grey plover, tho' is reather louder and more varied, their habits appear also to be the same, with this difference; that it sometimes rests on the water and swims which I do not recollect having seen the plover do. this bird which I shall henceforth stile the Missouri plover, generally feeds about the shallow bars of the river, to collect it's food which consists of [blank space in MS.], it immerces it's beak in the water and throws it's head and beak from side to side at every step it takes.1 1 The avocet (Recurvirostra Americana).—Ed. .

The wind continued violent all night nor did it abate much of it's violence this morning, when at daylight it was attended with snow which continued to fall untill about 10 A.M. being about one inch deep, it formed a singular contrast with the vegitation which was considerably advanced. some flowers had put forth in the plains, and the leaves of the cottonwood were as large as a dollar. sent out some hunters who killed 2 deer 3 Elk and several buffaloe; on our way this evening we also shot three beaver along the shore; these anamals in consequence of not being hunted are extreemly gentle, where they are hunted they never leave their lodges in the day, the flesh of the beaver is esteemed a delecacy among us; I think the tale a most delicious morsal, when boiled it resembles in flavor the fresh tongues and sounds of the codfish, and is usually sufficiently large to afford a plentifull meal for two men. Joseph Fields one of the hunters who was out today found several yards of scarlet cloth which had been suspended on the bough of a tree near an old indian hunting cam[p], where it had been left as a sacrefice to the deity by the indians, probably of the Assinniboin nation, it being a custom with them as well as all the nations inhabiting the waters of the Missouri so far as they are known to us, to offer or sacrefice in this manner to the deity wat-ever they may be possessed off which they think most acceptable to him, and very honestly making their own feelings the test of those of the deity offer him the article which they most prize themselves. this being the most usual method of we[r]shiping the great sperit as they term the deity, is practiced on interesting occasions, or to produce the happy eventuation of the important occurrances incident to human nature, such as relief from hungar or mallady, protection from their enemies or the delivering them into their hands, and with such as cultivate, to prevent the river's overflowing and distroying their crops &amp;c. s[a]crefices of a similar kind are also made to the deceased by their friends and relatives. the are was very piercing this evening the [water] friezed on the oars as they rowed. the wind dying at 5.P.M. we set out.

The morning being very could we did not set out as early as usual; ice formed on a kettle of water 1/4 of an inch thick. the snow has melted generally in the bottoms, but the hills still remain covered. on the lard side at the distance of 2 miles we passed a curious collection of bushes which had been tyed up in the form of a faciene [fascine—Ed.] and standing on end in the open bottom it appeared to be about 30 feet high and ten or twelve feet in diameter, this we supposed to have been placed there by the Indians, as a sacrefice for some purpose. The wind continued to blow hard from the West but not so strong as to compel us to ly by. Capt Clark walked on shore and killed an Elk which he caused to be butch[er]ed by the time I arrived with the party, here we halted and dined being about 12 OCk. our usual time of halting for that purpose. after dinner Capt. Clark pursued his walk, while I continued with the party, it being a rule which we had established, never to be absent at the same time from the party. the plains or high lands are much less elivated than they were, not being more than from 50 to 60 feet above the river bottom, which is also wider than usual being from 5 to 9 Ms in width; traces of the ancient beds of the river are visible in many places through the whole extent of this valley. since the hills have become lower the appearance of the stratas of coal burnt hills and pumice stone have in a great measure ceased; I saw none today. we saw vast quantities of Buffaloe, Elk, deer principally of the long tale kind, Antelope or goats, beaver, geese, ducks, brant and some swan. near the entrance of the river mentioned in the 10th course of this day, we saw an unusual number of Porcupines from which we determined to call the river after that anamal, and accordingly denominated it Porcupine river.1 1 Now Poplar River; the name Porcupine is in our day applied to a branch of Milk River.— Ed. this stream discharges itself into the Missouri on the Stard. side 2000 miles above the mouth of the latter, it is a beatifull bold runing stream, 40 yards wide at it's entrance; the water is transparent, it being the first of this discription that I have yet seen discharge itself into the Missouri; before it enters a large sand bar through which it discharges itself into the missouri it's banks and bottom are formed of a stiff blue and black clay; it appears to be navigable for canoes and perogues at this time and I have no doubt but it might be navigated with boats of a considerable size in high water. it's banks appear to be from 8 to ten feet high and seldom overflow; from the quantity of water furnished by this river, the appearance of the country, the direction it pursues, and the situation of it's entrance, I have but little doubt but it takes it's source not far from the main body of the Suskashawan river, and that it is probably navigable 150 Miles; perhaps not very distant from that river. should this be the case, it would afford a very favorable communication to the Athebaskay country, from whence the British N.W. Company derive so large a portion of their valuable furs. Capt. Clark who ascended this river several 'miles and passed it above where it entered the hills informed me on his return that he found the general width of the bed of the river about one hundred yards, where he passed the river the bed was 112 yards wide, the water was knee deep and 38 yard in width; the river which he could observe from the rising grounds for about 20 miles, bore a little to the East of North. there was a considerable portion of timber in the bottom lands of this river. Capt Clark also met with limestone on the surface of the earth in the course of his walk. he also saw a range of low mountains at a distance to the W of N, their direction being N.W. the country in the neighbo[rhood] of this river, and as far as the eye can reach, is level, fertile, open and beatifull beyond discription. 1/4 of a mile above the entrance of this river a large creek falls in which we called 2000 Mile Creek. I sent Rubin Fields to examine it, he reported it to be a bold runing stream, it's bed 30 yards wide. we proceeded about 3 miles above this creek and encamped on the Stard. shore. I walked out a little distance and met with 2 porcupines which were feeding on the young willow which grow in great abundance on all the sandbars; this anamal is exceedingly clumsy and not very watchfull I approached so near one of them before it percieved me that I touched it with my espontoon. found the nest of a wild goose among some driftwood in the river from which we took three eggs. this is the only nest we have met with on driftwood, the usual position is the top of a broken tree, sometimes in the forks of a large tree but almost invariably, from 15 to 20 feet or upwards high.

The snow is all or nearly all off the low bottoms, the Hills are entireley covered; three of our party found in the back of a bottom 3 pieces of scarlet one brace in each, which had been left as a sacrifice near one of their swet houses, on the L.S. we passed to day a curious collection of bushes tied up in the shape of faccene about 10 feet diamuter, which must have been left also by the natives as an offering to their medison which they [are] convinced protected or gave them relief near the place, the wind continued to blow hard from the West, altho not sufficently so to detain us. I walked on shore and killed an Elk &amp; had him bucchered by the time the Perogus came up which was the usial time of dineing. The high lands are low and from 5 to 9 miles apart and there is evident marks of the bead [bed] of the river having been changed frequently but little appearance of the coal &amp; burnt hills to day. Great numbers of Buffalow, Elk, Deer, antilope, beaver, Porcupins, &amp; water fowls seen to day, such as, Geese, ducks of dift. kinds, &amp; a fiew Swan. I continued my walk on shore after dinner, and arrived at the mouth of a river on the St. Side, which appeared to be large, and I concluded to go up this river a few miles to examine it accordingly I set out North 1 mile thro wood or timbered bottom, 2 miles through a butifull leavel plain, and 1 mile over a high plain about 50 feet higher than the bottom, &amp; came to the little river, which I found to be a butifull clear Stream of about 100 yds from bank to bank, (I waded this river at the narrowest part and made it 112 steps from bank to bank and at this place which was a kind of fording place the water was near Knee deep, and 38 steps wide, the bottom of a hard stiff Black clay, I observed a Great perportion of timber in the bottoms of this river as far as I could See which was to the East of N. 18 or 20 miles, it appears to be navagable at this time for canoes, and from appearances must be navagable a long distance for Perogus &amp; boats in high water. This river we call Porcupines from the great number of those anamals found about it's mouth. a Short distance above about 1/4 mile and on the Lard Side a large Creek falls in, which R. Fields went to examine &amp; reports that it is a bold running stream 30 yds wide as this creek is 2000 miles up the Missouri we call it the 2000 mile Creek, we proceeded on 3 miles &amp; camped on the S.S. here I joined Capt Lewis who had in my absence walkd on the upper Side of Porcupine River for some distance. This river from its size &amp; quantity of water must head at no great distance from the Saskashawan on this river I saw emence herds [of] Elk &amp; Buffalow &amp; many deer &amp; Porcupine. I also saw the top of a mountain which did not appear verry high to the West of N. &amp; bore N W. I saw on the high land limestone &amp; pebble.

We were detained this morning untill about 9 OCk. in order to repare the rudder irons of the red perogue which were broken last evening in landing; we then set out, the wind hard against us. I walked on shore this morning, the weather was more plesant, the snow has disappeared; the frost seems to have effected the vegetation much less than could have been expected the leaves of the cottonwood the grass the box alder willow and the yellow flowering pea seem to be scarcely touched; the rosebushes and honeysuckle seem to have sustaned the most considerable injury. The country on both sides of the Missouri continues to be open level fertile and beautifull as far as the eye can reach which from some of the eminences is not short of 30 Miles. the river bottoms are very extensive and contain a much greater proportion of timber than usual; the fore part of this day the river was bordered with timber on both sides, a circumstance which is extreemly rare and the first which has occurred of any thing like the same extent since we left the Mandans. in the after part of the day we passed an extensive beautifull plain on the Stard. side which gradually ascended from the river. I saw immence quantities of buffaloe in every direction, also some Elk deer and goats; having an abundance of meat on hand I passed them without firing on them; they are extreemly gentle the bull buffaloe particularly will scarcely give way to you. I passed several in the open plain within fifty paces, they viewed me for a moment as something novel and then very unconcernedly continued to feed. Capt. Clark walked on shore this evening and did not rejoin us untill after dark, he struck the river several miles above our camp and came down to us. we saw many beaver some [of] which the party shot, we also killed two deer today. much sign of the brown bear. passed several old Indian hunting camps in the course of the day one of them contained two large lodges which were fortifyed with old driftwood and fallen timber; this fortification consisted of a circular fence of timber lade horizontally laping on and over laying each other to the hight of 5 feet. these pounds are sometimes built from 20 to 30 feet in diameter and covered over with the trunks and limbs of old timber. the usual construction of the lodges we have lately passed is as follows. three or more strong sticks the thickness of a man's leg or arm and about 12 feet long are attatched together at one end by a with of small willows, these are then set on end and spread at the base, forming a circle of ten twelve or 14 feet in diameter; sticks of driftwood and fallen timber of convenient size are now placed with one end on the ground and the other resting against those which are secured together at top by the with and which support and give the form to the whole, thus the sticks are laid on untill they make it as thick as they design, usually about three ranges, each piece breaking or filling up the interstice of the two beneath it, the whole forming a connic figure about 10 feet high with a small apperture in one side which answers as a door. leaves bark and straw are sometimes thrown over the work to make it more complete, but at best it affords a very imperfect shelter particularly without straw which is the state in which we have most usually found them.

At noon the sun was so much obscured that I could not obtain his maridian Altitude which I much wished in order to fix the latitude of the entrance of Porcupine river. Joseph Fields was very sick today with the disentary had a high fever I gave him a doze of Glauber salts, which operated very well, in the evening his fever abated and I gave him 30 drops of laudnum. [Clark:] May 4th.. Satturday 1805 The rudder Irons of our large Perogue broke off last night, the replaceing of which detained us this morning untill 9 oClock at which time we set out the wind a head from the west, The countrey on each side of the Missouri is a rich high and butifull the bottoms are extencive with a great deal of timber on them all the fore part of this day the wood land bordered the river on both Sides, in the after part a butifull assending plain on the Std Side we camped on the Std. Side a little above. we passed a Small Creek on the L. Side near which I saw where an Indian lodge had been fortified many year past. Saw great numbers of anamals of different kinds on the banks, I saw the black martin to day. in the evening I walkd on Shore on the Std Side &amp; Struck the river Several miles above our camp &amp; did not get to Camp untill some time after night. we have one man Sick.

The country is as yesterday beatifull in the extreme. saw the carcases of many Buffaloe lying dead along the shore partially devoured by the wolves and bear. saw a great number of white brant also the common brown brant, geese of the common kind and a small species of geese which differ considerably from the common canadian goose;1 1 Of these birds, the small goose described is scientifically known as Bernicla hutchinsi; the Canadian goose is B. canadensis. The brown brant is B. brenta, and the white brant Chen hyperboreus; the last-named bird goes much farther north to breed.—Ed. their neck head and beak are considerably thicker shorter and larger than the other in proportion to it's size, they are also more than a third smaller, and their note more like that of the brant or a young goose which has not perfectly acquired his notes, in all other rispects they are the same in colour habits and the number of feathers in the tale, they frequently also ascociate with the large geese when in flocks, but never saw them pared off with the large or common goose. The white brant ascociate in very large flocks, they do not appear to be mated or pared off as if they intended to raise their young in this quarter, I therefore doubt whether they reside here during the summer for that purpose. this bird is about the size of the common brown brant or two thirds of the common goose, it is not so long by six inches from point to point of the wings when extended as the other; the beak head and neck are also larger and stronger; their beak legs and feet are of a redish or flesh-coloured white. the eye is of moderate size, the puple of a deep sea green incircled with a ring of yellowish brown. it has sixteen feathers of equal length in the tale; their note differs but little from the common brant, their flesh much the same, and in my opinion preferable to the goose, the flesh is dark. they are entirely of a beatifull pure white except the large feathers of the 1st and second joints of the wings which are jut [jet] black. form and habits are the same with the other brants; they sometimes ascociate and form one common flock. Capt Clark found a den of young wolves in the course of his walk today and also saw a great number of those anamals; they are very abundant in this quarter, and are of two species the small woolf or burrowing dog of the praries are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains; they usually ascociate in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game; not being able alone to take a deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands; they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows; in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued; when a person approaches them they frequently bark, their note being precisely that of the small dog. they are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog, very active fleet and delicately formed; the ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox; tale long and bushey; the hair and fur also resembles the fox tho' is much coarser and inferior. they are of a pale redish brown colour. the eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing. their tallons are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the atlantic States, none of which are to be found in this quarter, nor I believe above the river Plat.1 1 A description of the coyote (Canis latrans), followed by that of the common wolf (C. lupus occidentalis). Coues thinks that Lewis is mistaken as to the habitat of the latter: "in some of its varieties, it was found in most parts of North America, though it is now exterminated from settled regions" (L. and C., i, p. 297).—Ed. The large woolf found here is not as large as those of the atlantic states. they are lower and thicker made shorter leged. their colour which is not effected by the seasons, is a grey or blackish brown and every intermediate shade from that to a creen [cream] coloured white; these wolves resort [to] the woodlands and are also found in the plains, but never take refuge in the ground or burrow so far as I have been able to inform myself. we scarcely see a gang of buffaloe without observing a parsel of those faithfull shepherds on their skirts in readiness to take care of the mamed wounded. the large wolf never barks, but howls as those of the atlantic states do. Capt. Clark and Drewyer killed the largest brown bear this evening which we have yet seen. it was a most tremendious looking anamal, and extreemly hard to kill notwithstanding he had five balls through his lungs and five others in various parts he swam more than half the distance acoss the river to a sandbar, &amp; it was at least twenty minutes before he died; he did not attempt to attack, but fled and made the most tremendous roaring from the moment he was shot. We had no means of weighing this monster; Capt. Clark thought he would weigh 500 lbs. for my own part I think the estimate too small by 100 lbs. he measured 8. Feet 7 1/2 Inches from the nose to the extremety of the hind feet, 5 F. 10 1/2 Ins. arround the breast, 1 F. 11. I. arround the middle of the arm, &amp; 3.F. 11.1. arround the neck; his tallons which were five in number on each foot were 4 3/8 Inches in length. he was in good order, we therefore divided him among the party and made them boil the oil and put it in a cask for future uce; the oil is as hard as hogs lard when cool, much more so than that of the black bear. this bear differs from the common black bear in several respects; it's tallons are much longer and more blont, it's tale shorter, it's hair which is of a redish or bey brown, is longer thicker and finer than that of the black bear; his liver lungs and heart are much larger even in proportion with his size; the heart particularly was as large as that of a large Ox. his maw was also ten times the size of black bear, and was filled with flesh and fish. his testicles were pendant from the belly and placed four inches assunder in seperate bags or pouches. this animal also feeds on roots and almost every species of wild fruit. The party killed two Elk and a Buffaloe today, and my dog caught a goat, which he overtook by superior fleetness, the goat it must be understood was with young and extreemly poor. a great number of these goats are devowered by the wolves and bear at this season when they are poor and passing the river from S.W. to N.E. they are very inactive and easily taken in the water, a man can out swim them with great ease; the Indians take them in great numbers in the river at this season and in autumn when they repass to the S.W. Courses and distances of May 5th.. 1805. Mls.

Point of observation No. 9. On the Lard. shore near the fourth course of this day, observed meridian Altitude of the ?s. L. L. with Octant by the back observation to be 68° 47′; the latitude deduced from which is 45° 46′ 5″6. I do think this observation can be depended on as it was reather late before I could commence it, the sun was about to decline or perhaps had declined a few minutes. [Clark:] 5th of May Sunday 1805 We set out verry early and had not proceeded far before the rudder Irons of one of the Perogus broke which detained us a short time Capt Lewis walked on shore this morning and killed a Deer, after brackfast I walked on shore Saw great numbers of Buffalow &amp; Elk Saw also a Den of young wolves, and a number of Grown Wolves in every direction, the white &amp; Grey Brant is in this part of the Missouri I shot at the white brant but at so great a distance I did not kill, The Countrey on both sides is as yesterday handsom &amp; fertile. The river rising &amp; current Strong &amp; in the evening we saw a Brown or Grisley beare on a sand beech, I went out with one man Geo Drewyer &amp; Killed the bear, which was verry large and a turrible looking animal, which we found verry hard to kill we Shot ten Balls into him before we killed him, &amp; 5 of those Balls through his lights. This animal is the largest of the carnivorous kind I ever saw we had nothing that could way him, I think his weight may be stated at 500 pounds, he measured 8 feet 7 1/2 Ins. from his nose to the extremity of the Toe, 5 feet 10 1/2 Ins. arround the breast, 1 feet 11 Ins: around the middle of the arm, 3 feet 11 Ins. arround the neck his tallents was 4 Inches &amp; 3/5 long, he was [in] good order, and appeared verry different from the common black bear in as much as his tallents (talon or nail) were blunt, his tail short, his liver &amp; lights much larger, his maw ten times as large and contained meat or flesh &amp; fish only. we had him skined and divided, the oile tried up &amp; put in Kegs for use. we camped on the Stad Side, our men killed three Elk and a Buffalow to day, and our Dog cought an antilope a fair race, this animal appeared verry pore &amp; with young.
