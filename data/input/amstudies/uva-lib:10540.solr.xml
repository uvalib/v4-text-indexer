MOST of the hunters turned out by light this morning a few others remained without our permission or knoledge untill late in the morning, we chid them severely for their indolence and inattention to the order of last evening. about 8 OCk. Sheilds returned with a small deer on which we breakfasted. by 11 A.M. all our hunters returned, Drewyer and Cruzatte brought each a deer, Collins wounded another which my dog caught at a little distance from the camp. our stock of provision now consisted of 4 deer and the remnant of the horse which we killed at Colter's Creek. Sheilds killed a duck of an uncommon kind. the head beak and wing of which I preserved.1 1 Already mentioned by Lewis, vol. iv, p. 323, ante; the shoveler duck (Spatula clypeata).—Ed. the beak is remarkably wide and obtusely pointed, on it's edges it is furnished with a sceries of teeth very long and fine not unlike the teeth of a comb. the belley is of a brick red, the lower part of the neck white, the upper part or but of the wing is a sky blue, underneath which a narrow stripe of white succeeds marking the wing transversly, the large feathers are of a dark colour. tail short and pointed and consists of 12 dark brown feathers. the back is black and the sides white; legs yellow and feet formed like the Duckinmallard which it also resembles in size and form. the eye is moderately large, puple black and iris of an orrange colour. the colours and appearance of the female is precisely that of the duckinmallard only, reather smaller. we are informed that the natives in this quarter were much distressed for food in the course of the last winter; they were compelled to collect the moss which grows on the pine which they boiled and eat;1 1 A lichen, Alectoria jubata.—C. V. Piper. near this camp I observed many pine trees which appear to have been cut down about that season which they inform us was done in order to collect the seed of the longleafed pine which in those moments of distress also furnishes an article of food; the seed of this speceis of pine is about the size and much the shape of the seed of the large sunflower; they are nutricious and not unpleasent when roasted or boiled, during this month the natives also peal this pine and eat the succulent or inner bark. in the creek near our encampment I observed a falling trap constructed on the same plan with those frequent[ly] seen in the atlantic states for catching the fish decending the stream Capt. C. took several small trout from this trap. Neesh-ne-park-kee-ook and several other indians joined us this morning.2 2 Here some of the natives came to our camp, and informed us, that we could not cross the mountains for a moon and a half; as the Snow was too deep, and no grass for our horses to subsist on.—Gass (p. 305). we gave this cheif and the indians with us some venison, horsebeef, the entrels of the four deer, and four fawns which were taken from two of the does that were killed, they eat none of their food raw, tho' the entrals had but little preperation and the fawns were boiled and consumed hair hide and entrals. these people sometimes eat the flesh of the horse tho' they will in most instances suffer extreem hunger before they will kill their horses for that purpose, this seems reather to proceede from an attatchment to this animal, than a dislike to it's flesh for I observe. many of them eat very heartily of the horsebeef which we give them. The Shoshone man was displeased because we did not give him as much venison as he could eat and in consequence refused to interpret, we took no further notice of him and in the course of a few hours he became very officious and seemed anxious to reinstate himself in our good opinions. the relation of the twisted hair and Neeshneparkkeook gave us a sketch of the principall watercourses West of the Rocky Mountains a copy of which I preserved;1 1 For this map see our atlas volume, No. 44.—Ed. they make the main Southwardly branch of Lewis's river much more extensive than the other [Salmon], and place many villages of the Shoshonees on it's western side. at half after 3 P.M. we departed; for the lodge of the Twisted hair accompanyed by the Cheif and sundry other indians. the relation of the twisted hair left us. the road led us up a steep and high hill to a high and level plain mostly untimbered, through which we passed parrallel with the river about 4 miles when we met the Twisted hair and a party of six men. to this Cheif we had confided the care of our horses and a part of our saddles when we decended the river last fall. the Twisted hair received us very cooly an occurrence as unexpected as it was unaccountable to us. he shortly began to speak with a loud voice and in an angry manner, when he had ceased to speak he was answered by the Cutnose Cheif or Neeshneparkkeook; we readily discovered that a viole[n]t quarrel had taken place between these Cheifs but at that instant knew not the cause; we afterwards learnt that it was on the subject of our horses. this contreversy between the cheifs detained us about 20 minutes; in order to put an end to this dispute as well as to releive our horses from the embarasment of their loads, we informed the Cheifs that we should continue our march to the first water and encamp accordingly we moved on and the Indians all followed about two miles on the road we arrived at a little branch which run to the wright. here we encamped for the evening having traveled 6 miles today.2 2 The expedition is on the south side of the Clearwater, passing up the river from Jack's Creek, and encamping probably on Big Cañon River.—Ed. the two cheifs with their little bands formed seperate camps a short distance from ours, they all appeared to be in an ill humour. we had been informed some days since that the natives had discovered the deposit of our saddles and taken them away and that our horses were much scattered. we were very anxious to learn the particulars or truth of these reports from the twisted hair, as it must in some measure govern us in the establishment of our perminent camp which in consequence of our detention by the snow of the mountains has become necessary. to obtain our horses and saddles as quickly as possible is our wish, and we are somewhat apprehensive that this difference which has taken place between these Chiefs may millitate against our operations in this rispect. we were therefore desireous to bring about a good understanding between them as soon as possible. The Shoshone boy refused to speak, he aledged it was a quarrel between two Cheifs and that he had no business with it; it was in vain that we urged that his interpreting what we said on this subject was not taking the responsibility of the inteference on himself, he remained obstenately silent. about an hour after we had encamped Drewyer returned from hunting we sent him to the Twisted hair to make some enquiries relative to our horses and saddles and to ask him to come and smoke with us. The Twisted hair accepted the invitation and came to our fire. The twisted hair informed us that accordingly to the promis he had made us when he seperated from us at the falls of the Columbia he collected our horses on his return and took charge of them, that about this time the Cutnose or Neeshneparkkeook and Tun-nach-e-moo-toolt or the broken Arm. returned from a war excurtion against the Shoshonees on the South branch of Lewis's river which had caused their absence when we were in this neighbourhood. that these men had become dissatisfyed with him in consequence of our having confided the horses to his care and that they were eternally quarreling with him insomuch that he thought it best as he was an old man to relinquish any further attention to the horses, that they had consequently become scattered; that most of the horses were near this place, a part were in the forks between the Chopunnish and Kooskooske rivers and three or four others were at the lodge of the broken arm about half a days march higher up the river. he informed us with rispect to our saddles that on the rise of the water this spring the earth had fallen from the door of the cash [cache] and exposed the saddles, he being informed of their situation had taken them up and placed them in another cash where they were at this time; he said it was probable that a part of them had fallen into the water but of this he was not certain. The Twisted hair said if we would spend the day tomorrow at his lodge which was a few miles only from hence and on the road leading to the Broken arm's lodge, he would collect such of our horses as were near this place and our saddles, that he would also send some young men over the Kooskooske to collect those in the forks and bring them to the lodge of the broken Arm to met us. he advised us to go to the lodge of the broken Arm as he said he was a Cheif of great emenence among them, and promised to accompany us thither if we wished him. we told him that we should take his advice in every particular, that we had confided the horses to his care and expected that he would collect them and deliver them to us which when he performed we should pay him the two guns and amunition we had promised him for that service. he seemed much pleased and promised his utmost exertions. we sent Drewyer to the Cutnose who also came to our fire and smoked with ourselves and the Twisted hair we took occasion in the course of the evening to express our regret that there should be a misunderstanding between these Cheifs; the Cut-nose told us in the presents of the Twisted hair that he the twisted hair was a bad old man that he woar two faces, that in stead of taking care of our horses as he had promised us that he had suffered his young men to ride them hunting and had injured them very much; that this was the cause why himself and the Broken arm had forbid his using them. the other made no reply. we informed the Cutnose of our intention of spending tomorrow at the Twisted hair's lodge in order to collect our horses and saddles and that we should proceede the next day to the Broken arm's lodge, he appeared well satisfyed with this arrangement and said he would continue with us, and would give us any assistance in his power; he said he knew the broken arm expected us at his lodge and that he had two bad horses for us, metaphorically speaking a present of two good horses. he said the broken arm had learnt our want of provision and had sent four of his young men with a supply to meet us but that they had taken a different road and had missed us. about 10 P.M. our guests left us and we layed down to rest. [Clark:] Thursday 8th.. of May 1806. This morning our hunters was out by the time it was light. about 8 oClock Shields brought in a small deer, on which we brackfast by 11 A.M. all our hunters returned Drewyer &amp; P. Crusat brought ia a Deer each &amp; Collins wounded one which our Dog caught near our camp. Total of our stock of provisions 4 deer &amp; some horse flesh. on the small creek which passes our Camp, the nativs have laterly encamped and as we are informed have been much distressed for provisions, they have fallen a number of small pine in the vicinity of this Encampment for the Seed which is in the bur of which they eate. we are informed that they were compelled to collect the moss off the pine boil &amp; eate it in the latter part of the last winter. on the creek near our camp I observed a kind of trap which was made with great panes to catch the small fish which pass down with the stream. This was a dam formed of stone so as to collect the water in a narrow part not exceeding 3 feet wide from which place the water shot with great force and scattered through some small willows closely connected and fastened with bark, this mat of willow switches was about 4 feet wide and 6 long lying in a horozontal position, fastened at the extremety. the small fish which fell on those willows was washed on the Willows where they [lie] untill taken off &amp;c. I cought or took off those willows 9 small trout from 3 to 7 Inches in length. Soon after I returned from the fishery an Indian came from a fishery of a similar kind a little above with 12 small fish which he offered me which I declined axcepting as I found from his signs that his house was a short distance above, and that those fisheries afforded the principal part of the food for his children. The great Chief of the Bands below who has a cut nose joined us this morning. we gave the interals with 4 young fauns which was in two of the deer killed to day to the Indians also some of our deer &amp; horse flesh. the paunch of the deer they eate without any preperation further than washing them a little. the fauns they boiled and eate every part of them even the Skins with the hair. The Snake Indian was much displeased that he was not furnished with as much Deer as he could eate. he refused to speake to the wife of Shabono, through whome we could understand the nativs. we did not indulge him and in the after part of the day he came too and spoke very well. one of the Indians drew me a sketch of the river in this sketch he makes the 1st. large Southerly fork of Lewis's river much the longest and on which great numbers of the Snake Indians reside &amp;c. at [blank space in MS.] P. M. we loaded up and set on on the roade leading as we were informed to the lodge of the twisted hair, the Chief in whoes care we had left our horses. we were accompanied by the Cut nose Chief our old Chief who had accompanied us down the river and several men. we assended the hills which was steep and emencely high to a leavel rich country thinly timbered with pine. we had not proceeded more than 4 miles before we met the twisted hair and several men meeting of us. we were verry coolly receved by the twisted hair. he spoke aloud and was answered by the Cut nose. we could not learn what they said, but plainly discovered that a missunderstanding had taken place between them. we made signs to them that we should proceed on to the next water and encamp. accordingly I set out and they all followed. we had not proceeded far before the road crossed a small handsom stream on which we encamped. The parties of those two Chiefs took different positions at some distance from each other and all appeared sulkey. after we had formed our camp we sent Drewyer with a pipe to smoke with the twisted hair and lern the cause of the dispute between him and the Cut nose, and also to invite him to our fire to smoke with us. The twisted hair came to our fire to smoke we then sent drewyer to the Cut Noses fire with the same directions. he returned and informed us that the Cut nose said he would join us in a fiew minits. it appears that the cause of the quarrel between those two men is about our horses and we cannot lern the particulars of this quarrel which probably originated through jelousy on the part of the Cut nose who blames the twisted hair for suffer[ing] our horses to be rode, and want water dureing the winter &amp;c. twisted hair says the horses were taken from him &amp;c. The Cut nose joined us in a short time We smoked with all the party of both Chiefs, and told them that we were sorry to find them at varience with each other the cut nose said that the twisted hair was a bad man and wore two faces, that he had not taken care of our horses as was expected, that himself an the broken arm had caused our horses to be watered in the winter and had them drove together, and that if we would proceed on to the village of the great chief [for] whome we had left a flag last fall the broken arm he would send for our horses, that he had himself three of them. he also informed us that the great Chief hereing of our distressed situation had sent his son and 4 men to meet us and have us furnished on the way &amp;c. that the young men had missed us and could never over take us untill this time. that the great Chief had 2 bad horses for us and expected us to go to his lodge which was near the river and about half a days march above &amp;c. The twisted hair told us that he wished to smoke with us at his lodge which was on the road leading to the Great Chiefs lodge, and but a fiew miles ahead. if we would delay at his lodge tomorrow he would go after our saddles and horses which was near the place we made our canoes our last fall. we deturmined to set out early in the morning and proceed on to the lodge of the twisted hair and send for our saddles and powder which we had left burried near the forks, and the day after tomorrow to proceed on to the lodge of the Grand Chief. accordingly we informed the Indians of our intentions. we all smoked and conversed untill about 10 P M. the Indians retired and we lay down. Derected 5 hunters to turn out early in the morning to hunt and meet us at the twisted hair's lodge. [Lewis:] Friday May 9th 1806. We sent out several hunters early this morning with instructions to meet us at the lodge of the Twisted hair. Collecting our horses detained us untill 9.A.M. when we charged our packhorses and set out. our rout lay through a level rich country similar to that of yesterday; at the distance of 6 miles we arrived at the lodge of the twisted hair; this habitation was built in the usual form with sticks mats and dryed hay, and contained 2 fir[e]s and about 12 persons. even at this small habitation there was an appendage of the soletary lodge, the retreat of the tawney damsels when nature causes them to be driven into coventry; here we halted as had been previously concerted, and one man with 2 horses accompa[n]yed the twisted hair to the canoe camp,1 1 Referring to the camp made by the explorers at the forks of the Clearwater, Sept. 26, 1805.—Ed. about 4 ms. in quest of the saddles. the Twisted hair sent two young men in surch of our horses agreeably to his promis. The country along the rocky mountains for several hundred miles in length and about 50 in width is level extreemly fertile and in many parts covered with a tall and open growth of the longleafed pine, near the watercourses the hills are steep and lofty tho' [they] are covered with a good soil not remarkably stony and possess more timber than the level country. the bottom lands on the watercou[r]ses are reather narrow and confined tho' fertile &amp; seldom inundated. this country would form an extensive settlement; the climate appears quite as mild as that of similar latitude on the Atlantic coast if not more so and it cannot be otherwise than healthy; it possesses a fine dry pure air. the grass and many plants are now upwards of knee high. I have no doubt but this tract of country if cultivated would produce in great abundance every article essentially necessary to the comfort and subsistence of civillized man. to it's present inhabitants nature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which furnish them a plentifull store of provision; these are acquired with but little toil, when prepared after the method of the natives afford not only a nutricious but an agreeable food. among other roots those called by them the quawmash and Cows are esteemed the most agreeable and valuable as they are also the most abundant. the cows is a knobbed root of an irregularly rounded form not unlike the gensang in form and consistence. this root they collect, rub of[f] a thin black rhind which covers it and pounding it expose it in cakes to the sun. these cakes are about an inch and 1/4 thick and 6 by 18 in width, when dryed they either eat this bread alone without any further preparation, or boil it and make a thick musilage; the latter is most common and much the most agreeable. the flavor of this root is not very unlike the gensang. this root they collect as early as the snows disappear in the spring and continue to collect it untill the quawmash supplys it's place which happens about the latter end of June. the quawmash is also collected for a few weaks after it first makes it's appearance in the spring, but when the scape appears it is no longer fit for use untill the seed are ripe which happens about the time just mentioned, and then the cows declines.1 1 For description of camas (quawmash) root, see vol. iii, p. 78, note I; for kowse, see vol. iv, p. 354, note 2.—Ed. the latter is also frequently dryed in the sun and pounded afterwards and then used in making soope. I observed a few trees of the larch and a few small bushes of the balsam fir near the lodge of the Twisted hair. at 2 P.M. our hunters joined us Drewyer killed a deer but lost it in the river. a few pheasants was the produce of the hunt. we procured a few roots of cows of which we made soope. late in the evening The Twisted hair and willard returned; they brought about half of our saddles, and some powder and lead which had been buried at that place. my saddle was among the number of those which were lost. about the same time the young men arrived with 21 of our horses. the greater part of our horses were in fine order. five of them appeared to have been so much injured by the indians riding them last fall that they had not yet recovered and were in low order. three others had soar backs. we had these horses caught and hubbled. the situation of our camp was a disagreeable one in an open plain; the wind blew violently and was cold. at seven P.M. it began to rain and hail, at 9 it was succeeded by a heavy shower of snow which continued untill the next morning. Several indians joined us this evening from the village of the broken arm or Tunnachemootoolt and continued all night. The man who had imposed himself on us as a relation of the twisted hair rejoined us this evening we found him an impertinent proud supercilious fellow and of no kind of rispectability in the nation, we therefore did not indulge his advances towards a very intimate connection. The Cutnose lodged with the twisted hair I beleive they have become good friends again. several indians slept about us. [Clark:] Friday 9th. May 1806 The hunters set out very early agreeable to their derections. we were detained untill 9 A.M. for our horses which were much scattered at which time we collected our horses and set out and proceeded on through a butifull open rich country for 6 miles to the camp of the twisted hair. this Campment is formed of two Lodges built in the usial form of mats and straw. the largest and principal Lodge is calculated for 2 fires only and contains about [blank space in MS.] persons. the Second lodge is small &amp; appears to be intended for the sick women who always retire to a seperate lodge when they have the [blank space in MS.] this custom is common to all the nations on this river as well as among all other Indian nations with whom I am acquainted. at the distance of 2 miles we passd. a lodge of 2 fires on a fork of the road which leads to the right Situated on a small branch which falls into Musquetor Creek. before 2 P M all our hunters joined us haveing killed only one deer which was lost in the river and a pheasent. Soon after we halted at the lodge of the twisted hair he set out with two boys and Willard with a pack horse down to the river near the place we made the canoes for our saddles and a cannister of powder and some lead buried there, also a part of our horses which resorted near that place. late in the evening they returned with 21 of our horse[s] and about half of our saddles with the powder and ball. The greater part of the horses were in fine order, tho' five of them had been rode &amp; worsted in such a manner last fall by the Inds. that they had not recovered and are in very low order, and 3 with sore backs. we had all the recovered horses cought &amp; hobbled. we precured some pounded roots of which a supe was made thick on which we suped. the wind blew hard from the S.W. accompanied with rain untill from 7 oClock untill 9 P.M. when it began to snow and continued all night. several Indians came from the village of the Chief with whome we had left a flag and continued with us all night. they slept in the house of the twisted hair and two of them along side of us. [Lewis:] Saturday May 10th. 1806. This morning the snow continued falling [until] 1/2 after 6 A.M. when it ceased, the air keen and cold, the snow 8 inches deep on the plain; we collected our horses and after taking a scant breakfast of roots we set out for the village of Tunnachemootoolt; our rout lay through an open plain course S. 35. E. and distance 16 Ms. the road was slippery and the snow clogged to the horses feet, and caused them to trip frequently. the mud at the sources of the little ravines was deep black and well supplyed with quawmash. Drewyer turned off to the left of the road in order to hunt and did not join us this evening. at 4 in the afternoon we decended the hills to Commearp Creek1 1 This creek is sometimes called Kamai or Kamiah, but is generally known as Lawyer's Cañon Creek; it takes this name from an Indian called by the whites "Lawyer," who claimed to be a son of the chief who kept the horses of the expedition during the preceding winter; but James Stuart (an educated Nez Percé of much ability) told O. D. Wheeler that this claim was induced by vanity on Lawyer's part, who assented to the statement that it was his father who had aided the explorers. In reality the hunting districts of Twisted Hair and Lawyer's father were many miles apart.—Ed. and arrived at the Village of Tunnachemootoolt, the cheif at whos lodge we had left the flag last fall. this flag was now displayed on a staff placed at no great distance from the lodge. underneath the flag the Cheif met my friend Capt. C. who was in front and conducted him about 80 yds.. to a place on the bank of the creek where he requested we should encamp; I came up in a few minutes and we collected the Cheifs and men of consideration smoked with them and stated our situation with rispect to provision. the Cheif spoke to his people and they produced us about 2 bushels of the quawmas roots dryed, four cakes of the bread of cows and a dryed salmon trout. we thanked them for this store of provision but informed them that our men not being accustomed to live on roots alone we feared it would make them sick, to obviate which we proposed exchangeing a [good] horse in reather low order for a young horse in tolerable order with a view to kill. the hospitality of the cheif revolted at the eydea of an exchange, he told us that his young men had a great abundance of young horses and if we wished to eat them we should by [be] furnished with as many as we wanted. accordingly they soon produced us two fat young horses one of which we killed, the other we informed them we would pospone killing untill we had consumed the one already killed. This is a much greater act of hospitality than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe since we have passed the Rocky mountains. in short be it spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act which deserves the appellation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter. we informed these people that we were hungry and fatiegued at this moment, that when we had eaten and refreshed ourselves we would inform them who we were, from whence we had come and the objects of our resurches. a principal Cheif by name Ho-hâst-ill-pilp arrived with a party of fifty men mounted on eligant horses. he had come on a visit to us from his village which is situated about six miles distant near the river. we invited this man into our circle and smoked with him, his retinue continued on horseback at a little distance. after we had eaten a few roots we spoke to them as we had promised, and gave Tinnachemootoolt and Hohâstillpilp each a medal; the former one of the small size with the likeness of Mr. Jefferson and the latter one of the sewing medals1 1 I. e., "sowing"—referring to the design on the "third-class" medal of a farmer sowing grain.—Ed. struck in the presidency of Washington. we explained to them the desighn and the importance of medals in the estimation of the whites as well as the red men who had been taught their value. The Cheif had a large conic lodge of leather erected for our reception and a parsel of wood collected and laid at the door after which he invited Capt. C. and myself to make that lodge our home while we remained with him. we had a fire lighted in this lodge and retired to it accompanyed by the Cheifs and as many of the considerate [considerable] men as could croud in a circcle within it. here after we had taken a repast on some horsebeef we resumed our council with the indians which together with smoking the pipe occupyed the ballance of the evening. I was surprised to find on decending the hills of Commearp Cr. to find that there had been no snow in the bottoms of that stream. it seems that the snow melted in falling and decended here in rain while it snowed on the plains. the hills are about six hundred feet high about one fourth of which distance the snow had decended and still lay on the sides of the hills. as these people had been liberal with us with rispect to provision I directed the men not to croud their lodge [in] surch of food in the manner hunger has compelled them to do at most lodges we have passed, and which the Twisted hair had informed me was disgreeable to the natives. but their previous want of hospitality had induced us to consult their enclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provision from them on the best terms they could. The village of the broken arm as I have heretofore termed it consists of one house only which is 150 feet in length built in the usual form of sticks matts and dry grass. it contains twenty four fires and about double that number of families. from appearances I presume they could raise 100 fighting men. the noise of their women pounding roots reminds me of a nail factory. The indians seem well pleased, and I am confident that they are not more so than our men who have their s[t]omachs once more well filled with horsebeef and mush of the bread of cows. the house of coventry is also seen here. [Clark:] Saturday 10th of May 1806 This morning the snow continued falling untill 1/2 past 6 A M when it seased. the air keen and cold the snow 8 inches deep on the plain. we collected our horses and after takeing a scanty brackfast of roots, we set out for the village of the Chief with a flag, and proceeded on through an open plain. the road was slipry and the snow cloged and caused the horses to trip very frequently. the mud at heads of the streams which we passed was deep and well supplied with the Carmash. Drewyer turned off the road to hunt near the river to our lef[t] and did not join us to day. at 4 P M we arrived at the village of Tin nach e moo toolt the Chief whome We had left a flag. this flag was hoisted on a pole unde[r] the flag the Chief met me and conducted me to a spot near a small run about 80 paces from his Lodges where he requested me to halt which I did. Soon after Cap Lewis who was in the rear came up and we smoked with and told this Chief our situation in respect to provisions. they brought forward about 2 bushels of quawmash 4 cakes of bread made of roots and a dried fish. we informed the Chief that our party was not accustomed to eate roots without flesh &amp; proposed to exchange some of our oald horses for young ones to eate. they said that they would not exchange horses, but would furnish us with such as we wished, and produced 2 one of which we killed and informd. them that we did not wish to kill the other at this time. We gave medals to the broken arm or Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt and Hoh-hâst-ill-pilp two principal Chiefs of the Chopunnish Nation and was informed that there was one other Great Chief (in all 4) who had but one eye. he would be here tomorrow. a large Lodge of Leather was pitched and Capt. Lewis and my self was envited into it. we entered and the Chief and principal men came into the lodge and formed a circle a parcel of wood was collected and laid at the dore and a fire made in this conic lodge before we entered it. the Chief requested that we might make the Lodge our homes while we remained with him. here after we had taken a repast on roots &amp; horse beef we resumed our council with the indians which together with smokeing took up the ballance of the evening. I was supprised to find decending the hill to Commearp Creek to find that there had been no snow in the bottoms of that stream. it seams that the snow melted in falling and decended here in rain while it snowed in the plain. the hills are about Eight hundred feet high about 1/4 of which distance the snow had decended and still lay on the sides of the hill. as those people had been liberal I directed the men not to crowd their Lodges in serch of food the manner hunger has compelled them to do, at most lodges we have passed, and which the Twisted Hair had informed us was disagreeable to the nativs. but their previous want of hospitality had enduced us to consult their enclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provisions from them on the best terms they could. The Village of the broken Arm consists of one house or Lodge only which is 150 feet in length built in the usial form of sticks, Mats and dry grass. it contains 24 fires and about double that number of families. from appearance I prosume they could raise 100 fighting men. the noise of their women pounding the cows roots remind me of a nail factory. The Indians appear well pleased, and I am confident that they are not more so than our men who have their stomach once more well filled with horse beef and the bread of cows. Those people has shewn much greater acts of hospitallity than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe since we have passed the rocky Mountains. in short be it spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act which diserves the appelation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter. [Lewis:] Sunday May 11th 1806. The last evening we were much crouded with the indians in our lodge, the whole floor of which was covered with their sleeping carcases. we arrose early and took breakfast. at 8 A.M. a Cheif of great note among these people arrived from his village or lodge on the S. side of Lewis's River. this is a stout fellow of good countenance about 40 years of age and has lost the left eye. his name is Yoom-park?-kar-tim.1 1 This name is said to mean five big hearts. See Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clark, ii, p. 267.—Ed. to this man we gave a medal of the smal kind. those with the likeness of Mr. Jefferson have all been disposed of except one of the largest size which we reserve for some great Cheif on the Yellow rock river. we now pretty fully informed ourselves that Tunnachemootoolt, Neeshneparkkeeook, Yoomparkkartim and Hohâstillpilp were the principal Cheif[s] of the Chopunnish nation and rank in the order here mentioned; as all those cheifs were present in our lodge1 1 We now find a great many more men among the Indians than when we went down last fall; and several chiefs, which had then been out at war.—Gass (p. 308). we thought it a favorable time to repeat what had been said yesterday and to enter more minutely into the views of our government with rispect to the inhabitants of this western part of the continent, their intention of establishing trading houses for their relief, their wish to restore peace and harmony among the natives, the strength power and wealth of our nation &amp;c. to this end we drew a map of the country with a coal on a mat in their way and by the assistance of the snake boy and our interpretters were enabled to make ourselves understood by them altho' it had to pass through the French, Minnetare, Shoshone and Chopunnish languages. the interpretation being tedious it ocupyed nearly half the day before we had communicated to them what we wished. they appeared highly pleased. after this council was over we amused ourselves with shewing them the power of magnetism, the spye glass, compass, watch, air-gun and sundry other articles equally novel and incomprehensible to them. they informed us that after we had left the Minnetares last spring that three of their people had visited that nation and that they had informed them of us and had told them that we had such things in our possession but that they could not place confidence in the information untill they had now witnessed it themselves. A young man, son of a conspicuous cheif among these people who was killed not long since by the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie, brought and presented us a very fine mare and colt. he said he had opened his ears to our councils and would observe them strictly, and that our words had made his heart glad. he requested that we would accept this mear and colt which he gave in token of his determination to pursue our advise. about 3 P.M. Drewyer arrived with 2 deer which he had killed. he informed us that the snow still continued to cover the plain. many of the natives apply to us for medical aid which we gave them cheerfully so far as our skill and store of medicine would enable us. schrofela, ulsers, rheumatism, soar eyes, and the loss of the uce of their limbs are the most common cases among them. the latter case is not very common but we have seen th[r]ee instances of it among the Chopunnish. it is a very extraordinary complaint. a Cheif of considerable note at this place has been afflicted with it for three years, he is incapable of moving a single limb but lies like a corps in whatever position he is placed, yet he eats heartily, digests his food perfectly, injoys his understanding, his pulse are good, and has retained his flesh almost perfectly, in short were it not that he appears a little pale from having lain so long in the shade he might well be taken for a man in good health. I suspect that their confinement to a diet of roots may give rise to all those disorders except the rheumatism &amp; soar eyes, and to the latter of these, the state of debility incident to a vegetable diet may measureably contribute. The Chopunnish notwithstanding they live in the crouded manner before mentioned are much more clenly in their persons and habitations than any nation we have seen since we left the Ottoes on the river Platte. The Twisted hair brought us six of our horses. [Clark:] Sunday 11th May 1806 Some little rain last night. we were crouded in the Lodge with Indians who continued all night and this morning Great numbers were around us. The One Eyed Chief Yoom-park-kar-tim arived and we gave him a medal of the small size and spoke to the Indians through a Snake boy Shabono and his wife. we informed them who we were, where we came from &amp; our intentions towards them, which pleased them very much. a young man son to the great Chief who was killed not long sence by the Indians from the N.E. brought an elegant mare and coalt and Gave us, and said he had opened his ears to what we had said and his heart was glad: and requested us to take this mare and coalt as a token of his deturmination to pursue our Councels &amp;c. The twisted hair brough[t] six of our horses all in fine order. Great numbers of Indians apply to us for medical aid which we gave them cherfully so far as our skill and store of Medicine would enable us. schrofla, ulsers, rhumitism, sore eyes, and the loss of the use of their Limbs are the most common cases among them. the latter case is not very common but We have seen 3 instances of it among the Chopunnish. a very extroadinery compl[ai]nt. about 3 P. M. Geo. drewyer arived with 2 deer which he had killed. he informed us that the snow still continued to cover the plains. We are now pretty well informed that Tunnachemootoolt, Hohâstillpilp, Neshneparkkeeook, and Yoomparkkartim were the principal Chiefs of the Chopunnish Nation and ranked in the order here mentioned; as all those chiefs were present in our lodge we thought it a favourable time to repeet what had been said and to enter more minutely into the views of our government with respect to the inhabitants of this Western part of the Continent, their intentions of establishing tradeing houses for their relief, their wish to restore peace and harmony among the nativs, the strength welth and powers of our nation &amp;c. to this end we drew a map of the country with a coal on a mat in their way, and by the assistance of the Snake boy and our interpreters were enabled to make ourselves understood by them altho' it had to pass through French, Minnetare, Shoshone and Chopunnish languages.1 1 Before leaving the Chopunnish, among whom they spent several weeks, the explorers acquired something of their language. Clark entered upon the fly-leaf of Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 3, the following terms used by this tribe: "The Chopunnish call the Crow Indians Up-shar-look-kar Chopunnish name for Sin-sho-cal Dearbourn R. ditto do Cal-la-mar-sha-mash Meddeson [River] ditto do Co-ma-win-nim Maria River ditto ditto Ta-ki-á-ki-á Muscle Shell R ditto ditto Wah-wa-ko-ye-o-cose is the Rochejhone Elk river ditto do Koos-koos-an-nim-a the little Missouri ditto do Walsh-nem-mah Knife R ditto do Ni-he-six-te C. R"—Ed. the interpretation being tegious it occupied the greater part of the day, before we had communicated to them what we wished. they appeared highly pleased. after this council was over we amused ourselves with shewing them the power of magnetism, the spye glass, compass, watch, air gun and sundery other articles equally novel and incomprehensible to them. they informed us that after we left the Menetares last spring that 3 of their people has visited that nation, and that they had informed them of us, and had told them that we had such things in our possession but that they could not place confidence in the information untill they had now witnessed it themselves. In the evening a man was brought in a robe by four Indians and laid down near me. they informed me that this man was a Chief of considerable note who has been in the situation I see him for 5 years. this man is incapable of moveing a single limb but lies like a corps in whatever position he is placed, yet he eats hartily, dejests his food perfectly, enjoys his understanding. his pulse are good, and has retained his flesh almost perfectly; in short were it not that he appears a little pale from having been so long in the shade, he might well be taken for a man in good health. I suspect that their confinement to a diet of roots may give rise to all the disorde[r]s of the nativs of this quarter except the Rhumitism &amp; Sore eyes, and to the latter of those, the state of debility incident to a vegitable diet may measureably contribute. The Chopunnish not withstanding they live in the crouded manner before mentioned are much more clenly in their persons and habitations than any nation we have seen sence we left the Illinois. These nativs take their fish in the following manner towit. a stand small stage or warf consisting of sticks and projecting about 10 feet into the river and about 3 feet above the water on the extremity of this the fisherman stands with his guig or a skooping net which differ but little in their form [from] those commonly used in our country it is formed thus with those nets they take the Suckers and also the salmon trout and I am told the salmon also. [Lewis:] Monday May 12th. 1806. This morning a great number of indians collected about us as usual. we took an early breakfast and Capt. C. began to administer eyewater to a croud of at least 50 applicants. The Indians held a council among themselves this morning with rispect to the subjects on which we had spoken to them yesterday. the result as we learnt was favourable. they placed confidence in the information they had received and resolved to pu[r]sue our advise. after this council was over the principal Cheif or the broken Arm, took the flour of the roots of cows and thickened the soope in the kettles and baskets of all his people, this being ended he made a harangue the purport of which was making known the deliberations of their council and impressing the necessity of unanimity among them and a strict attention to the resolutions which had been agreed on in councill; he concluded by inviting all such men as had resolved to abide by the decrees of the council to come and eat and requested such as would not be so bound to shew themselves by not partaking of the feast. I was told by one of our men who was present, that there was not a dissenting voice on this great national question, but all swallowed their objections if any they had, very cheerfully with their mush. during the time of this loud and animated harangue of the Cheif the women cryed wrung their hands, toar their hair and appeared to be in the utmost distress. after this cerimony was over the Cheifs and considerate men came in a body to where we were seated at a little distance from our tent, and two young men at the instance of the nation, presented us each with a fine horse. we caused the cheifs to be seated and gave them each a flag a pound of powder and fifty balls. we also gave powder and ball to the two young men who had presented the horses. Neeshneeparkkeeook gave Drewyer a good horse. The band of Tin-nach-e-moo-toolt have six guns which they acquired from the Minnetaries and appear anxious to obtain arms and amunition. after they had received those presents the Cheifs requested we would retire to the tent whither they accompanied us, they now informed us that they wished to give an answer to what we had said to them the preceeding day, but also informed us that there were many of their people waiting in great pain at that moment for the aid of our medicine. it was agreed between Capt. C. and myself that he sould attend the sick as he was their favorite phisician while I would [remain] here and answer the Cheifs. The father of Hohâstillpilp was the orrator on this occasion. he observed that they had listened with attention to our adivse and that the whole nation were resolved to follow it, that they had only one heart and one tongue on this subject. he said they were fully sensible of the advantages of peace and that the ardent desire which they had to cultivate peace with their neighbours had induced his nation early last summer to send a pipe by 3 of their brave men to the Shoshonees on the S. side of Lewis's river in the Plains of Columbia, that these people had murdered these men, which had given rise to the war expedition against that nation last fall; that their warriors had fallen in with the Shoshonees at that time and had killed 42 of them with the loss of 3 only on their part; that this had satisfyed the blood of their disceased friends and that they would never again make war against the Shoshonees, but were willing to receive them as friends. that they valued the lives of their young men too much to wish them to be engaged in war. That as we had not yet seen the black foot Indians and the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie they did not think it safe to venture over to the Plains of the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations would not kill them. that when we established our forts on the Missouri as we had promised, they would come over and trade for arms Amunition &amp;c. and live about us. that it would give them much pleasure to be at peace with these nations altho' they had shed much of their blood. he said that the whitemen might be assured of their warmest attatchment and that they would alwas give them every assistance in their power; that they were poor but their hearts were good. he said that some of their young men would go over with us to the Missouri and bring them the news as we wished, and that if we could make a peace between themselves and their enimies on the other side of the mountain their nation would go over to the Missouri in the latter end of the summer. on the subject of one of their cheifs accompanying us to the Land of the white-men they could not yet determine, but that they would let us know before we left them. that the snow was yet so deep in the mountain if we attempted to pass we would certainly perish, and advised us to remain untill after the next full moon when the[y] said the snow would disappear and we could find grass for our horses. when the oald man had concluded I again spoke to them at some length with which they appeared highly gratifyed. after smoking the pipe which was about 2 P.M. they gave us another fat horse to kill which was thankfully received by the party. Capt. C. now joined us having just made an end of his medical distrabution. we gave a phiol of eyewater to the Broken Arm, and requested that he would wash the eyes of such as might apply for that purpose, and that when it was exhausted we would replenish the phiol. he was much pleased with this present. we now gave the Twisted hair one gun and a hundred balls and 2 lbs. of powder in part for his attention to our horses and promised the other gun and a similar quantity of powder and lead when we received the ballance of our horses. this gun we had purchased of the indians below for 2 Elkskins. this evening three other of our original stock of horses were produced, they were in fine order as well as those received yesterday. we have now six horses out only, as our old guide Toby and his son each took a horse of ours when they returned last fall. these horses are said to be on the opposite side of the river at no great distance from this place. we gave the young men who had delivered us the two horses this morning some ribbon, blue wampum and vermillion, one of them gave me a handsome pare of legings and the Broken Arm gave Capt. C. his shirt, in return for which we gave him a linin shirt. we informed the indians of our wish to pass the river and form a camp at some proper place to fish, hunt, and graize our horses untill the snows of the mountains would permit us to pass. they recommended a position a few miles distant from hence on the opposite side of the river, but informed us that there was no canoe at this place by means of which we could pass our baggage over the river, but promised to send a man early in the morning for one which they said would meet us at the river by noon the next day. The indians formed themselves this evening into two large parties and began to gamble for their beads and other ornaments. the game at which they played was that of hiding a stick in their hands which they frequently changed accompanying their operations with a song. this game seems common to all the nations in this country, and dose not differ from that before discribed of the Shoshonees on the S.E. branch of Lewis's river. we are anxious to procure some guides to accompany us on the different routs we mean to take from Travellers rest; for this purpose we have turned our attention to the Twisted hair who has several sons grown who are well acquainted as well as himself with the various roads in those mountains. we invited the old fellow to remove his family and live near us while we remained; he appeared gatifyed with this expression of our confidence and promissed to do so. shot at a mark with the indians, struck the mark with 2 balls distce. 220 yds.1 1 In the weather diary for this date, Lewis wrote (Codex K, p. 148): "the natives inform us that the salmon have arrived at the entrance of the Kooskooske in great numbers and that some were caught yesterday in Lewis's river opposite to us many miles above the entrance of that river. from this village of the broken arm Lewis's river is only about 10 miles distant to the S. W. the natives also inform us that the salmon appear many days sooner in Lewis's river above the entrance of the Kooskooske than they do in that stream."—Ed. [Clark:] Monday 12th. May 1806 a fine morning great numbers of Indians flock about us as usial. after brackfast I began to administer eye water and in a fiew minits had near 40 applicants with sore eyes, and maney others with other complaints most common Rhumatic disorders &amp; weaknesses in the back and loins perticularly the womin. the Indians had a grand Council this morning after which we were presented each with a horse by two young men at the instance of the nation. we caused the chiefs to be seated and gave them each a flag a pint of Powder and 50 balls to the two young men who had presented the horses we also gave powder and ball. The broken arm or Tunnachemootoolt pulled off his leather shirt and gave me. In return gave him a shirt. We retired into the Lodge and the natives spoke to the following purpote, i.e. they had listened to our advice and that the whole nation were deturmined to follow it, that they had only one heart and one tongue on this subject. explained the cause of the War with the Shoshones. they wished to be at peace with all nations &amp;c. Some of their men would accompany us to the Missouri &amp;c. &amp;c. as a great number of men women &amp; children were wateing and requesting medical assistance maney of them with the most simple complaints which could be easily releived, independent of maney with disorders intirely out of the power of Medison all requesting something, we agreed that I should administer and Capt L to here and answer the Indians. I was closely employed untill 2 P.M. administering eye water to about 40 grown persons. some simple cooling medicenes to the disabled Chief, to several women with rhumatic effections &amp; a man who had a swelled hip. &amp;c. &amp;c. in the evening three of our horses were brought all in fine order. we have now only Six remaining out. We gave to each a Chief a pint of Powder and 50 Balls a small flag and to the two young men who delivered us the horses we gave also powder &amp; Ball and some blue wompom &amp; ribin. all appeared much pleased. Those people are much affraid of the blackfoot indians, and the Big bellies of Fort de prarie establishment. those indians kill great numbers of this nation whenever they pass over to hunt on the Missouri. one of our men bought a horse for a fiew small articles of an Indian. The Indians brought up a fat horse and requested us to kill and eate it as they had nothing else to offer us to eate. The Cut Nose made a present of a horse to Drewyer at the same time the two horses were offered to Capt. Lewis &amp; my self. The horses of those people are large well formed and active. Generally in fine order. sore backs caused by rideing them either with out saddles, or with pads which does not prevent the wate of the rider pressing imediately on the back bone, and weathers [withers] of the horse. the Indians formed two parti[e]s and plaied for their beeds. we gave the twisted hair a gun, powder &amp; 100 ball in part for takeing care of our horses &amp;c. and wish him to camp near us untill we crossed the mountains which he agreed to do, and was much pleased we have turned our attentions towards the twisted hair who has several sons grown who are well acquainted as well as himself with the various roads through the rocky Mountains and will answer very well as guides to us through those mountains. In the council to day the father of Hohâstillpilp said the Chopunnish were fully convinced of the advantages of peace and ardently wished to cultivate peace with their neighbours. early last Summer 3 of their brave men were sent with a pipe to the Shoshones on the S E. fork of Lewis's river in the Plains of Columbia, their pipe was disregearded and their 3 men murdered, which had given rise to the War expedition against that nation last fall; that their warriers had fallen in with and killed 42 of the Shoshones with the loss of 3 men only on their part; that this had satisfied the blood of the deceased friends and they would never again make war against the Shoshones, but were willing to receve them as friends. That as we had not seen the Indians towards Fort de Prarie they did not think it safe to venture over to the Plains of the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations would not kill them. I gave a vial of eye water to the Broken arm for to wash the eyes of all who applied to him and told him when it was out we would replenish it again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter XXVIII ENCAMPED ON THE UPPER KOOSKOOSKE Lewis's Journal, May 13–June 6, 1806 Clark's Journal, May 13–June 6 [Lewis:] Tuesday May 13th. 1806. THIS morning Capt. C. as usual was busily engaged with his patients untill eleven OCk. at 1 P.M. we collected our horses and set out for the river escorted by a number of the natives on horseback. we followed the [Lawyer's Cañon] creek downwards about two miles, passing a stout branch at 1 m. which flowed in on the wright. our course S.E. we now entered an extensive open bottom of the Kooskooske R. through which we passed nearly N. about 1 1/2 miles and halted on the bank of the river at the place appointed to meet the canoe the man had set out early this morning for the purpose but had not yet arrived with the canoe we therefore unloaded our horses and turned them out to graize. as the canoe did not arrive untill after sunset we remained here all night; a number of the natives continued with us. in the evening we tryed the speed of several of our horses. these horses are active strong and well formed. these people have immence numbers of them 50, 60 or a hundred hed is not unusual for an individual to possess. The Chopunnish are in general stout well formed active men. they have high noses and many of them on the acqueline order with cheerfull and agreeable countenances; their complexions are not remarkable in common with other savage nations of America they extract their beards but the men do not uniformly extract the hair below, this is more particularly confined to the females. I observed several men among them whom I am convinced if they had shaved their beard instead of extracting it would have been as well supplyed in this particular as any of my countrymen. they appear to be cheerfull but not gay; they are fond of gambling and of their amusements which consist principally in shooting their arrows at a bowling target made of willow bark, and in riding and exercising themselves on horseback, racing &amp;c. they are expert marksmen and good riders. they do not appear to be so much devoted to baubles as most of the nations we have met with, but seem anxious always to obtain articles of utility, such as knives, axes, tomma-hawks, kettles blankets and mockersonalls [awls]. blue beads however may form an exception to this remark; this article among all the nations of this country may be justly compared to goald or silver among civilized nations. They are generally well cloathed in their stile. their dress consists of a long shirt which reaches to the middle of [the] thye, long legings which reach as high as the waist, mockersons and robes. these are formed of various skins and are in all rispects like those particularly discribed of the Shoshones. their women also dress like the Shoshones. their ornaments consist of beads shells and peices of brass variously attatched to their dress, to their ears arr[u]ond their necks wrists arms &amp;c. a bando of some kind usually surrounds the head, this is most frequently the skin of some fir animal as the fox otter &amp;c. tho' they have them also of dressed skin without the hair. the ornament of the nose is a single shell of the wampum. the pirl1 1 The wampum was made of a shell (Dentalium, or a related genus). The pearl was probably pieces of mother-of-pearl from the mussel (Margaritana margaritifera), which could be obtained by barter with the Indians of the Columbia.—Ed. and beads are suspended from the ears. beads are woarn arround their wrists necks and over their sholders crosswise in the form of a double sash. the hair of the men is cewed [queued] in two rolls which hang on each side in front of the body as before discribed of other inhabitants of the Columbia. collars of bears claws are also common; but the article of dress on which they appear to b[e]stow most pains and ornaments is a kind of collar or brestplate; this is most commonly a strip of otterskin of about six inches wide taken out of the center of the skin it's whole length including the head. this is dressed with the hair on; a hole is cut lengthwise through the skin near the head of the animal sufficiently large to admit the head of the person to pass. thus it is placed about the neck and hangs in front of the body the tail frequently reaching below their knees; on this skin in front is attatched peices of pirl, beads, wampum peices of red cloth and in short whatever they conceive most valuable or ornamental. I observed a tippit woarn by Hohâstillpilp, which was formed of human scalps and ornamented with the thumbs and fingers of several men which he had slain in battle.1 1 The nation here, the Cho-co-nish, is very numerous, as well as the other. These nations have been long at war, and destroyed a great many of each other, in a few years past.—Gass (p. 312). their women brade their hair in two tresses which hang in the same position of those of the men. they also wear a cap or cup on the head formed of beargrass and cedarbark. the men also frequently attatch some small ornament to a small plat of hair on the center of the crown of their heads. [Clark:] Tuesday 13th11 of May 1806. a fine morning I administered to the sick and gave directions. we collected all our horses and set out at 1 P.M. and proceeded down the Creek to the Flat head River a short distance below the enterance of the Creek at the distance of 3 miles from the Village. at this place we expected to have met the Canoe which was promised to be furnished us, and for which an indian set out very early this morning. we halted at the Flat Head River unloaded our horses and turned them out to feed. Several Indians accompanied us to the river and continued untill evening. The man who set out early this morning to the forks of this river for a canoe did not arive untill after sunset we remained all night; in the evening we tried the speed of several of our horses. these horses are strong active and well formed. Those people have emence numbers of them 50 or 60 or a Hundred head is not unusial for an individual to possess. The Chopunnish are in general stout well formed active men. they have high noses and maney of them on the acqueline order with chearfull and agreeable countinances; their complexions are not remarkable in common with other Indian Nations of America they extract their beard, but the men do not uniformly extract the hair below, this is more particularly confined to the females. they appear to be cheerfull but not gay, they are fond of gambling and of their amusements which consists principally in shooting their arrows at a targit made of willow bark, and in rideing and exersiseing themselves on horseback, raceing &amp;c. they are expirt marks men &amp; good riders. they do not appear to be so much devoted to baubles as most of the nations we have met with, but seem anxious always to riceve articles of utility, such as knives, axes, Kittles, blankets &amp; mockerson awls. blue beeds however may form an exception to this remark; This article among all the nations of this country may be justly compared to gold and silver among civilized nations. They are generally well clothed in their stile their dress consists of a long shirt which reaches to the middle of the leg, long legins which reach as high as the waist, mockersons &amp; robe. those are formed of various skins and are in all respects like those of the Shoshone. Their orniments consists of beeds, shells and pieces of brass variously attached to their dress, to their ears arround theire necks wrists arms &amp;c. a band of some kind usially serounds the head, this is most frequently the skin of some fir animal as the fox otter &amp;c. I observed a tippet worn by Hohâstillpilp, which was formed of Humane scalps and ornemented with the thumbs and fingers of several men which he had slain in battle. they also were a coller or breastplate of otter skin orniminted with shells beeds &amp; quills. the women brade their hair in two tresses which hang in the same position of those of the men, which ar[e] cewed and hang over each sholder &amp;c. [Lewis:] Wednesday May 14th. 1806. The morning was fair, we arrose early and dispatched a few of our hunters to the opposite side of the river, and employed a part of the men in transporting our baggage to the opposite shore wile others were directed to collect the horses; at 10 A.M. we had taken our baggage over and collected our horses, we then took breakfast, after which we drove our horses into the river which they swam without accedent and all arrived safe on the opposite shore. the river is 150 yds. wide at this place and extreemly rapid. tho' it may be safely navigated at this season, as the water covers all the rocks which lie in it's bed to a considerable debth. we followed our horses and again collected them, after which we removed our baggage to a position which we had previously selected for out permanent camp about half a mile below.1 1 On the east, or right-hand, bank of the Clearwater, nearly opposite the town of Kamiah, Nez Perces Co., Idaho, and not far from the eastern boundary of the Nez Percés Indian Reservation.—Ed. this was a very eligible spot for defence it had been an ancient habitation of the indians; was sunk about 4 feet in the ground and raised arround it's outer edge about three 1/2 feet with a good wall of ea[r]th, the whole was a circle of about 30 feet in diameter. arround this we formed our tents of sticks and grass facing outwards and deposited our baggage within the sunken space under a shelter which we constructed for the purpose our situation was within 40 paces of the river in an extentsive level bottom thinly timbered with the longleafed pine. here we are in the vicinity of the best hunting grounds from indian information, are convenient to the salmon which we expect daily and have an excellent pasture for our horses. the hills to the E and North of us are high broken and but partially timbered; the soil is rich and affords fine grass. in short as we are compelled to reside a while in this neighbourhood I feel perfectly satisfyed with our position.2 2 The expedition remained in this camp longer than at any other place upon the route, except at Forts Mandan and Clatsop. By analogy it is usually spoken of as Camp Chopunnish, but there is no evidence that the explorers gave it that title. Wheeler, who visited the place in 1902, states that the circles of Indian wigwams were still to be discerned, and that it is yet frequented by the Chopunnish, although white settlers are moving into the neighbourhood.—Ed. immediately after we had passed the river Tunnachemootoolt and Hohâstillpilp arrived on the south side with a party of a douzen of their young men; they began to sing in token of friendship as is their custom, and we sent the canoe over for them. they left their horses and came over accompanyed by several of their party among whom were the 2 young men who had presented us with two horses in behalf of the nation; one of these was the son of Tunnachemootoolt and the other the son of the Cheif who was killed by the Minnetares or Fort de Prarie last year and the same who had given us the mare and Colt. we received them at our camp and smoked with them; after some hours Hohâstillpilp with much cerimony presented me with a very eligant grey gelding which he had brought for that purpose. I gave him in return a handkercheif 200 balls and 4 lbs. of powder. with which he appeared perfectly satisfyed. Collins killed two bear this morning and was sent with two others in quest of the meat; with which they returned in the evening; the mail bear was large and fat the female was of moderate size and reather meagre. we had the fat bear fleaced in order to reserve the oil for the mountains. both these bear were of the speceis common to the upper part of the missouri they may be called white black grizly brown or red bear for they are found of all those colours. perhaps it would not be unappropriate to designate them the variagated bear. we gave the indians who were about 15 in number half the female bear, with the sholder head and neck of the other. this was a great treat to those poor wretches who scarcely taist meat once a month. they immediately prepared a brisk fire of dry wood on which they threw a parsel of smooth stones from the river, when the fire had birnt down and heated the stones they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine boughs, on these they laid the flesh of the bear in flitches, placing boughs between each course of meat and then covering it thickly with pine boughs; after this they poared on a small quantity of water and covered the who[l]e over with earth to the debth of four inches. in this situation they suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it out. I taisted of this meat and found it much more tender than that which we had roasted or boiled, but the strong flavor of the pine distroyed it for my pallate. Labuish returned late in the evening and informed us that he had killed a female bear and two large cubbs, he brought with him several large darkbrown pheasants which he had also killed. Shannon also returned with a few pheasants and two squirrels. we have found our stonehorses [stallions] so troublesome that we indeavoured to exchange them with the Chopunnish for mears or gel[d]ings but they will not excha[n]ge altho' we offer 2 for one, we came to a resolution to castrate them and began the operation this evening one of the indians present offered his services on this occasion, he cut them without tying the string of the stone as is usual, and assures us that they will do much better in that way; he takes care to scrape the string very clean and to seperate it from all the adhereing veigns before he cuts it. we shall have an opportunity of judging whether this is a method preferable to that commonly practiced as Drewyer has gelded two in the usual way. The indians after their feast took a pipe or two with us and retired to rest much pleased with their repast. these bear are tremendious animals to them; they esteem the act of killing a bear equally great with that of an enimy in the field of action. I gave the claws of those which Collins killed to Hohâstillpilp. [Clark:] Wednesday 14th. of May 1806 a fine day. we had all our horses collected by 10 a.m. dureing the time we had all our baggage crossed over the Flathead River which is rapid and about 150 yards wide. after the baggage was over to the North Side we crossed our hors[e]s without much trouble and hobbled them in the bottom after which we moved a short distance below to a convenient situation and formed a camp around a very conveniant spot for defence where the Indians had formerly a house under-ground and hollow circiler spot of about 30 feet diameter 4 feet below the serf[a]ce and a Bank of 2 feet above this situation we concluded would be sufficently convenient to hunt the wood lands for bear &amp; Deer and for the salmon fish which we were told would be here in a fiew days, and also a good situation for our horses. the hills to the E. &amp; N. of us are high broken &amp; but partially timbered; the soil rich and affords fine grass. in short as we are compelled to reside a while in this neighbourhood I feel perfectly satisfied with our position. imediately after we had crossed the river the Chief called the broken arm or Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt another principal Chief Hoh-hâst-'ill-pilp arived on the opposite side and began to sing. we sent the canoe over and those chiefs, the son of the broken arm and the son of a Great Chief who was killed last year by the Big bellies of Saskasshewin river. those two young men were the two whome gave Capt Lewis and my self each a horse with great serimony in behalf of the nation a fiew days ago, and the latter a most elligant mare &amp; colt the morning after we arived at the village. Hohâstillpilp with much serimoney presented Capt Lewis with an elegant Gray horse which he had brought for that purpose. Capt Lewis gave him in return a Handkerchief two hundred balls and four pounds of powder, with which he appeared perfectly satisfied, and appeared much pleased. Soon after I had crossed the river and during the time Cap Lewis was on the opposit side John Collins whome we had sent out verry early this morning with Labiech and Shannon on the North Side of the river to hunt, came in and informed me, that he had killed two Bear at about 5 miles distant on the uplands, one of which was in good order. I imediately de[s]patched Jo. Fields. &amp; P. Wiser with him for the flesh. we made several attempts to exchange our Stalions for Geldin[g]s or mar[e]s without success we even offered two for one. those horses are troublesom and cut each other very much and as we can't exchange them we think it best to castrate them and began the opperation this evening one of the indians present offered his services on this occasion. he cut them without tying the string of the stone as is usial. he [s]craped it very clean &amp; seperate it before he cut it. about Meridian Shannon came in with two Grows [grouse] &amp; 2 Squireles common to this country. his mockersons worn out obliged to come in early. Collins returned in the evening with the two bears which he had killed in the morning one of them an old hee was in fine order, the other a female with Cubs was meagure. we gave the Indians about us 15 in number two shoulders and a ham of the bear to eate which they cooked in the following manner. towit on a brisk fire of dryed wood they threw a parcel of small stones from the river, when the fire had burnt down and heated the stone, they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine boughs, on those they laid the flesh of the bear in flitches, placeing boughs between each course of meat and then covering it thickly with pine boughs; after this they poared on a small quantity of water, and covered the whole over with earth to the debth of 4 inches. in this situation they suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it out fit for use. at 6 oClock Labiech returned and informed us that he had killed a female Bear and two Cubs, at a long distance from camp towards the Mountains. he brought in two large dark brown pheasents which he had also killed Shannon also returned also with a few black Pheasents and two squirels which he had killed in the wood land towards Collins Creek. This nation esteem the Killing of one of those tremendeous animals (the Bear) equally great with that of an enemy in the field of action. we gave the claws of those bear which Collins had killed to Hohâstillpilp. [Lewis:] Thursday May 15th. 1806. This morning early Reubin Fields in surching for his horse saw a large bear at no great distance from camp; several men went in pursuit of the bear, they followed his trail a considerable distance but could not come up with him. Labuish and Shannon set out with a view to establish a hunting camp and continuing several days, two others accompanyed them in order to bring in the three bear which Labuish had killed. Drewyer and Cruzatte were sent up the river; Sheilds R. Feilds and Willard hunted in the hills near the camp they returned in the evening with a few pheasants only and reported that there was much late appearance of bear, but beleived that they had gone off to a greater distance at 11 A.M. the men returned with the bear which Labuich had killed. These bear gave me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this country being one speceis only, than any I have heretofore had. The female was black with a considerable proportion of white hairs intermixed and a white spot on the breast, one of the young bear was jut black and the other of a light redish brown or bey colour. the poil of these bear were infinitely longer finer and thicker than the black bear their tallons also longer and more blont as if woarn by diging roots. the white and redish brown or bey coloured bear I saw together on the Missouri; the bey and grizly have been seen and killed together here for these were the colours of those which Collins killed yesterday. in short it is not common to find two bear here of this speceis precisely of the same colour, and if we were to attempt to distinguish them by their collours and to denominate each colour a distinct speceis we should soon find at least twenty. some bear nearly white have also been seen by our hunters at this place. the most striking differences between this speceis of bear and the common black bear are that the former are larger, have longer tallons and tusks, prey more on other animals, do not lie so long nor so closely in winter quarters, and will not climb a tree tho' ever so heardly pressed. the variagated bear I beleive to be the same here with those on the missouri but these are not so ferocious as those perhaps from the circumstance of their being compelled from the scarcity of game in this quarter to live more on roots and of course not so much in the habit of seizing and devouring living animals. the bear here are for from being as passive as the common black bear they have attacked and fought our hunters already but not so fiercely as those of the Missouri. there are also some of the common black bear in this neighbourhood. Frazier, J. Fields and Wiser complain of violent pains in their heads, and Howard and York are afflicted with the cholic. I attribute these complaints to their diet of roots [to] which they have not been accustomed. Tunnachemootoolt and 12 of his young men left us this morning on their return to their village. Hohâstillpilp and three old men remained untill 5 in the evening when they also departed. at 1 P.M. a party of 14 natives on horseback passed our camp on a hunting excurtion; they were armed with bows and arrows and had decoys for the deer these are the skins of the heads and upper portions of the necks of the deer extended in their natural shape by means of a fraim of little sticks placed within. the hunter when he sees a deer conceals himself and with his hand gives to the decoy the action of a deer at feed; and thus induces the deer within arrowshot; in this mode the indians hunt on foot in the woodlands where they cannot pursue the deer with horses which is their favorite method when the ground will permit. we had all of our horses driven together today near our camp, which we have directed shall be done each day in order to familiarize them to each other. several of the horses which were gelded yesterday are much swolen particularly those cut by Drewyer, the others bled most but appear much better today than the others. We had our baggage better secured under a good shelter formed of grass; we also strengthened our little fortification with pine poles and brush, and the party formed themselves very comfortable tents with willow poles and grass in the form of the orning of a waggon, these were made perfectly secure as well from the heat of the sun as from rain. we had a bower constructed for ourselves under which we set by day and sleep under the part of an old sail now our only tent as the leather lodge has become rotten and unfit for use. about noon the sun shines with intense heat in the bottoms of the river. the air on the top of the river hills or high plain forms a distinct climate, the air is much colder, and vegitation is not as forward by at least 15 or perhaps 20 days. the rains which fall in the river bottoms are snows on the plain. at the distance of fifteen miles from the river and on the Eastern border of this plain the Rocky Mountains commence and present us with winter at it's utmost extreem. the snow is yet many feet deep even near the base of these mountains; here we have summer spring and winter within the short space of 15 or 20 miles. Hohâstillpilp and the three old men being unable to pass the river as the canoe had been taken away, returned to our camp late in the evening and remained with us all night. [Clark:] Thursday 15th. of May 1806 This morning Reubin Fields went out to hunt his horse very early and saw a large bear and no great distance from Camp. Several men went in pursute of the bear, and prosued his trail some time without gitting sight of this monster. Shannon went out with Labeach to hunt and continued out 3 days, Gibson and Hall accompanied them for the meat Labeech killed yesterday which they brought in by 11 A. M. this morning the female was black with white hares intermixed and a white spot on the breast the Cubs were about the size of a dog also pore. one of them very black and the other a light redish brown or bey colour. These bear give me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this country being one specie only, than any I have heretofore had. Several other colours have been seen. Drewyer and Peter Crusat went up the river. John Shields, R. Fields and Willard hunted in the hills near camp and returned before 2 P. M. without killing any thing except a fiew Grows. they saw but few deer. some bear sign. Frazur Jo. Fields and Peter Wizer complain of a violent pain in their heads. Howard and York with violent cholicks. the cause of those disorders we are unable to account for. their diet and the sudin change of climate must contribute. The Great Chief Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt (or broken arm) and 12 of the young men of his nation left us to day about 11 oClock and crossed the river to his Village Hoh-hâst-ill-pilt and 3 old men continued with us untill about 5 P.M. when they left us and returned to their village. a party of 14 Indians passed our camp about 1 P M on their way to the leavel uplands to run and kill the deer with their horses and Bows and arrows. Some of them were also provided with deers heads cased for the purpose of decoying the deer. those men continued with us but a fiew minits and proceeded on. Those people hunt most commonly on horse back seround the Deer or Goat which they find in the open plains &amp; kill them with their arrows, tho' they sometimes hunt the deer on foot &amp; decoy them. we had all of our horses drove together to day with a view to fermilurize them to each other. those that were cut yesterday are stiff and several of them much swelled. we had all our baggage secured and covered with a rouf of straw. our little fortification also completely secured with brush around which our camp is formed. the Greater part of our security from the rains &amp;c. is the grass which is formed in a kind of ruff so as to turn the rain completely and is much the best tents we have.1 1 The Chopunnish made wickiups of brush and grass, which were impervious to rain. See Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clark, ii, p. 272.—Ed. as the days are worm &amp;c.. we have a bowry made to write under which we find not only comfortable but necessary, to keep off the intence heet of the sun which has great effect in this low bottom. on the high plains off the river the climate is entirely different cool, some snow on the north hill sides near the top and vegetation near 3 weeks later than in the river bottoms, and the rocky Mountains imediately in view covered several say 4 &amp; 5 feet deep with snow. here I behold three different climats within a fiew miles a little before dark Hoh-hâst-ill-pilt and the 3 old men &amp; one other returned to our camp and informed us the canoe was a great way off and they could not cross this evening. [Lewis:] Friday May 16th. 1806. Drewyer's horse left his camp last night and was brought to us this morning by an indian who informed us he had found him a considerable distance towards the mountains. Hohâstillpilp and all the natives left us about noon and informed us that they were going up the river some distance to a place at which they expected to find a canoe, we gave them the head and neck of a bear, a part of which they eat and took the ballance with them. these people sometimes kill the variagated bear when they can get them in the open plain where they can pursue them on horseback and shoot them with their arrows. the black bear they more frequently kill as they are less ferocious. our sick men are much better today. Sahcargarweah geathered a quantity of the roots of a speceis of fennel which we found very agreeable food, the flavor of this root is not unlike annis seed,2 2 Carum gairdneri, mentioned also Aug. 26, 1805.—C. V, Piper. and they dispell the wind which the roots called Cows and quawmash are apt to create particularly the latter. we also boil a small onion which we find in great abundance, with other roots and find them also an antidote to the effects of the others. the mush of roots we find adds much to the comfort of our diet. we sent out several hunters this morning but they returned about 11 A.M. without success; they killed a few pheasants only. at 5 P.M. Drewyer and Cruzatte returned having killed one deer only. Drewyer had wounded three bear which he said were as white as sheep but had obtained neither of them. they informed us that the hunting was but bad in the quarter they had been, the country was broken and thickly covered in most parts with underbrush. a little after dark Shannon and Labuish returned with one deer; they informed us that game was wild and scarce, that a large creek (Collins' Creek)1 1 The Nahwah River, also known as the Lolo Fork of the Clearwater.—Ed. ran parallel with the river at the distance of about 5 or 6 miles which they found impracticable to pass with their horses in consequence of the debth and rapidity of it's current. beyond this creek the Indians inform us that there is great abundance of game. Sergt. Pryor and Collins who set out this morning on a hunting excurtion did not return this evening. I killed a snake near our camp, it is 3 feet 11 Inches in length, is much the colour of the rattlesnake common to the middle atlantic states, it has no poisonous teeth. it has 218 scutæ on the abdomen and fifty nine squamæ or half formed scutæ on the tail. the eye is of moderate size, the iris of a dark yellowish brown and puple black. there is nothing remarkable in the form of the head which is not so wide across the jaws as those of the poisonous class of snakes usually are. I preserved the skin of this snake. [Clark:] Friday 16th11 May 1806 a cloudy morning with some rain which continued untill meridian at intervals, but very moderately. a man and boy came to our camp at 11 A.M with Drewyers Horse which he informed us he found at a long distance towards the Mtns. this horse must have strayed from Drewyers Camp last night. Hohhastillpelt and all the nativs left us at merdn. and went up the river with a view to cross at some distance above where they expected to find a canoe. we gave those people a head and neck of the largest bear a part of which they eate and the balance they carefully took with them for their children. The Indians of this country seldom kill the bear they are very much afraid of them and the killing of a White or Grizly bear, is as great a feet as two of their enimey. the fiew of those animals which they chance to kill is found in the leavel open lands and pursued on horses &amp; killed with their Arrows. they are fond of the flesh of this animal and eate imoderately of it when they have a sufficiency to indulge themselves. The men who were complaining of the head ake and cholick yesterday and last night are much better to day. Shabonos Squar gathered a quantity of fenel roots which we find very paliatiable and nurushing food. the onion we also find in abundance and boil it with our meat. Shields rode out and hunted in the morning without suckcess he returned at 11 A.M. having killed only a black wood pecker with a red breast as discribed hereafter. a snake which resembles the rattle snake in colour and spots on the skin, longer and inosent. at 5 P M Dreyer and Crusat returned haveing killed only one Deer only. D. shot 3 white bear but could get neither of them. they inform us that the hunting in the direction they were is very bad. the country hilly &amp; brushey. a little after dark Shannon &amp; Labiech came in from the chas[e]. Shannon killed one deer which he brought in. this deer being the only animal they could kill. they informed that a large Creek (Collin's Creek) run parrelal with the river at about 5 or 6 miles distant between which there was but little game, and the Creek being high rapid and the smothe rocks in the bottom rendered it impossible for them to pass it on horsback. Sergt. Pryor and Collins who set out early this morning hunting have not returned. we derected that the horses be drove up in future at 12 oClock on each day. [Lewis:] Saturday May 17th. 1806. It rained the greater part of the last night and this morning untill 8 OCk. the water passed through [the] flimzy covering and wet our bed most perfectly in sho[r]t we lay in the water all the latter part of the night. unfortunately my chronometer which for greater security I have woarn in my fob for ten days past, got wet last night; it seemed a little extraordinary that every part of my breechies which were under my head, should have escaped the moisture except the fob where the time peice was. I opened it and founded [it] nearly filled with water which I carefully drained out exposed it to the air and wiped the works as well as I could with dry feathers after which I touched them with a little bears oil. several parts of the iron and steel works were rusted a little which I wiped with all the care in my power. I set her to going and from her apparent motion hope she has sustained no material injury. at 9 A.M. Sergt. Pryor and Collins returned, Sergt. Pryor brought the Skin and flesh of a black bear which he had killed; Collins had also killed a very large variegated bear but his horse having absconded last evening was unable to bring it. they had secured this meat perfectly from the wolves or birds and as it was at a considerable distance we did not think proper to send for it today. neither of these bear were in good order. as the bear are reather ferocious and we are obliged to depend on them pincipally for our subsistence we thought it most advisable to direct at least two hunters to go together, and they accordingly paired themselves out for this purpose. we also apportioned the horses to the several hunters in order that they should be equally rode and thereby prevent any horse being materially injured by being too constantly hunted. we appointed the men not hunters to take charge of certain horses in the absence of the hunters and directed the hunters to set out in different directions early in the morning and not return untill they had killed some game. it rained moderately the greater part of the day and snowed as usual on the plain. Sergt. Pryor informed me that it was shoe deep this morning when he came down. it is somewhat astonishing that the grass and a variety of plants which are now from a foot to 18 inches high on these plains sustain no injury from the snow or frost; many of those plants are in blume and appear to be of a tender susceptable texture. we have been visited by no indians today, an occurrence which has not taken place before since we left the Narrows of the Columbia. I am pleased at finding the river rise so rapidly, it now doubt is attributeable to the me[l]ting snows of the mountains; that icy barier which seperates me from my friends and Country, from all which makes life esteemable.—patience, patience1 1 In the weather diary for this date (Codex K, pp. 147, 148), Lewis wrote: "the Indians caught 3 salmon at their village on the Kooskooske above our camp some miles. they say that these fish are now passing by us is great numbers, but that they cannot be caught a yet because those which first ascend the river do not keep near shore; they further inform us that in the course of a few days the fish run near the shore and then they take them with their skimming neetts in great numbers."—Ed. [Clark:] Saturday 17th. May 1806 rained moderately all the last night and this morning untill, we are wet. The little river on which we are encamped rise sepriseingly fast. at 9 A.M. Sergt. Pryor and Collins returned with the flesh and skin of a Black bear on Sgt. Pryors horse, Coilins's horse haveing run off from him yesterday. they informed us that they had each killed a Bear neither of which were fat. the one which they left in the woods was of the white species and very large we did not think it necessary in the cours of this day to send for the flesh of the bear left in the woods. the rains of the last night unfortunately wet the Crenomuter in the fob of Capt. L. breaches, which has never before been wet since we set out on this expedition. her works were cautiously wiped and made dry by Capt. L. and I think she will receve no injury from this misfortune &amp;c. we arranged the hunters and horses to each hunter and directed them to turn out in the morning early and continue out untill they killed something. others arranged so as to take care of the hunters horses in their absence. rained moderately all day. at the same time snowed on the mountains which is in to the S. E. of us. no Indians visit us to day which is a singular circumstance as we have not been one day without Indians since we left the long narrows of the Columbia. the fiew worm days which we have had has melted the snows in the mountains and the river has rose considerably. that icy barier which seperates me from my friends and Country, from all which makes life estimable, is yet white with the snow which is maney feet deep. I frequently consult the nativs on the subject of passing this tremendious barier which now present themselves to our view for [a] great extent. they all appear to agree as to the time those mountains may be passed which is about the middle of June. Sergt. Pryor informs me that the snow on the high plains from the river was shoe deep this morning when he came down. it is somewhat estonishing that the grass and a variety of Plants sustain no injurey from the snow or frost; maney of those plants are in blume and appear to be of tender susceptable texture. At the distance of 18 miles from the river and on the Eastern border of the high Plain the Rocky Mountain commences and presents us with Winter here we have Summer, Spring and winter in the short space of twenty or thirty miles. [Lewis:] Sunday May 18th. 1806. Twelve hunters turned out this morning in different directions agreeably to the order of last evening. Potts and Whitehouse accompanied Collins to the bear he had killed on the 16th. inst. with which they returned in the afternoon. the colours of this bear was a mixture of light redish brown white and dark brown in which the bey or redish brown predominated, the fur was bey as well as the lower portion of the long hairs, the white next succeeded in the long hairs which at their extremit[i]es were dark brown, this uncommon mixture might be termed a bey grizzle. our indian woman was busily engaged today in laying in a store of the fennel roots for the Rocky mountains. these are called by the Shoshones Year-pah. at 2 P.M. 3 Indians who had been hunting towards the place at which we met with Chopunnish last fall, called by them the quawmash ground, called at our camp; they informed us that they had been hunting several days and had killed nothing; we gave them a small peice of meat which they told us they would reserve for their small children who were very hungary; we smoked with them and they shortly after departed. early this morning the natives erected a lodge on the opposite side of the river near a fishing stand a little above us. no doubt to be in readiness for the salmon, the arrival of which they are so ardently wishing as well as ourselves. this stand is a small stage ore warf constructed of sticks and projecting about 10 feet into the river and about 3 feet above the surface of the water on the extremity of this the fisherman stands with his scooping net, which differ but little in their form from those commonly used in our country it is formed thus the fisherman exercised himself some hours today but I believe without success. at 3 P.M. J. Fields returned, very unwell having killed nothing. shortly after an old man and woman arrived; the former had soar eyes and the latter complained of a lax and rheumatic effections. we gave the woman some creem of tartar and flour of sulpher, and washed the oldman's eyes with a little eyewater. a little before dark Drewyer R. Fields and LaPage returned having been also unsuccessfull they had killed a hawk only and taken the part of a salmon from an Eagle, the latter altho' it was of itself not valuable was an agreeable sight as it gave us reason to hope that the salmon would shortly be with us. these hunters had scowered the country between the Kooskooske and Collins's Creek from hence to their junction about 10 miles and had seen no deer or bear and but little sign of either. shortly after dark it began to rain and continued raining moderately all night. the air was extreemly cold and disagreeable and we lay in the water as the preceeding night. [Clark:] Sunday 18th11 May 1806 Cloudy morning 12 hunters turned out this morning in different directions agreeably to the order of yesterday. Potts and Whitehouse accompanied Collins to the bear which he had killed on the 16th. and brought in the flesh and skins. this bear was not large but remarkably light coloured the hair of it as also the hair of all those which has been killed is very thick and long. The Squar wife to Shabono busied her self gathering the roots of the fenel called by the Snake Indians Year-pah for the purpose of drying to eate on the Rocky mountains. those roots are very paliatiable either fresh rosted boiled or dried and are generally between the size of a quill and that of a mans fingar and about the length of the latter. at 2 P. M. 3 Indians who had been out hunting towards the place we met with the Chopunnish last fall, which place they call the quarmash grounds. those men had been out several days and killed nothing. we gave them a small piece of meat which they told us they would reserve for their small children who was very hungary. we smoked with them and they departed. The nativs made a lodge on the opposit bank of the river a little above us at a fishing place. as all communication is cut off between us and the nativs on the opposit side of the river, we cannot say by whome or for what service that lodge has been errected as no one has been near it since it was errected this morning. at 3 P M Jo. Field returned from the chase without killing any thing he complains of being unwell. so[o]n after an old man and a woman arived the man with sore eyes, and woman with a gripeing and rhumatic effections. I gave the woman a dose of creme of tarter and flour of Sulphur, and the man some eye water. a little before night Rueben Field Drewyer and Lapage returned haveing killed nothing but a large hawk they had hunted in the point between the Kooskooske and Collins's Creek and saw but little sign of either deer or Bear. the evening Cloudy, soon after dark it began to rain and rained moderately all night. Lapage took a Salmon from an Eagle at a short distance below our camp. this is induces us to believe that the Salmon is in this river and most probably will be here in great numbers in the course of a fiew days. [Lewis:] Monday May 19th. 1806. It continued to rain this morning untill 8.OCk. when it became fair. We sent Charbono, Thompson, Potts, Hall and Wiser over the river to a village above in order to purchase some roots to eat with our lean bear meat. for this purpose we gave them a few awls, Kniting pins and Armbands. we were informed that there was a canoe at the village in which they could pass the river. I sent Joseph and R. Feilds up the river in surch of the horse which I rode over the Rocky mountains last fall. he had been seen yesterday with a parsel of indian horses and has become almost wild. at 11 A.M. Thompson returned from the village accompanyed by a train of invalids consisting of 4 men 8 women and a child. The men had soar eyes and the women in addition to soar eyes had a variety of other complaints principally rheumatic; a weakness and pain in the loins is a common complaint with their women. eyewater was administered to all; to two of the women cathartics were given, to a third who appeared much dejected and who from their account of her disease we supposed it to be histerical, we gave 30 drops of Laudanum. the several parts of the others where the rheumatic pains were seated were well rubed with volitile linniment. all of those poor wretches thought themselves much benefited, and all returned to their village well satisfyed. at 5 P.M. o[u]r marketers returned with about 6 bushels of the cows roots and a considerable quan[ti]ty of bread of the same materials. late in the evening Reubin and Joseph Feilds returned with my horse; we had him immediately castrated together with two others by Drewyer in the ordinary [way]. we amused ourselves about an hour this afternoon in looking at the men running their horses. several of those horses would be thought fleet in the U States. a little after dark Sheilds and Gibson returned unsuccessfull from the chase. they had seen some deer but no bear. [Clark:] Monday 19th11 May 1806 Rained this morning untill 8 oClock when it cleared off and became fair. We sent Shabono, Thomson, Potts, Hall &amp; Wizer over to the Villages above to purchase some roots to eate with our pore bear meat, for which purchase we gave them a fiew awls, knitting pins, &amp; arm ban[d]s and directed them to proceed up on this side of the river opposit to the Village and cross in the cano[e] which we are informed is at that place. sent Jo. &amp; Reuben Field up the river a short distance after the horse which Capt. Lewis rode over the mountains last fall, which horse was seen yesterday with a gangue of Indian horses, and is very wild. about 11 oClock 4 men and 8 women came to our camp with Thompson who went to the Village very early this morning. those men applyed for Eye water and the Women had a variety of Complaints tho' the most general complaint was the Rhumitism, pains in the back and the sore eyes, they also brought fowd. a very young Child whome they said had been very sick. I administered eye water to all, two of the women I gave a carthartic, one whose spirets were very low and much hiped1 1 According to the Century Dictionary, "hipped" is the past participle of the verb "hip," meaning to become melancholy or mopish.—Ed. I gave 30 drops of Lodomem, and to the others I had their backs hips legs thighs &amp; arms well rubed with Volitile leniment all of those pore people thought themselves much benifited by what had been done for them, and at 3 P. M. they all returned to their Villages well satisfied. at 5 P. M. Potts, Shabono &amp;c. returned from the Village with about 6 bushels of the root the nativs call cowse and some bread of the same root. Rubin &amp; Jos. Fields returned with the horse Capt. Lewis rode across the rocky mountains we had this horse imediately cut with 2 others which we had not before thought proper to castrate. we amused ourselves about an hour this after noon looking at the men run their horses, several of them would be thought swift horses in the atlantic states. a little after dark John Shields and Gibson returned haveing killed nothing. they saw some deer but saw no bear. [Lewis:] Tuesday May 20th. 1806. It rained the greater part of last night and continued this morning untill noon when it cleared away about an hour and then rained at intervals untill 4 in the evening. our covering is so indifferent that Capt. C. and myself lay in the water the greater part of the last night. Drewyer, and the two Feildses set out on a hunting excurtion towards the mountains. Shannon and Colter came in unsuccessfull, they had wounded a bear and a deer last evening but the night coming on they were unable to pursue them, and the snow which fell in the course of the night and this morning had covered the blood and rendered all further pursuit impracticable. at 2 P.M. Labuish arrived with a large buck of the Mule deer speceis which he had killed on Collins's Creek yesterday. he had left Cruzatte and Collins on the Creek where they were to wait his return. he informed us that it was snowing on the plain while it was raining at our camp in the river bottom. late in the evening Labuish and LaPage set out to join Collins and Cruzatte in order to resume their hunt early tomorrow morning. this evening a party of indians assembled on the opposite bank of the river and viewed our camp with much attention for some time and retired. at 5 P.M. Frazier who had been permitted to go to the village this morning returned with a pa[r]sel of Roots and bread which he had purchased. brass buttons is an article of which these people are tolerably fond, the men have taken advantage of their prepossession in favour of buttons and have devested themselves of all they had in possesson which they have given in exchange for roots and bread. [Clark:] Tuesday 20th. May 1806 rained the greater part of the last night and this morning untill meridian when it cleared away for an hour and began to rain and rained at intervals untill 4 P. M. our covering was so indefferent that Capt Lewis and myself was wet in our bed all the latter part of the night. Drewyer, Jos. &amp; R. Fields set out towards the mountains. Shannon &amp; Colter came in without any thing. they had seen and Shot at a Bear and a Deer neither of which they could get. both of those Animals they must have Wounded Mortally, but the night comeing on prevented their following them, and this morning the snow had covered the tracks and hid the blood and prevented their getting either of them. at 2 P. M. Labiech came in with a large Buck of the Mule Deer Speces which he had killed on Collins's Creek yesterday. he left Collins and Peter Crusat on the Creek at which place they would continue untill his return. he informed us that it was snowing on the leavel plains on the top of the hill all the time it was raining in the bottom at our camp. Labiech &amp; Lapage returned to Collins &amp; Crusat in the evening late for the purpose of Pursueing the hunt in the morning early. Several Indians came to the opposit side of the River and viewed us some time. at 5 P M Frazur who had leave to go to the village returned with some roots which he had purchased. cloudy &amp;c. [Lewis:] Wednesday May 21st. 1806. It rained a few hours this morning. Sheilds and Gibson set out to hunt towards the mountains. Collins came to camp at noon and remained about 2 hours; he has killed nothing since he left us last. we set five men at work to make a canoe for the purpose of fishing and passing the river. the Indians have already promised us a horse for this canoe when we have no longer any uce for her. as our tent was not sufficient to shelter us from the rain we had a lodge constructed of willow poles and grass in the form of the orning of a waggon closed at one end. this we had made sufficiently large to sleep in and to shelter the most important part of our baggage. it is perfectly secure against the rain sun and wind and affords us much the most comfortable shelter we have had since we left Fort Clatsop. today we divided the remnant of our store of merchandize among our party with a view that each should purchase therewith a parsel of roots and bread from the natives as his stores for the rocky mountains for there seems but little probability that we shall be enabled to make any dryed meat for that purpose and we cannot as yet form any just idea what resource the fish will furnish us. each man's stock in trade amounts to no more than one awl, one Knitting pin, a half an ounce of vermillion, two nedles, a few scanes of th[r]ead and about a yard of ribbon; a slender stock indeed with which to lay in a store of provision for that dreary wilderness. we would make the men collect these roots themselves but there are several speceis of hemlock1 1 The water-hemlock (or poison hemlock), a poisonous plant—belonging, as does the kouse (Peucedanum), to the order Umbelliferœ.—Ed. which are so much like the cows that it is difficult to discriminate them from the cows and we are affraid that they might poison themselves. the indians have given us another horse to kill for provision which we keep as a reserved store. our dependence for subsistence is on our guns, the fish we may perhaps take, the roots we can purchase from the natives and as the last alternative our horses. we eat the last morsel of meat which we had for dinner this evening, yet nobody seems much conserned about the state of provision. Willard, Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich were permitted to visit the village today; the former returned in the evening with some roots and bread, the two last remaining all night. one of our party brought in a young sandhill crain it was about the size of a pateridge and of a redish brown colour, it appeared to be about 5 or six days old; these crains are abundant in this neighbourhood.1 1 Probably the ordinary Grus canadensis.—Ed. [Clark:] Wednesday 21st11 May 1806. rained this morning. Shields and Gibson set out to hunt towards the mountains. Collins came in to day and stayed in about two hours. he has killed nothing since he went out last. we set 5 men at work to build a canoe for the purpose of takeing fish and passing the river and for which we can get a good horse. as our tent is not sufficient to keep off the rain we are compelled to have some other resort for a security from the repeeted showers which fall. we have a small half circular place made and covered with grass which makes a very secure shelter for us to sleep under. we divided our store of merchindize amongst our party for the purpose of precureing some roots &amp;c. of the nativs to each mans part amounted to about an awl knitting pin a little paint and some thread &amp; 2 Needles which is but a scanty dependance for roots to take us over those Great snowey Barriers (rocky mountains) which is and will be the cause of our Detention in this neighbourhood probably untill the 10 or 15 of June. they are at this time covered deep with snow. the plains on the high country above us is also covered with snow. Serjt. Ordway, Goodrich, &amp; Willard went to the village to day to precure a fiew roots. we eate the last of our meat for Dinner to day, and our only certain dependance is the roots we can precure from the nativs for the fiew articles we have left those roots with what game we can precure from the wo[o]ds will probably last us untill the arival of the Salmon. if they should not; we have a horse in store ready to be killed which the indians have offered to us. Willard returned from the village. Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich continued all night. one of the men brought me a young sandhill crain which was about 5 or 6 days old it was of a yellowish brown colour, about the size of a partridge. Those crains are very abundant in every part of this country in pars of two, and sometimes three together. [Lewis:] Thursday May 22nd 1806. A fine morning we exposed all our baggage to air and dry as well as our store of roots and bread purchased from the natives. permited Windsor and Mc.Neal to go to the indian village. Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich returned this morning with a good store of roots and bread. about noon 2 indian men came down the river on a raft and continued at our camp about 3 hours and returned to their village. we sent out Shannon and Colter to hunt towards the mountains. we sent Sergt. Pryor down to the entrance of Collins's Creek to examine the country and look out for a good position for an encampment on the river below that Creek, having determined to remove our camp below that crek if it continues high, as soon as we have completed our canoe, as the country to which we are confined to hunt at present is limited by this creek and river to a very narrow tract, and game have already become scarce. if we can obtain a good situation below the entrance of this creek it will be much more eligible as the hunting country is more extensive and game more abundant than above. The horse which the indians have given us to kill was driven away yesterday by the natives with a gang of their horses I presume in mistake; being without meat at noon we directed one of the largest of our colts to be killed. we found the flesh of this animal fat tender and by no means illy flavoured. we have three others which we mean to reserve for the rocky mountains if we can subsist here without them. my horse which was castrated the day before yesterday wounded his thigh on the inner side with the rope by which he was confined that evening and is now so much swolen with the wound the castraiting and the collection of vermen that he cannot walk, in short he is the most wretched specticle; I had his wounds clensed of the vermen by washing them well with a strong decoction of the bark of the roots &amp; leaves of elder but think the chances are against his recovery. at 3 P.M. we observed a large party of Indians on horseback in pursuit of a deer which they ran into the river opposite to our camp; Capt. C. Myself &amp; three of our men shot and killed the deer in the water; the indians pursued it on a raft and caught it. it is astonishing to see these people ride down those steep hills which they do at full speed.1 1 The frames of their saddles are made of wood nicely jointed, and then covered with raw skins which, when they become dry, bind every part tight, and keep the joints in their places. The saddles rise very high before and behind, in the manner of the saddles of the Spaniards, from whom they no doubt received the form; and also obtained their breed of horses. When the Indians are going to mount, they throw their buffaloe robes over the saddles and ride on them, as the saddles would otherwise be too hard.—Gass (p. 315). on our return to camp we found Drewyer the two Feildses Gibson and Sheilds just arrived with five deer which they had killed at a considerable distance towards the mountains. they also brought with them two red salmon trout which they had purchased from some indians whom they had met with on their return to camp. Two Indians who were just arrived at our camp informed us that these salmon trout remained in this river the greater part of the winter, that they were not good at this season which we readily discovered, they were very meagre. these indians also informed us that there were at this time a great number of salmon at no great distance from hence in Lewis's river which had just arrived and were very fat and fine, they said it would be some days yet before they would ascend this river as high as this place. a party of the natives on the opposite shore informed those with us that a party of the Shoshones had two nights past surrounded a lodge of their nation on the South side of Lewis's river, that the inhabitants having timely discovered the enimy effected their retreat in the course of the night and escaped. Charbono's Child is very ill this evening; he is cuting teeth, and for several days past has had a violent lax, which having suddonly stoped he was attacked with a high fever and his neck and throat are much swolen this evening. we gave him a doze of creem of tartar and flour of sulpher and applyed a poltice of boiled onions to his neck as warm as he could well bear it. Sergt. Pryor returned late in the evening and informed us that he had been down the river eight miles and that the clifts set in so abruptly to the river he could get no further without returning several miles back and ascending the hills and that he had thought it best to return and ride down tomorrow on the high plain as he believed the mouth of the creek was a considerable distance. Drewyer who has been at the place informs us that it is about 10 ms. and that there is no situation on the river for some distance below this creek which can possibly answer our purposes. we dryed our baggage &amp;c. perfectly and put it up. [Clark:] Thursday 22nd. May 1806 a fine day we exposed all our baggage to the sun to air and dry, also our roots which we have precured of the nativs. gave promission to Windser &amp; Mr Neal to go to the Indian Villages. Sergt. Ordway and Goodrich returned at 11 A. M. soon after 2 Indian men came down on a raft and continued with us about 3 hours and then returned to their village. Shannon &amp; Colter went out to day to hunt towards the mountains. Serjt. Pryor went out to hunt down the river, and examine the mouth of Collins Creek, if a good situation was below that creek for a camp. this creek which cannot be passed owing to it's debth &amp; rapidity is a great bearrer [barrier] in our way to the best hunting country. it confines us to a narrow scope between this creek and the river on which we are camped. If a situation can be found imediately below the creek it will answer us better than our present one as from there we can get out to some distance to hunt, and be convenient also to the fish should they pass up &amp;c. The horse the Indian's left with us to kill has been drove to their village with a gang of horses which I suppose belonged to enother man. as the greater part of our men have not had any meat to eate for 2 days, and the roots they complain of not being accustomed to live on them altogether we directed a large coalt which was given to us by a young man with an elegant mare on the [blank space in MS.] instant [to be killed]. this coalt was fat and was handsom looking meat. late in the evening we were informed that the horse which Capt L. rode over the rocky mountains and which was cut day before yesterday had his hip out of place since that time, and could not walk. Capt. Lewis examined him and thought he could not recover. at 3 P. M. we observed a number of Indians in chase of a deer on their horses on the opposit hill sides. soon after the deer took the water I Capt L. and 3 men run down on this side and killed the deer in the water, the deer floated down and the Indians took it by means of a raft which they had ready. on my return to camp found Drewyer Jos. &amp; Reuben Fields, Shields, and gibson just arrived from the chass with 5 Deer which they had killed on the high lands toward the mountains. they also brought with them two salmon trout which they had purchased of Indians which they saw on their return to camp. at 5 p. m. two young men highly decurated in their way came to our camp and informed us that the fat fish were in great numbers in Lewis's river. that those salmon trout which our hunters brought were pore and such as were cought in the winter in this river and were not the kind which comes up in the spring of the year. great number of Indians come to the opposit bank and inform those on this side that the Snake Indians had come to a Lodge on Lewis's river at night. the inhabitents previously discovering them abandened the house. Shabonos son a small child is dangerously ill.1 1 See letter of Clark to Charbonneau, in Appendix, vol. vii, wherein he expresses his affection for this child, and offers to adopt and educate him. Incidental references to his latter life have been collected by Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clark, i, pp. 128130. —Ed. his jaw and throat is much swelled. we apply a poltice of onions, after giveing him some creem of tarter &amp;c. this day proved to be fine and fair which afforded us an oppertunety of drying our baggage which had got a little wet. [Lewis:] Friday May 23rd. 1806. Sergt. Pryor wounded a deer early this morning in a lick near camp; my dog pursued it into the river; the two young Indian men who had remained with us all night mounted their horses swam the river and drove the deer into the water again; Sergt. Pryor killed it as it reached the shore on this side, the indians returned as they had passed over. we directed half this deer to be given to the indians, they immediately made a fire and cooked their meat, 4 others joined them from the village with the assistance of whom they consumed their portion of the spoil in less than 2 hours. and took their leave of our camp. the Creem of tartar and sulpher operated several times on the child in the course of the last night, he is considerably better this morning, tho' the swelling of the neck has abated but little; we still apply pol[t]ices of onions which we renew frequently in the course of the day and night. at noon we were visited by 4 indians who informed us they had come from their village on Lewis's river at the distance of two days ride in order to see us and obtain a little eyewater, Capt. C. washed their eyes and they set out on their return to their village. our skill as phisicians and the virtue of our medicines have been spread it seems to a great distance. I sincerely wish it was in our power to give releif to these poor aff[l]icted wretches. at 1. P.M. Shannon, Colter, Labuish, Cruzatte, Collins, and LaPage returned from hunting without having killed anything except a few pheasants of the dark brown kind, which they brought with them. These hunters informed us that they had hunted the country deligently betwen the river and Creek for some distance above and below our camp and that there was no game to be found. all the horses which have been castrated except my poor unfortunate horse appear as if they would do very well. I am convinced that those cut by the indians will get well much soonest and they do not swell nor appear to suffer as much as those cut in the common way.1 1 At this point ends Lewis's journal, as contained in Codex K; his Codex L continues the record.—Ed. [Clark:] Friday 23rd. May 1806 a fair morning. Sergt. Pryor wounded a Deer at a lick near our camp and our dog prosued it into the river. two Indians which happened to be at our camp Mounted their horses and swam across the river chased the deer into the water again and pursued it across to the side on which we were, and as the Deer came out of the water Sgt. Pryor killed it. we derected half of this deer to be given to those two indians. they imediately made a fire and cooked the meat. 4 others joined them from the village and they soon consumed their portion. The child is something better this morning than it was last night. we apply a fresh poltice of the wild Onion which we repeeted twice in the course of the day. the swelling does not appear to increas any since yesterday. The 4 Indians who visited us to day informed us that they came from their village on Lewis's river two days ride from this place for the purpose of seeing of us and getting a little eye water I washed their eyes with some eye water and they all left us at 2 P. M. and returned to the villages on the opposit side of this river. at 1 oClock Shannon, Colter, Labiech, Crusatt Lapage and Collins all returned from hunting without haveing killed any thing except a fiew heath hens &amp; black Pheasants two of which they brought with them. Labiech also brought a whisteling squirel which he had killed on it's hole in the high plains. this squirel differs from those on the Missouri in their colour, size, food and the length [of] ta[i]l and from those found near the falls of Columbia2 2 See description, May 27, post.—Ed. our hunters brought us a large hooting owl which differ from those of the Atlantic states. The plumage of this owl is an uniform mixture of dark yellowish brown and white, in which the dark brown prodominates. it's colour may be properly termed a dark Iron gray. the plumage is very long and remarkably silky and soft. those have not the long feathers on the head which give it the appearance of ears or horns. remarkable large eyes. the hunters informed us that they had hunted with great industry all the country between the river and for some distance above and below without the smallest chance of killing any game. they inform us that the high lands are very cold with snow which has fallen for every day or night for several [days] past. our horses which was cut is like to doe well. [Lewis:] Saturday May 24th. 1806. The child was very wrestless last night; it's jaw and the back of it's neck are much more swolen than they were yesterday tho' his fever has abated considerably. we gave it a doze of creem of tartar and applyed a fresh poltice of onions. we ordered some of the hunters out this morning and directed them to pass Collins's creek if possible and hunt towards the quawmash feilds. William Bratton still continues very unwell; he eats heartily digests his food well, and has recovered his flesh almost perfectly yet is so weak in the loins that he is scarcely able to walk, nor can he set upwright but with the greatest pain. we have tried every remidy which our engenuity could devise, or with which our stock of medicines furnished us, without effect. John Sheilds observed that he had seen men in a similar situation restored by violent sweats. Bratton requested that he might be sweated in the manner proposed by Sheilds to which we consented. Sheilds sunk a circular hole of 3 feet diamiter and four feet deep in the earth. he kindled a large fire in the hole and heated well, after which the fire was taken out a seat placed in the center of the hole for the patient with a board at bottom for his feet to rest on; some hoops of willow poles were bent in an arch crossing each other over the hole, on these several blankets were thrown forming a secure and thick orning of about 3 feet high. the patient being striped naked was seated under this orning in the hole and the blankets well secured on every side. the patient was furnished with a vessell of water which he sprinkles on the bottom and sides of the hole and by that means creates as much steam or vapor as he could possibly bear, in this situation he was kept about 20 minutes after which he was taken out and suddonly plunged in cold water twise and was then immediately returned to the sweat hole where he was continued three quarters of an hour longer then taken out covered up in several blankets and suffered to cool gradually. during the time of his being in the sweat hole, he drank copious draughts of a strong tea of horse mint. Sheilds says that he had previously seen the tea of Sinneca snake root used in stead of the mint which was now employed for the want of the other which is not to be found in this country.1 1 Professor Piper says that Lophanthus urticæfolius, Benth., is the only large mint of this region. The Seneca snake-root (Polygala senega) has its habitat in the eastern United States.—Ed. this experiment was made yesterday; Bratton feels himself much better and is walking about today and says he is nearly free from pain. at 11 A. M. a canoe arrived with 3 of the natives one of them the sick man of whom I have before made mention as having lost the power of his limbs. he is a cheif of considerable note among them and they seem extreemly anxious for his recovery. as he complains of no pain in any particular part we conceive it cannot be the rheumatism, nor do we suppose that it can be a parelitic attack or his limbs would have been more deminished. we have supposed that it was some disorder which owed it's origine to a diet of particular roots perhaps and such as we have never before witnessed. while at the village of the broken arm we had recommended a diet of fish or flesh for this man and the cold bath every morning. we had also given him a few dozes of creem of tarter and flour of sulpher to be repeated every 3d. day. this poor wretch thinks that he feels himself somewhat better but to me there appears to be no visible alteration. we are at a loss what to do for this unfortunate man. we gave him a few drops of Laudanum and a little portable soup. 4 of our party pased the river and visited the lodge of the broken Arm for the purpose of traiding some awls which they had made of the links of [a] small chain belonging to one of their steel traps, for some roots. they returned in the evening having been very successfull, they had obtained a good supply of roots and bread of cows.1 1 Our stock of provisions is exhausted, and we have nothing to eat but some roots, which we get from the natives at a very dear rate.—Gass (p. 317). this day has proved warmer than any of the preceeding since we have arrived here. [Clark:] Saturday 24th. May 1806 a fine morning the Child was very restless last night its jaw and back of its neck is much more swelled than it was yesterday. I gave it a dost of creme of Tarter and a fresh Poltice of Onions. ordered Shields, Gibson, Drewyer, Crusat, Collins, and Jo. &amp; rubin Fields to turn out hunting and if possible cross Collins Creek and hunt towards the quarmash fields. W. Brattin is yet very low he eats hardly but he is so weak in the small of his back that he can't walk. we have made use of every remedy to restore him without it's haveing the desired effect. one of our party, John Shields observed that he had seen men in similar situations restored by violent swets, and bratten requested that he might be Swetted in the way Shields purposed which we agreed to. Shields dug a round hole 4 feet deep &amp; 3 feet Diamuter in which he made a large fire so as to heet the hole after which the fire was taken out a seet placed in the hole, the pat[i]ent was then set on the seat with a board under his feet and a can of water handed him to throw on the bottom &amp; sides of the hole so as to create as greate a heat as he could bear and the hole covered with blankets supported by hoops. after about 20 minits the patient was taken out and put in cold water a few minits, &amp; returned to the hole in which he was kept about 1 hour. then taken out and covered with several blankets, which was taken off by degrees untill he became cool. this remedy took place yesterday and bratten is walking about to day and is much better than he has been. at 11 A. M. a canoe came down with the Indian man who had applyed for medical assistance while we lay at the broken arms village. this man I had given a fiew doses of Flower of Sulphur &amp; creme of Tarter and derected that he should take the Cold bath every morning. he conceited himself a little better than he was at that time. he had lost the use of all his limbs and his fingers are contracted. We are at a loss to deturmine what to do for this unfortunate man. I gave him a fiew drops of Lodmen and some portable Supe as medisine. 4 of our men crossed the river and went to the broken arms village and returned in the evening with a supply of bread and roots which they precured in exchange for Awls which were made of pieces of a chane. we were visited to day by the 2 young men who gave Capt L. and my self a horse each at the village. those men stayed about two hours and returned to their village. this day proved to be very worm. [Lewis:] Sunday May 25th. 1806. It rained the greater part of last night and continued untill 6 A. M. our grass tent is impervious to the rain. the Child is more unwell than yesterday. we gave it a doze of creem of tartar which did not operate, we therefore gave it a clyster in the evening. we caused a sweat to be prepared for the indian Cheif in the same manner in which Bratton had been sweated, this we attempted but were unable to succeed, as he was unable to set up or be supported in the place. we informed the indians that we knew of no releif for him except sweating him in their sweat houses and giving him a plenty of the tea of the horse mint which we shewed them. and that this would probably not succeed as he had been so long in his present situation. I am confident that this would be an excellent subject for electricity and much regret that I have it not in my power to supply it. Drewyer Labuish and Cruzatte set out this morning to hunt towards the quawmash grounds if they can possibly pass Collins's Creek. Joseph and Reuben Feilds passed the river in order to hunt on the opposite side some miles above where the natives inform us there is an abundance of bear and some deer. Goodrich visited a village about 8 ms. above on the opposite side of the river and returned in the evening; he procured but few roots, he informed us that there were but 8 persons at home; the others were either hunting, diging roots or fishing on Lewis's river. he saw several salmon in their lodges which they informed him came from that river these fish were remarkably fat and fine. Gibson and Shields returned this evening having killed a Sandhill Grain only they had wounded a female bear and a deer but got neither of them. Gibson informed me that the bear had two cubbs one of which was white and the other as black as jett. four indians remained with us this evening. Point of observation No. 56. May 25th. 1806.

The clouds which had inte[r]fered during this observation now obscured boath sun and moon. [Clark:] Sunday 25h. May 1806 rained moderately the greater part of last night and this morning untill 6 A.M. The child is not so well to day as yesterday. I repeeted the creem of tarter and the onion poltice. I caused a swet to be prepared for the Indn. in the same hole which bratten had been swetted in two days past Drewyer Labiech and Peter crusatt set out hunting towards the quarmash grounds if they can cross the Creek which is between this and that place, which has been the bearrier as yet to our hunters. Jos. &amp; R Fields crossed the river to hunt on the opposit side. Goodrich went to the 2d. village to purchase roots a fiew of which he precured. he informed us that only 8 persons remained in the village, the men were either hunting on Lewis's river fishing, &amp; the women out digging roots. he saw several fresh Salmon which the nativs informed him came from Lewis's river and were fat and fine. One of our men purchased a Bear skin of the nativs which was nearly of a cream coloured white. this skin which was the skin of an animal of the middle size of bears together with the different sizes colours &amp;c. of those which have been killed by our hunters give me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this country being one species only, than any I have heretofore had. the poil of these bear were infinately longer finer &amp; thicker than the black bear their tallons also longer &amp; more blunt as worn by digging roots, the white redish brown and bey coloured bear I saw together on the Missouri; the bey &amp; Grizly have been seen and killed together here. for these were the colours of those which Collins killed on the 14th. inst. in short it is not common to find two bear here of this species precisely of the same colour, and if we were to attempt to distinguish them by their colours and to denomonate each colour a distinct species we should soon find at least twenty. the most striking difference between this species of bear and the common black bear are that the former are large and have longer tallens, hair, and tushes, prey more on other animals, do not lie so long or so closely in winter quarters, and will not climb a tree, tho' ever so hardly pursued. the varigated bear I believe to be the same here with those of the Missouri but these are not so ferocious as those on the Missouri perhaps from the circumstance of their being compeled from the scercity of game in this quarter to live more on roots and of course not so much in the habit of seizing and devowering liveing animals. the bear here is far from being as passive as the common black bear, they have atacked and fought our hunters already but not so fiercely as those of the Missouri. There are also some of the common black bear in this neighbourhood tho no[t] so common as the other species. we attempted to swet the sick indian but could not suckceed. he was not able either to set up or be supported in the place prepared for him. I therefore deturmined to inform the nativs that nothing but sefere [severe] swetts would restore this disabled man, and even that doubtfull in his present situation. in the evening Shields &amp; gibson returned haveing killed a sandhill crane only. they saw a female bear, &amp; 2 cubs &amp; several deer. they shot the bear and a deer both of which made their escape. Gibson told me that the cubs were of different colours one jut black and the other of a whiteish colour. 4 indians continue with us, one return to their village to day. [Lewis:] Monday May 26th. 1806. Had frequent showers in the course of the last night. Collins, Shannon and Colter set out to hunt on the high lands some distance up on the N. E. side of Collins's Creek. The Clyster given the Child last evening operated very well. it is clear of fever this evening and is much better, the swelling is considerably abated and appears as if it would pass off without coming to a head. we still continue fresh poltices of onions to the swolen part. we directed the indians in what manner to treat the di[s]eased Cheif, gave him a few dozes of flour of sulpher and Creem of tartar &amp; some portable soupe and directed them to take him home. they seemed unwilling to comply with the latter part of the injunction for they consumed the day and remained with us all night. at 1 P. M. Joseph and R. Feilds returned, accompanyed by Hohastillpilp several other inferior Cheifs and some young men. These hunters informed us they were unable to reach the grounds to which they had been directed in consequence of the debth and rapidity of a large creek which falls in about 10 Ms. above.1 1 The South Fork of the Clearwater, also called American River; at its mouth is the town of Stuart.—Ed. they passed Commearp Creek at about 1-1/2 Ms. and a second creek reather larger at 3 Ms. further. at the distance of 4 Ms. up this last creek on their return they called at a village which our traders have never yet visited, here they obtained a large quantity of bread and roots of Cows on very moderate terms. we permitted Sergt. Pryor and four men to pass the river tomorrow morning with a view to visit this village we also directed Charbono York and Lepage to set out early for the same place and procure us some roots. our meat is again exhausted, we therefore directed R. Fields to hunt the horse in the morning which the Indians have given us to kill. one of our men saw a salmon in the river today. in the afternoon we compleated our canoe and put her in the water; she appears to answer very well and will carry about 12 persons. the river still rising fast and snows of the mountains visibly diminish. [Clark:] Monday 26th. May 1806 Some small showers of rain last night, and continued cloudy this morning untill 7 A. M. when it cleared away and became fair and worm. collins Shannon &amp; Colter set out to hunt on the high lands to the N E of us towards Collins Creek. The child something better this morning tho the swelling yet continue. we still apply the onion poltice. I derected what should be done for the disabled man, gave him a fiew doses of creem of tarter &amp; flour sulphur, and some portable supe and directed that he should be taken home &amp; swetted &amp;c. at 1. P. M. Joseph &amp; R. Fields returned accompanied by Hohhâstillpilt and an second Chief and 4 men several young men also rode down on this side. Jo &amp; R Fields informed us that they were at a village 4 miles up the 2nd. Creek from this place on the opposit side above at which place they precured roots on very reasonable terms. they could not proceed higher up to hunt as the creeks were too high for them to cross, &amp;c. we gave permission to Serjt. Pryor and 4 men to cross the river and trade with nativs of the village the Fields were at yesterday for roots &amp;c. we also directed Shabono &amp; York to proceed on to the same village and precure some roots for our selves if possible. one of our men saw a salmon in the river to day, and two others eat of salmon at the near village which was brought from Lewis's river. our canoe finished and put into the water. it will carry 12 men. the [river] riseing very fast and snow appear to melt on the mountains. [Lewis:] Tuesday May 27th. 1806 Early this morning we sent Reubin Feilds in surch of the horse which the indians had given us to kill. at 10 in the morning he returned with the horse and we killed and butchered him;1 1 He was so wild and vicious that we could not manage him, or do anything with him.—Gass (p. 318). he was large and in good order. Hohâstillpilp told us that most of the horses we saw runing at large in this neighbourhood belonged to himself and his people, and whenever we were in want of meat he requested that we would kill any of them we wished; this is a piece of liberallity which would do honour to such as bo[a]st of civilization; indeed I doubt whether there are not a great number of our countrymen who would see us fast many days before their compassion would excite them to a similar act of liberallity. Sergt. Pryor and the party ordered to the indian Village set out early this morning. in the evening he returned with Gibson and Sheilds. the others remained at the village all night; they brought a good store of roots and bread. we also sent Sergt. ordway and 2 men this morning over to Lewis's river for salmon, which the indians inform us may be procured in abundance at that place, and that it is but half a days ride, nearly south. Drewyer, Cruzatte, and Labuish returned at 4 P. M. with five deer which they had killed at some distance up Collins's Creek on this side; that stream still continues so high that they could not pass it. Charbono's son is much better today, tho' the swelling on the side of his neck I beleive will terminate in an ugly imposthume a little below the ear. the indians were so anxious that the sick Cheif should be sweated under our inspection that they requested we would make a second atte[m]pt today; accordingly the hole was somewhat enlarged and his father a very good looking old man, went into the hole with him and sustained him in a proper position during the operation; we could not make him sweat as copiously as we wished. after the operation he complained of considerable pain, we gave him 30 drops of laudanum which soon composed him and he rested very well. this is at least a strong mark of parental affection. they all appear extreemly attentive to this sick man nor do they appear to relax in their asciduity towards him notwithstand[ing] he has been sick and helpless upwards of three years. the Chopunnish appear to be very attentive and kind to their aged people and treat their women with more rispect than the nations of the Missouri. There is a speceis of Burrowing squirel common in these plains which in their habits somewhat resemble those of the missouri but are a distinct speceis.1 1 Spermophilus columbianus, first noticed by the explorers in this locality.—Ed. this little animal measures one fo[o]t five and 1/2 inches from the nose to the extremity of the tail, of which the tail occupys 2-1/4 inches only; in the girth it is 11 In. the body is proportionably long, the neck and legs short; the ears are short, obtusely pointed, and lie close to the head; the aperture of the ear is larger proportionably than most animals which burrow. the eyes are of moderate size, the puple black and iris of a dark sooty brown. the teeth are like those of the squirel as is it's whole contour. the whiskers are full, long and black; it also has some long black hairs above the eyes. it has five toes on each foot; the two inner toes of the fore feet are remarkably short, and have short blont nails. the remaining toes on those feet are long, black, slightly curved and sharply pointed. the outer and inner toes of the hind feet are not short yet they are by no means as long as the three toes in the center of the foot which are remarkably long but the nails are not as long as those of the fore feet tho' of the same form and colour. the hair of the tail tho' thickly inserted on every part rispects the two sides only. this gives it a flat appearance and a long oval form. the tips of the hair which form the outer edges of the tail are white. the base of the hairs are either black or a fox red. the under disk of the tail is an iron grey, the upper a redish brown. the lower part of the jaws, under part of the neck, legs and feet from the body down and belley are of a light brick red. the nose as high as the eyes is of a darker brick red. the upper part of the head neck and body are of a curious brownish grey colour with a cast of the brick red. the longer hair of these parts being of a redish white colour at their extremities, fall together in such manner as to give it the appearance of being speckled at a little distance. these animals form large ascociations as those of the Missouri, occupying with their burroughs one or sometimes 200 acres of land. the burrows are seperate and are each occupyed perhaps by ten or 12 of those animals. there is a little mound in front of the hole formed of the earth thrown out of the burrow and frequently there are three or four distinct holes forming what I term one burrow with their mouths arround the base of this little mound which seems to be occupyed as a watch-tower in common by the inhabitants of those several holes. these mounds are sometimes as much as 2 feet high and 4 feet in diameter, and are irregularly distributed over the tract they occupy at the distance of from ten to thirty or 40 yds. when you approach a burrow the squirrels, one or more, usually set erect on these mounds and make a kind of shrill whistleing nois, something like tweet, tweet, tweet, &amp;c. they do not live on grass as those of the missouri but on roots. one which I examined had in his mouth two small bulbs of a speceis of grass, which resemble very much what is sometimes called the grass-nut. the intestins of those little animals are remarkably large for it's size. fur short and very fine. the grass in their villages is not cut down as in those of the plains of the missouri. I preserved the skins of several of these animals with the heads feet and legs entire. The Black woodpecker1 1 Now known as "Lewis's woodpecker" (Asyndesmus torquatus).—Ed. which I have frequently mentioned and which is found in most parts of the roky Mountains as well as the Western and S. W. mountains, I had never an opportunity of examining untill a few days since when we killed and preserved several of them. this bird is about the size of the lark woodpecker or the turtle dove, tho' it's wings are longer than either of those birds. the beak is black, one inch long, reather wide at the base, somewhat curved, and sharply pointed; the chaps are of equal length. around the base of the beak including the eye and a small part of the throat is of a fine crimson red. the neck and as low as the croop in front is of an iron grey. the belly and breast is a curious mixture of white and blood reed which has much the appearance of having been artificially painted or stained of that colour. the red reather predominates. the top of the head back, sides, upper surface of the wings and tail are black, with a g[l]ossey tint of green in a certain exposure to the light. the under side of the wings and tail are of a sooty black. it has ten feathers in the tail, sharply pointed, and those in the centre reather longest, being 2-1/2 inches in length. the tongue is barbed, pointed, and of an elastic cartelaginous substance. the eye is moderately large, puple black and iris of a dark yellowish brown. this bird in it's actions when flying resembles the small redheaded woodpecke[r] common to the Atlantic states; it's note also somewhat resembles that bird. the pointed tail seems to assist it in seting with more eas or retaining it its resting position against the perpendicular side of a tree. the legs and feet are black and covered with wide imbricated scales. it has four toes on each foot of which two are in rear and two in front; the nails are much curved long and remarkably keen or sharply pointed. it feeds on bugs worms and a variety of insects.1 1 In the weather diary for this date (Codex K, p. 147), Lewis wrote: "the dove is cooing which is the signal as the indians inform us of the approach of the salmon,"—Ed. [Clark:] Tuesday 27th: May 1806 A cloudy morning Serjt. Pryor and party set out at 7 A. M. Serjt. Ordway and two men are ordered to cross this river and proceed on through the plains to Lewis's [river] and precure some salmon on that river, and return tomorrow if possible he set out at 8 A. M. we sent Rub: Field in serch of the horse which the indians had given us to kill. at 10 A. M. he returned with the horse and he was killed and butchered; he was large and in good order. Hohâstillipilp told us that most of the horses which we saw runing in those plains in this neighbourhood at large belonged to himself and his people, and whenever we were in want of meet, he requested that we would kill any of them we wished; this is a piece of liberallity which would do honour to such as bost of civilization. Serjt. Pryor, Gibson &amp; Shields returned from the village with a good stock of roots and bread. Shabono Lapage &amp; Yourk whome we had sent to purchase roots for ourselves remained at the village all night. Drewyer, Labiech &amp; Crusat return at 4 P. M. with 5 Deer which they had killed at some distance up Collin's Creek on this side, that stream still continue so high that they could not pass it. Shabono's child is much better to day; tho' the swelling on the side of his neck I believe will termonate in an ugly imposthume a little below the ear. The Indians were so anxious that the sick Chief (who has lost the use of his limbs) should be sweted under our inspection they requested me to make a 2d. attempt to day; accordingly the hole was enlargened and his father a very good looking old man performed all the drugery &amp;c. we could not make him swet as copously as we wished, being compelled to keep him erect in the hole by means of cords. after the oppiration he complained of considerable pain, I gave him 30 drops of Laudnom which soon composed him and he rested very well. I observe the strongest marks of parental affection. they all appear extreemly attentive to this sick man, nor do they appear to relax in their ascituity towards him notwithstanding he has been sick and helpless for near 5 years. The Chopunnish appeare to be very attentive &amp; kind to their aged people and treat their women with more respect than the nativs on the Missouri. There is a Species of Whistleing Squirel common in these plains which in their habit somewhat resembles those of the Missouri but are a distinct species. this little animale measures 1 foot 5 inches &amp; a half from the nose to the extremity of the tail, of which the tail occupies 2 1/4 inches only; in the girth it is 11 inches the body is perpotionably long, the neck and legs short; the ears are short, obtusely pointed, and lye close to the head; the aperture of the ear is larger proportionably than that [of] most animals which burrow. the eyes are of moderate size, the puple black and iris of a dark dusky brown. the teeth are like those of the squirel as is it's whole contour. the whiskers are full, long and black; it has also some long black hars above the eye. it has five toes on each foot; the 2 inner toes of the fore feet are remarkably short, and have short blunt nails. the remaining toes on these feet are long slightly curved, black and sharply pointed. the outer and inner toes of the hind feet are not short yet they are by no means as long as the three toes in the center of the foot which are remarkably long but the nails are not as long as those of the fore feet tho' of the same form and colour. the hars of the tail tho thickly inserted on every part respects the two sides only. this givs it a flat appearance and a long oval form. the tips of the hair which forms the outer edges of the tail are white. the bace of the hair are either black or a fox red. the under disk of the tail is an iron gray, the upper a redish brown. the lower part of the jaws, under part of the neck, legs and feet from the body down and belly are of a light brick red. the nose as high as the eyes is of a darker brick red. the upper part of the head neck and body are of a curious brownish gray colour with a cast of the brick red. the longer hairs of these parts being of a redish white colour at their extremities fall together in such a manner as to give it the appearance of being spekled at a little distance. these animals form large asco[i]ations as those of the Missouri, occupying with their burroughs one or sometimes 200 acres of Land. the burrows are seperate and are each occupyed perhaps by 10 or 12 of those animals. there is a little mound in front of the hole formed of the earth thrown out of the burrow and frequently there are three or four distinct holes forming what I call one burrow, around the base of the mound, which seams to be occupied as a watch tower in common by the inhabitents of those several holes. these mounds are sometimes as much as 2 feet high, and 4 feet in diameter, and are irregularly distributed over the tract they occupy at the distance of from ten to 30 or forty yards. When you approach a burrow the Squirels one, or more, usially set erect on their mounds and make a kind of shrill whistleing nois, something like tweet, tweet, tweet &amp;c. they do not live on grass as those of the Missouri but on roots. one which I examoned had in his mouth two small bulbs of a species of grass, which resembles very much what is sometimes called the Grass Nut. the intestins of these little animals are remarkably large for it's size; fur short and very fine. the grass in their village is not cut down as in these of the plains of the Missouri. I preserved the skins of several of these animals with the heads feet and legs entire. The Black Wood pecker which is found in most parts of the rocky mountains as well as the western and S W. mountains, I had never [had] an oppertunity of examineing, untill a fiew days since when we killed and preserved several of them. this bird is about the size of the lark woodpecker or the turtle dove, tho' it's wings are longer than either of these birds. the beak is black, one inch long reather wide at the base, somewhat cirved, and sharply pointed; the chaps are of equal length. around the bace of the beak including the eye and a small part of the throat is of a crimson red. the neck and as low as the croop in front is of an iron gray. the belly and breast is of a curious mixture of white and blood red which has much the appearance of haveing been artificially painted or stained of that colour, the red reather prodominates. the top of the head, back, sides, upper surface of the wings and tail are black, the under side of the wings and tail are black. it has ten feathers in the tail, sharply pointed, and those in the center reather longest, being 2 1/2 inches in length. the tongue is barbed, pointed, and of an elastic cartalaginous substance. the eye is moderately large, puple black and iris of a dark yellowish brown. this bird in it's actions when flying resemble the small redish woodpecker common to the atlantic states; it's note also somewhat resembles that bird. the pointed tail seems to assist it in sitting with more ease or retaining it, in it's resting position against the perpendicular side of a tree. the legs and feet are black, and covered with imbricated scales. it has four toes on each foot, of which two are in rear and two in front; the nails are much curved long and remarkably keen or sharply pointed. it feeds on bugs, worms and a variety of insects. [Lewis:] Wednesday May 28th. 1806 We sent Goodrich to the village of the broken arm this morning he returned in the evening with some roots bread and a parsel of goats-hair for making our saddle pads. Reubin and Joseph Feilds set out this morning to hunt high up on a creek which discharges itself into this river about 8 miles above us. at Noon Charbono, York and Lapage returned, they had obtained four bags of the dryed roots of Cows and some bread. in the evening Collins Shannon and Colter returned with eight deer. they had fortunately discovered a ford on Collin's Creek where they were enabled to pass it with their horses and had hunted at the quawmash ground where we first met with the Chopunnish last fall. deer were very abundant they informed us, but there were not many bear. The sick Cheif was much better this morning he can use his hands and arms and seems much pleased with the prospect of recovering, he says he feels much better than he has for a great number of months. I sincerely wish these sweats may restore him; we have consented that he should still remain with us and repeat these sweats. he set up a great proportion of the day. The Child is also better, he is free of fever, the imposthume is not so large but seems to be advancing to maturity. since my arrival here I have killed several birds of the corvus genus of a kind found only in the rocky mountains and their neighbourhood.1 1 The American nutcracker (Picicorvus columbianus), discovered by Lewis and Clark, in August, 1805. The "small corvus" is a jay (Perisorous canadensis capitalis). —Ed. I first met with this bird above the three forks of the Missouri and saw them on the hights of the rocky Mountains but never before had an opportunity of examining them closely. the small corvus discribed at Fort Clatsop is a different speceis, tho' untill now I had taken it to be the same, this is much larger and has a loud squawling note something like the mewing of a cat. the beak of this bird is 1-1/2 inches long, is proportionably large, black and of the form which characterizes this genus. the upper exceeds the under chap a little. the head and neck are also proportionably large. the eye full and reather prominent, the iris dark brown and puple black. it is about the size and somewhat the form of the Jaybird tho reather rounder or more full in the body. the tail is four and a half inches in length, composed of 12 feathers nearly of the same length. the head neck and body of this bird are of a dove colour. the wings are black except the extremities of six large f[e]athers occupying the middle joint of the wing which are white. the under disk of the wing is not of the shining or gr[l]ossy black which marks its upper surface. the two feathers in the center of the tail are black as are the two adjacent feathers for half their width the ballance are of a pure white. the feet and legs are black and imbricated with wide scales. the nails are black and remarkably long and sharp, also much curved. it has four toes on each foot of which one is in the rear and three in front. the toes are long particularly that in the rear. This bird feeds on the seed of the pine and also on insects. it resides in the rocky mountains at all seasons of the year, and in many parts is the only bird to be found. our hunters brought us a large hooting Owl which differs considerably from those of the Atlantic States which are also common here. the plumage of this owl is an uniform mixture of dark yellowish brown and white, in which the dark brown predominates. it's colour may be properly termed a dark iron grey. the plumage is very long and remarkably silky and soft. these have not the long feathers on the head which give it the appearance of ears or horns. the feathers of the head are long narrow and closely set, they rise upwright nearly to the extremity and then are bent back suddenly as iff curled. a kind of ruff of these feathers incircle the th[r]oat. The head has a flat appearance being broadest before arid behind and is 1 foot 10 Is. in circumference, incircling the eyes and extending from them like rays from the center a tissue of open hairy long feathers are placed of a light grey colour, these conceal the ears which are very large and are placed close to the eyes behind and extending below them. These feathers meet over the beak which they nearly conceal and form the face of the owl. they eyes are remarkably large and prominent, the iris of a pale goald colour and iris [sc. pupil] circular and of a deep sea green. the beak is short and wide at its base. the upper chap is much curved at the extremity and comes down over and in front of the under chap. this bird is about the size of the largest hooting Owl. the tail is composed of eleven feathers, of which those in the center are reather the longest. it is booted to the extremity of the toes, of which it has four on each foot, one in the rear one on the outer side and two in front. the toes are short particularly that in the rear, but are all armed with long keen curved nails of a dark brown colour. the beak is white and nostrils circular large and unconnected. the habits and note of this owl is much that of the common large hooting owl.1 1 The great gray owl (Scotiaptex cinerea, also known as Syrnium cinereum), discovered by the explorers.—Ed. [Clark:] Wednesday May 28th. 1806 We sent Goodrich to the village of the broken arm for hair to stuff saddle pads. Jo. &amp; R. Fields set out this morning to hunt towards the mountains. at noon Shabono York and Lapage returned, they had obtained 4 bags of the dried roots of Cowse and some bread. in the evening Collins, Shannon &amp; Colter returned with 8 deer. they fortunately discovered a ford on Collin's Creek where they were enable[d] to pass it with there horses and had hunted at the quawmash Grounds where we first met with the Chopunnish last fall. deer were very abundant they informed us, but there was not many bear. The Sick Chief is much better this morning he can use his hands and arms and seems much pleased with the prospects of recovering, he says he feels much better than he has done for a great number of months. I sincerly wish that the swetts may restore him. I have consented to repeet the sweets. The Country along the rocky mountains for several hundred miles in length and about 50 in width is leavel extremely fertile and in many parts covered with a tall and opulent growth of the long leafed pine. near the watercourses the hills are lofty tho' [they] are covered with a good soil and not remarkably stoney and possess more timber than the leavel country. the bottom lands on the water courses are reather narrow and confined tho' fertile and seldom inundated. this country would form an extensive settlement; the climate appears quit[e] as mild as that of a similar latitude on the Atlantic Coast; &amp; it cannot be otherwise than healthy; it possesses a fine dry pure air. the grass and maney plants are now upwards of knee high. I have no doubt that this tract of country if cultivated would produce in great abundance every article esentially necessary to the comfort and subsistence of civillized man. to it's present inhabitents nature seems to have dealt with a liberal hand, for she has distributed a great variety of esculent plants over the face of the country which furnish them a plentiful store of provisions; those are acquired [with] but little toil; and when prepared after the method of the nativs afford not only a nutricious but an agreeable food. among other roots those called by them the Quawmash and Cows are esteemed the most agreeable and valuable as they are also the most abundant in those high plains. The Cows is a knobbed root of an irregularly rounded form not unlike the ginsang in form and consistance, this root they collect, rub off a thin black rhind which covers it and pounding it exposes it in cakes to the sun. these cakes are about an inch and 1/4 thick and 6 by 18 in width, when dry they either eat this bread alone without any further preperation, or boil it and make a thick muscilage; the latter is most common &amp; much the most agreeable. the flower of this root is not very unlike the ginsang. this root they collect as early as the snow disappears in the Spring, and continues to collect it untill the Quawmash supplies it's place which happins about the Middle of June. the quawmash is also collected for a fiew weeks after it first makes it's appearance in the Spring, but when the scape appears it is no longer fit for use untill the seed are ripe which happens about the time just mentioned, and then the Cows declines. the Cows [quawmash?] is also frequently dried in the sun and pounded afterwards and used in thickening supe and makeing Mush. The Chopunnish held a council in the morning of the 12th among themselves in respect to the Subject on which we had spoken to them the day before,1 1 See Lewis's journal, p. 19, ante.—Ed. the result as we learnt was favourable, they placed confidence in the information they had recived and resolved to pursue our advice. after this council was over the principal chief or the broken arm, took the flour of the roots of Cows and thickened the Soup in the Kittles and baskets of all his people, this being ended he made a harangue the purpote of which was makeing known the deliberations of their councils and impressing the necessity of unanimity among them, and a strict attention to the resolution which had been agreed on in councell; he concluded by enviting all such men as had resolved to abide by the decree of the councill to come and eat, and requested such as would not be so bound to show themselves by not partakeing of the feast. I was told by one of our men who was present in the house, that there was not a decenting voice on this great national question, but all swallowed their objections if any they had, very cheerfully with their mush. dureing the time of this loud animated harangue of the Chief the women cryed wrung their hands, tore their hair and appeared to be in the utmost distress. after this cerimoney was over, the Chiefs and considerate men came in a body to where we were seated at a little distance from our tent, and two young men at the instance of the nation presented Capt L. and myself each a fine horse. and informed us that they had listened with attention to what we had said and were resolved to pursue our counsels &amp;c. that as we had not seen the Black foot Indians and the Menetarees of Fort dePrarie they did not think it safe to venter over to the plains of the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations would not kill them. that when we had established a tradeing house on the Missouri as we had promised they would come over and trade for arms amunition &amp;c. and live about us. that it would give them much pleasure to be at peace with those nations altho' they had shed much of their blood. They said that they were pore but their hearts were good. we might be assured of their sincerety Some of their brave men would go over with us to the Missouri and bring them the news as we wished, and if we could make a peace between themselves and their enimies on the other side of the mountains their nation would go over to the Missouri in the latter end of the summer. on the subject of one of their chiefs accompanying us to the land of the White men they could not yet determine, but that they would let us know before we left them. that the Snow was yet so deep in the mountains that if we attempted to pass, we would certainly perish, and advised us to remain untill after the next full moon when the snow would disappear on the South hill sides and we would find grass for our horses. Shabonos child is better this day than he was yesterday. he is free from fever. the imposthume is not so large but seems to be advanceing to meturity. [Lewis:] Thursday May 29th. 1806. No movement of the party today worthy of notice. we have once more a good stock of meat and roots. Bratton is recovering his strength very fast; the Child and the Indian Cheif are also on the recovery. the cheif has much more uce of his hands and arms. he washed his face himself today which he has been unable to do previously for more than twelve months. we would have repeated the sweat today had [it] not been cloudy and frequently rainy, a speceis of Lizzard called by the French engages prarie buffaloe are native of these plains as well as of those of the Missouri. I have called them the horned Lizzard. they are about the size and a good deel of the figure of the common black lizzard. but their bellies are broader, the tail shorter and their action much slower; they crawl much like the toad. they are of a brown colour with yellowish and yellowish brown spots. it is covered with minute scales intermixed with little horny prosesses like blont prickles on the upper surface of the body. the belly and throat is more like the frog and are of a light yelowish brown colour. arround the edge of the belley is regularly set with little homey projections which give to these edges a serrate figure the eye is small and of a dark colour, above and behind the eyes there are several projections of the bone which being armed at their extremities with a firm black substance has the appearance of horns sprouting out from the head. this part has induced me to distinguish it by the appellation of the horned Lizzard.1 1 The horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglasi), often, although erroneously, called "horned frog" or "horned toad." The name "prairie buffalo" no doubt arises from its horns, and the way in which it humps itself when irritated.—Ed. I cannot conceive how the engages ever assimilated this animal with the buffaloe for there is not greater analogy than between the horse and the frog. this animal is found in greatest numbers in the sandy open parts of the plains, and appear in great abundance after a shower of rain; they are sometimes found basking in the sunshine but conceal themselves in little holes in the earth much the greater proportion of their time. they are numerous about the falls of the Missouri and in the plains through which we past lately above the Wallahwallahs. The Choke Cherry has been in blume since the 20th. inst. it is a simple branching ascending stem. the cortex smooth and of a dark brown with a redish cast. the leaf is scattered petiolate oval accute at its apex finely serrate smooth and of an ordinary green. from 2–1/2 to 3 inches in length and 1-3/4 to 2 in width. the peduncles are cilindric common and from 4 to 5 inches in length and are inserted promiscuously on the twigs of the preceeding years growth. on the lower portion of the common peduncle are frequently from 3 to 4 small leaves being the same in form as those last discribed. other peduncles 1/4 of an inch in length are thickly scattered and inserted on all sides of the common peduncle at wrightangles with it each elivating a single flower, which has five obtuse short patent white petals with short claws inserted on the upper edge of the calyx. the calyx is a perianth including both stamens and germ, one leafed fine cleft entire simiglobular, inf[e]rior, deciduous. the stamens are upwards of twenty and are seated on the margin of the flower cup or what I have called the perianth. the filaments are unequal in length subulate inflected and superior membranous. the anthers are equal in number with the filaments, they are very short oblong &amp; flat, naked and situated at the extremity of the filaments, is of a yelow colour as is also the pollen. one pistillum. the germen is ovate, smooth, superior, sessile, very small; the Style is very short, simple, erect, on the top of the germen, deciduous. the stigma is simple, flat very short. [Clark:] Thursday 29th. of May 1806 No movement of the party to day worthy of notice. we have once more a good stock of Meat and roots. Bratten is recovering his strength very fast. the Child, and the Indian Cheaf are also on the recovery. the Chief has much more use of his hands and arms. he washed his face himself today, which he has not been able to do previously for more than twelve months past. I would have repeeted the sweat to day had it not been cloudy and frequently raining. Since my arrival here I have killed several birds of the Corvus genus of a kind found only in the rocky mountains and their neighbourhood. I first met with [this] bird on Jeffersons River, and saw them on the hights of the rocky Mountains, but never before had an oppertunity of examineing them closely. the small corvus discribed at Fort Clatsop is a different Species, tho' untill now I had taken it to be the same, this is much larger and has a loud squaling note something like the mewing of a cat. the beak of this bird is 1 1/2 incles long, is proportionably large, black and of the form which characterize this genus. the upper exceeds the under chap a little. the head and neck are also proportionably large, the eyes full and reather prominant, the iris dark brown and purple black. it is about the size and somewhat the form of the jaybird, tho' reather rounder and more full in the body. the tail is four and a half inches in length, composed of 12 feathers nearly of the same length. the head, neck and body of this bird is of a dove colour. the wings are black except the extremities of six large feathers occupying the middle joint of the wings which are white. the under disk of the wings are not of the shineing or glossy black which mark it's upper surface. the two feathers in the center of the tail are black as are the two adjacent feathers for half their wedth, the ballance are of a pure white. the feet and legs are black, and imbricated with wide scales, the nails are black and remarkably long and sharp, also much curved, it has four toes on each foot of which one is in the rear and 3 in front. the toes are long particular[ly] that in the rear. this bird feeds on the seeds of the pine and also on insects. it resides in the rocky Mountains at all seasons of the year, and in many parts is the only bird to be found. a Species of Lizzard called by the French engages, Prarie buffaloe are nativs of these plains as well as those of the Missouri. I have called them the horned Lizzard. they are about the size and a good deel the figure of the common black lizzard, but their bellies are broader, the tail shorter and their action much slower; they crawl much like the toad. they are of a brown colour with yellowish and yellowish brown spots. it is covered with minute scales intermixed with little horney like blunt prickkles on the upper serface of the body. the belly and throat is more like the frog, and are of a light yellowish brown colour. around the edge of the belly is regularly set with little horney prejections which give to those edges a serrate figure, the eye is small and of a dark colour. above and behind the eyes there are several projections of the bone which being armed at their extremities with a firm black substance has the appearance of horns sprouting out from the head. this part has induced me to distinguish it by the appellation of the Horned Lizzard I cannot conceive how the engagees ever assimilated this animal with the Buffalow for there is not grater anology than between the Horse and the frog. this Animal is found in greatest numbers in the sandy open parts of the plains, and appear in great abundance after a rain; they are sometimes found basking in the sunshine but conceal themselves in little holes under the tufts of grass or herbs much the greater proportion of their time. they are noumerous about the Falls of Missouri, and in the plains through which we passed lately above the Falls of Columbia. The Choke Cherry has been in blume since the 20th. inst. it is a simple branching ascending stem, the cortex smooth and of a dark brown with a redish cast. the leaf is scattered petiolate oval accute at it's apex finely serated smooth and of an ordinary green, from 2 1/2 to 3 inches in length and from 1 3/4 to 2 in width. the peduncles cilindric and common from 4 to 5 inches in length and are inserted promiscuisly on the twigs of the proceeding years growth. on the lower portion of the common peduncle are frequently from 3 to 4 small leaves, being the same in form as those last discribed. other peduncles 1/4 of an inch in length are scattered and thickly inserted on all side of the common peduncle at right-angles with it, each elivateing a single flower, which has five obtuse short patent white petals with short claws incerted on the upper edge of the calyx. the calyx is a perianth induding both stemes &amp; germ, one leafed five cleft entire, semi globular. the stamons are upwards of twenty and are seated on the margin of the flower cup or what I have called the perianth. the filaments are unequal in length subulate inflected and superior membranous. the anthers are equal in number with the filaments, they are very short oblong and flat, naked and situated at the extremity of the filaments. is of a yellowish colour as is also the pollen. one pistillum. the germin is ovate, smooth, superior, sessile, very small; the style is very short, simple, erect, on the top of the germen deciduous. the stigma is simple, flat very short. This shrub rises to the hight of from 6 to 8 feet generally but sometimes [in] rich situations much higher. it is not confined to any particular situation. Capt. L—s met with a singular plant in blume of which we preserved a specimen. it grows on the steep fertile hill sides near this place the radix is fibrous, not much branched, annual, wo[o]dy, white and nearly smooth. the stem is simple branching ascending 2 1/2 feet high. celindric, villose and of a pale red colour. the branches are but fiew and those near it's upper extremity. the extremities of the branches are flexable and are bent down near their extremities with the weight of the flowers. the leaf is sessile, scattered thinly, nearly lineor tho' somewhat widest in the middle, two inches in length, absolutely entire, villose, obtusely pointed and of an ordinary green. above each leaf a small short branch protrudes, supporting a tissue of four or five small leaves of the same appearance of those discribed. a leaf is placed under neath each branch and each flower. the calyx is one flowered Spatha. the corolla superior, consists of four pale perple petals which are tripartite, the centeral lobe largest and all terminate obtusely; they are inserted with a long and narrow claw on the top of the germ, are long, smooth and deciduous. there are two distinct sete of stamens the first or principal consists of four, the filaments [of ] which are capillary, erect, inserted on the top of the germ alternately with the petals, equal short, membranus; the anthers are also four each being elivated with it's fillaments, they are reather flat, erect sessile, cohering to the base, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twise as long as the fillament naked, and of a pale purple colour, the second set of stamens are very minute, are also four and placed within and opposit to the petals, those are scercely preceptable while the first are large &amp; conspicious, the fillaments are capillary equal, very short white and smooth. the anthers are four, oblong, beaked, erect cohering at the base, memb[r]anous, shorter than the fillaments, white naked and appear not to form pollen, there is one pistillum; the germ of which is also one, celindric, villous, inferior, sessile, as long as the first stamuns, and grooved. the single style and stigma form a perfect monopetallous corolla only with this difference that the style which elivates the stigma or limb is not a tube but solid tho' it's outer appearance is that of a tube of a monopetallous corolla swelling as it ascends and gliding in such manner into the limb that it cannot be said where the style ends or the stigma begins, jointly they are as long as the corilla, while the limb is four cleft, sauser shaped, and the margin of the lobes entire and rounded. this has the appearance of a monopetallous flower growing from the center of the four petalled corollar which is rendered more conspicuous in consequence of the first being white and the latter of a pale purple. I regret very much that the seed of this plant are not ripe as yet and it is probable will not be so dureing our residence in this neighbourhood. Our Horses maney of them have become so wild that we cannot take them without the assistance of the indians who are extreemly dextrous in throwing a rope and takeing them with a noose about the neck; as we frequently want the use of our horses when we cannot get the use of the indians to take them, we had a strong pound formed to day in order to take them at pleasure [Lewis:] Friday May 30th. 1806 Lapage and Charbono set out to the indian villages early this morning for the purpose of trading with them for roots; Sergt. Gass was sent this morning to obtain some goats hair to stuff the padds of our saddles. he ascended the river on this side and being unable to pass the river opposite to the village he wished to visit, returned in the evening unsuccessfull. Shannon and Collins were permitted to pass the river in order to trade with the natives and lay in a store of roots and bread for themselves with their proportion of the merchandize as the others had done; in landing on the opposite shore the canoe was driven broad side with the full forse of a very strong current against some standing trees and instantly filled with water and sunk. Potts who was with them is an indifferent swimer, it was with much difficulty he made the land. they lost three blankets a blanket coat and their pittance of merchandise. in our bear state of clothing this was a serious loss.1 1 The loss of these blankets is the greatest which hath happened to any individual since we began out voyage, as there are only three men in the party, who have more than a blanket apiece.—Gass (p. 319). I sent Sergt. Pryor and a party over with the indian canoe in order to raise and secure ours but the debth of the water and the strength of the current baffled every effort. I fear that we have also lost our canoe. all our invalides are on the recovery. we gave the sick Cheif a severe sweat today, shortly after which he could move one of his legs and thyes and work his toes pretty well, the other leg he can move a little; his fingers and arms seem to be almost entirely restored. he seems highly delighted with his recovery. I begin to entertain strong hope of his restoration by these sweats. in the evening Joseph Feild returned in surch of his horses which had left them last evening and returned to camp. Feilds informed us that himself and his brother whom he had left at their camp 6 ms. distant on Collins creek, had killed 3 deer. The reptiles which I have observed in this quarter are the Rattlesnake of the speceis discribed on the Missouri, they are abundant in every part of the country and are the only poisonous snake which we have yet met with since we left St. Louis. the 2 speceis of snakes of an inosent kind already discribed. the common black lizzard, the horned lizzard, a smal green tree-frog, the smal frog which is common to our country which sings in the spring of the year, a large speceis of frog which resorts the water considerably larger than our bull frog, it's shape seems to be a medium between the delicate and lengthy form of our bull frog and that of our land frog or toad as they are sometimes called in the U' States. like the latter their bodies are covered with little pustles or lumps, elivated above the ordinary surface of the body; I never heard them make any sound or noise.1 1 The horned lizard (Phrynosoma douglasi), small green tree frog (Hyla regilla), and large frog or toad (Bufo columbiensis) were identified by Coues. The small frog, which sings in the spring, is not Chorophilus triseriatus, but the only frog of this region (Rana pretiosa).—C. V. Piper. the mockerson snake coper head, a number of vipers a variety of lizzard, the toad bull frog &amp;c. common to the U' States are not to be found in this country. most of the insects common to the U'States are found here. the butterflies, common house and blowing flies the horse flies, except the goald coloured ear fly, tho' in stead of this fly we have a brown coloured fly about the same size which attatches itself to that part of the horse and is equally troublesome. the silkworm is also found here. a great variety of beatles common to the Atlantic states are found here likewise. except from this order the large cow beatle and the black beatle usually [c]alled the tumble bug which are not found here. the hornet, the wasp and yellow wasp or yellow jacket as they are frequently called are not met with in this quarter. there is an insect which much resembles the latter only a vast deel larger which are very numerous particularly in the rocky mountains on the waters of the Columbia; these build in the ground where they form a nest like the hornet with an outer covering to the comb in which they deposit their eggs and raise their young. the sheets of this comb are attatched to each other as those of the hornets are. their wings are four of a dark brown colour. the head is black, the body and abdomen are yellow incircled with transverse rings of black, they are ferce and sting very severely, we found them troublesome in frightening our horses as we passed those mountains.2 2 A species of wasp, Vespa diabolica.—Ed. the honey bee is not found here. the bumble bee is. one of the men brought me today some onions from the high plain of a different speceis from those near the borders of the river as they are also from the shive or small onion noticed below the falls of the Columbia. these onions were as large as a nutmeg, they generally grow double on two bulbs connected by the same tissue of radicles; each bulb has two long linear flat solid leaves. the peduncle is solid celindric and crowned with an umbal of from 20 to 30 flowers. this onion is exceedingly crisp and delicately flavoured indeed I think more sweet and less strong than any I ever taisted. it is not yet perfectly in blow, the parts of the flower are not distinct.1 1 Coues thinks that this was probably Allium tolmiei.—Ed. [Clark:] Friday May 30th. 1806 Lapage and Shabono set out early this morning to the Indian Village in order to trade with them for roots; Serjt. Gass was sent this morning to obtain some goats hair to stuff the pads of our Saddles; he assended the river on this side and being unable to pass the river to the village he wished to visit returned in the evening unsucksessfull. Shannon and Collins were permited to pass the river in order to trade with the nativs and lay in a store of roots and bread for themselves with their proportion of the merchendize as others had done; on landing on the opposit shore the canoe was driven broad side with the full force of a very strong current against some Standing trees and instantly filled with water and sunk. Potts who was with them is an indifferent swimer, it was with dificuelty he made the land. they lost three blankets and a Blanket Cappo and their pittance of merchindize. in our bear state of clothing this was a serious loss. I sent Serjt. Pryor and a party over in the Indian canoe in order to raise and secure ours but the debth of the water and the strength of the current baffled every effort. I fear that we have also lost our canoe. all our invalides are on the recovery. we gave the sick Chief a severe Swet to day, shortly after which he could move one of his legs and thy's and work his toes pritty well, the other leg he can move a little; his fingers and arms seem to be almost entirely restored. he seems highly delighted with his recovery. I begin to entertain strong hope of his recovering by these sweats. in the evening Joseph Fields returned in serch of his horses which had left them last evening and returned to camp. Field informed us that himself and his brother whome he had left at their Camp 6 ms. distant on Collins Creek had killed 3 Deer. The reptiles which I have observed in this quarter are the rattle snake of the species discribed on the Missouri, they are abundant in every part of the country and are the only poisonous snake which we have met with since we left St. Louis. the second species of snake of an inosent kind already discribd. the common black Lizzard, the horned Lizzard, a small green tree-frog; the same frog which is common to our country which sings in the Spring of the year. a large species of frog which resorts the water considerably larger than our bull-frog, it's shape seems to be a medium between the delicate and lengthy form of our bullfrogs and that of our land frog or toad as they are sometimes called in the United States, like the latter their bodies are covered with little pustles or lumps, elevated above the ordinary surface of the body; I never heard them make any sound or noise, the Mockerson Snake or copper head, a number of vipers, a variety of Lizzards, the toad bullfrog &amp;c. common to the U. States are not to be found in this country. Most of the insects common to the U States are found here. the butterfly, common house and blowing flies, the horse flies, except the gold coloured ear fly. tho' in stead of this fly we have a brown coloured fly about the same size which attatches itself to that part of the horse and is equally as troublesom. the silk worm is also found here. a great variety of beatles common to the atlantic states are seen here likewise. except from this order the large cow beatle and the black beatle usially termed tumble bug which are not found here. the hornet, the wasp and yellow wasp or yellow jacket as they are frequently called are not met with in this quarter. there is an insect which much resembles the latter only a vast deel larger which are very noumerous particular in the Rocky Mountains on the waters of the Columbia, those build in the ground where they form a nest like the hornet with an outer covering to the comb in which they deposit their eggs and raise their young. the sheets of this comb are attatched to each other as those of the hornets are. their wings are four of a dark brown colour. the head is black, the body and abdomin are yellow insercled with transverce rings of black, they are firce and sting very severely; we found them troublesom in frightening our horses as we passed through [the] mountains. the honey bee is not found here. the bumble bee is. one of the men brought me to day some onions from the high plains of a different species from those near the borders of the river as they are also from the shive or small onion noticed below the Falls of Columbia. these onions were as large as an nutmeg, they generally grow double or two bulbs connected by the same tissue of radicles; each bulb has two long line[a]r flat solid leaves. the pedencle is solid celindric and cround with an umble of from 20 to 30 flowers. this onion is exceedingly crisp and delicately flavoured indeed. I think more sweet and less strong than any I ever tasted, it is not yet perfectly in blume, the parts of the flower are not distinct. [Lewis:] Saturday May 31st. 1806. Goodrich and Willard visited the indian Villages this morning and returned in the evening. Willard brought with him the dressed skin of a bear which he had purchased for Capt. C. this skin was an uniform pale redish brown colour, the indians informed us that it was not the Hoh-host or white bear. that it was the Yâck-kâh. this distinction of the indians induced us to make further enquiry relative to their opinions of the several speceis of bear in this country. we produced the several skins of the bear which we had killed at this place and one very nearly white which I had purchased. The white, the deep and pale red grizzle, the dark bro[w]n grizzle, and all those which had the extremities of the hair of a white or frosty colour without regard to the colour of the ground of the poil, they designated Hoh-host and assured us that they were the same with the white bear, that they ascosiated together, were very vicisious, never climbed the trees, and had much longer nails than the others. the black skins, those which were black with a number of intire white hairs intermixed, the black with a white breast, the uniform bey, brown and light redish brown, they designated the Yâck-kâh; said that they climbed the trees, had short nails and were not vicious, that they could pursue them and kill them with safety, they also affirmed that they were much smaller than the white bear. I am disposed to adopt the Indian distinction with respect to these bear and consider them two distinct speceis. the white and the Grizzly1 1 The grizzly bear (Ursus horribilis or ferox), discovered by Lewis and Clark; they correctly distinguish it from the black bear (U. americanus) and the closely allied cinnamon bear (U. cinnamomeus), notwithstanding the great range of color-variation in all three species.—Ed. of this neighbourhood are the same of those found on the upper portion of the Missouri where the other speceis are not, and that the uniform redish brown black &amp;c. of this neighbourhood are a speceis distinct from our black bear and from the black bear of the Pacific coast which I believe to be the same with those of the Atlantic coast, and that the common black bear do not exist here. I had previously observed that the claws of some of the bear which we had killed here had much shorter tallons than the variagated or white bear usually have but supposed that they had woarn them out by scratching up roots, and these were those which the indians called Yâk-kâh. on enquiry I found also that a cub of an uniform redish brown colour, pup to a female black bear intermixed with entire white hair had climbed a tree. I think this a distinct speceis from the common black bear, because we never find the latter of any other colour than an uniform black, and also that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and longer with a greater proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other [r]ispects they are much the same. This evening Joseph and R. Feilds returned with the three deer which they had killed. The Indians brought us another of our origional Stock of horses; there are only two absent now of those horses, and these the indians inform us our shoshone guide rode back when he returned. we have sixty five horses at this time, most of them in excellent order and fine strong active horses. The Indians pursued a mule deer to the river opposite to our camp this evening; the deer swam over and one of our hunters killed it. there being a large party of indians assembled on this occasion on the opposite side, Hohâst-ill-pilp desired them to raise our canoe which was sunk on that side of the river yesterday; they made the attempt but were unable to effect it. [Clark:] Saturday May 31st. 1806 Goodrich and Willard visited the indian village this morning and returned in the evening Willard brought with him the dressed skin of a bear which he had purchased for me. this skin was of a uniform pale redish brown colour, the indians inform us that it was not the Hoh-host or white bear, that it was the Yâck-kâh this distinction of the indians induced us to make further enquiry relitive to their oppinions of the different species of bear in this country. we produced the several skins of the bear which our hunters had killed at this place and one very nearly white which Capt Lewis had purchased. the white, the deep and pale red grizzle, the dark brown grizzle, and all those that had the extremities of the hair of a white or frosty colour without regard to the colour of the ground of the poil, they disignated Hoh-host and assured us that they were the same with the white bear, that they associated together, were very vicisious, never climb the trees, and had much longer nails than the others. The black skins, those which were black with a number of entire white hairs intermixed, the black with a white breast, the uniform bey, brown and light redish brown, they disignated the Yâck-kâh; said that they climb the trees had short nails and were not viscisious, that they could prosue them and kill them in safty, they also affirmed that they were much smaller than the white bear. I am disposed to adopt the indians distinction with respect to these bear and consider them two distinct species. the white and the Grizzly of this neighbourhood are the same as those found on the upper part of the Missouri where the other species are not, and that the uniform redish brown black &amp;c. of this neighbourhood are a species distinct from both species of our black bear, and from the black bear of the Pacific Coast which I believe to be the same with those of the Atlantic Coast, and that the common black bear do not exist here. I had previously observed that the claws of some of the bear which we had killed here had much shorter tallons than the varigated or white bear usially have but supposed that they had worn them out by scratching out roots, and these were those which the indians call Yâhkâh. on enquiry I found also that a Cub of a uniform redish brown colour pup to a female black bear intermixed with entire white hairs, had climbed a tree. I think this a distinct species from the common black bear becaus we never find the latter of any other colour than a uniform black, and also that the poil of this bear is much finer thicker and longer with a greater proportion of fur mixed with the hair, in other respects they are much the same. This evening Joseph and Reuben Fields returned with the three deer they had killed. The indians brought us another of our original stock of Horses; there are only two absent now of these horses, and these the indians inform us that our Sho-sho-ne guide rode back when he returned. We have sixty five horses at this time, most of them in excellent order and fine strong active horses. The Indians pursued a mule deer to the river opposit to our Camp this evening; the deer swam over and one of our hunters killed it. there being a large party of indians assembled on this occasion on the opposit side with Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt they attempted to rais our canoe which was sunk on that side of the river yesterday; they made the attempt but were unable to effect it. [Clark:] This [accompanying] Sketch was given by Sundary Indians of the Chopunnish Nation on the 29th. 30th and 31st. of May 1806. on the Flat Head River. Notes From the Chopunish information.1 1 Much confusion exists in the codices, and on the early maps published, regarding the identity of the rivers here mentioned—unavoidable, of course, as regards the explorers, when (as here) they were obliged to rely on information furnished by the Indians. Clark's name is now applied to that great branch of the Columbia which, first formed by the junction (in western Montana) of the Missoula and Flathead rivers, and flowing thence northwest, passes through Lake Pend d'Oreille (the name of which is also sometimes conferred upon the river), and discharges into the Columbia just north of the Canadian boundary. From Lake Cœur d'Alêne, (Waytom, of Clark) the Spokane River takes a more westerly course to the Columbia; and one of it southern tributaries is the Latah (Clark's "Lar-tow"); but all these names of rivers are confused in the text. Apparently, however, the Skitsuish tribe lived on the Spokane River, and around Lake Cœur d'Alêne. This matter written by Clark is found on pp. 1, 2 of Codex M, accompanying the Indian map, here reproduced. See also our atlas volume, No. 43.—Ed. The Sket-so-mish Nation reside in 6 villages and are about 70 miles distant from the Chopunnish Nation &amp; beyond a Mountain which that river heads in. The Waytom Lake is 10 days around it, has 2 Islands in it and is 7 days from the Chopunnish. The Falls of the Lartow R a little below the Lake is 150 feet nearly perpendicular or there abouts. The falls of Clarks river which is only half a days ride from the latter falls between 4 and 500 feet and leaves a continued Sprey. The roads which pass up Clarks River from the falls and that which intersect it from the falls of Lar-tow River are hilly and bad The Sket-so-mish reside 30 miles up their river. they as well as those at the falls of Clarks river are in allience with the Big bellies &amp;c. &amp;c. The Skeetsomish reside also [o]n the borders of the Wavtom Lake and on 2 Islands within the Same. Note. The Indians inform us that roads passes in every direction where it is dotted in the Sketch. d'. that a large river waters the country beyond the Mountains to the S.W. of the Chopunnish Nation. d'. that the Shoshones reside on the principal fork of Lewis's river in a great number of Villages &amp;c. a good roade to the buffalow. [Lewis:] Sunday June 1st. 1806. Yesterday evening Charbono an[d] LaPage returned, having made a broken voyage. they ascended the river on this side nearly opposite to a village eight miles above us, here their led horse which had on him their merchandize, fell into the river from the side of a steep clift and swam over; they saw an indian on the opposite side whom they prevailed on to drive their horse back again to them; in swiming the river the horse lost a dressed Elkskin of LaPages and several small articles, &amp; their paint [i. e., vermilion] was destroyed by the water. here they remained and dryed their articles the evening of the 30th. Ult. the indians at the village learning their errand and not having a canoe, made an attempt [y]esterday morning to pass the river to them on a raft with a parsel of roots and bread in order to trade with them; the indian raft struck a rock, upset and lost th[e]ir cargo; the river having fallen heir to both merchandize and roots, our traders returned with empty bags. This morning Drewyer accompanyed by Hohâstillpilp set out in surch of two tomahawks of ours which we have understood were in the possession of certain indians residing at a distance in the plains on the South side of the Kooskoske; the one is a tomahawk which Capt. C. left at our camp on Musquetoe Creek and the other was stolen from us while we lay at the forks of this and the Chopunnish rivers last fall. Colter and Willard set out this morning on a hunting execurtion towards the quamash grounds beyond Collins's Creek. we begin to feel some anxiety with rispect to Sergt. Ordway and party who were sent to Lewis's river for salmon; we have received no inteligence from them since they set out. we desired Drewyer to make some enquiry after the Twisted hair; the old man has not been as good as his word with rispect to encamping near us, and we fear we shall be at a loss to procure guides to conduct us by the different routs we wish to pursue from Traveller's rest to the waters of the Missouri. I met with a singular plant today in blume of which I preserved a specemine; it grows on the steep sides of the fertile hills near this place, the radix is fibrous, not much branched, annual, woody, white and nearly smooth. the stem is simple branching ascending, [2-1/2 feet high.] celindric, villose and of a pale red colour. the branches are but few and those near it's upper extremity. the extremities of the branches are flexable and are bent downward near their extremities with the weight of the flowers. the leaf is sessile, scattered thinly, nearly linear tho' somewhat widest in the middle, two inches in length, absolutely entire, villose, obtusely pointed and of an ordinary green. above each leaf a small short branch protrudes, supporting a tissue of four or five smaller leaves of the same appearance with those discribed. a leaf is placed underneath ea[c]h branch, and each flower. the calyx is a one flowered spathe. the corolla superior consists of four pale perple petals which are tripartite, the central lobe largest and all terminate obtusely; they are inserted with a long and narrow claw on the top of the germ, are long, smooth, &amp; deciduous. there are two distinct sets of stamens the 1st. or principal consists of four, the filaments of which are capillary, erect, inserted on the top of the germ alternately with the petals, equal, short, membranous; the anthers are also four each being elivated with it's fillament, they are linear and reather flat, erect, sessile, cohering at the base, membranous, longitudinally furrowed, twice as long as the fillament naked, and of a pale perple colour. the second set of stamens are very minute are also four and placed within and opposite to the petals, these are scarcely persceptable while the 1st are large and conspicuous; the filaments are capillary equal, very short, white and smooth. the anthers are four, oblong, beaked, erect, cohering at the base, membranous, shorter than the fillaments, white naked and appear not to form pollen, there is one pistillum; the germ of which is also one, cilindric, villous, inferior, sessile, as long as the 1st stamens &amp; marked with 8 longitudinal furrows. the single style and stigma form a perfict monapetallous corolla only with this difference,'that the style which elivates the stigma or limb is not a tube but solid tho' it's outer appearance is that of the tube of a monopetallous corolla swelling as it ascends and gliding in such manner into the limb that it cannot be said where the style ends, or the stigma begins; jointly they are as long as the corolla, white, the limb is four cleft, sauser shaped, and the margins of the lobes entire and rounded. this has the appearance of a monopetallous flower growing from the center of a four petalled corollar, which is rendered more conspicuous in consequence of the 1st. being white and the latter of a pale perple. I regret very much that the seed of this plant are not yet ripe and it is pro[ba]ble will not be so during my residence in this neighbourhood.1 1 Both Prof. William Trelease, director of the Missouri Botanical Gardens, and Prof. C. V. Piper, of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, identify this as the plant named by Pursh Clarkia pulchella from the specimen preserved by Lewis.—Ed. [Clark:] Sunday June 1st. 1806 Late last evening Shabono &amp; Lapage returned haveing made a broken voyage. they assended the river on this side nearly opposit to the Village eight miles above us, here their led horse who had on him their stock of merchindize fell into the river from the side of a steep clift and swam over, they saw an indian on the opposit side whome they provaled on to drive their horse back again to them; in swiming the horse lost a dressed Elk skin of Lapages and several small articles, and their paint was distroyed by the water. here they remained and dryed their articles the evening of the 30h. ulto: the indians at the village learned their errand and not haveing a canoe, made an attempt yesterday morning made an attempt to pass the river to them on a raft with a parcel of roots and bread in order to trade with them; the indian raft struck a rock upset and lost their cargo; the river haveing swallowed both merchindize &amp; roots, our traders returned with empty bags. This morning Geo: Drewyer accompanied by Hohâstillpilp set out in serch of two tomahawks of ours which we have understood were in the possession of certain indians resideing at a distance in the plains on the South Side of Flat Head river; one is a pipe tomahawk which Cap L. left at our camp on Musquetor Creek and the other was stolen from me whilst we lay at the forks of this and Chopunnish rivers last fall. Colter and Willard set out this morning on a hunting excurtion towards the quawmash grounds beyond Colins creek. we begin to feel some anxiety with respect to Sergt. Ordway and party who were sent to Lewis's river for salmon; we have receved no intellegence of them since they set out. we desired Drewyer to make some enquiry after the Twisted hair; the old man has not been as good as his word with respect to encamping near us, and we fear we shall be at a loss to procure guides to conduct us by the different routs we wish to pursue from Travillers rest to the waters of the Missouri. [Lewis:] Monday June 2nd. 1806. Mr. Neal and York were sent on a trading voyage over the river this morning, having exhausted all our merchandize we are obliged to have recourse to every subterfuge in order to prepare in the most ample manner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journy, the Rocky Mountains, where hungar and cold in their most rigorous forms assail the w[e]aried traveller; not any of us have yet forgotten our suffering in those mountains in September last, and I think it probable we never shall. Our traders Mc. Neal and York were furnished with the buttons which Capt. C. and myself cut off our coats, some eye water and Basilicon which we made for that purpose and some Phials and small tin boxes which I had brought out with Phosphorus. in the evening they returned with about 3 bushels of roots and some bread having made a successfull voyage, not much less pleasing to us than the return of a good cargo to an East India Merchant. Collins, Sheilds, R &amp; J. Feilds and Shannon set out on a hunting excurtion to the Quawmash grounds on the lower side of Collins's Creek. our horses many of them have become so wild that we cannot take them without the assistance of the Indians who are extreemly dextrous in throwing a rope and taking them with a noose about the neck; as we frequently want the use of our horses when we cannot get the assistance of the indians to take them, we had a strong pound formed today in order to take them at pleasure. Drewyer arrived this morning with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohâstillpilp who had accompanyed him to the lodges of the persons who had our tomahawks. he obtained both the tomahawks principally by the influence of the former of these Cheifs. the one which had been stolen we prized most as it was the private property of the late Sergt. Floyd and Capt. C. was desirous of returning it to his friends. the man who had this tomahawk had purchased it from the Indian that had stolen it, and was himself at the moment of their arrival just expiring. his relations were unwilling to give up the tomehawk as they intended to bury it with the disceased owner, but were at length induced to do so for the consideration of a ha[n]dkerchief, two strands of beads, which (Cap C. sent by) Drewyer gave them and two horses given by the cheifs to be killed agreeably to their custom at the grave of the disceased. The bands of the Chopunnish who reside above the junction of Lewis's river and the Kooskooske bury their dead in the earth and place stones on the grave, they also stick little splinters of wood in betwe[e]n the interstices of the irregular mass of stone piled on the grave and afterwards cover the whole with a roof of board or split timber. the custom of sacreficing horses to the disceased appears to be common to all the nations of the plains of the Columbia. a wife of Neeshneeparkkeeook died some short time since, himself and hir relations sac[r]eficed 28 horses to her. The Indians inform us that there are a plenty of Moos to the S..E. of them on the East branch [Salmon River] of Lewis's [Snake] river which they call Tommanamah R. about Noon Sergt. Ordway Frazier and Wizer returned1 1 One of these men got two Spanish dollars from an Indian for an old razor. They said they got the dollars from about a Snake Indian's neck, they had killed some time ago. There are several dollars among these people, which they get in some way. We suppose the Snake Indians, some of whom do not live very far from New Mexico, get them from the Spaniards in that quarter. The Snake Indians also get horses from the Spaniards.—Gass (pp. 320, 321). with 17 salmon and some roots of cows; the distance was so great from which they had brought the fish that most of them were nearly spoiled. these fish were as fat as any I ever saw; sufficiently so to cook themselves without the addition of grease; those which were sound were extreemly delicious; their flesh is of a fine rose colour with a small admixture of yellow. these men set out on the 27th. ult. and instead of finding the fishing shore at the distance of half a days ride as we had been informed, they did not reach the place at which they obtained their fish untill the evening of the 29th. having travelled by their estimate near 70 miles. the rout they had taken however was not a direct one; the Indians conducted them in the first instance to the East branch of Lewis's river about 20 miles above its junction with the South branch, at a distance of about 50 Ms. where they informed them they might obtain fish; but on their arrival at that place finding that the salmon had not yet arrived or were not taken, they were conducted down that river to a fishery a few miles below the junction of the forks of Lewis's river about 20 Ms. further, here with some difficulty and remaining one day they purchased the salmon which they brought with them. the first 20 Ms. of their rout was up Commeâp Creek and through a plain open country die hills of the creek continued high and broken with some timber near it's borders. the ballance of their rout was th[r]ough a high broken mountanous country generally well timbered with pine the soil fertile in this quarter they met with an abundance of deer and some bighorned animals. the East fork of Lewis's river they discribe as one continued rapid about 150 yds. wide it's banks are in most places solid and perpendicular rocks, which rise to a great hight; it's hills are mountains high. on the tops of some of those hills over which they passed the snow had not entirely disappeared, and the grass was just springing up. at the fishery on Lewis's river below the forks there is a very considerable rapid nearly as great from the information of Sergt. Ordway as the great falls (rapids) of the Columbia the river 200 yds. wide. their common house at this fishery is built of split timber 150 feet long and 35 feet wide flat at top. The general course from hence to the forks of Lewis's river is a little to the West of south about 45 ms.1 1 This journey is easily traced, and Sergeant Ordway's party was probably the first white men upon the lower Salmon River (East Fork of Lewis River). The cañon of the Salmon is well described.—Ed. The men at this season resort their fisheries while the women are employed in collecting roots. both forks of Lewis's river above their junction appear to enter a high Mountainous country. my sick horse being much reduced and apearing to be in such an agoni of pain that there was no hope of his recovery I ordered him shot this evening. the other horses which we casterated are all nearly recovered, and I have no hesitation in declaring my beleif that the indian method of gelding is preferable to that practiced by ourselves. [Clark:] Monday June 2nd 1806. Mc. Neal and York were sent on a tradeing voyage over the river this morning. having exhosted all our merchindize we were obliged to have recourse to every Subterfuge in order to prepare in the most ample manner in our power to meet that wretched portion of our journey, the Rocky Mountains, where hungar and Cold in their most rigorous form assail the waried traveller; not any of us have yet forgotten our sufferings in those mountains in September last, I think it probable we never shall. Our traders Mc. Neal and York are furnished with the buttons which Capt L—. and my self cut off of our coats, some eye water and Basilicon which we made for that purpose and some phials of eye water and some tin boxes which Capt L. had brought from Philadelphia. in the evening they returned with about 3 bushels of roots and some bread haveing made a suckcessfull voyage, not much less pleasing to us than the return of a good cargo to an East India merchant. Shields, Collins, Reuben &amp; Joseph Field &amp; Shannon set out on a hunting excurtion to the quawmash on the lower side of Collins Creek &amp; towards the mountains. Drewyer arived this evening with Neeshneparkkeeook and Hohashillpilp who had accompanied him to the lodge of the person who had our tomahawks, he obtained both the toma-hawks principally by the influence of the former of those Chiefs, the one which had been stolen we prized most as it was the private property of the late Serjt. Floyd and I was desirous of returning it to his friends. The man who had this tomahawk had purchased it from the man who had stolen it, and was himself at the moment of their arival just expireing. his relations were unwilling to give up the tomahawk as they intended to bury it with the deceased owner, but were at length [induced] to do so for the consideration of a handkerchief, two strands of beeds, which drewyer gave them and two horses given by the Chiefs to be Killed agreeable to their custom at the grave of the deceased. The custom of sacrificeing horses to the disceased appears to be common to all the nations of the plains of the Columbia, a Wife of Neeshneeparkkeeook died some short time sence, himself and her relations sacrificed 28 horses to her. The Indians inform us that there is a plenty of Moos to the S. E. of them on the East branch of Lewis's river which they call Tommawamah River. about noon Sergt. Ordway Frazier and Wiser returned with 17 salmon and some roots of the cows; the distance was so great from whence they brought the fish, that most of them were nearly spoiled. those fish were as fat as any I ever saw; sufficiently so to cook themselves without the addition of Grease or butter; those which were sound were extreemly delicious; their flesh is of a fine rose colour with a small admixture of yellow. these men set out on the 27th. ulto: and in sted of finding the fishing shore at the distance of half a days ride as we had been informed, they did not reach the place at which they obtained their fish untill the evening of the 29th. haveing traveled near 70 miles. the rout they had taken however was not a direct one; the Indians conducted them in the first instance to the East fork of Lewis's river about 10 miles above it's junction with the South branch, a distance of about 50 miles where they informed them they might obtain fish; but on their arival at that place finding that the Salmon had not arived or were not taken, they were conducted down that river to a fishery a fiew miles below the junction of the forks of Lewis's River about 20 miles further, here they remained one day and with some dificuelty, they purchased the salmon which they brought with them. the first 20 ms. of their rout was up Comm?ap Creek and through a plain open country, the hills of the creek continued high and broken with some timber near it's borders. the ballance of their rout was through a high broken mountanious country. generally well timbered with pine the soil fertile. in this quarter the[y] meet with abundance of deer and some big-horned Animals. The East fork [Salmon] of Lewis's river they discribe as one continued rapid of about 150 yards wide, it's banks are in most places solid and perpindicular rocks, which rise to a great hight; it's hills are mountanious high. on the top of some of those hills over which they passed, the snow had not entirely disappeared, and the grass was just springing up. at the fishery on Lewis's river below the forks there is a very considerable rapid, nearly as Great from the information of Sergt. Ordway as the Great falls of the Columbia1 1 The falls of the Lewis or Snake below Salmon River are now known as Wild Goose Rapids.—Ernest Bross, managing editor of Portland Oregonian. the river 200 yards wide. their common house at this fishery is built of split timber 150 feet long and 35 feet in width, flat at top. the general course from here to the forks of Lewis's river is a little to the west of South about 45 ms. The men at this season resort their fisheries while the womin are employed in collecting roots. both forks above the junction of Lewis's river appear to enter a high mountainious country. our horses are all recovering &amp; I have no hesitation in declareing that I believe that the Indian method of guilding [is] preferable to that practised by ourselves. [Lewis:] Tuesday June 3.d 1806. Our invalids are all on the recovery; Bratton is much stronger and can walk about with considerable ease. the Indian Cheif appears to be gradually recovering the uce of his limbs, and the child is nearly well; the imposthume on his neck has in a great measure subsided and left a hard lump underneath his left ear; we still continue the application of the onion poltice. at 2 P. M. The Broken arm and 3 of his wariors visited us and remained all night. Colter, Jo. Fields and Willard returned this evening with five deer and one bear of the brown speceis; the hair of this was black with a large white spot on the breast containing a small circular black spot. to day the Indians dispatched an express over the mountains to travellers rest or the neighbourhood of that Creek on Clark's river in order to learn from the Oote-lash-shoots a band of the Flatheads who have wintered there, the occurrences that have taken place on the East side of the mountains during that season. this is the band which we first met with on that river. the mountains being practicable for this express we thought it probable that we could also pass, but the Indians informed us that several of the creeks would yet swim our horses, that there was no grass and that the roads were extreemly deep and slipery; they inform us that we may pass conveniently in twelve or fourteen days. we have come to a resolution to remove from hence to the quawmash grounds beyond Collins's creek on the 10th. to hut in that neighbourhood a few days, if possible lay in a stock of meat and then attempt the mountains about the middle of this month. I begin to lose all hope of any dependance on the Salmon as this river will not fall sufficiently to take them before we shall leave it, and as yet I see no appearance of their runing near the shores as the indians informed us they would in the course of a few day. I find that all the salmon which they procure themselve they obtain on Lewis's river, and the distance thither is too great for us to think of sending after them even had we merchandize with which to purchase. [Clark:] Tuesday June 3rd.. 1806 Our invalids are all on the recovery; bratten is much stronger and can walk about with considerable ease. the Indian chief appears to be gradually recovering the use of his limbs, and the child is nearly well; the inflomation on his neck continues but the swelling appears to subside, we still continue the application, of the onion poltice. at 3 P. M. the broker, arm and three wariors visited us and remained all night. Colter, Jos Fields and Willard returned this evenmg with five deer and one bear of the brown species; the hair of this was black with a large white spot on the breast containing a small circular black spot. (this species of bear is smaller than our common black bear) this was a female bear and as our hunters informed us had cubs last year, this they judged from the length and size of her tits &amp;c. this bear I am confident is not larger than the yerlin [yearling] cubs of our country. To day the Indians dispatched an express over the mountains to Travellers rest or to the neighbourhood of that creek on Clark's river in order to learn from a band of Flat-Heads who inhabit that river and who have probably wintered on Clarks river near the enterance of travellers rest Creek, the occurencs which have taken place on the East side of the mountains dureing the last winter. this is the band which we first met with on that river. the mountains being practicable for this express we thought it probable that we could also pass, but the Chiefs informs us that several of the Creek's would yet swim our horses, that there was no grass and that the road was extreemly deep and slipery; they inform us that we may pass conveniently in twelve or fourteen davs. we have come to a resolution to remove from hence to the quawmash Grounds beyond Colins Creek on the 10th. to hunt in that neighbourhood a fiew days, if possible lay in a stock of meat, and then attempt the mountains about the middle of this month. I begin to lose all hope of any dependance on the Salmon as this river will not fall sufficiently to take them before we shall leave it, and as yet I see no appearance of their running near the shore as the indians informed us they would in the course of a fiew days. I find that all the Salmon which they precure themselves they obtain on Lewis's river, and the distance thither is too great for us to think of sending after them, even had we merchendize with which to purchase the salmon. [Lewis:] Wednesday June 4th. 1806. about noon The 3 Cheifs left us and returned to their vilages. while they were with us we repeated the promises we had formerly made them and invited them to the Missouri with us, they declined going untill the latter end of the summer and said it was there intention to spend the ensuing winter on the East side of the Rocky mountains. they gave us no positive answer to a request which we made, that two or three of their young men should accompany me to the falls of the Missouri and there wait my return from the upper part of Maria's river where it was probable I should meet with some of the bands of the Minnetares from Fort de Prarie, that in such case I should indeavor to bring about a good understanding between those indians and themselves, which when effected they would be informed of it th[r]ough the young men thus sent with me, and that on the contrary should I not be fortunate enough to meet with these people nor to prevail on them to be at peace they would equally be informed through those young men, and they might still remain on their guard with rispect to them untill the whites had it in their power to give them more effectual relief. The Broken Arm invited us to his village and said he wished to speak to us before we set out, and that he had some roots to give us tor our journey over the mountains; Capt. C. promised to visit him as he wished the day after tomorrow. Sheilds returned this evening from the quawmash grounds with 2 deer which he had killed. [Clark:] Wednesday June 4th. 1806 About noon the 3 chiefs left us and returned to their villages. While they were with us we repeeted the promises we had formerly made them and envited them to the Missouri with us, they declined going untill the latter end of the Summer, and said it was their intention to spend the insuewing winter on the East Side of the Rocky Mountains, they gave us no positive answer to a request which we made, that two or three of their young men should accompany Cap L. to the falls of Missouri and there wait his return from the upper part of Maria's river where it was probable he should meet with some of the bands of the Blackfoot Indians and Minitarres of Fort dePrarie, that in such case Capst L. would indeavor to bring about a good understanding between those Indians and themselves, which when effected they would be informed of it through the young men thus sent with him. and that on the contrary should he not be fortunate enough to meet with those people, nor to provaile on them to be at peace they would equally be informed through those young men, and they might still remain on their guard with respect to them, untill the whites had it more in their power to give them more effectual relief. I also urged the necessaty of sending one or two of their considerate men to accompany me by way of the Shoshones on the head of Jeffersons river and about the three forks of the Missouri which [with] whome there is most probably some of the Chiefs of those bands of Shoshones with whome they are at war, and by which means a message [may be] sent to that nation &amp; good understanding brought about between the Shoshones and the Chopunnish Nations which appears to be the wish of both Nations. The Broken Arm envited us to his Village and said he wished to speak to us before we set out, and that he had some roots to give us for journey over the mountains; I promised to visit him as he wished the day after tomorrow. Shields returned this evening from the quawmash grounds with two Deer which he had killed. [Lewis:] Thursday June 5th. 1806 Colter and Bratton were permitted to visit the indian villages to day for the purpose of trading for roots and bread, they were fortunate and made a good return, we gave the indian cheif another sweat today, continuing it as long as he could possibly bear it; in the evening he was very languid but appeared still to improve in the use of his limbs. the child is recovering fast the inflamation has subsided intirely, we discontinued the poltice, and applyed a plaster of basilicon; the part is still considerably swolen and hard. in the evening R. Feilds Shannon and Labuish return from the chaise and brought with them five deer and a brown bear. among the grasses of this country I observe a large speceis which grows in moist situations; it rises to the hight of eight or ten feet, the culm is jointed, hollow, smooth, as large as a goos quill and more firm than ordinary grasses; the leaf is linnear broad and rough; it has much the appearance of the maden cain as it is called in the state of Ge[o]rgia, and retains its virdure untill late in the fall. this grass propegates principally by the root which is horizontal and perennial. a second speceis grows in tussucks and rises to the hight of six or eight feet; it seems to delight in the soil of the river bottoms which possess a greater mixture of sand than the hills in this neighbourhood. this is also a harsh course grass; it appears to be the same which is called the Corn grass in the Southern states, and the foxtail in Virginia. a third speceis resembles the cheet, tho' the horses feed on it very freely. a fourth and most prevalent speceis is a grass which appears to be the same called the blue grass common to many parts of the United States; it is common to the bottom as well as to the uplands, is now seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords an excellent pasture for horses and appears to bear the frosts and snow better than any grass in our country; I therefore regret very much that the seed will not be ripe before probable departure. this is a fine soft grass and would no doubt make excellent hay if cultivated.1 1 The first species of grass has not been identified; the second is Elymus cardensatus; the third is Bromus margiatus; and the fourth Poa sandbergii, Vasey.— C. V. Piper. I do not find the greensweard here which we met with on the lower part of the Columbia. there are also several speceis of the wild rye to be met with in the praries. among the plants and shrubs common to our co[u]ntry I observe here the seven bark, wild rose, vining honey sickle, sweet willow, red willow, longleafed pine, Cattail or cooper's flag, lamsquarter, strawberry, raspberry, tonge grass, musterd, tanzy, sinquefeild [cinquefoil], horsemint, coltsfoot, green plantin, cansar weed, [cancerwort] elder, shoeraate and several of the pea blume flowering plants.2 2 Of those not elsewhere identified, the cattail flag is Typha latifolia; and the cinquefoil, Potentilla sp.—C.

Colter and Bratten were permitted to visit the Indian Village to day for the purpose of tradeing for roots and bread, they were fortunate and made a good return. We gave the Indian Chief another sweat to-day, continuing it as long as he could bear it, in the evening he was very languid but still [continued] to improve in the use of his limbs. the Child is recovereing fast. I applied a plaster of sarve [salve] made of the rozen of the long leafed pine, Beaswax and Bears oil mixed, which has subsided the inflomation entirely, the part is considerably swelled and hard. in the evening Reuben Fields, G. Shannon, Labiech, &amp; Collins returned from the chaise and brought with them five deer and a brown Bear. Among the Grasses of this country I observe a large species which grows in moist situations; it rises to the hight of eight or ten feet, the culm is jointed, hollow, smooth, as large as a goose quill, and more firm than ordinary grass; the leaf is linner [linear] broad and rough; it has much the appearance of the meadin cain [maiden cane] as it is called in the Southern parts of the U'States, and retains it's virdu[r]e untill late in the fall, this grass propagates principally by the root which is horozontal and perennial. a second species grows in tussucks and rises to the hight of six or eight feet; it seams to delight in the soil of the river bottoms which possess a greater mixture of sand than the hills in this neighbourhood. this is also a harsh course grass; it appears to be the same which is called the corn grass in the southern states, and the Foxtail in virginia. a third species resembles the cheet, tho' the horses feed on it very freely. a fou[r]th and most prevalent species is a grass which appears to be the same called the blue Grass common to maney parts of the United States; it is common to the bottoms as well as the uplands, is now seeding and is from 9 inches to 2 feet high; it affords an excellent pa[s]terage for horses and appears to bear the frost and snow better than any grass in our country; I therefore regrett very much that the seed will not be ripe before our probable departure. this is a fine soft grass and would no doubt make excellent hay if cultivated. I do not find the greensword here, which we met with on the lower part of the Columbia. There are also several species of the wild rye to be met with in the praries. among the plants and shrubs common to our country I observe here the seven bark, wild rose, vineing honeysuckle, sweet willow, red willow, long leafed pine, cattail or coopers Flag, Lambsquarter, Strawberries, Raspberries, Gooseberries, tongue grass, Mustard, tanzy, sinquefield, horse mint, water penerial [pennyroyal], elder, coalts foot, Green plantin, canser weed, Shoemate, and several of the pea blume flowering plants. Frazier who had permission to visit the Twisted Hairs Lodge at the distance of ten or twelve miles did not return this evening. The river falls in course of the day and rises some at night as will Be seen by the remarks in the Diary of the weather. this most probably is the melding [melting] of the snows dureing the day &amp;c. [Lewis:] Friday June 6th. 1806 This morning Frazier returned having been in quest of some roots and bread: which [he] had left at the lodg of the Twisted hair when on his way to the fishery on Lewis's river. the Twisted hair came with him but I was unable to converse with him for the want of an interpreter, Drewyer being absent with Capt. C. This Cheif left me in the evening and returned to his village. Capt. C. Visited the Broken arm to day agreeably to his promise; he took with him Drewyer and several others. they were received in a friendly manner. The Broken Arm informed Capt. C. that the nation would not pass the mountain untill the latter end of the summer, and that with rispect to the young men whom we had requested should accompany us to the falls of the Missouri, [they] were not yet scelected for that purpose nor could they be so untill there was a meeting of the nation in counsil. that this would happen in the course of ten or twelve days as the whole of the lodges were about to remove to the head of the Commeâp Creek in the plain near Lewis's river, that when they had assembled themselves they would hold a council and scelect the young men. that if we set out previously to that period the men would follow us. we therefore do not calculate on any assistance from them as guides, but depend more upon engageing some of the Ootlashoots in the neighborhood of Travellers rest C. for that purpose. The broken arm gave Capt. C. a few dryed Quawmas roots as a great present, but in our estimation those of cows are much better, I am confident they are much more healthy. The men who were with Capt. C. obtained a good store of roots and bread in exchange for a number of little notions, using the Yanke phrase, with which their own enginuity had principally furnished them. on examination we find that our whole party have an ample store of bread and roots for our voyage, a circumstance not unpleasing. They returned at 5 P. M. shortly after which we were visited by Hohâstillpilp the two young Cheifs who gave us the horses in behalf of the nation some time since and several others, who remained all night. The Kooskooske is about 150 yds. wide at this place and discharges a vast body of water; notwithstanding it[s] high state the water remains nearly transparent, and it's temperature appea[r]s to be quite as cold as that of our best springs. we meet with a beautifull little bird in this neighbourhood about the size and somewhat the shape of the large sparrow, it is reather longer in proportion to it's bulk than the sparrow, it measures 7 inches from the extremity of the beek to that of the tail, the latter occupying 2-1/2 inches. the beak is reather more than half an inch in length, and is formed much like the Virginia nitingale; it is thick and large for a bird of it's size; wide at the base, both chaps convex, and pointed, the uper exceeds the under chap a little is somewhat curved and of a brown colour; the lower chap of a greenish yellow. the eye full reather large and of a black colour both puple and iris. the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of the neck and head is of a fine orrange yellow and red, the latter predominates on the top of the head and arround the base or the beak from whence it graduly deminishes &amp; towards the lower part of the neck, the orrange yellow prevails most; the red has the appearance of being laid over a ground of yellow. the breast, the sides, rump and some long feathers which lie between the legs and extend underneath the tail are of a fine orrange yellow. the tail, back and wings are black, e[x]cept a small stripe of yellow on the outer part of the middle joint of the wing, 1/4 of an inch wide and an inch in length, the tail is composed of twelve feathers of which those in the center are reather shortest, and the plumage of all the feathers of the tail is longest on that side of the quill next the center of the tail. the legs and feet are black, nails long and sharp; it has four toes on each foot, of which three are forward and one behind; that behind is as long as the two outer of the three toes in front.1 1 Coues says that this is the earliest description of the Louisiana tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), named by Wilson from a specimen procured by this expedition.—Ed.

The broken Arm informed me that maney of the small chief[s] of the different Bands of his nation had not heard our word from our own mouths, several of them were present and was glad to see me &amp;c. I repeeted in part what had been said in council before. The Broken arm told me that the nation would not pass the mountains untill the latter part of the summer, and with respect to the young men who we had requested to accompany us to the falls of Missouri, [they] were not yet selected for that purpose nor could they be so untill they had a meeting of the nation in council. that this would happen in the course of ten or 12 days as the whole of the Lodges were about to move to the head of Commeâp Creek in the Plain of Lewis's river, that when they held a council they would select two young men. that if we set out previously to that time the men would follow us. we therefore do not calculate [upon] any assistance from them as guides, but depend more upon engaging some of the Oat-lash-shoots on Clarks river in the neighbourhood of Travellers rest C. for that purpose. The Broken Arm gave me a fiew quawmash roots as a great preasent, but in my estimation those of Cows is much better. I am confident they are much more healthy. The Broken Arm informed me that they had latterly been informed that a party of the Shoshones had arived at the Y e-e-al po Nation who reside to the South of the enterance of Kooskooske into Lewis's river, and had informed that people that their nation (the Shoshones) had received the talk which was given their relations on the head of the East fork of Lewis's river last fall, and were resolved to pursue our councils, and had come fo[r]ward for the purpose of makeing peace with them, and allso with the Chopunnish &amp;c. that they had sent several men in serch of those people with a view to bring them to Lewis's river at which place the Broken Arm informed me he should meet them and smoke the pipe of peace. which he should afterwards send by with some of his Chiefs in company with those Shoshones to their nation and confirm a piece which never should be broken on his part. he produced two pipes one of which he said was as a present to me the other he intended to send to the Shoshones &amp;c. and requested me to take one, I receved the one made in the fas [h] ion of the country, the other which was of stone curiously inlaid with silver in the common form which he got from the Shoshones. I deckorated the stem of this pipe with blue ribon and white wampom and informed the chief this was the emblem of peace with us. The men who accompanied me obtained a good store of roots and bread in exchange for a number of little notions, useing the Yanke phrase, with which their own enginueity had principally furnished them. on examonation we find our whole party have a sufficient store of bread and roots for our Voyage. a circumstance not unpleasing. I returned at 4 P. M. followed by Hohâstillpilp the 2 young Chiefs who gave us the horses in behalf of the nation some time sence, the young man who gave us the horse at Collins Creek to kill as we came up, and several others. I met the twisted hair and two other indians with Frazier on the opposit bank from our Camp this morning &amp; sent him over to our Camp. I met him this evening on his return home. he informed me he could not accompany us across the mountains as his brother was sick &amp;c.</field>

Sergt. Gass, McNeal, Whitehouse and Goodrich accompanyed them with a view to procure some pack or lash ropes in exchange for parts of an old sain [seine], fish giggs, peices of old iron, old files and some bullets. they were also directed to procure some bags for the purpose of containing our roots &amp; bread. in the eveing they all returned except Whitehouse and Goodrich who remained all night. they procured a few strings but no bags. Hohâstillpilp passed the river to day and brought over a horse which he gave Frazier one of our party who had previously made him a present of a pair of Canadian shoes or shoe-packs. Drewyer set out on a hunting excurtion up Collins's Creek this evening. we wished to leave the deer in the neighbourhood of the quawmash plains undisturbed untill the 10th. when we intend removing thither to lay in some meat for our voyage over the Mountains. our party are much engaged in preparing their saddles arranging their loads provisions &amp;c. for our departure. There is a species of cherry which grows in this neighbourhood in sitations like the Choke cherry or near the little rivulets and water cou[r]ses. it seldom grows in clumps or from the same cluster of roots as the choke cherry dose. the stem is simple branching reather diffuse stem the cortex is of a redish dark brown and reather smooth. the leaf is of the ordinary texture and colour of those of most cherries, it is petiolate, a long oval 1-1/4 inches in length and 1/2 inch in width, obtuse, margin so finely serrate that it is scarcely perseptable &amp; smooth. the peduncle is common 1 inch in length, branch[ed], proceeding from the extremities as well as the sides of the branches, celindric gradually tapering; the secondary peduncles are about 1/2 inch in length scattered tho' proceeding more from the extremity of the common peduncle and are each furnished with a small bracted. the parts of fructification are much like those discribed of the choke cherry except that the petals are reather longer as is the calix reather deeper. the cherry appears to be half grown, the stone is begining to be hard and is in shape somewhat like that of the plumb; it appears that when ripe it would be as large as the Kentish cherry, which indeed the growth of the bush somewhat resembles; it rises about 6 or 8 feet high [Clark:] Saturday 7th. June 1806.1 1 Here begins Codex M, which is Clark's record of the journey, parallel with Lewis's, for the period from June 7 to Aug. 14, 1806.—Ed. The two young cheafs and other Indians who accompanied them crossed the river and returned to their Village this morning after brackfast; Sha[r]bono Sergt. Gass Mc:Neal, Whitehouse &amp; Goodrich accompanied them for the purpose of purchaseing or exchangeing old peces of sane, fish gig, peces of iron, bullets, and old files and Such articles as they could raise for ropes and Strings for to lash their loads, and bags to cary their roots in Sergt. Gass, Sha[r]bono &amp; Mc.Neal returned at 2 P.M. haveing precured a String each only. Whitehouse and Goodrich continued at the Village all night. Hohastillpilp crossed the river to day and brought over a horse and gave it to Frazier one of our party who had made him a present previously of a par of canidian Shoes. one of our men informed me one of the young Chiefs who had given us two horses already was in Serch of one which he intended to give to me. George Drewyer Set out on a hunting excurtion up Collins's Creek alone. our party are all much engaged in preparing Sadles and packing up their stores of Provisions &amp;c. The Flat Head river is about 150 yards wide at this place and discharges a vast body of water; notwithstanding it's high State the water remains nearly transparent, and it's temperature appears to be quit[e] as cold as that of our best Springs. we met with a butifull little bird in this neighbourhood about the Size and Somewhat the shape of the large Sparrow. it measures 7 inches from the extremity of the beak to that of the tail, the latter Occupying 2 1/2 inches. the beak is reather more than half an inch in length, and is formed much like the Virginia Nightingal; [red bd..] it is thick and large for a bird of it's size, wide at the base, both chaps convex, and pointed, the upper exceeds the under chap a little is Somewhat cirved and of a brown colour; the lower chap of a Greenish yellow. the eye full reather large and of a black colour both puple and iris. the plumage is remarkably delicate; that of the neck and head is of a fine orrange yellow and red. the latter predomonates on the top of the head and around the base of the beak from whence it gradually diminishes towards the lower part of the Neck, the orring[e] yellow prevails most, the red has the Appearance of haveing been laid over a ground of yellow. the breast, the Sides, rump and some long feathers which lie between the legs [and] extend underneath the tail is of a fine orrange yellow, the tail, back and wings are black, except a Small Strip of yellow on the outer part of the Middle joint of the wing, 1/4 of an inch wide and an inch in length. the tail is composed of 12 feathers of which those in the center are reather Shortest, and the plumage of all the feathers of the tail is longest on that Side of the quill next to the center of the tail. the legs and feet are black, nails long and Sharp; it has four toes on each foot, of which three are forward and one behind; that behind is as long as the two outer of the three toes in front.

The sick Cheif is fast on the recovery, he can bear his weight on his legs, and has acquired a considerable portion of strength. the child is nearly well; Bratton has so far recovered that we cannot well consider him an invalid any longer, he has had a tedious illness which he boar with much fortitude and firmness. The Cutnose visited us today with ten or twelve warriors; two of the latter were Y-e-let-pos [Willetpos] a band of the Chopunnish nation residing on the South side of Lewis's river whom we have not previously seen. the band with which we have been most conversent call themselves pel-late-pal-ler.1 1 Probably the Paloos, a Shahaptian tribe. The Yeletpos (or Willetpos) were the Waiilatpuan tribe known as Cayuse, who occupied the lower part of the Walla Walla River, and some adjoining territory on the Columbia. The Narrative of the Wilkes' exploring expedition of 1838–42 states (vol. iv, p. 422) that Lewis and Clark presented an American flag to the Cayuse (who were allies of the Wallawalla, but long hostile to the Shoshoni), calling it a flag of peace. As a result of this, the allies planted the flag at a trading rendezvous called "the Grande Ronde," and made a permanent peace with the Shoshoni. This last statement is confirmed by Clark himself; see his entry for June 23 following this.—Ed. one of the yeletpos exchanged his horse for an indifferent one of ours and received a tomahawk to boot; this tomahawk was one for which Capt. C. had given another in exchange with the Clah-clel-lâh Chief at the rapids of the Columbia, we also exchanged two other of our indifferent horses with unsound backs for much better horses in fine order without any consideration but the horse itself, several foot races were run this evening between the indians and our men. the indians are very active; one of them proved as fleet as Drewyer and R. Fields, our swiftest runners. when the racing was over the men divided themselves into two parties and played prison base, by way of exercise which we wish the men to take previously to entering the mountain; in short those who are not hunters have had so little to do that they are geting reather lazy and slouthfull. after dark we had the violin played and danced for the amusement of ourselves and the indians. one of the indians informed us that we could not pass the mountains untill the full of the next moon or about the first of July, that if we attempted it sooner our horses would be at least three days travel without food on the top of the mountain; this information is disagreeable inasmuch as it causes some doubt as to the time at which it will be most proper for us to set out. however as we have no time to loose we will wrisk the chanches and set out as early as the indians generally think it practicable or the middle of this month. [Clark:] Sunday June 8th.. 1806 Drewyer returned this morning from the chase without killing any thing. his horse left him last night and he prosued him near our camp before he cought him. The Sick Chief is much mended, he can bear his weight on his legs and recovers strength. the Child has nearly recovered. The Cut nose and ten or 12 came over today to visit us, two of those were of the tribes from the plains of Lewis's river whome we had not before seen; one of those men brought a horse [for] which I gave a tomahawk which I had exchanged for with the chief of the Clahclahlah's Nation below the Great rapids of Columbia, and [a] broken-down horse which was not able to cross the mountains, we also exchanged 2 of our indifferent horses for sound back horses, in the evening several foot races were run by the men of our party and the Indians; after which our party devided and played at prisoners base untill night, after dark the fiddle was played and the party amused themselves in danceing. one of those Indians informed us that we could not cross the mountains untill the full of the next moon; or about the 1st. of July. if we attempted it Sooner our horses would be three days without eating, on the top of the Mountns. this information is disagreeable to us, in as much as it admits of some doubt, as to the time most proper for us to Set out. at all events we Shall Set out at or about the time which the indians Seem to be generally agreed would be the most proper. about the middle of this month. [Lewis:] Monday June 9th. 1806 This morning we had all our horses brought up and indeavoured to exchange five or six with the Indians in consequence of their having unsound backs but succeeded in exchanging one only. Hohâstillpilp with several of the natives who visited us yesterday took leave of us and set out for the plains near Lewis's river where the nation are about to assemble themselves. The broken arm made us a short visit this morning and took leave of us, being about to set out with his village today in order to join the nation at their rehdezvouz on Lewis's R. The Cutnose or Neeshneeparkkeeook borrowed a horse and rode down the Kooskooske River a few miles this morning in quest of some young eagles which he intends raising for the benefit of their feathers; he returned soon after with a pair of young Eagles of the grey kind; they were nearly grown and prety well feathered, in the evening the young Chief who gave both Capt. C. and myself a horse some time since, came to our camp with a party of young men and remained all night. this evening one of our party obtained a very good horse for an indifferent one by giving the indian an old leather shirt in addition, we eat the last of our meat yesterday evening and have lived on roots today, our party seem much elated with the idea of moving on towards their friends and country, they all seem allirt in their movements today; they have every thing in readiness for a move, and notwithstanding the want of provision have been amusing themselves very merrily today in runing footraces pitching quites [quoits], prison basse &amp;c. the river has been falling for several days and is now lower by near six feet than it has been; this we view as a strong evidence that the great body of snow has left the mountains, though I do not conceive that we are as yet loosing any time as the roads is in many parts extreemly steep rocky and must be dangerous if wet and slippry; a few days will dry the roads and will also improve the grass. [Clark:] Monday June 9h. 1806. We had all of our horses brought up and attempted to exchange our sore back and most indifferent horses with the indians for sound back horses, we exchanged one only. Hohas[t]illpilp took his leave of us and Set our for the Plains of Lewises river, with several of the nativs who Visited us yesterday. The broken arm came over and continued a fiew minits with us this morning, and also took his leave of us &amp; set out with his Village for the plains of Lewis's river. The Cut nose borrowed a horse and rode down the flathead river a fiew miles to take some young Eagles, which he intends to raise for their feathers. in the evening one of the young Chiefs who had given both Capt. Lewis and myself a horse came to our camp accompanied by 10 of his people and continued with us all night. one of our men exchanged a very indifferent horse for a very good one. our party exolted with the idea of once more proceeding on towards their friends and country are elert in all their movements and amuse themselves by pitching quates, Prisoners bast running races &amp;c. The flat head river is still falling fast and [is] nearly as low as it was at the time we arrived at this place. this fall of water is what the nativs have informed us was a proper token for us. when this river fell the Snows would be sufficiently melted for us to cross the Mountains. the greater length of time we delayed after the time, the higher the grass would grow on th[e] Mountains. [Lewis:] Tuesday June 10th. 1806 This morning we arrose early and had our horses collected except one of Cruzatt's and one of Whitehouse's, which were not to be found; after a surch of some hours Cruzatt's horse was obtained and the indians promised to find the other and bring it to us at the quawmash flatts where we purpose encamping a few days. at 11 A. M. we set out with the party each man being well mounted and a light load on a second horse, beside which we have several supenemary horses in case of accedent or the want of provision, we therefore feel ourselves perfectly equiped for the mountains. we ascended the river hills which are very high and about three miles in extent our course being N. 22°. E. thence N. 15. W. 2 m to Collin's creek. thence due North 5 m. to the Eastern border of the quawmash flatts where we encamped near the place we first met with the Chopunnish last fall1 1 Quamash flats is now known as Weippe Prairie, in Shoshone County, Idaho, Clark' s first view of this extensive plain was Sept. 20, 1805; see vol. iii, pp. 77–87. ante.—Ed. the pass of Collins's Creek was deep and extreemly difficult tho' we passed without sustaining further injury than weting some of our roots and bread. the country through which we passed is extreemly fertile and generally free of stone, is well timbered with several speceis of fir, long leafed pine and larch. the undergrowth is chooke cherry near the water courses, black alder, a large speceis of redroot now in blume, a growth which resembles the pappaw in it's leaf and which bears a burry with five valves of a deep perple colour, two speceis of shoemate sevenbark, perple haw, service berry, goosburry,2 2 The redroot is Ceanothus sanguineus, Pursh; the "growth which resembles the pappaw "is Lonicera involucrata, Banks; the two species of sumac are Rhus glabra, L., and Rhus toxicodendra, L.; the service berry is Amelanchier sp.; the gooseberry, Ribes niveum or cognatum.—C.

V. Piper. there are two speceis of the wild rose both quinqui petallous and of a damask red but the one is as large as the common red rose of our gardens. I observed the apples of this speceis last fall to be more than triple the size of those of the ordinary wild rose; the stem of this rose is the same with the other tho' the leaf is somewhat larger.4 4 Rosa nutkana and R. pisocarpa.—C. V. Piper. after we encamped this evening we sent out our hunters; Collins killed a doe on which we suped much to our satisfaction. we had scarcely reached Collins's Creek before we were over taken by a party of Indians who informed us that they were going to the quawmash fiatts to hunt; their object I beleive is the expectation of b[e]ing fed by us in which however kind as they have been we must disappoint them at this moment as it is necessary that we should use all frugallaty as well as employ every exertion to provide meat for our journey. they have encamped with us. we find a great number of burrowing squirels about our camp of which we killed several; I eat of them and found them quite as tender and well flavored as our grey squirel. saw many sand hill crains and some ducks in the slashey glades about this place. [Clark:] Tuesday June 10th. 1806. rose early this morning and had all the horses collected except one of Whitehouses horses which could not be found, an Indian promised to find the horse and bring him on to us at the quawmash fields at which place we intend to delay a fiew days for the laying in some meat by which time we calculate that the Snows will have melted more off the mountains and the grass raised to a sufficient hight for our horses to live. we packed up and Set out at 11 A M we set out with the party each man being well mounted and a light load on a 2d horse, besides which we have several supernumary horses in case of accident or the want of provisions, we therefore feel ourselves perfectly equiped for the Mountains. we assended the hills which are very high and about three miles in extent our course being N.22d. E, thence N.15°.W 2 Ms: to Collins Creek. Thence North 5 Miles to the Eastern boarders of the Quawmash flatts where we encamped near the place I first met with the Chopunnish Nation last fall. the pass of Collins Creek was deep and extreemly difficult tho' we passed without sustaining further injury than wetting some of our roots and bread. The Country through which we passed is extreemly fertile and generally free from Stone, is well timbered with several Species of fir, long leafed pine and Larch. the undergrowth is choke cherry near the watercourses, black alder, a large species of red root now in blume, a Growth which resembles the poppaw in it's leaf, and which bears a berry with five valves of a deep purple colour, two species of shoemate, seven bark, perple haw, service berry, Goose berry, wildrose, honey suckle which bears a white berry, and a Species of dwart pine which grows about 10 or 12 feet high, bears a globarlar formed cone with small scales, the leaf is about the length and much the appearance of the pitch pine haveing it's leaves in fassicles of two; in other respects they would at a little distance be taken for the young plants of the long leafed pine. There are two Species of the wild rose both quinque petallous and of a damask red, but the one is as large as the common red rose of our guardens. I observed the apples of these Species last fall to be more than triple the size of those of the ordinary wild rose; the stem of this rose is the same with the other tho' the leaf is somewhat larger. after we encamped this evening we Sent out our hunters; Collins killed a doe on which we Suped much to our satisfaction, we had not reached the top of the river hills before we were overtaken by a party of 8 Indians who informed me that they were gowing to the quawmash flatts to hunt; their object I belive is the expectation of being fed by us in which however kind as they have been we must disappoint them at this moment as it is necessary that we should use all frugallaty as well as employ every exertion to provide meat for our journey. they have encamped with us. we find a great number of burrowing squirels about our camp of which we killed several; I eate of them and found them quit[e] as tender and well flavd. as our grey squirrel. Saw many sand hill crains and some ducks in the Slashey Glades about this place. [Lewis:] Wednesday June 11th. 1806. All our hunters were out this morning by daylight; Labuish and Gibson only proved successfull, the former killed a black bear of the brown speceis and a very large buck, the latter also killed a fine fat buck. five of the Indians also turned out and hunted untill noon, when they returned without having killed anything; at three P. M. the[y] left us on their return to the[i]r villages. previous to their departure one of our men exchanged an indifferent horse with one of them for a very good one. in the evening our hunters resumed the chase; as game has become scarce and shye near our camp they were directed to hunt at a greater distance and therefore set out prepared to remain all night and make a mornings hunt in grounds not recently frequented. Whitehouse returned this morning to our camp on the Kooskooske in surch of his horse. As I have had frequent occasion to mention the plant which the Chopunnish call quawmash1 1 The com-mas grows in great abundance in this plain, and at this time looks beautiful, being in full bloom, with flowers of a pale blue color.—Gass (p. 323). I shall here give a more particular description of that plant and the mode of preparing it for food as practiced by the Chopunnish and others in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains with whom it forms much the greatest portion of their subsistence. we have never met with this plant but in or adjacent to a piny or fir timbered country, and there always in the open grounds and glades; in the Columbian vally and near the coast it is to be found in small quantities and inferior in size to that found in this neighbourhood and in the high rich flatts and vallees within the rocky mountains, it delights in a black rich moist soil, and even grows most luxuriantly where the land remains from 6 to nine inches under water untill the seed are nearly perfect which in this neighbourhood or on these flats is about the last of this month. neare the river where I had an opportunity of observing it the seed were begining to ripen on the 9th. inst. and the soil was nearly dry. it seems devoted to it's particular soil and situation, and you will seldom find it more than a few feet from the inundated soil tho' within it's limits it grows very closely in short almost as much so as the bulbs will permit; the radix is a tunicated bulb, much the consistence shape and appearance of the onion, glutanous or somewhat slymy when chewed and almost tasteless and without smell in it's unprepared state; it is white except the thin or outer tunicated scales which are few black and not succulent; this bulb is from the size of a nutmeg to that of a hens egg and most commonly of an intermediate size or about as large as an onion of one years growth from the seed. the radicles are numerous, reather large, white, flexable, succulent and diverging. the foliage consists of from one to four seldom five radicale, linear sessile and revolute pointed leaves; they are from 12 to 18 inches in length and from 1 to 3/4 of an inch in widest part which is near the middle; the uper disk is somewhat groved of a pale green and marked it's whole length with a number of small longitudinal channels; the under disk is a deep glossy green and smooth. the leaves sheath the peduncle and each other as high as the surface of the earth or about 2 inches; they are more succulent than the grasses and less so than most of the lillies hyesinths &amp;c. the peduncle is soletary, proceeds from the root, is columner, smooth leafless and rises to the hight of 2 or 2-1/2 feet. it supports from 10 to forty flowers which are each supported by seperate footstalk of 1/2 an inch in length scattered without order on the upper portion of the peduncle. the calix is a partial involucre or involucret situated at the base of the footstalk of each flower on the peduncle; it is long thin and begins to decline as soon as the corolla expands. the corolla consists of six long oval, obtusly pointed skye blue or water coloured petals, each about 1 inch in length; the corolla is regular as to the form and size of the petals but irregular as to their position, five of them are placed near ech other pointing upward while one stands horizontally or pointing downwards, they are inserted with a short claw on the extremity of the footstalk at the base of the germ; the corolla is of course inferior; it is also shriveling, and continues untill the seeds are perfect. The stamens are perfect, six in number; the filaments each elivate an anther, near their base are flat on the inside and rounded on the outer terminate in a subulate point, are bowed or bent upwards, inserted on the inner side and on the base of the claws of the petals, below the germ, are equal both with rispect to themselves and the corolla, smooth &amp; membraneous. the Anther is oblong, obtusely pointed, 2 horned or forked at one end and furrowed longitudinally with four channels, the upper and lower of which seem almost to divide it into two loabs, incumbent patent, membranous, very short, naked, two valved and fertile with pollen, which last is of a yellow colour. the anther in a few hours after the corolla unfoalds, bursts, discharges it's pollen and becomes very minute and shrivled; the above discription of the anther is therefore to be understood of it at the moment of it's first appearance, the pistillum is only one, of which, the germ is triangular reather swolen on the sides, smooth superior, sessile, pedicelled, short in proportion to the corolla tho' wide or bulky; the style is very long or longer than the stamens, simple, cilindrical, bowed or bent upwards, placed on the top of the germ, membranous shrivels and falls off when the pericarp has obtained its full size. the stigma is three cleft very minute, &amp; pubescent. the pericarp is a capsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three longitudinal valves. the seed so far as I could-judge are numerous not very minute and globelar. soon after the seeds are mature the peduncle and foliage of this plant perishes, the grownd becomes dry or nearly so and the root encreases in size and shortly becomes fit for use; this happens about the middle of July when the natives begin to collect it for use which they continue untill the leaves of the plant attain some size in the spring of the year. when they have collected a considerable quantity of these roots or 20 [or] 30 bushels which they readily do by means of [a] stick sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the earth forming a circular concavity of 2-1/2 feet in the center and 10 feet in diameter; they next collect a parsel of split dry wood with which they cover this bason in the groun[d] perhaps a foot thick, they next collect a large parsel of stones of about 4 or 6 lbs. weight which are placed on the dry wood; fire is then set to the wood which birning heats the stones; when the fire has subsided and the stones are sufficiently heated which are nearly a red heat, they are adjusted in such manner in the whole as to form as level a surface as pi[o]ssible, a small quantity of earth is sprinkled over the stones and a layer of grass about an inch thick is put over the stones; the roots, which have been previously devested of the black or outer coat and radicles which rub off easily with the fingers, are now laid on in a conical pile, are then covered with a layer of grass about 2 or 3 inches thick; water is now thrown on the summit of the pile and passes through the roots and to the hot stones at bottom; some water is allso poared arround the edges of the hole and also finds its way to the hot stones; as soon as they discover from the quantity of steem which issues that the water has found its way generally to the hot stones, they cover the roots and grass over with earth to the debth of four inches and then build a fire of dry wood all over the connical mound which they continue to renew through the course of the night or for ten or 12 hours after which it is suffered to cool two or three hours when the earth and grass are removed and the roots thus sweated and cooked with steam are taken out, and most commonly exposed to the sun on scaffoalds untill they become dry, when they are black and of a sweet agreeable flavor. these roots are fit for use when first taken from the pitt, are soft of a sweetish tast and much the consistency of a roasted onion; but if they are suffered to remain in bulk 24 hour after being cooked they spoil. if the design is to make bread or cakes of these roots they undergo a second process of baking being previously pounded after the fi[r]st baking between two stones untill they are reduced to the consistency of dough and then rolled in grass in cakes of eight or ten lbs. are returned to the sweat intermixed with fresh roots in order that the steam may get freely to these loaves of bread. when taken out the second time the women make up this dough into cakes of various shapes and sizes usually from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick and expose it on sticks to dry in the sun, or place it over the smoke of their fires. the bread this [thus] prepared if kept free from moisture will keep sound for a great length of time. this bread or the dried roots are frequently eaten alone by the natives without further preparation, and when they have them in abundance they form an ingredient in almost every dish they prepare. this root is pallateable but disagrees with me in every shape I have ever used it. [Clark:] Wednesday June 11th. 1806 All of our hunters were out by daylight this Morning. Labeech and Shann[on] was the only suckcess[f]ull hunters, Labeech killed a Black bear and a large buck, and Gibson killed a very fat Buck. five of the Indians also turned out and hunted untill near Meridn. without having killed any thing. at 3 P.M. they all packed up and returned to their Village. one of our men exchanged an indifferent horse for a verey good one with those people before they left us. in the evening all our hunters turned out in different directions with a view to find some probable Spot of killing deer and were directed to lay out all night and hunt in the morning early. Whitehouse returned this morning to our camp on the Kooskooske in Serch of his horse. As I have had frequent occasion to mention the plant which the Chopunnish and other nations of the Columbia call Quawmash I shall here give a more particular discription of that plant and the mode of prepareing it for food as practiced by the Chopinnish and others in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains with whome it forms much the greatest portion of their Subsistence. we have never met with this plant but in or adjacent to a piney or fir timbered country, and there always in the open grounds and glades; in the Columbian Vally and near the coast it is to be found in small quantities and inferior in size to that found in this neighbourhood or on those high rich flatts and vallies within the rocky Mountains. it delights in a black rich moist soil, and even grows most luxuriently where the lands remain from 6 to 9 inches under water untill the seed are nearly perfect, which in this neighbourhood or on those flatts is about the last of this month. near the river where I had an oppertanity of observing it, the Seed were beginning to ripen on the 9th. inst. and the soil was nearly dry. it seems devoted to it's particular soil and situation, and you will Seldom find [it] more than a fiew feet from an inundated soil tho' within it's limits it grows very closely. in short almost as much so as the bulbs will permit. the radix is a tumicated bulb, much the consistence shape and appearance of the Onion, glutinous or somewhat slymey when chewed and almost tasteless and without smell in it's unprepared state; it is white except the thin or outer tumicated scales which are fiew black and not suculent; this bulb is from the Size of a nutmeg to that of a hen egg and most commonly of an intermediate size or about as large as a common onion of one years growth from the seed. the radicles are noumerous, reather large, white, flexeable, succulent and deviding the foliage consists of from one to four seldom five radicals, line[a]r sessile and revolute pointed leaves; they are from 12 to 18 inches in length and from 1. to 3/4 of an inch in widest part which is nearest the middle; the upper disk is somewhat gro[o]ved of a pale green and marked it's whole length with a number of small longitudinal channels; the under disk is of a deep glossy green and smooth. the leaves sheath the peduncle and each other as high as the surface of the earth or about 2 inches; they are more succulent than the grasses and less so than most of the lillies hyisinths &amp;c. the peduncle is soletary, proceeds from the root, is columner, smooth and leafless and rises to the hight of 2 or 2 1/2 feet. it supports from 10 to 40 flowers which are each surported by a Seperate footstalk of 1/2 an inch in length scattered without order on the upper portion of the peduncle. the calix is a partial involucre or involucret situated at the base of the footstalk of each flower on the peduncle; it is long thin and begins to decline as soon as the corrolla expands. the corolla consists of five long oval obtusely pointed Skye blue or water coloured petals, each about 1 inch in length; the corolla is regular as to the form and size of the petals but irregular as to their position, five of them are placed near each other pointing upwards while one stands horozontially, or pointing downwards, they are inserted with a short claw on the extremity of the footstalk at the base of the germ; the corolla is of course inferior; it is also shriveling, and continues untill the seed are perfect. The Stamens are perfect, six in number; the falaments each elivate an anther, near their base are flat on the in side and rounded on the outer, termonate in a subulate point, and bowed or bent upwards inserted on the inner side and on the base of the claws of the petals, below the germ, are equal both with respect to themselves and the corolla, smooth membranous. the Anther is oblong obtusely pointed, 2 horned or forked at one end and furrowed longitudinally with four channels, the upper and lower of which seem almost to divide it into two loabs, incumbent, patent, membranous, very short, necked, two valved and fertile with pollen, which last is of a yellow colour. the Anther in a fiew hours after the corolla unfoalds, bursts discharges it's pollen and becomes very manute and chrivled; the above discription of the Anther is therefore to be understood of it, at the moment of it's first appearance. the pistillum is only one, of which the Germ is triangular reather swolen on the sides, smooth, superior, sessile, pedicelled, short in proportion to the corolla tho' wide or bulky; the style is very long or longer than the stamens, simple, cilindrical, bowed or bent upwards, placed on the top of the germ, membranous shrivels and falls off when the pericarp has obtained it's full size. the Stigma is three clefts very manute and pubescent. the pericarp is a capsule, triangular, oblong, obtuse, and trilocular with three longitudinal valves. the seed so far as I could judge are noumerous not very manute and globilar. Soon after the seed are mature the peduncle and foliage of this plant perishes, the ground becoms dry or nearly so and the root increases in size and shortly becoms fit for use; this happens about the middle of July when the nativs begin to collect it for use which they continue untill the leaves of the plant obtain some size in the Spring of the year. when they have collected a considerable quantity of these roots or 20 or 30 bushels which they readily do by means of Sticks Sharpened at one end, they dig away the surface of the earth forming a cercular concavity of 2 1/2 feet in the center and 10 feet in diameter; they next collect a parcel of dry split wood with which they cover this bason from the bottom perhaps a foot thick, they next collect a parcel of Stones from 4 to 6lb. weight which are placed on the dry wood; fire is then set to the wood which burning heats the Stones; when the fire has subsided and the Stones are sufficiently heated which are nearly a red heat, they are adjusted in such manner in the hole as to form as leavel a surface as possible, a small quantity of earth is sprinkled over the Stones, and a layer of grass about an inch thick is laid over the stone; the roots which have been previously devested of the black or outer coat and radicles which rub off easily with the fingers, are now laid on in a circular pile, are then covered with a layer of grass about 2 or 3 inches thick; water is then thrown on the Summit of the pile and passes through the roots and to the hot Stones at bottom; Some water is also pored around the edges of the hole, and also find[s] it's way to the hot Stones. they cover the roots and grass over with earth to the debth of four inches and then build a fire of dry wood all over the connical mound which they continue to renew through the course of the night or for 10 or 12 hours, after which it is suffered to cool, 2 or three hours, when the earth and grass are removed. and the roots thus Sweated are cooled with steam or taken out, and most commonly exposed to the Sun on Scaffolds untill they become dry. when they are black and of a sweet agreeable flavor. these roots are fit for use when first taken from the pitt, are Soft of a Sweetish taste and much the consistancy of a roasted onion; but if they are Suffered to remain in bulk 24 hours after being cooked they Spoil, if the design is to make bread or cakes of those roots they undergo a second preperation of baking being previously pounded after the first baking between two stones untill they are reduced to the consistancy of dough and then rolled in grass in cakes of 8 or 10 pounds, are returned to the Sweat intermixed with fresh roots in order that the steam may get freely to those loaves of bread. when taken out the Second time the Indn. woman make up this dough into cakes of various shapes and sizes, usually from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick and expose it on sticks to dry in the Sun, or place it over the smoke of their fires. The bread thus prepared if kept free from moisture will [keep] Sound for a great length of time. this bread or the dryed roots are frequently eaten alone by the nativs without further preperation, and when they have them in abundance they form an ingrediant in almost every dish they prepare. this root is palateable but disagrees with us in every shape we have ever used it. the nativs are extreemly fond of this root and present it [to] their visiters as a great treat. when we first arrived at the Chopunnish last fall at this place our men who were half Starved made so free a use of this root the it made them all sick for several days after. [Lewis:] Thursday June 12th. 1806 All our hunters except Gibson returned about noon; none of them had killed anything except Sheilds who brought with him two deer. in the evening they resumed their hunt and remained out all night. an indian visited us this evening and spent the night at our camp. Whitehouse returned with his horse at 1 P. M. the days are now very warm and the Musquetors our old companions have become very troublesome. The Cutnose informed us on the 10th. before we left him that two young men would overtake us with a view to accompany me to the falls of the Missouri. nothing interesting occurred in the course of this day. our camp is agreeably situated in a point of timbered land on the eastern border of an extensive level and beautifull prarie1 1 This plain contains about two thousand acres, and is surrounded with beautiful pine timber of different kinds. The soil is very good. . . . There are a good many deer here, and some bears, but they are very wild, as they are much pursued by the natives.—Gass (pp. 323, 324). which is intersected by several small branches near the bank of one of which our camp is placed. the quawmash is now in blume and from the colour of its bloom at a short distance it resembles lakes of fine clear water, so complete is this deseption that on first sight I could have swoarn it was water. [Clark:] Thursday June 12th. 1806. All our hunters except Gibson returned about noon; none of them had killed any thing except Shields who brought with him two deer. in the evening they resumed their hunt and remained out all night. an Indian visited us this evening and Spent the night at our camp. Whitehouse returned with his horse at 1 P. M. the days are very worm and the Musquetors our old companions have become very troublesome. The Cutnose informed us on the 10th. before we left him that two young Chiefs would overtake us with a view to accompany us to the Falls of the Missouri and probably to the Seat of our Governmt. nothing interesting occured in the course of this day. our camp is agreeably situated in a point of timbered land on the eastern borders of an extensive leavel and butifull prarie which is intersected by several small branches near the bank of one of which our camp is placed. the quawmash is now in blume at a Short distance it resembles a lake of fine clear water, so complete is this deseption that on first Sight I could have sworn it was water. [Lewis:] Friday June 13th. 1806. Reubin Feilds and Willard were ordered to proceed on our road to a small prarie 8 miles distant on this side of Collins's Creek and there hunt until our arrival;1 1 This was probably on Musselshell Creek where there is a small clearing answering this description. See June 15, post.—Ed. they departed at 10 A. M. about noon seven of our hunters returned witil 8 deer; they had wounded several others and a bear but did not get them. in the evening Labuish and Cruzatte returned and reported that the buzzards had eaten up a deer which they had killed butchered and hung up this morning. The indian who visited us yesterday exchanged his horse for one of ours which had not perfectly recovered from the operation of castration and received a small ax and a knife to boot, he seemed much pleased with his exchange and set out immediately to his village, as if fearfull that we would cancel the bargain which is customary among themselves and deemed only fair. we directed the meat to be cut thin and exposed to dry in the sun. we made a digest of the Indian Nations West of the Rocky Mountains which we have seen and of whom we have been repeated[ly] informed by those with whom we were conversent. they amount by our estimate to 69.000 (about 80,000) Souls.2 2 See "Estimate of Western Indians," in our vol. vi.—Ed. [Clark:] Friday June 13th. 1806. Ordered Rubin Fields and Willard to proceed on to a small prarie in the Mountains about 8 miles and there hunt untill we arrive the[y] set out at 10 A. M. Soon after they set out all of our hunters returned each with a deer except Shields who brought two in all 8 deer. Labeech and P. Crusatt went out this morning killed a deer &amp; reported that the buzzds. had eate up the deer in their absence after haveing butchered and hung it up. The indian who visited us yesterday exchanged his horse with one of our party for a very indiferant one in which exchange he r[e]cived a small ax a Knife &amp;c. Soon after he had exchanged he returned to his village well satisfied, we caused the meat to be cut thin and dried in the sun. I make a list of the Indian Nations their place of residence, and probable number of Soles of each nation from estimation and indian information &amp;c. [Lewis:] Saturday June 14th. 1806. Sent our hunters out early this morning. Colter killed a deer and brought it in by 10 A. M. the other hunters except Drewyer returned early without having killed anything. Drewyer returned. we had all our articles packed up and made ready for an early departure in the morning. our horses were caught and most of them hubbled and otherwise confined in order that we might not be detained. from hence to traveller's rest we shall make a forsed march; at that place we shal probably remain one or two days to rest ourselves and horses and procure some meat. we have now been detained near five weeks in consequence of the snows; a serious loss of time at this delightfull season for traveling. I am still apprehensive that the snow and the want of food for our horses will prove a serious imbarrassment to us as at least four days journey of our rout in these mountains lies over hights and along a ledge of mountains never intirely destitute of snow. every body seems anxious to be in motion, convinced that we have not now any time to delay if the calculation is to reach the United States this season; this I am detirmined to accomplish if within the compass of human power. [Clark:] Saturday June 14th. 1806 Sent out Hunters this morning Colter killed a deer and brought it in by 10 A. M. Drewyer did not return untill night he wounded deer but could get none &amp;c. neither of the other hunters killed nothing. we had our articles packed up ready for a start in the morning. our horses collected and hobble[d] that they may not detain us in the morning, we expect to set out early, and shall proceed with as much expedition as possible over those snowey tremendious mountains which has detained us near five weeks in this neighbourhood waiting for the Snows to melt sufficient for us to pass over them. and even now I shudder with the expectation with [of] great dificuelties in passing those Mountains, from the debth of snow and the want of grass sufficient to subsist our horses, as about 4 days we Shall be on the top of the Mountain which we have every reason to beleive is covered with snow the greater part of the year. [Lewis:] Sunday June 15th. 1806. We had some little difficulty in collecting our horses this morning they had straggled off to a greater distance than usual. it rained very hard in the morning and after collecting our horses we waited an hour for it to abait, but as it had every appearance of a settled rain we set out at 10 A. M. we passed a little prarie at the distance of 8-? m1. to which we had previously sent R. Feilds and Willard. we found two deer which they had killed and hung up. at the distance of 2-? Miles further we arrived at Collins's Creek where we found our hunters; they had killed another deer, and had seen two large bear together the one black and the other white. we halted at the creek, dined and graized our horses. the rains have rendered the road very slippery insomuch that it is with much difficulty our horses can get on several of them fell but sustained no injury. after dinner we proceeded up the creek about ? a mile, passing it three times, thence through a high broken country to an Easterly fork of the same creek about 10-? miles and incamped near a small prarie in the bottom land.1 1 When the explorers left the Weippe (Quawmash) Prairie, they virtually retraced their outgoing trail to the Musselshell Prairie (the "little prarie" of this day's route) and the mouth of Musselshell Creek. Then, instead of going northeast and up the Lolo Fork, they clambered over the mountains on the south side of the eastern fork of Collins Creek, until they reached the old trail west of the spot where Lewis camped on the night of Sept. 20, 1805.—O. D. Wheeler. the fallen timber in addition to the slippry roads made our march slow and extreemly laborious on our horses. the country is exceedingly thickly timbered with longleafed pine, some pitch pine, larch, white pine, white cedar or arbor vita of large size, and a variety of firs.2 2 The long-leaved pine is Pinus ponderosa; the larch, Larix occidentalis; the white pine, Pinus monticola; white cedar, Thuya plicata, Don (T. gigantea, Nutt.). —C. V. Piper. the undergrowth principally reedroot1 1 For redroot, see p. 121, note 2, ante.—Ed. from 6 to 10 feet high with all the other speceis enumerated the other day. the soil is good; in some plaices it is of a red cast like our lands in Virginia about the S. W. mountains. Saw the speckled woodpecker, bee martin and log cock or large woodpecker. found the nest of a humming bird, it had just began to lay its eggs. Came 22 Miles today. [Clark:] Sunday June 15th. 1806. Collected our horses early with the intention of makeing an early Start. Some hard Showers of rain detained us untill [blank space in MS.] AM at which time we took our final departu[r]e from the quawmash fields and proceeded with much dificuelty owing to the Situation of the road which was very sliprey, and it was with great dificulty that the loaded horses Could assend the hills and Mountains the[y] frequently sliped down both assending and decending those steep hills. at 9 miles we passed through a Small prarie in which was quawmash in this Prarie Reubin Fields &amp; Willard had killed and hung up two deer at 2 miles further we arrived at the Camp of R. Fields &amp; Willard on Collin's Creek, they arrived at this creek last evening and had killed another Deer near the Creek. here we let our horses graze in a small glade and took dinner. the rain seased and sun shown out. after detaining about 2 hours we proceeded on passing the Creek three times and passing over some ruged hills or Spurs of the rocky Mountain, passing the Creek on which I encamped on the 17th. Septt. last to a Small glade of about 10 acres thickly covered with grass and quawmash, near a large Creek and encamped. we passed through bad fallen timber and a high Mountain this evening. from the top of this Mountain I had an extensive view of the rocky Mountains to the South and the Columbian plains for [a] great extent also the SW. Mountains and a range of high Mountains which divides the waters of Lewis's &amp; Clarks rivers and seems to termonate nearly a West cours[e]. Several high pts. to the N &amp; N. E. covered with Snow. a remarkable high rugd mountain in the forks of Lewis's river nearly south and covered with snow. The vally up the Chopunnish river appears extensive tolerably leavel and covered with timber. The SW. Mountain is very high in a S S W derection. [Lewis:] Monday June 16th. 1806. We collected our horses very readily this morning, took breakfast and set out at 6 A. M.; proceeded up the creek about 2 miles through some handsom meadows of fine grass abounding with quawmash, here we passed the creek &amp; ascended a ridge which led us to the N. E. about seven miles when we arrived at a small branch of hungry creek. the difficulty we met with from the fallen timber detained us untill 11 OC before we reached this place. here is a handsome little glade in which we found some grass for our horses we therefore halted to let them graize and took dinner knowing that there was no other convenient situation for that purpose short of the glaids on hungry creek where we intended to encamp, as the last probable place, at which we shall find a sufficient quantity of grass for many days. this morning Windsor busted his rifle near the muzzle. before we reached this little branch on which we dined we saw in the hollows and N. hillsides large qua [n] titles of snow yet undesolved; in some places it was from two to three feet deep. vegetation is proportionably backward; the dogtooth violet is just in blume, the honeysuckle, huck[le]burry and a small speceis of white maple are begining to put fourth their leaves;1 1 The dogtooth violet is Erythronium grandiflorum; the honeysuckle, Lonicera ciliosa; the huckleberry, Vaccinium membranaceum; and the white maple, Acer douglasii, Hook.—C. V. Piper these appearances in this comparatively low region augers but unfavourably with rispect to the practibility of passing the mountains, however we determined to proceed, accordingly after taking a haisty meal we set out and continued our rout through a thick wood much obstructed with fallen timber, and intersepted by many steep ravines and high hills. the snow has increased in quantity so much that the greater part of our rout this evening was over the snow which has become sufficiently firm to bear our horshes, otherwise it would have been impossible for us to proceed as it lay in immence masses in some places 8 or ten feet deep, we found much difficulty in pursuing the road as it was so frequently covered with snow. we arrived early in the evening at the place1 1 Lewis's party reached this place on the outward journey, Sept. 20, 1805; the glade was on Hungry Creek. See vol. iii, p. 72, note 2, ante.—Ed. that Capt. C. had killed and left the flesh of a horse for us last September. here is a small glade in which there was some grass, not a sufficiency for our horses but we thought it most advisable to remain here all night as we apprehended if we proceeded further we should find less grass. the air is pleasent in the course of the day but becomes very cold before morning notwithstanding the shortness of the nights. Hungry creek is but small at this place but is deep and runs a perfect torrent; the water is perfectly transparent and as cold as ice. the pitch pine. white pine some larch and firs consti[tu]te the timber; the long leafed pine extends a little distance on this side of the main branch of Coilins's creek, and the white cedar not further than the branch of hungry creek on which we dined. I killed a small brown pheasant today, it feeds on the tender leaves and buds of the fir and pitch pine, in the fore part of the day I observed the Cullumbine the blue bells and the yelow flowering pea in blume. there is an abundance of a speceis of anjelico in these mountains, much st[r]onger to the taist and more highly scented than that speceis common to the U'States. I know of no particular virtue or property it possesses; the natives dry it cut it in small peices which they string on a small cord and place about their necks; it smells very pleasantly.2 2 The columbine is Aquilegia formosa, Fisch.; the bluebell, Campanula rotundi-folia, L.; the yellow flowering pea, Lathyrus ochroleucus probably; and angelica, Angelica lyallii, Wats.—C. V. Piper we came 15 miles today. [Clark:] Munday 16th. June 1806 Collected our horses early and Set out 7 AM proceeded on up the Creek through a gladey swompy bottom covered with grass and quawmash crossed the creek to the East and proceeded on through most intolerable bad fallen timber over a high Mountain on which great quantity of Snow is yet lying premisquissly through the thick wood, and in maney places the banks of snow is 4 feet deep. we no[o]ned it or dined on a small creek in a small open Vally where we found some grass for our horses to eate, altho' serounded by snow no other convenient situation short of the glades on Hungery Creek where we intended to encamp, as the last probable place, at which we Shall find a sufficient quantity of grass for many days. This morning Windsor bursted his rifle near the Muzzle. Vegitation is propotionable backward; the dogtooth Violet is just in blume, the honeysuckle, huckleberry and a small Species of white maple are beginning to put forth their leaves, where they are clear of the Snow, those appearances in this comparratively low region augers but unfavourably with respect to the practibility of passing the Mountains, however we deturmine to proceed, accordingly after takeing a hasty meal we set out and continued our rout through a thick wood much obstructed with fallen timber, and interupted by maney Steep reveins and hills which wer very high. the Snow has increased in quantity so much that the great part of our rout this evening was over the Snow which has become sufficiently firm to bear our horses, otherwise it would have been impossible for us to proceed as it lay in emince masses in some places 8 or ten feet deep. We found much dificulty in finding the road, as it was so frequently covered with snow. we arived early in the evening at the place I had killed and left the flesh of a horse for the party in my rear last Septt. here is a Small glade in which there is some grass, not a Sufficency of [for] our horses, but we thought it adviseable to remain here all night as we apprehended if we proceeded further we should find less grass. The air is pleasant in the course of the day, but becomes very cold before morning notwithstanding the shortness of the night. Hungary Creek is but small at this place but is deep and runs a perfect torrent; the water is perfectly transparent and as Cold as ice. the t[p]itch pine, white pine some Larch and firs consists the timber, the long leafed pine extends but a short distance on the Mts. Capt L. killed a small brown pheasant today, it feeds on the tender leaves and buds of the fir and pitch pine. in the forepart of the day I observed the Cullumbine the blue bells and the Yellow flowering pea in blume. there is an abundance of a Species of anjelico in the mountains much stronger to the taiste, and more highly scented than that Species common to the U'. States. I know of no particular virtue or property it possesses. the nativs dry it cut it in small pieces which they string on a small cord and place about the necks; it smells pleasently. we Come 15 Ms. to day. [Lewis:] Tuesday June 17th. 1806. we collected our horses and set out early; we proceeded down hungry creek about seven miles passing it twice; we found it difficult and dangerous to pass the creek in consequence of its debth and rapidity; we avoided two other passes of the creek by ascending a very steep rocky and difficult hill. beyond this creek1 1 G. B. Nicholson, chief engineer of the Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific Railway, Covington, Ky., who surveyed the Lolo Trail in 1866, sends us a map traced from his reconnaissance of the Lewis and Clark route along Hungry Creek. He places the point at which they abandoned this stream to ascend the mountain, twelve miles from the divide at Mount Romeo; he thinks, however, that Clark's "Courses and distances" (see our vol. vi) place Hungry Creek a little too far south of the dividing ridge.—Ed. the road ascends the mountain to the hight of the main leading ridges which divides the Waters of the Chopunnish and Kooskooske rivers.2 2 That is, the North Fork of the Clearwater, or Kooskooske, and the Middle or Lochsa Fork of the same.—Ed. this hill or reather mountain we ascended about 3 miles when we found ourselves invelloped in snow from 12 to 15 feet deep even on the south sides of the hills with the fairest exposure to the sun; here was winter with all it's rigors; the air was cold, my hands and feet were benumbed. we knew that it would require five days to reach the fish wears at the entrance of Colt Creek, provided we were so fortunate as to be enabled to follow the proper ridges of the mountains to lead us to that place; of this Drewyer our principal dependance as a woodman and guide was entirely doubtfull;1 1 This sentence is crossed out with ink (of another shade) in the MS.—Ed. short of that point we could not hope for any food for our horses not even underwood itself as the whole was covered many feet deep in snow. if we proceeded and should get bewildered in these mountains the certainty was that we should loose all our horses and consequently our baggage inst[r]uments perhaps our papers and thus eminently wrisk the loss of the discoveries which we had already made if we should be so fortunate as to escape with life. the snow boar our horses very well and the trav[e]lling was therefore infinitely better that [n] the obstruction of rocks and fallen timber which we met with in our passage over last fall when the snow lay on this part of the ridge in detached spots only. under these circumstances we conceived it madnes[s] in this stage of the expedition to proceed without a guide who could certainly conduct us to the fish wears on the Kooskooske (Travellers (Creek) Rest), as our horses could not possibly sustain a journey of more than five days without food. we therefore came to the resolution to return with our horses while they were yet strong and in good order and indevour to keep them so untill we could procure an indian to conduct us over the snowey mountains, and again to proceed as soon as we could procure such a guide, knowing from the appearance of the snows that if we remained untill it had desolved sufficiently for us to follow the road that we should not be enabled to return to the United States within this season. having come to this resolution, we ordered the party to make a deposit for all the baggage which we had not immediate use for, and also all the roots and bread of cows which they had except an allowance for a few days to enable them to return to some place at which we could subsist by hunting untill we procured a guide. we left our instruments papers &amp;c. beleiving them safer here than to wrisk them on horseback over the roads and creeks which we had passed. our baggage being laid on scaffoalds1 1 We therefore hung up our loading on poles, tied to and extended between trees, covered it all safe with deer-skins, and turned back melancholy and disappointed. —Gass (p. 327). and well covered we began our retrograde march at 1 P. M. having remained about 3 hours on this snowey mountain. we returned by the rout we had come to hungry creek, which we ascended about 2 miles and encamped. we had here more grass for our horses than the proceeding evening, yet it was but scant. the party were a good deel dejected tho' not as much so as I had apprehended they would have been. this is the first time since we have been on this long tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a retrograde march. it rained on us most of this evening. [Clark:] Tuesday June 17th. 1806 We collected our horses and set out early; we proceeded down hungary Creek about 7 miles passing it twice; we found it difficuelt and dangerous to pass the creek in consequence of it's debth and rapidity; we avoided two other passes of the creek, by assending a steep rockey and difficuelt hill. beyond this creek the road assends the mountain to the hight of the main leading ridges, which divides the waters of the Kooskooske and Chopunnish Riv's. This mountain we ascended about 3 miles when we found ourselves invelloped in snow from 8 to 12 feet deep even on the South Side of the mountain. I was in front and could only prosue the derection of the road by the trees which had been peeled by the nativs for the iner bark of which they scraped and eate, as those pealed trees were only to be found scattered promisquisley, I with great difficulty prosued the direction of the road one mile further to the top of the mountain where I found the snow from 12 to 15 feet deep, but new trees with the fairest exposure to the Sun; here was Winter with all it's rigors; the air was cold my hands and feet were benumed. we knew that it would require four days to reach the fish weare at the enterance of Colt Creek, provided we were so fortunate as to be enabled to follow the p[r]oper ridge of the mountains to lead us to that place; of this all of our most expert woodsmen and principal guides were extreemly doubtfull; Short of that point we could not hope for any food for our horses not even under wood itself as the whole was covered many feet deep in snow. if we proceeded and Should git bewildered in those Mountains the certainty was that we Should lose all of our horses and consequently our baggage enstrements perhaps our papers and thus eventially resque the loss of our discoveries which we had already made if we should be so fortunate as to escape with life. the snow bore our horses very well and the traveling was therefore infinately better than the obstruction of rocks and fallen timber which we met with in our passage over last fall when the snow lay on this part of the ridge in detached spop[t]s only. under these circumstances we conceived it madness in this stage of the expedition to proceed without a guide who could certainly conduct us to the fishwears on the Kooskooske, as our horses could not possibly sustain a journey of more than 4 or 5 days without food. we therefore come to the resolution to return with our horses while they were yet strong and in good order, and indeaver to keep them so untill we could precure an indian to conduct us over the Snowey Mountains, and again to proceed as soon as we could precure such a guide, knowing from the appearance of the snows that if we remained untill it had disolved sufficiently for us to follow the road that we should not be enabled to return to the United States within this season. having come to this resolution, we ordered the party to make a deposit of all the baggage which we had not imediate use for, and also all the roots and bread of Cows which they had except an allowance for a fiew days to enable them to return to some place at which we could subsist by hunting untill we precured a guide. we left our instrements, and I even left the most of my papers believing them safer here than to Wrisk them on horse back over the road, rocks and water which we had passed. our baggage being laid on Scaffolds and well covered, we began our retragrade march at 1 P. M. haveing remaind. about three hours on this Snowey mountain. we returned by the rout we had advanced to hungary Creek, which we assended about 2 miles and encamped. we had here more grass for our horses than the proceeding evening, yet it was but scant. the party were a good deel dejected, tho' not as much so as I had apprehended they would have been. this is the first time since we have been on this tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a retragrade march. it rained on us the most of this evening. on the top of the Mountain the Weather was very fluctiating and uncertain snowed cloudy &amp; fair in a few minets. [Lewis:] Wednesday June 18th. 1806. this morning we had considerable difficulty in collecting our horses they having straggled off to a considerable distance in surch of food on the sides of the mountains among the thick timber, at 9 OCk. we collected them all except one of Drewyers and one of Sheildes; we set out leaving Sheilds and LaPage to collect the two lost horses and follow us. We dispatched Drewyer and Shannon to the Chopunnish Indians in the plains beyond the Kooskooske in order to hasten the arrival of the indians who had promised to accompany us or to procure a gu[i]de at all events and rejoin us as soon as possible. we sent by them a rifle which we offered as a reward to any of them who would engage to conduct us to traveller's rest: we also dirrected them if they found difficulty in inducing any of them to accompany us to offer the reward of two other guns to be given them immediately and ten horses at the falls of Missouri. we had not proceeded far this morning before Potts cut his leg very badly with one of the large knives; he cut one of the large veigns on the inner side of the leg; I found much difficulty in stoping the blood which I could not effect untill I applyed a tight bandage with a little cushon of wood and tow on the veign below the wound. Colter's horse fel with him in passing hungry creek and himself and horse were driven down the creek a considerable distance rolling over each other among the rocks, fortunately [he] escaped without injury or the loss of his gun. by 1 P. M. we returned to the glade on the branch of hungry Creek where we had dined on the 16th. inst. here we again halted and dined. as there was much appearance of deer about this place we left R. and J. Feilds with directions to hunt this evening and tomorrow morning at this place and to join us in the evening at the meadows of Collin's creek where we intend remaining tomorrow in order to rest our horses and hunt. after dinner we proceeded on to Collin's Creek and encamped in a pleasant situation at the upper part of the meadows about 2 Ms. above our encampment of the 15th. inst. we sent out several hunters but they returned without having killed anything. they saw a number of salmon (trout) in the creek and shot at them several times without success. we directed Colter and Gibson to fix each of them a gigg in the morning and indevour to take some of the salmon. the hunters saw much fresh appearance of bear but very little of deer, we hope by means of the fish together with what deer and bear we can kill to be enabled to subsist untill our guide arrives without the necessity of returning to the quawmash flats. there is a great abundance of good food here to sustain our horses. [Clark:] Wednesday June 18th. 1806 This morning we had considerble dificuelty in collecting our horses they haveing Strageled of[f] to a considerable distance in serch of food on the Sides of the mountains among the thick timber, at 9 oClock we collected them all except 2 one of Shields &amp; one of Drewyers. we Set out leaving Shields and LePage to collect the two lost horses and follow us. We dispatched Drewyer and Shannon to the Chopunnish Indians in the plains beyond the Kooskooske in order to hasten the arrival of the Indians who promised to accompany us, or to precure a guide at all events and rejoin us as soon as possible. We sent by them a riffle which we offered as a reward to any of them who would engage to conduct us to Clarks river at the entrance of Travellers rest Creek; we also directed them if they found difficuelty in induceing any of them to accompany us to offer the reward of two other guns to be given them immediately and ten horses at the falls of Missouri. we had not proceeded far this morning before J. Potts cut his leg very badly with one of the large knives; he cut one of the large veins on the iner side of the leg; Colters horse fell with him in passing hungary creek and himself and horse were driven down the Creek a considerable distance roleing over each other among the rocks. he fortunately escaped with[out] much injurey or the loss of his gun. he lost his blanket. at 1 P. M we returned to the glade on a branch of hungary creek where we had dined on the 16th. instant. here we again halted and dined. as there was some appearance of deer about this place we left J. &amp; R. Field with directions to hunt this evening and tomorrow morning at this place and join us in the evening in the Meadows on Collin's Creek where we intended to remain tomorrow in order to rest our horses and hunt. after dinner we proceeded on to the near fork of Collins Creek and encamped in a pleasant situation at the upper part of the Meadows about 2 miles above our encampment of the 15th. inst. we sent out several hunters but they returned without having killed any thing. they saw a number of large fish in the creek and shot at them several times without suckcess. we [ordered] Gibson and Colter to fix each of themselves a gigg in the morning and indeaver to take some of those fish. the hunters saw much fresh appearance of Bear, but very little deer sign. we hope by the means of the fish together with what deer and bear we can kill to be enabled to subsist untill our guide arives without the necessaty of returning to the quawmash flats. there is great abundance of good food here to sustain our horses. we are in flattering expectations of the arrival of two young chiefs who informed us that they intended to accompany us to the U. States, and Should Set out from their village in 9 nights after we left them [or] on the 19th. inst. if they set out at that time Drewyer &amp; Shannon will meet them, and probably join us on the 20th. or 21st. Musquetors Troublesome. [Lewis:] Thursday June 19th. 1806. Our hunters were out very early this morning, they returned before noon with one deer only. the Fishermen had been more unsuccessfull, they returned without a single fish and reported that they could find but few and those they had tryed to take in vain. they had broke both their giggs which were of indian fabrication made of bone. I happened to have a pointed peice of iron in my pouch which answered by cuting in two peices to renew boath giggs. they took one fish this evening which proved to be a salmon trout much to our mortification, for we had hoped that they were the salmon of this spring['s] arrival and of course fat and fine. these trout are of the red kind they remain all winter in the upper parts of the rivers and creeks and are generally poor at this season. At 2 P. M. J &amp; R Feilds arived with two deer; John Sheilds and LaPage came with them, they had not succeeded in finding their horses. late in the evening Frazier reported that my riding horse that of Capt. Clark and his mule had gone on towards the Quawmash flatts and that he had pursued their tracks on the road about 2-? miles, we determined to send out all the hunters in the morning in order to make a fair experiment of the p[r]act[ica]bility of our being able to subsist at this place and if not we shall move the day after to the Quawmash flatts. the musquetoes have been excessively troublesome to us since our arrival at this place particularly in the evening. Cruzatte brought me several large morells which I roasted and eat without salt pepper or grease in this way I had for the first time the true taist of the morell which is truly an insippid taistless food.1 1 A kind of mushroom; "morel" is the name of a European fungus Morchella esculenta) found as well in the United States.—Ed. our stock of salt is now exhausted except two quarts which I have reserved for my tour up Maria's River and that I left the other day on the mountain. [Clark:] Thursday June 19th 1806 This morning early Collins Labeesh &amp; Crusat turned out to hunt, and Gibson &amp; Colter fixed two Indian giggs and went in serch of fish in the Creek. I took my gun and walked up the Creek about 4 Miles Saw some bear sign and one fish only. Gibson killed only one fish which we found to be the Salmon Trout of the dark species. this fish was of the common size pore and indifferently flavoured. Labeesh killed one Deer neither of the others killed any thing. about 1 P. M. Jo. &amp; R Fields &amp; LaPage came up. Reubin &amp; Joseph Fields broughth two Deer which R. had killed in the small glade on a branch of Hungary Creek where we had left them yesterday. Shields &amp; LaPage did not find the two horses which we lost yesterday morning. they report that they hunted with great diligence in the vicinity of our camp of the 17th. without suckcess. in my walk of this day up the creek I observed a great abundance of fine grass sufficient to sustain our horses any length of time we chose to stay at this place. Several glades of quawmash. the S W. Sides of the hills is fallen timber and burnt woods, the N. E. Sides of the hills is thickly timbered with lofty pine, and thick under growth. This evening several salmon trout were seen in the Creek, they hid themselves under the banks of the creek which jutted over in such a manner as to secure them from the stroke of our giggs nets and spears which were made for the purpose of taking those salmon trout. we concluded to delay at this place another day with a view to give time to the two young Chiefs to arrive in case they set out on the 19th. inst. as they informed us they should they will have sufficient time to join us tomorrow or early the next day. should we get a guide from this place it will save us two days march through some of the worst road through those Mountains, crouded with fallin timber mudholes and steep hills &amp;c. we directed all the hunters to turn out early and kill something for us to live on &amp;c. Musquetors troublesom. [Lewis:] Friday June 20th. 1806. Our hunters set out early this morning; most of them returned before noon. R. Feilds killed a brown bear the tallons of which were remarkably short broad at their base and sharply pointed this was of the speceis which the Chopunnish call Yah-kar. it was in very low order and the flesh of the bear in this situation is much inferior to lean venison or the flesh of poor Elk. Labush and Cruzatte returned late in the evening with one deer which the former had killed. we also caught seven salmon trout in the course of the day. the hunters assured us that their greatest exertions would not enable them to support us here more than one or two days longer from the great scarcity of game and the difficult access of the country, the under brush being very thick and great quantities of fallen timber. as we shall necessarily be compelled to remain more than two days for the return of Drewyer and Shannon we determined to return in the morning as far as the quawmash flatts and indeavour to lay in another stock of meat for the mountains, our former stock being now nearly exhausted as well as what we have killed on our return. by returning to the quawmash flats we shall sooner be informed whether or not we can procure a guide to conduct us through the mountains; should we fail in procuring one, we have determined to wrisk a passage on the following plan immediately, because should we wait much longer or untill the snow desolves in such manner as to enable us to follow the road we cannot hope to reach the United States this winter; this is that Capt C. or myself shall take four of our most expert woodsmen with three or four of our best horses and proceed two days in advance taking a plentifull supply of provision. for this party to follow the road by the marks which the baggage of the indians has made in many places on the sides of the trees by rubing against them, and to blaize the trees with a tomahawk as they proceeded. that after proceeding two days in advance of hungary creek two of those men would be sent back to the main party who by the time of their return to Hungary Creek would have reached that place. the men so returning would be enabled to inform the main party of the probable success of the proceeding party in finding the road and of their probable progress, in order that should it be necessary, the main party by the delay of a day or two at hungary creek, should give the advance time to mark the road through before the main party could overtake them, and thus prevent delay on the part of the rout where no food is to be obtained for our horses. should it so happen that the advance could not find the road by the marks on the trees after attempting it for two days, the whole of [them] then would return to the main party. in which case we wo[u]ld bring back our baggage and attempt a passage over these mountains through the country of the Shoshones further to the South by way of the main S. Westerly fork of Lewis's river and Madison or Gallatin's rivers, where from the information of the Chopunnish there is a passage which at this season of the year is not obstructed by snow, though the round is very distant and would require at least a month in it's performance. The Shoshones informed us when we first met with them that there was a passage across the mountains in that quarter but represented the difficulties arrising from steep high and rugged mountains and also an extensive and barren plain which was to be passed without game, as infinitely more difficult than the rout by which we came. from the circumstance of the Chopunnish being at war with that part of the Shoshones who inhabit the country on this side of the Mountains through which the road passes I think it is highly probable that they cannot be well informed with rispect to the road, and further, had there been a better road in that quarter the Shoshones on the East fork of Lewis's river who knew them both would not have recommended that by which we came to this country. the travelling in the mountains on the snow at present is very good, the snow bears the horses perfictly; it is a firm coa[r]se snow without a crust, and the horses' have good foothold without sliping much; the only dificulty is finding the road, and I think the plan we have devised will succeed even should we not be enabled to obtain a guide. Although the snow may be stated on an average at 10 feet deep yet arround the bodies of the trees it has desolved much more than in other parts not being generally more than one or two feet deep immediately at the roots of the trees, and of course the marks left by the rubing of the indian baggage against them is not concealed. the reason why the snow is comparitively so shallow about the roots of the trees I presume proceeds as well from the snow in falling being thrown off from their bodies by their thick and spreading branches as from the reflection of the sun against the trees and the warmth which they in some measure acquire from the earth which is never frozen underneath these masses of snow. Bratton's horse was also discovered to be absent this evening. I presume he has also returned to the flatts. [Clark:] Friday June 20th. 1806 The hunters turned out early in different directions, our guiggers also turned out with 2 guigs a Bayonet fixed on a pole, a Scooping nett and a Snar made of horse [hair]. near the ford of the Creek in a deep hole we killed six Salmon trout &amp; 2 others were killed in the Creek above in the evening. Reubin Field killed a redish brown bear which was very meagure. the tallons of this bear was remarkably short broad at their base and Sharply pointed, this was the Species the Chopunnish call Yah-kar. as it was in very low order the flesh was indifferent. Labiesh &amp; Crusat returned late in the evening with one deer which the former had killed. the hunters assured us that their greatest exertions would not enable them to support us here more than one or two days longer, from the great scercity of game and the dificuelt access of the Country, the under brush being very thick and great quantities of fallen timber. as we shall necessarily be compelled to remain more than two days for the return of Drewyer &amp; Shannon we determine to return in the morning as far as the quawmash flatts, and endeaver to lay in another stock of meat for the Mountains, our former stock now being nearly exhosted as well as what we have killed on our rout. by returning to the quawmash flatts we shall sooner be informed wheather or not we can procure a guide to conduct us through the Mountains; Should we fail in precureing one, we are deturmined to wrisk a passage on the following plan immediately, because should we wait much longer, or untill the Snow disolves in such manner as to enable us to follow the road we cannot expect to reach the U, States this Winter; this is that Capt. L. or myself shall take four of our most expert woodsmen with 3 or four of our best horses and proceed two days in advance takeing a plentifull supply of provisions. for this party to follow the road by the mark the indi[a]ns have made in many places with their baggage on the Sides of the trees by rubbing against them, and to blaize the trees with a tomahawk as they proceed. that after proceeding two days in advance of Hungary Creek, two of those men would be sent back to the party who by the time of their return to hungary Creek would have reached that place. the men So returning would be enabled to inform the main party of the probable suckcess of the proceeding party in finding the road and of their probable progress, in order that should it be necessary, the main party by a delay of a day or two a[t] hungary Creek should give the advance time to make the road through before the main party could overtake them, and thus prevent delay on that part of the rout where no food is to be obtained for our horses. Should it so happen that the advance should not find the road by the marks of the trees after attempting it for two days, the whole of them would return to the main party. in which Case we would bring back our baggage and attempt a passage over the Mountains through the Country of the Shoshones further to the South, by way of the main S Westerly fork of Lewis's river and Madisons or Gallitins river's, where from the information of the Chopunnish, there is a passage where [which] at this season of the year is not obstructed by snow, though the round is very distant and would require at least a month in it's preformance. The Shoshones informed us when we first met with them that there was a passage across the Mountains in that quarter but represented the difficuelties arriseing from Steep ruggid high Mountains, and also an extensive and barren plain which was to be passed without game, as infinitely more difficuelt than the rout by which we came. from the circumstance of the Chopunnish being at War with that part of the Shoshones who inhabit the country on this side of the Mountains through which the road passes, I think it is highly probable they cannot be well informed with respect to the road, and further, had there been a better road in that quarter the Shoshones on the East fork of Lewis's river who knew them boath would not have recommend'd that by which we came to this country. The travelling in the Mountains on the Snow at present is very good, the Snow bears the horses perfectly; it is a firm coa[r]se Snow without a crust, and the horses have good foot hold without slipping much; the only dificuelty is finding the road, and I think the plan we have devised will suckceed even should we not be enabled to obtain a guide, altho the Snow may be stated on an average at 10 feet deep, yet arround the body of the trees it has disolved much more than in other parts, not being generally more than one or two feet deep imediately at the roots of the trees, and of course the marks made by the rubbing of the Indian baggage against them is not concealed. The reason why the Snow is comparitively so shallow about the roots of the trees, I prosume proceeds as well from the Snow in falling being thrown off from their bodies by the thick and spreading branches, as from the reflection of the sun against the trees and the warmth which they in some measure acquire from the earth which is never frozen underneath those masses of snow. 4 of our horses are absent. [Lewis:] Saturday June 21st. 1806 We collected our horses early set out on our return to the flatts. we all felt some mortification in being thus compelled to retrace our steps through this tedious and difficult part of our rout, obstructed with brush and innumerable logs of fallen timber which renders the traveling distressing and even dangerous to our horses. one of Thompson's horses is either choked this morning or has the distemper very badly I fear he is to be of no further service to us. an excellent horse of Cruzatte's snagged himself so badly in the groin in jumping over a parsel of fallen timber that he will evidently be of no further service to us. at the pass of Collin's Creek we met two Indians who were on their way over the mountain; they had brought with them the three horses and the mule that had left us and returned to the quawmash grounds. these indians returned with us about 1/2 a mile down the creek where we halted to dine and graize our horses at the same place I had halted and remained all night with the party on the [blank space in MS.] of Septembr. last. as well as we could understand the indians they informed us that they had seen Drewyer and Shannon and that they would not return untill the expiration of two days; the cause why Drewyer and Shannon had not returned with these men we are at a loss to account for. we pressed these indians to remain with us and to conduct us over the mountain on the return of Drewyer and Shannon. they consented to remain two nights for us and accordingly deposited their store of roots and bread in the bushes at no great distance and after dinner returned with us, as far as the little prarie about 2 miles distant from the creek, here they halted with their horses and informed us they would remain untill we overtook them or at least two nights. they had four supenumery horses with them. we sent on four hunters a head to the quawmash flatts to take an evenings hunt; they so far succeeded as to kill one deer. we left Reubin and J. Feilds at the Creek where we dined together with Sergt. Gass in order to hunt about that place untill our return. at seven in the evening we found ourselves once more at our old encampment where we shall anxiously await the return of Drewyer and Shannon. [Clark:] Saturday June 21st. 1806 We collected our horses early and Set out on our return to the flatts. we all felt some mortification in being thus compelled to retrace our Steps through this tedious and difficuelt part of our rout, obstructed with brush and innumerable logs and fallen timber which renders the traveling distressing and even dangerous to our horses. one of Thompsons horses is either choked this morning or has the distemper badly. I fear he is to be of no further survice to us. an excellent horse of Cruzatt's snagged himself so badly in the groin in jumping over a parcel of fallen timber that he will eventually be of no further survice to us. at the pass of Collin's Creek we met two indians who were on their way over the mountains, they had brought with themm the three horses and the Mule which had left us and returned to the quawmash ground. those indians returned with us about 1/2 a mile down the Creek where we halted to dine and graze our horses. as well as we could understand the Indians they informed us they had Seen Geo. Drewyer &amp; Shannon, and that they would not return untill the expiration of two days. the cause why Drewyer &amp; Shannon did not return with these men we are at a loss to account for. we pressed those indians to remain with us, and conduct us over the Mountains on the return of Drewyer &amp; Shannon. they consented to remain two nights for us and accordingly deposited their Stores of roots &amp; Bread in the bushes at no great distance and after Dinner returned with us as far as the little prarie about 2 Miles distance from the Creek, here they halted with their horses and informed us they would remain untill we overtook them or at least 2 nights. they had four Supernoumery horses with them. We Sent on four hunters ahead to the quawmash flatts to make an evening hunt; they so far suckceeded as to kill one deer. We left R. and Jo. Fields at the Creek where we dined, and Sergt. Gass in order to hunt about that place untill our return. at 7 in the evening we found ourselves once more at our old encampment where we Shall anxiously await the return of Drewyer &amp; Shannon. [Lewis:] Sunday June 22ed. 1806. this morning by light all hands who could hunt were sent out; the result of this days perfo[r]mance was greater than we had even hoped for. we killed eight deer and three bear. we dispatched Whitehouse to the Kooskooske near our old encampment above Collins's Creek in order to procure some Salmon which we have understood the natives are now taking in considerable quantities near that place. we gave Whitehouse a few beads which Capt. C. had unexpectedly found in one of his waistcoat pockets to purchase the fish. nothing further worthy of notice occured in the course of this day. the last evening was cool but the day was remarkably pleasant with a fine breize from the N. W. neither Drewyer Shannon nor Whitehouse returned this evening. Potts's legg is inflamed and very painfull to him. we apply a poltice of the roots of Cows. [Clark:] Sunday June 22nd. 1806 This morning by light all hands who could hunt were Sent out, the result of the days performance was greater than we had even hopes for. we killed eight Deer and three Bear. we despatched whitehouse to the Kooskoo[s]ke near out old encampment above Collins Creek in order to precure some salmon which we understood the nativs are now takeing in considerable quantities near that place. we gave Whitehouse a fiew beeds which I unexpectedly found in one of my waistcoat pockets to purchase the fish. nothing further occured in the course of this day. the last evening was cool but the day was remarkably pleasant with a fine breeze from the N.W. neither Shannon Drewyer nor Whitehouse returned this evening. Potts legg is inflamed and very painfull to him. we apply a poltice of the root of Cowes. [Lewis:] Monday June 23rd. 1806. Apprehensive from Drewyer's delay that he had met with some difficulty in procuring a guide, and also that the two indians who had promised to wait two nights for us would set out today, we thought it most advisable to dispatch Frazier and Wiser to them this morning with a vew if possible to detain them a day or two longer; and directed that in the event of their not being able to detain the indians, that Sergt. Gass, R &amp; J. Feilds and Wiser should accompany the indians by whatever rout they might take to travellers rest and blaize the trees well as they proceeded and wait at that place untill our arrival with the party. the hunters as usual wer dispatched early this morning. the does now having their fawns the hunters can bleat them up and in that manner kill them with more facility and ease. the indians pursue the game so much on horseback in this neighbourhood that it is very shye. our hunters killed 4 deer and a bear today. at 3 P. M. Drewyer Shannon and Whitehouse returned. Drewyer brought with him three indians who had consented to accompany us to the falls of the Missouri for the compensation of two guns. one of those men is the brother of the cutnose and the other two are the same who presented Capt. Clark and myself each with a horse on a former occasion at the Lodge of the broken arm. these are all young men of good character and much respected by their nation. we directed the horses to be brought near camp this evening and secured in such manner that they may be readily obtained in the morning being determined to make an early start if possible. Colter one of our hunters did not return this evening. [Clark:] Monday June 23rd. 1806 Apprehensive from Drewyer &amp; Shannons delay that they had met with some difficuelty in precureing a guide, and also that the two indians who had promised to wait two nights for us would set out today, we thought it most adviseable to dispatch Wizer &amp; Frazier to them this morning with a view if possible to detain them a day or two longer; and directed that in the event of their not being able to detain the indians, that Sergt. Gass, Jo. &amp; R. Fields &amp; Wiser should accompany the indians by whatever rout they might take to travellers rest and blaize the trees well as they proceeded, and wait at that place untill our arival with the party. the hunters as usial were dispatched early this morning. The does now haveing their young the hunters can blait them up, and in that manner kill them with more facillity and ease. the indians pursue the game so much on horse back in this neighbourhood that it is very shye. our hunters killed [blank space in MS.]1 1 Ten deer and three bears.—Gass. deer today. at 4 P. M. Shannon Drewyer &amp; Whitehouse returned. Shannon &amp; Drewyer brought with them three indians who had consented to accompany us to the falls of the Missouri for the Compensation of 2 guns. one of those men is the brother of the cutnose and the other two are the Same who presented Capt. L. and myself with a horse on a former occasion at the Lodge of the broken arm, and the two who promised to pursue us in nine nights after we left the river, or on the 19th. inst. Those are all young men of good Charrector and much respected by their nation. those men infor[med] us that th[e]ir nation as well as the Wallar-wallars have made peace with the Shoshones agreeable to our late advice to them. they also inform us that they have heard by means of the Skeetsomis[h] Nation &amp; Clarks river that the Big bellies of Fort de Prarie killed great numbers of the Shoshons and Ottelashoots which we met with last fall on the East fork of Lewis's river and high up the West fork of Clarks river &amp;c. We directed the horses to be brought near camp and secured in such a manner that they may be readily obtained in the morning being deturmined to make an early start if possible. Colter one of our hunters did not return this evening. [Lewis:] Tuesday June 24th. 1806. We collected our horses early this morning and set out accompanyed by our three guides. Colter joined us this morning having killed a bear, which from his discription of it's poverty and distance we did not think proper to send after. we nooned it as usual at Collins's Creek where we found Frazier, solus; the other four men having gone in pursuit of the two indian men who had set [out] from Collins's Creek two hours before Frazier and Wizer arrived. after dinner we continued our rout to Fish Creek a branch of Collins's Creek where we had lain on the 19th. &amp; 20th. inst. here we found Sergt. Gass Wiser and the two Indians whom they had prevailed on to remain at that place untill our arrival; R. &amp; J. Feilds had only killed one small deer only while they lay at Collins's Creek and of this they had been liberal to the Indians insomuch that they had no provision; they had gone on to the branch of hungary Creek at which we shall noon it tomorrow in order to hunt. we had fine grass for our horses this evening. [Clark:] Tuesday June 24th. 1806 We collected our horses early this morning and set out accompanied by our 3 guides. Colter joined us this morning haveing killed a Bear, which from his discription of it's poverty and distance we did not think proper to send after. We nooned it as usial at Collins's Creek where we found Frazier, solus; the other four men haveing gorn in pursute of the two indians who had set out from Collin's Creek two hours before Fraziers arrival Wiser arrived there. after dinner we continued our rout to fish Creek a branch of Collin's creek where we had lain the 15th 18th. 19th. &amp; 20th. insts. here we found Sargt. Gass, Wiser and the two indian men whome they had prevail'd on to remain at that place untill our arival; Jos. &amp; R. Fields had killed one Small deer only while they lay at Collins creek, and of this they had been liberal to the indians insomuch that they had no provisions; they had gorn on to the branch of hungary creek at which we shall noon it tomorrow in order to hunt. we had fine grass for our horses this evening. [Lewis:] Wednesday June 25th. 1806. last evening the indians entertained us with seting the fir trees on fire. they have a great number of dry lims near their bodies which when set on fire creates a very suddon and immence blaze from bottom to top of those tall trees. they are a beatifull object in this situation at night. this exhibition reminded me of a display of fireworks. the natives told us that their object in seting those trees on fire was to bring fair weather for our journey. We collected our horses readily and set out at an early hour this morning. one of our guides complained of being unwell, a symptom which I did not much like as such complaints with an Indian is generally the prelude to his abandoning any enterprize with which he is not well pleased. we left them at our encampment and they promised to pursue us in a few hours. at 11. A. M. we arrived at the branch of hungary creek where we found R. &amp; J. Feilds. they had not killed anything. here we halted and dined and our guides overtook us. at this place I met with a plant the root of which the shoshones eat. it is a small knob root a good deel in flavor an consistency like the Jerusalem Artichoke. it has two small oval smooth leaves placed opposite on either side of the peduncle just above the root. the scape is only about 4 inches long is round and smooth. the roots of this plant formed one of those collections of roots which Drewyer took from the Shoshones last summer on the head of Jeffersons's river.1 1 This is Claytonia lanceolata, Pursh. Lewis collected the type on the Lolo trail under date of June 27, 1806.—C. V. Piper. after dinner we continued our rout to hungary Creek and encamped about one and a half miles below our encampment of the 16th. inst. the indians continued with us and I beleive are disposed to be faithfull to their engagement. I gave the si[c]k indian a buffaloe robe he having no other covering except his mockersons and a dressed Elkskin without the hair. Drewyer and Sheilds were sent on this morning to hungry Creek in surch of their horses which they fortunately recovered. [Clark:] Wednesday June 25th. 1806 last evening the indians entertained us with setting the fir trees on fire. they have a great number of dry limbs near their bodies which when Set on fire create a very sudden and emmence blaize from bottom to top of those tall trees. they are a boutifull object in this situation at night. this exhibition remi[n]de[d] me of a display of firewo[r]ks. the nativs told us that their object in Setting those trees on fire was to bring fair weather for our journey. We collected our horses and set out at an early hour this morning. one of our guides complained of being unwell, a Symptom which I did not much like as such complaints with an indian is generally the prelude to his abandoning any enterprize with which he is not well pleased. we left 4 of those indians at our encampment they promised to pursue us in a fiew hours. at 11 A.M. we arrived at the branch of hungary Creek where we found Jo. &amp; R. Fields. they had not killed anything. here we halted and dined and our guides overtook us. at this place the squaw collected a parcel of roots of which the Shoshones Eat. it is a small knob root a good deel in flavour and consistency like the Jerusolem artichoke. it has two small smooth oval leaves placed opposit on either Side of the peduncle just above the root. the scope [scape] is only about 4 inches long is round and Smooth. the roots of this plant forms one of the collection of roots which D—. took from the Shoshones last fall on the head of Jefferson river. after dinner we continued our rout to hungary creek and encamped about one and a half miles below our Encampment of the 61th. inst: The indians all continue with us and I beleive are disposed to be faithfull to their engagements. Capt. L. gave the sick indian a small buffalow robe which he brought from the Missouri, this indian having no other Covering except his mockersons and a dressed Elk skin without the hair. Drewyer &amp; Shields were sent on this morning to hungary Creek in serch of their horses which they fortunately recovered. came [blank space in MS.] miles to daye. [Lewis:] Thursday June 26th. 1806. This morning we collected our horses and set out after an early breakfast or at 6 A. M. we passed by the same rout we had travelled on the 17th. inst. to our deposit on the top of the snowey mountain to the N. E. of hungary Creek. here we necessarily halted about 2 hours to arrange our baggage and prepare our loads. we cooked and made a haisty meal of boiled venison and mush of cows. the snow has subsided near four feet since the 17th. inst. we now measured it accurately and found from a mark which we had made on a tree when we were last here on the 17th. that it was then 10 feet 10 inches which appeared to be about the common debth though it is deeper still in some places. it is now generally about 7 feet. on our way up this mountain about the border of the snowey region we killed 2 of the small black pheasant and a female of the large dommanicker or speckled pheasant, the former have 16 f[e]athers in their tail and the latter 20 while the common pheasant have only 18. the indians informed us that neither of these speceis drumed; they appear to be very silent birds for I never heared either of them make a noise in any situation. the indians haistened to be off, and informed us that it was a considerable distance to the place which they wished to reach this evening where there was grass for our horses. accordingly we set out with our guides who lead us over and along the steep sides of tremendious mountains entirely covered with snow except about the roots of the trees where the snow had sometimes melted and exposed a few square feet of the earth. we ascended and decended several lofty and steep hights but keeping on the dividing ridge between the Chopunnish and Kooskooske rivers we passed no stream of water.1 1 The route now coincides essentially with the one of the year before until the camp of Sept. 15, 1805, at the snow bank, is reached.—O. D. Wheeler. late in the evening much to the satisfaction of ourselves and the comfort of our horses we arrived at the desired spot and encamped on the steep side of a mountain convenient to a good spring (having passed a few miles our camp of 18 Sepr 1805). there we found an abundance of fine grass for our horses. this situation was the side of an untimbered mountain with a fair southern aspect where the snows from appearance had been desolved about 10 days. the grass was young and tender of course and had much the appearance of the greensward.2 2 Three of their (Lewis and Clark's) camping places were positively recognized by us, viz.: at the Oyipe Prairie (Quamash Flats), which a trapper who had lived forty-five years among the Nez Percés pointed out to me; the Hot Springs on Lou-lou or Travellers Rest Creek; and the camp on Meadow Mountain, about midway, which when I was there (1866) was used for a resting place by all travellers who had occasion to pass over the rugged Lolo trail.—G. B. Nicholson. there is a great abundance of a speceis of bear-grass which grows on every part of these mountains it's growth is luxouriant and continues green all winter but the horses will not eat it. soon after we had encamped we were overtaken by a Chopunnish man who had pursued us with a view to accompany me to the falls of the Missouri. we were now informed that the two young men whom we met on the 21st. and detained several days are going on a party of pleasure mearly to the Oote-lash-shoots or as they call them Sha-lees a band of the Tush-she-pâh nation who reside on Clark's river in the neighbourhood of traveller's rest. one of our guides lost 2 of his horses, which he returned in surch of; he found them and rejoined us a little before dark. [Clark:] Thursday June 26th. 1806 We collected our horses and set out early and proceeded on Down hungary Creek a fiew miles and assended to the summit of the mountain where we deposited our baggage on the 17th. inst. found everything safe and as we had left them. the Snow which was 10 feet 10 inches deep on the top of the mountain, had sunk to 7 feet tho' perfectly hard and firm. we made some fire cooked dinner and dined, while our horses stood on snow 7 feet deep at least. after dinner we packed up and proceeded on. about the borders of the Snowey region we killed 2 small black pheasents and a female of the large dommanicker or Speckled pheasent, the former have 16 feathers in the tail and the latter 20 while the common Pheasent have 18. the indians informed us that neither of these Spec[i]es drumed; they appear to be very silent birds for I never heard any of them make any noise. the Indians hastened us off and informed us that it was a considerable distance to the place they wished to reach this evening where there was grass for our horses. accordingly we Set out with our guides who led us over and along the Steep Sides of tremendious Mountains entirely covered with Snow except about the roots of the trees where the Snow was partially melted and exposed a small spot of earth. we assended and decended several steep lofty hights but keeping on the dividing ridge of the Chopunnish &amp; Kooskooske river we passed no Stream of water. late in the evening much to the Satisfaction of ourselves and the Comfort of the horses we arived at the desired Spot and Encamped on the steep side of a Mountain convenient to a good Spring. here we found an abundance of fine grass for our horses. this Situation was the Side of an untimbered mountain with a fair Southern aspect where the snow from appearance had been disolved about 10 days, the grass was young and tender of course and had much the appearance of the Green Swoard. there is a great abundance of [a] Species of beargrass which grows on every part of those Mountains, its growth is luxuriant and continues green all winter but the horses will not eate it. Soon after we had encamped we were overtaken by a Chopunnish man who had pursued us with a view to accompany Capt Lewis to the falls of Missouri. we were now informed that the two young men we met on the 21st. and detained several days were going on a party of pleasure mearly to the Oat-lash-shoots or as they call them Sha-lees a band of the Tush-she-pâh Nation who reside on Clarks river in the neighbourhood of the Mouth of Travelers rest. one of our Guides lost 2 of his horses, he returned in serch of them he found them &amp; rejoined us at Dark. all of the Indians with us have two &amp; 3 horses each. I was taken yesterday with a violent pain in my head which has tormented me ever since most violently. [Lewis:] Friday June 27th. 1806. We collected our horses early and set out. the road still continued on the heights of the same dividing ridge on which we had traveled yesterday for nine miles or to our encampment of the (17th.) of September last. about one mile short of this encampment on an elivated point we halted by the request of the Indians a few minutes and smoked the pipe. On this eminence the natives have raised a conic mound of stones of 6 or eight feet high and on it's summit erected a pine pole of 15 feet long.1 1 This mound, similar to those at the Indian Post-offices, is at or near what is now known as Castle Butte.—O. D. Wheeler. from hence they informed us that when passing over with their famil[i]es some of the men were usually sent on foot by the fishery at the entrance of Colt Creek in order to take fish and again me[e]t the main party at the Quawmash glade on the head of the Kooskooske river. from this place we had an extensive view of these stupendous mountains principally covered with snow like that on which we stood; we were entirely surrounded by those mountains from which to one unacquainted with them it would have seemed impossible ever to have escaped; in short without the assistance of our guides I doubt much whether we who had once passed them could find our way to Travellers rest in their present situation for the marked trees on which we had placed considerable reliance are much fewer and more difficult to find than we had apprehended. these fellows are most admireable pilots; we find the road wherever the snow has disappeared though it be only for a few hundred paces. after smoking the pipe and contemplating this seene sufficient to have damp[ened] the sperits of any except such hardy travellers as we have become, we continued our march and at the distance of 3 ms. decended a steep mountain1 1 The foot of this mountain is now known as Snow-Bridge Gulch, running north.—G. B. Nicholson. and passed two small branches of the Chopunnish river just above their forks and again ascended the ridge on which we passed several miles and at a distance of 7ms arrived at our encampment [of the] (16th.) of September near which we passed 3 small branches of the Chopunnish river and again ascended to the dividing ridge on which we continued nine miles when the ridge became lower and we arrived at a situation very similar to our encampment of the last evening tho' the ridge was somewhat higher and the snow had not been so long desolved of course there was but little grass. here we encamped for the night having traveled 28 miles over these mountains without releiving the horses from their packs or their having any food. the indians inform us that there is (in the mountains a little to our left) an abundance of the mountain sheep or what they call white buffaloe. we saw three black-tailed or mule deer this evening but were unable to get a shoot at them. we also saw several tracks of those animals in the snow. the indians inform that there is great abundance of Elk in the vally about the Fishery on the Kooskooske River. our meat being exhausted we issued a pint of bears oil to a mess which with their boiled roots made an agreeable dish. Potts's legg which has been much swolen and inflamed for several days is much better this evening and gives him but little pain. we applyed the pounded roots and leaves of the wild ginger2 2 The wild ginger of this region is Asarum caudatum, Hook.—C. V. Piper. from which he found great relief. neare our encampment we saw a great number of the yellow lilly with reflected petals in blume; this plant was just as forward here at this time as it was in the plains on the 10th. of may.3 3 This is Erythronium nuttallium.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Friday June 27th. 1806 We collected our horses early and set out. the road Still continue[d] on the hights of the Dividing ridge on which we had traveled yesterday for 9 Ms. or to our encampment of the 16th. Septr. last. about 1 M. short of the encampment we halted by the request of the Guides a fiew minits on an ellevated point and smoked a pipe on this eminance the nativs have raised a conic mound of Stons of 6 or 8 feet high and erected a pine pole of 15 feet long. from hence they informed us that when passing over with their families some of the men were usually sent on foot by the fishery at the enterance of Colt Creek in order to take fish and again meet the party at the quawmash glade on the head of Kóoskoské river. from this place we had an extencive view of these Stupendeous Mountains principally covered with snow like that on which we stood; we were entirely serounded by those mountains from which to one unacquainted with them it would have Seemed impossible ever to have escaped, in short without the assistance of our guides, I doubt much whether we who had once passed them could find our way to Travellers rest in their present situation for the marked trees on which we had placed considerable reliance are much fewer and more difficuelt to find than we had apprehended. those indians are most admireable pilots; we find the road wherever the snow has disappeared tho' it be only for a fiew paces. after haveing smoked the pipe and contemplating this Scene Sufficient to have dampened the Sperits of any except such hardy travellers as we have become, we continued our march and at the dist[ance] of 3 M. decended a steep Mountain and passed two small branches of the Chopunnish river just above their fo[r]k, and again assend the ridge on which we passed. at the distance of 7 M. arived at our Encampment of 16th. Septr. last passed 3 small branches passed on a dividing ridge rugid and we arived at a Situation very similar to our situation of last night tho' [as] the ridge was somewhat higher and the snow had not been so long disolved of course there was but little grass. here we Encamped for the night haveing traveled 28 Ms. over these mountains without releiving the horses from their packs or their haveing any food. the Indians inform us that there is an abundance of the Mountain Sheep, or what they call white Buffalow on those Mountains. we Saw 3 black tail or mule deer this evening but were unable to get a Shoot at them. we also Saw Several tracks of those animals in the snow. our Meat being exhosted we issued a point of Bears Oil to a mess which with their boiled roots made an agreeable dish. Jo. Potts leg which had been much Swelled and inflaimed for several days is much better this evening and givs him but little pain. we applied the pounded root &amp; leaves of wild ginger from which he found great relief. Near our encampment we saw great numbers of the Yellow lilly with reflected petals in blume; this plant was just as forward here at this time as it was in the plains on the 10th. of May. My head has not pained me so much to day as yesterday and last night. [Lewis:] Saturday June 28th. 1806. This morning we collected our horses and set out as usual after an early breakfast. several of our horses had straggled to a considerable distance in surch of food but we were fortunate enough to find them in good time they look extreemly gant this morning, however the indians informed us that at noon we would arrive at a place where there was good food for them. we continued our rout along the dividing ridge passing one very deep hollow and at the distance of six miles passed our encampment of the [15th] of September last, one and a half miles further we passed the road which leads by the fishery falling in on the wright immediately on the dividing ridge.1 1 Here the explorers reject the old trail (followed on the outward journey) down the mountain to the fishery and Colt-killed Creek, and follow the trail as at present known, to the Hot Springs on Travellers' Rest Creek.—O. D. Wheeler. about eleven O'clock we arrived at an untimbered side of a mountain with a Southern aspect just above the fishery here we found an abundance of grass for our horses as the Indians had informed us.2 2 Mount Marcy, 6875 feet in height.—G. B. Nicholson. as our horses were very hungary and much fatiegued and from information no other place where we could obtain grass for them within the reach of this evening's travel we determined to remain at this place all night having come 13 miles only. the water was distant from our encampment we therefore melted snow and used the water principally. the whole of the rout of this day was over deep snows. we find the traveling on the snow not worse than without it, as the easy passage it gives us over rocks and fallen timber fully compensate for the inconvenience of sliping, certain it is that we travel considerably faster on the snow than without it. the snow sinks from 2 to 3 inches with a hors, is coarse and firm and seems to be formed of the larger and more dense particles of the snow; the surface of the snow is reather harder in the morning than after the sun shines on it a few hours, but it is not in that situation so dense as to prevent the horse from obtaining good foothold. we killed a small black pheasant; this bird is generally found in the snowey region of the mountains and feeds on the leaves of the pine and fir. there is a speceis of small whortleburry common to the hights of the mountains, and a speceis of grass with a broad succulent leaf which looks not unlike a flag; of the latter the horses are very fond, but as yet it is generally under the snow or mearly making it's appearance as it [is] confined to the upper parts of the highest mountains.1 1 This grass is Veratrum oiride, Ait., the local name of which is "squaw cabbage." The whortleberry is Vaccinium occidentale, Gray.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Saturday June 28th. 1806 This morning we colected our horses and Set out as usial after an early brackfast. we continued our rout along the dividing ridge over knobs &amp; through deep hollows passed our encampmt of the 14 Sept. last near the forks of the road leaving the one on which we had come one leading to the fishery to our right imediately on the dividing ridge. at 12 oClock we arived at an untimberd. side of a mountain with a southern aspect just above the fishery here we found an abundance of grass for our horses as the guid[e]s had informed us. as our horses were hungary and much fatiegued and from information no other place where we could obtain grass for them within the reach of this evening's travel we deturmined to remain at this place all night haveing come 13 M. only. the water was distant from our Encampment we therefore melted snow and used the water. the whole of the rout of this day was over deep Snow. we find the travelling on the Snow not worse than without it, as [the] easy passage it givs us over rocks and fallen timber fully compensates for the inconvenience of sliping, certain it is that we travel considerably faster on the snow than without it. the snow sinks from 2 to 3 inches with a horse, is course and firm and seems to be formed of the larger particles of the Snow; the Surface of the Snow is reather harder in the morning than after the sun shines on it a fiew hours, but it is not in that situation so dense as to prevent the horses from obtaining good foothold. I killed a small black pheasant; this bird is generally found in the Snowey region of the mountains and feeds on the leaves of the pine &amp; fir. there is a Species of small huckleberry common to the hights of the mountains. and a Species of grass with a broad succulent leaf which looks not unlike a flag; of the latter the horses are very fond, but as yet it is generally under the Snow, or mearly makeing it's appearance as it [is] confined to the upper part of the highest mountains. [Lewis:] Sunday June 29th. 1806. We collected our horses early this morning and set out, having previously dispatched Drewyer and R. Fields to the warm springs to hunt. we pursued the hights of the ridge on which we have been passing for several days; it terminated at the distance of 5 ms from our encampment and we decended to, and passed the main branch of the Kooskooske 1-? ms above the entrance of Quawmash [i. e., Glade] creek which falls in on the N. E. side. when we decended from this ridge we bid adieu to the snow. near the river we f [o]und a deer which the hunters had killed and left us. this was a fortunate supply as all our oil was now exhausted and we were reduced to our roots alone without salt. the Kooskooske at this place is about 30 yds. wide and runs with great velocity. the bed as [of] all the mountain streams is composed of smooth stones. beyond the river we ascended a very steep acclivity of a mountain about 2 Miles and arrived at it's summit where we found the old road which we had pased as we went out, coming in on our wright. the road was now much plainer and more beaten, which we were informed happened from the circumstance of the Ootslashshoots visiting the fishery frequently from the vally of Clark's river; tho' there was no appearance of there having been here this spring. at noon we arrived at the quawmas flatts on the Creek of the same name and halted to graize our horses and dine having traveled 12 miles. we passed our encampment of the (13th.) September at 10 ms. where we halted there is a pretty little plain of about 50 acres plentifully stocked with quawmash and from apperances this fromes [forms] one of the principal stages or encampments of the indians who pass the mountains on this road. we found after we had halted that one of our pack-horses with his load and one of my riding horses were left behind. we dispatched J. Feilds and Colter in surch of the lost horses. after dinner we continued our march seven miles further to the warm springs where we arrived early in the evening and sent out several hunters, who as well as R. Fields and Drewyer returned unsuccessful; late in the evening Colter and J. Fields joined us with the lost horses and brought with them a deer which they had killed, this furnished us with supper. these warm springs are situated at the base of a hill of no considerable hight on the N. side and near the bank of travellers rest creek which at that place is about 10 yards wide. these springs issue from the bottoms and through the interstices of a grey freestone rock, the rock rises in iregular mas[s]y clifts in a circular range arround the springs on their lower side. immediately above the springs on the creek there is a handsome little quamas plain of about 10 acres. the prinsipal spring is about the temperature of the warmest baths used at the hot springs in Virginia.1 1 See vol. iii, p. 64, note 2, ante.—Ed. In this bath which had been prepared by the Indians by stoping the run with stone and gravel, I bathed and remained in 19 minutes, it was with dificulty I could remain thus long and it caused a profuse sweat two other bold springs adjacent to this are much warmer, their heat being so great as to make the hand of a person smart extreemly when immerced. I think the temperature of these springs about the same as the hotest of the hot springs in Virginia. both the men and indians amused themselves with the use of a bath this evening. I observed that the indians after remaining in the hot bath as long as they could bear it ran and plunged themselves into the creek the water of which is now as cold as ice can make it; after remaining here a few minutes they returned again to the warm bath, repeating this transision several times but always ending with the warm bath. I killed a small black pheasant near the quamash grounds this evening which is the first I have seen below the snowy region. I also saw some young pheasants which were about the size of Chickens of 3 days old. saw the track of two bearfoot indians who were supposed to be distressed rufugees who had fled from the Minnetares. [Clark:] Sunday June 29th. 1806 We colected our horses and Set out haveing previously dispatched Drewyer &amp; R. Fields to the warm Springs to hunt. we prosued the hights of the ridge on which we have been passing for several days; it termonated at the distance of 5 Ms. from our encampment, and we decended to &amp; passed the Main branch of Kooskooke 1? Ms. above the enterance of Glade Creek which falls in on the N. E. side. we bid adew to the Snow. near the River we found a Deer which the hunters had killed and left us. this was a fortunate supply as all our bears oil was now exhosted and we were reduced to our roots alone without salt. the river is 30 Yds wide and runs with great velossity. the bead as all the Mountain streams is composed of smooth stone. beyond this river we assended a steep Mountain about 2 Miles to it's sumit where we found the old road which we had passed on as we went out, comeing in on our right, the road was now much plainer and much beaten. at noon we arived at the quawmash flatts on Vally Creek and halted to graize our horses and dined haveing traveled 12 Miles here is a pretty little plain of about 50 acres plentifully stocked with quawmash and from appearance this forms one of the principal Stages of the indians who pass the mountains on this road. we found that one of our pack hors[e]s with his load and one of Capt. L.s. horses were missing we dispatched Jo. Field &amp; Colter in serch of the lost horse's. after dinner we continued our march 7 Ms further to the worm Springs where we arrived early in the evening, and sent out several hunters, who as well as R. Field &amp; Drewyer returned unsuksessfull; late in the evening Jo. Field &amp; Colter joined us with the lost horses and brought with them a Deer which J. F. had killed, this furnished us with a Supper. Those Worm or Hot Springs are Situated at the base of a hill of no considerable hight, on the N. Side and near the bank of travellers rest Creek which is at that place about 10 yds wide. these Springs issue from the bottom and through the interstices of a grey freestone rock, the rock rises in irregular masy clifts in a circular range, arround the Springs on their lower Side. imediately above the Springs on the creek there is a handsom little quawmash plain of about 10 acres. the principal spring is about the temperature of the Warmest baths used at the Hot Springs in Virginia. in this bath which had been prepared by the Indians by stopping the river with Stone and mud, I bathed and remained in 10 minits it was with dificuelty I could remain this long and it causd. a profuse swe[a]t. two other bold Springs adjacent to this are much warmer, their heat being so great as to make the hand of a person Smart extreemly when immerced. we think the temperature of those Springs about the Same as that of the hotest of the hot Springs of Virginia. both the Men and the indians amused themselves with the use of the bath this evening. I observe after the indians remaining in the hot bath as long as they could bear it run and plunge themselves into the creek the water of which is now as cold as ice can make it; after remaining here a fiew minits they return again to the worm bath repeeting this transision several times but always ending with the worm bath. saw the tracks of 2 bear footed indians. [Lewis:] Monday June 30th. 1806 We dispatched Drewyer and J. Fields early this morning to hunt on the road and indeavour to obtain some meat for us. just as we had prepared to set out at an early hour a deer came in to lick at these springs and one of our hunters killed it; this secured us our dinners, and we proceeded down the creek sometimes in the bottoms and at other times on the top or along the steep sides of the ridge to the N. of the Creek. at one mile from the springs we passed a stout branch of the creek on the north side and at noon having travelled 13 ms. we arrived at the entrance of a second Northe[r]n branch of the creek where we had nooned it on the 12th. of Septr. last. here we halted, dined and graized our horses. while here Sheilds took a small tern and killed a deer. at this place a road turns off to the wright which the indians informed us leads to Clarks river some distance below where there is a fine extensive vally in which the Shalees or Ootslashshoots sometimes reside. in decending the creek this morning on the steep side of a high hill my horse sliped with both his hinder feet out of the road and fell, I also fell off backwards and slid near 40 feet down the hill before I could stop myself such was the steepness of the declivity; the horse was near falling on me in the first instance but fortunately recovers and we both escaped unhirt. I saw a small grey squirrel today much like those of the Pacific coast only that the belly of this was white. I also met with the plant in blume which is sometimes called the lady's slipper or mockerson flower. it is in shape and appearance like ours only that the corolla is white, marked with small veigns of pale red longitudinally on the inner side.1 1 This is the well-known orchid, Cypripedium montanum.—C. V. Piper. after dinner we resumed our march. soon after seting out Sheilds killed another deer and in the course of the evening we picked up three others which Drewyer had killed along the road making a total of 6 today. Deer are very abundant in the neighbourhood of travellers rest of both speceis, also some bighorns and Elk. a little before sunset we arrived at our old encampment on the south side of the creek a little above it's entrance into Clark's river. here we encamped with a view to remain two days in order to rest ourselves and horses &amp; make our final arrangements for seperation. we came 19 ms. after dinner the road being much better than it has been since we entered the mountains we found no appearance of the Ootslashshoots having been here lately. the indians express much concern for them and apprehend that the Minnetares of fort de Prarie have distroyed them in the course of the last winter and spring, and mention the tracks of the bearfoot Indians which we saw yesterday as an evidence of their being much distressed. our horses have stood the journey supprisingly well, most of them are yet in fine order, and only want a few days rest to restore them perfectly. [Clark:] Monday June 30th. 1806 We dispatched Drewyer &amp; Jo. Field early this morning a head to hunt. just as we had prepard. to set out at an early hour, a deer came in to lick at the Springs and one of our hunters killed it; this secured to us our dinner. and we proceeded down the Creek, sometimes in the bottoms and at other times on the tops or along the Steep sides of the ridge to the N. of the Creek. at 1? M. we passd our encampment of the 12th. of Septr. last. we noon'd it at the place we had on the 12 of Septr. last whiles here Shields killed a deer on the N. fork near the road. here a rode leads up the N. fork and passed over to an extensive vally on Clarks river at some distance down that river as our guids inform us. after dinner we resumed our march. soon after setting out Shields killed another deer, and we picked up 3 others which G Drewyer had killed along the road. Deer are very abundant in the neighbourhood of travellers rest of boath Species, also some big horn and Elk. a little before Sunset we arrived at our old encampment on the S. side of the Creek a litle above its enterance into Clarks river. here we Encamped with a view to remain 2 days in order to rest ourselves and horses and make our final arrangements for Seperation. we found no signs of the Oatlashshots haveing been here lately. the Indians express much concern for them and apprehend that the Minetarries of Fort d[e]Prarie have destroyed them in the course of the last Winter and Spring, and mention the tracts of the bearfooted indians which we saw yesterday as an evidence of their being much distressed. our horses have stood the journey suprisinly well and only want a flew days rest to restore them.1 1 In the weather diary for this date (Codex M, p. 150), Clark entered the following general description of the route over the mountains: "Decended the mountain to Travellers rest leaveing these tremendious mountains behind us, in passing of which we have experienced cold and hunger of which I shall ever remember. in passing over this part of the Rocky mountains from Clarks river, to the Quawmash flats from the 14th. to the 19th. of Septr. 1805 we marched through Snow, which fell on us the night of the 14th. and nearly all the day of the 15 in addition to the old [and] rendered the air cool and the way dificuelt. our food was horses of which we eate three. on our return we Set out from the quawmash flats on the 15th. of June and commen [c]ed the assent of the rocky mountains; the air became cool and vegetation backward. on the 16th. we met with banks of Snow and in the hollars and maney of the hill Sides the Snow was from 3 to 4 feet deep, and Scercely any grass Vegetation just commencing where the Snow had melted. on the 17th. at meridian, the Snow became So deep in every derection from 6 to 8 feet deep we could not prosue the road, there being no grass for our horses we were obliged to return to the quawmash flatts to precure meat to live on as well as grass for our horses leaveing our baggage on the Mountains. "We precured 5 Indians as pilots and on the 24th. of June 1806 we again under took. those Snowey regs. on the 26th. we with our baggage arived at an open place serounded with Snow where there was grass for horses on the 27th. &amp; 28th. also passing over Snow 6 or 9 feet deep all the way, on 29th. passed over but little Snow, but saw great masses of it lying in different directions."—Ed. [Lewis:] Tuesday July 1st. 1806. This morning early we sent out all our hunters. set Sheilds at work to repair some of our guns which were out of order [Capt. Clark &amp; myself consurted the following Plan viz.] from this place I determined to go with a small party by the most direct rout to the falls of the Missouri, there to leave Thompson McNeal and goodrich to prepare carriages and geer for the purpose of transporting the canoes and baggage over the portage, and myself and six volunteers to ascend Maria's river with a view to explore the country and ascertain whether any branch of that river lies as far north as Latd. 50. and again return and join the party who are to decend the Missouri, at the entrance of Maria's river. I now called for the volunteers to accompany me on this rout, many turned out, from whom I scelected Drewyer the two Feildes, Werner, Frazier and Sergt. Gass [accompanied me] the other part of the men are to proceed with Capt. Clark to the head of Jefferson's river where we deposited sundry articles and left our canoes. from hence Sergt. Ordway with a party of 9 men are to decend the river with the canoes; Capt. C. with the remaining ten including Charbono and York will proceed to the Yellowstone river at it's nearest approach to the three forks of the missouri, here he will build a canoe and decend the Yellowstone river with Charbono the indian woman, his servant York and five others to the missouri where should he arrive first he will wait my arrival. Sergt. Pryor with two other men are to proceed with the horses by land to the Mandans and thence to the British posts on the Assinniboin with a letter to Mr. Heney (Haney) whom we wish to engage to prevail on the Sioux Ch[i]efs to join us on the Missouri, and accompany them with us to the seat of the general government. these arrangements being made the party were informed of our design and prepared themselves accordingly. our hunters killed 13 deer in the course of this day of which 7 were fine bucks, deer are large and in fine order. the indians inform us that there are a great number of white buffaloe or mountain sheep of [on] the snowey hights of the mountains West of this river (Clarks); they state that they inhabit the most rocky and inaccessible parts, and ran but badly, that they kill them with great ease with their arrows when they can find them. the indian warrior who overtook us on the 26th. Ult. made me a present of an excellent horse which he said he gave for the good council we had given himself and nation and also to assure us of his attatchment to the white men and his desire to be at peace with the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie. we had our venison fleeced and exposed in the sun on pole[s] to dry. the dove the black woodpecker, the lark woodpecker, the logcock, the prarie lark, sandhill crain, prarie hen with the short and pointed tail, the robin, a speceis of brown plover, a few curloos, small black birds, ravens hawks and a variety of sparrows as well as the bee martin and the several speceis of Corvus genus are found in this vally.1 1 Coues identifies these birds as follows: the dove, Zenaidura caroliniensis; black woodpecker, Asyndesmus torquatus; lark woodpecker, Colaptes mexicanus; logcock, Ceophlœus pileatus; prairie lark, Eremophila alpestris var.; sandhill crane, Grus canadensis; prairie hen, Pediœcetes columbianus; robin, Merula migratoria; plover, probably Podasocys montanus; blackbirds, Molothrus ater; and bee-martin, Tyrannus caroliniensis. —Ed. Windsor birst his gun near the muzzle a few days since; this Sheilds cut off and I then exchanged it with the Cheif for the one we had given him for conducting us over the mountains. he was much pleased with the exchange and shot his gun several times; he shoots very well for an inexperienced person.2 2 Here Lewis records "Courses and distances from Quawmash Flats to Traveller's Rest" (on pp. 70, 71 of Codex L); this matter we transpose to our vol. vi.—Ed. The little animal found in the plains of the Missouri which I have called the barking squirrel3 3 Better known as "prairie dog." See ante, vol. i, p. 142.—Ed. weighs from 3 to 3-? pounds. it's form is that of the squirrel. it's colour is an uniform light brick red grey, the red reather predominating. the under side of the neck and bel[l]y are lighter coloured than the other parts of the body. the legs are short, and it is wide across the breast and sholders in propotion to it's size, appears strongly formed in that part; the head is also bony muscular and stout, reather more blontly terminated wider and flatter than the common squirrel. the upper lip is split or divided to the nose. the ears are short and lie close to the head, having the appearance of being cut off, in this particular they resemble the guinea pig. the teeth are like those of the squirrel rat &amp;c. they have a false jaw or pocket between the skin and the mustle of the jaw like that of the common ground squ[i]rrel but not so large in proportion to their size. they have large and full whiskers on each side of the nose, a few long hairs of the same kind on each jaw and over the eyes. the eye is small and black. they have five toes on each foot of which the two outer toes on each foot are much sho[r]ter than those in the center particularly the two inner toes of the forefeet, the toes of the fore feet are remarkably long and sharp and seem well adapted to [s]cratching or burrowing those of the hind feet are neither as long or sharp as the former; the nails are black. the hair of this animal is about as long and equally as course as that of the common grey squ[i]rrel of our country, and the hair of the tail is not longer than that of the body except immediately at the extremity where it is somewhat longer and frequently of a dark brown colour. the part of generation in the female is placed on the lower region of the belly between the hinder legs so far forward that she must lie on her back to copolate. the whole length of this animal is one foot five inches from the extremity of the nose to that of the tail of which the tail occupyes 4 inches. it is nearly double the size of the whistleing squirrel of the Columbia. it is much more quick active and fleet than it's form would indicate. these squirrels burrow in the ground in the open plains usually at a considerable distance from the water yet are never seen at any distance from their burrows. six or eight usually reside in one burrow to which there is never more than one entrance. these burrows are of great debth. I once dug and pursued a burrow to the debth of ten feet and did not reach it's greatest debth. they generally associate in large societies placing their burrows near each other and frequently occupy in this manner several hundred acres of land. when at rest above ground their position is generally erect on their hinder feet and rump; thus they will generally set and bark at you as you approach them, their note being much that of the little toy dogs, their yelps are in quick succession and at each they [give] a motion to their tails upwards. they feed on the grass and weeds within the limits of their village which they never appear to exceed on any occasion. as they are usually numerous they keep the grass and weeds within their district very closely graized and as clean as if it had been swept. the earth which they throw out of their burrows is usually formed into a conic mound around the entrance. this little animal is frequently very fat and it's flesh is not unpleasant. as soon as the hard frosts commence it shuts up it's burrow and continues untill spring. it will eat neither grain or meat. [Clark:] Tuesday July 1st. 1806 on Clarks river We Sent out all the hunters very early this morning by 12 oClock they all returned haveing killd. 12 Deer six of them large fat Bucks, this is like once more returning to the land of liveing a plenty of meat and that very good. as Capt. Lewis and Myself part at this place we make a division of our party and such baggage and provisions as is Souteable. the party who will accompany Capt. L. is G. Drewyer, Sergt. Gass, Jo. &amp; R. Fields, Frazier &amp; Werner, and Thompson Goodrich &amp; Mc. Near[l] as far as the Falls of Missouri at which place the 3 latter will remain untill I send down the Canoes from the head of Jeffersons river. they will then join that party and after passing the portage around the falls, proceed on down to the enterance of Maria where Capt. Lewis will join them after haveing assended that river as high up as Latd. 50°. North. from the head of Jeffersons river I shall proceed on to the head of the Rockejhone [i. e., Yellowstone] with a party of 9 or 10 men and desend that river. from the R Rockejhone I shall dispatch Sergt. Pryor with the horses to the Mandans and from thence to the Tradeing Establishments of the N.W.C°. on the Assinniboin River with a letter which we have written for the purpose to engage Mr. H. Haney to endeaver to get some of the principal Chiefs of the Scioux to accompany us to the Seat of our government &amp;c. we divide the Loading and apportion the horses. Capt. L. only takes 17 horses with him, 8 only of which he intends to take up the Maria &amp;c. one of the Indians who accompanied us swam Clarks river and examined the country around, on his return he informed us that he had discovered where a Band of the Tushepaws had encamped this Spring passed of 64 Lodges, &amp; that they had passed Down Clarks river and that it was probable that they were near the quawmash flatts on a Easterly branch of that river. those guides expressed a desire to return to their nation and not accompany us further, we informed them that if they was deturmined to return we would kill some meat for them, but wished that they would accompy Capt Lewis on the rout to the falls of Missouri only 2 nights and show him the right road to cross the Mountains. this they agreed to do. we gave a medal of the small size to the young man son to the late Great Chief of the Chopunish Nation who had been remarkably kind to us in every instance, to all the others we tied a bunch of blue ribon about the hair, which pleased them very much the Indian man who overtook us in the Mountain, presented Capt Lewis with a horse and said that he opened his ears to what we had said, and hoped that Capt Lewis would see the Crovanters [Gros Ventres] of Fort de Prarie and make a good peace that it was their desire to be at peace. shew them the horse as a token of their wishes &amp;c. [Lewis:] Wednesday July 2nd. 1806. We sent out the hunters early this morning, they returned not so successfull as yesterday having killed 2 deer only. Sheilds continued repairing the gunns which he compleated by evening. all arrangements being now compleat we determined to set out in the morning. in the course of the day we had much conversation with the indians by signs, our only mode of communicating our ideas. they informed us that they wished to go in surch of the Ootslashshoots their friends and intended leaving us tomorrow morning, I prevailed on them to go with me as far as the East branch of Clark's River and put me on the road to the Missouri. I gave the Cheif a medal of the small size; he insisted on exchanging names with me according to their custom which was accordingly done and I was called Yo-me-kol-lick which interpreted is the white bearskin foalded. in the evening the indians run their horses, and we had several foot races betwen the natives and our party with various success. these are a race of hardy strong athletic active men. nothin worthy of notice transpired in the course of the day. Goodrich and Mc. Neal are both very unwell with the pox which they contracted last winter with the Chinnook women this forms my inducement principally for taking them to the falls of the Missouri where during an interval of rest they can use the murcury freely. I found two speceis of native clover here, the one with a very narrow small leaf and a pale red flower the other nearly as luxouriant as our red clover with a white flower the leaf and blume of the latter are proportionably large. I found several other uncommon plants specemines of which I preserved. The leaf of the cotton wood on this river is like that common to the Columbia narrower than that common to the lower part of the Missouri and Mississippi and wider than that on the upper part of the Missouri. the wild rose, servise berry, white berryed honeysuckle, seven bark, elder, alder aspin, choke cherry and the broad and narrow leafed willow are natives of this valley. the long leafed pine forms the principal timber of the neighbourhood, and grows as well in the river bottoms as on the hills. the firs and larch are confined to the higher parts of the hills and mountains. the tops of the high mountains on either side of this river are covered with snow. the musquetoes have been excessively troublesome to us since our arrival at this place. [Clark:] Wednesday July 2nd. 1806 Sent out 2 hunters this morning and they killed 2 Deer. the Musquetors has been So troublesom day and night since our arrival in this Vally that we are tormented very much by them and cant' write except under our Bears [i. e., biers]. We gave the second gun to our guides agreeable to our promis, and to each we gave Powder &amp; ball I had the greater part of the meat dried for to subsist my party in the Mountains between the head of Jeffersons &amp; Clarks rivers where I do not expect to find any game to kill. had all of our arms put in the most prime order two of the rifles have unfortunately bursted near the muscle [muzzle], Shields cut them off and they shute tolerable well one which is very short we exchanged with the Indian whoe he had given a longer gun to induce them to pilot us across the Mountains. we caused every man to fill his horn with powder &amp; have a sufficiency of Balls &amp;c. the last day in passing down Travellers rest Creek Capt. Lewis fell down the side of a Steep Mountain near 40 feet but fortunately receved no damage. his hors was near falling on him but fortunately recovered and they both escaped unhurt. I killed a Small grey squirel and a Common pheasant. Capt. L. showed me a plant in blume which is sometimes called the ladies slipper or Mockerson flower. it is in shape and appearance like ours only that the corolla is white marked with small veigns of pale red longitudinally on the inner side, and much smaller. The Indians and some of our men amused themselves in running races on foot as well as with their horses.</field>

SENT out the hunters they killed three deer gave the indians half. the mosqu[i]toes troublesome built fires for our horses. we did not get over the river until 6 P.M. I fell in the water and wet the chronometer. we made three rafts. Indians express great apprehension with rispect to the Minetares. saw the fresh track of a horse in the main road which leads up this river which the indians supposed to be the Shalees. Took leave of Capt. C. and party to-day. gave one of my shirts and a handkercheif to the two Indians whom we met on Collin's Creek and detained some days. Thursday July 3rd. 1806. All arrangements being now compleated for carrying into effect the several scheemes we had planed for execution on our return, we saddled our horses and set out I took leave of my worthy friend and companion Capt. Clark and the party that accompanyed him. I could not avoid feeling much concern on this occasion although I hoped this seperation was only momentary. I proceeded down Clark's river seven miles with my party of nine men and five indians. here the Indians recommended our passing the river which was rapid and 150 yds. wide. 2 miles above this place I passed the entrance of the East branch of Clark's River which discharges itself by two channels; the water of this river is more terbid than the main stream and is from 90 to 120 yds. wide. as we had no other means of passing the river we busied ourselves collecting dry timber for the purpose of constructing rafts; timber being scarce we found considerable difficulty in procuring as much as made three small rafts. we arrived at 11 A. M. and had our rafts completed by 3 P. M. when we dined and began to take over our baggage which we effected in the course of 3 hours the rafts being obliged to return several times. the Indians swam over their horses and drew over their baggage in little basons of deer skins which they constructed in a very few minutes for that purpose. we drove our horses in after them and they followed to the opposite shore. I remained myself with two men who could scarcely swim untill the last; by this time the raft by passing so frequently had fallen a considerable distance down the river to a rapid and difficult part of it crouded with several small Islands and willow bars which were now overflown; with these men I set out on the raft and was soon hurried down with the current a mile and a half before we made shore, on our approach to the shore the raft sunk and I was drawn off the raft by a bush and swam on shore the two men remained on the raft and fortunately effected a landing at some little distance below. I wet the chronometer by this accedent which I had placed in my fob as I conceived for greater security. I now joined the party and we proceeded with the indians about 3 Ms. to a small Creek and encamped at sunset.1 1 After leaving their camp, Lewis and his men proceeded down the west side of the Bitter Root River; at the end of five miles, they reached the confluence of that stream with the Hellgate River, their united waters forming the Missoula. Two miles below that point, they crossed the Missoula; then proceeding up its left bank and that of the Hellgate, they encamped at Grant Creek.—Ed. I sent out the hunters who soon returned with three very fine deer of which I gave the indians half. These people now informed me that the road which they shewed me at no great distance from our Camp would lead us up the East branch of Clark's river and [to] a river they called Cokahlarishkit or the river of the road to buffaloe and thence to medicine river and the falls of the Missouri where we wished to go. MS. page by Lewis, July 3, 1806. they alledged that as the road was a well beaten track we could not now miss our way and as they were affraid of meeting with their enimies the Minnetares they could not think of continuing with us any longer, that they wished now to proceed down Clark's river in surch of their friends the Shalees. they informed us that not far from the dividing ridge between the waters of this and the Missouri rivers the roads forked they recommended the left hand as the best rout but said they would both lead us to the falls of the Missouri.1 1 That is, the expedition was to follow the Cokahlarishkit River (now the Big Blackfoot) until the road led over the main ridge of the Rockies by two passes—the Cadotte, to the south, and the Lewis and Clark, which was attained by following the more northern or left hand branch.—Ed. I directed the hunters to turn out early in the morning and indeavour to kill some more meat for these people whom I was unwilling to leave without giving them a good supply of provision after their having been so obliging as to conduct us through those tremendious mountains. the musquetoes were so excessively troublesome this evening that we were obliged to kindle large fires for our horses these insects torture them in such manner untill they placed themselves in the smoke of the fires that I realy thought they would become frantic. about an hour after dark the air become so coald that the musquetoes disappeared. July 3rd Courses and distances from travellers rest [first draught]. North 7 M. to the crossing of Clarke's river, valley wide tops of the hills covered with Long leaf pine. bottoms pine and Cottonwood. passed a small branch at 3 M on W. side and at 1 M. further the entrance of a small creek on E. side. at 5 miles Co-kah-lár-coosh or buffaloe river falls in on the East side.

Clark's river 150 yds. wide the East branch from 90 to 120. the vally of Clark's river is extensive beatifull level plains and praries. the tops of the hills and mountains on either hand are covered with long leafed pine larch and fir; near the river the bottoms are timbered with long leafed pine and cottonwood. N. 75 Ms. E. 7. M./14 through a handsom level plain to the point at which the East branch enters the mountains or where the hills set in near it on either side. we halted and encamped on a small creek 5 miles short of the extremity of this course. a Creek 15 yds. wide falls into the E. branch on it's N. side one mile short of the mountain. We saw the fresh track of a horse this evening in the road near our camp which the indians supposed to be a Shale spye. we killed a prarie hen with the short and pointed tail she had a number of young which could just fly. [First draught:] July 4th. 1806 An Indian arrived alone from the West side of the mountains, he had pursued and overtook us here. sent out the hunters early to kill some meat to give the indians as they would not go with us further and I was unwilling after the service they had rendered to send them away without a good store of provision. they are going down Clark's River in surch of the Shalees their friends, and from thence intend returning by this rout home again, they fleesed their meat and informed us that they should dry it and leave it for their homeward journey. Set out at 12. had killed no deer. N. 75.

I arrose early this morning and sent out Drewyer and the Fieldses to hunt. at 6. A. M. a man of the Pallotepellows (Pelloat pallahs) arrived from the West side of the Rocky mountains; he had pursued us a few days after our departure and overtook us at this place; he proved to be the same young man who had first attempted to pass the rocky mountains early in June last when we lay on the Kooskooske and was obliged to relinquish the enterprize in consequence of the debth and softness of the snow. I gave a shirt a handkercheif and a small quantity of ammunition to the indians. at half after eleven the hunters returned from the chase unsuccessful. I now ordered the horses saddled smoked a pipe with these friendly people and at noon bid them adieu. they had cut the meat which I gave them last evening thin and exposed it in the sun to dry informing me that they should leave it in this neighbourhood untill they returned as a store for their homeward journey, it is worthy of remark that these people were about to return by the same pass by which they had conducted through the difficult part of the Rocky Mountains, altho they were about to decend Clark's river several days journey in surch of the Shale's their relations, a circumstance which to my mind furnishes sufficient evidence that there is not so near or so good a rout to the plains of Columbia by land along that river as that which we came, the several war routs of the Minetarees which fall into this vally of Clark's river concenter at traveller's rest beyond which point they have never yet dared to venture in pursuit of the nations beyond the mountains. all the nations also on the west side of the mountain with whom we are acquainted inhabiting the waters of Lewis's river &amp; who visit the plains of the Missouri pass by this rout. these affectionate people our guides betrayed every emmotion of unfeigned regret at seperating from us;1 1 It is but justice to say that the whole nation to which they belong [Nez Percés], are the most friendly, honest, and ingenuous people that we have seen in the course of our voyage and travels.—Gass (p. 340). they said that they were confidint that the Pahkees, (the appellation they give the Minnetares) would cut us off. the first 5 miles of our rout was through a part of the extensive plain in which we were encamped, we then entered the mountains with the East fork of Clark's river through a narrow confined pass on it's N. side continuing up that river five Ms. further to the entrance of the Cokahlahishkit R. which falls in on the N. E. side, is 60 yds. wide deep and rapid. the banks bold not very high but never overflow. the East fork below its junction with this stream is 100 yds. wide and above it about 90. the water of boath are terbid but the East branch much the most so; their beds are composed of sand and gravel; the East fork possesses a large portion of the former. neither of those streams are navigable in consequence of the rapids and shoals which obstruct their currents. thus far a plain or untimbered country bordered the river which near the junction of these streams spread into a handsome level plain of no great extent; the hills were covered with long leafed pine and fir.1 1 The expedition parted from their Indian guides in the wide mountain-walled valley at the mouth of Rattlesnake Creek, which is now the site of Missoula—an important station on the Northern Pacific Railway, and the seat of Montana State University. Farther down, at the junction of the Hellgate with the Bitter Root, stands Fort Missoula on a government military reservation. The Hellgate (East Fork) receives its name from the cañon which Lewis describes as "a narrow confined pass" stretching east from Missoula to the entrance of Big Blackfoot River (Cokalahishkit). As this was the route by which the Indians, trappers, and traders had to pass on their way to the buffalo country, and haunted by war parties of Blackfeet, it acquired, in the picturesque French, the title Porte de l'Enfer (Hell's Gate).—Ed. I now continued my rout up the N. side of the Cokaplahishkit river through a timbered country for 8 miles and encamped in a handsom bottom on the river where there was an abundance of excellent grass for our horses, the evening was fine, air pleasant and no musquetoes. a few miles before we encamped I killed a squirrel of the speceis common to the Rocky Mountains and a ground squirrel of a speceis which I had never before seen, I preserved the skins of both of these animals.

A Suplement to Come in here enclosed2 2 At this point in Codex L are ten blank leaves, on which Lewis evidently intended, but failed, to copy and elaborate the field notes made for his journey during July 5–14.

East 6 M. to the entrance of Werner's Creek1 1 Named for Private Werner, who accompanied Lewis; on the Land Office Maps it is now called Clearwater River.—Ed. 35 yds. wide through a high extensive prairie on N. side, hills low and timbered with the long leafed pine, larch, and some fir. the road passes at some distance to the left of the river and this cou[r]ses is with the river. N. 22 W. 4 Miles to a high insulated knob just above the entrance of a Creek 8 yards wide which discharges itself into Werners Creek. N. 75 E. 2 1/2 M. to the river passing through anextensive and handsom plain on Werner's Creek, crossing that creek at 1 M. and leaving a high prarie hills to the right seperating the plain from the river. saw two swan in this beautiful Creek. East 3 M. to the entrance of a large creek 20 yds. wide Called Seamans' Creek passing a creek at 1 m. 8 yds. wide. this course with the river, the road passing through an extensive high prarie rendered very uneven by a vast number of little hillucks and sink-holes. at the heads of these two creeks high broken mountains stand at the distance of 10 M. forming a kind of Cove generally of open untimbered country, we encamped on the lower side of the last creek just above it's entrance, here a war party had encamped about 2 months since and conceald their fires. 31 M. July 6th. 1806 Set out a little after sunrise passed the creek a little above our encampment. East 14 M. to the point at which the river leaves the extensive plains and enters the mountains these plains I called the prarie of the knobs from a number of knobs being irregularly scattered through it. passed the N. fork1 1 Now known as Salmon Trout Creek, the largest northern affluent of Big Black-foot River. The "prarie of knobs" is now called Blackfoot Prairie, and sometimes Stevens's Prairie, because of its exploration by Governor Stevens (1853–54), who attested the fidelity of Lewis's description of the knobs or irregular ridges of the plain.—Ed. of the Cokahlarishkit River at 7 M. it is 45 yds. wide deep and rapid. had some difficulty in passing it. passed a large crooked pond at 4 Ms. further, great Number of the burrowing squirr[e]ls in this prarie of the speceis common to the plains of Columbia saw some goats and deer. the hunters killed one of the latter. the trail which we take to be a returning war-party of the Minnetares of Fort de prarie becomes much fresher. they have a large pa[r]sel of horses. saw some Curloos, bee martains wood peckers plover, robins, doves, ravens, hawks and a variety of sparrows common to the plains also some ducks. the North fork is terbid as is also the main branch which is about 50 yds. wide the other streams are clear. these plains continue their course S. 75 E. and are wide where the river leaves them. up this valley and creek a road passes to Dearbourn's river and thence to the Missouri. N. 60 E. 1 1/2 up the river. here we halted and dined and our hunters overtook us with a deer which they had killed. river bottoms narrow and country thickly timbered. Cotton-wood and pine grow intermixed in the river bottoms musquitoes extreemely troublesome. we expect to meet with the Minnetares and are therefore much on our guard both day and night. the bois rague1 1 "Bois-rouge," in the Biddle text; literally, "redwood."—Ed. in blume. saw the common small blue flag and peppergrass. the southern wood and two other speceis of shrub are common in the prarie of knobs, preserved specemines of them. passed several old Indian encampments of brush lodges. S. 80 E. 2 M. to two nearly equal forks of the river here the road forks also one leading up each branch these are the forks of which I presume the indians made mention.1 1 See p. 185, note 1, ante. Lewis here left the main stream of the Big Blackfoot, and passed up Lander's Fork, named in 1853 in honor of one of the surveyors for the Pacific Railway.—Ed. passed a creek on N. side 12 Yds. wide shallow and clear. N. 75 E. 8 M. to our encampment of this evening over a steep high balld toped hill for 2 M. thence through and to the left of a large low bottom 2 M. thence three miles through a thick wood along the hill side bottoms narrow. thence one M. to our encampment on a large creek some little distance above it's mouth through a beatifull plain on the border of which we passed the remains of 32 old lodges. they appear to be those of the Minnetares as are all those we have seen to day. killed five deer and a beaver today. encamped on the creek much sign of beaver in this extensive bottom. 25 July 7th 1806. Set out at 7 A. M. N. 75 E. 6 M. with the road through a level beatifull plain on the North side of the river much timber in the bottoms hills also timbered with pitch pine. no long leafed pine since we left the praties of the knobs. crossed a branch of the creek 8 yds. wid on which we encamped at 1/4 M. also passed a creek 15 yds. wide at 1/4 further. North 6 Ms. passed the main creek at a mile [and] 1/2 and kept up it on the wrighthand side through handsom plain bottoms to the foot of a ridge which we ascended the main stream boar N. W. &amp; W. as far as I could see it a wright hand fork falls into this creek at 1 M. above the commencement of this course. N. 15. E. 8. M. over two ridges and again striking the wrighthand fork at 4 Ms. then continued up it on the left hand side much appearance of beaver many dams. bottoms not wide and covered with low willow and grass. halted to dine at a large beaver dam the hunters killed 3 deer and a fawn. deer are remarkably plenty and in good order. Reubin Fields wounded a moos deer this morning near our camp. my dog much worried. [by the moose.—Ed.] N. 10 E. 3 M. up the same creek. on the east side through a handsome narrow plain. N. 45. E. 2 M. passing the dividing ridge1 1 Lewis crossed the divide by the gap now known as Lewis and Clark's Pass; it is on the boundary line between Deer Lodge and Lewis and Clarke counties, about 45 miles (in a direct line) N. N. W. from Helena. From the headwaters of Big Blackfoot River, Lewis passed to those of Sun (Medicine) River, by which he soon reached the Missouri—to which river he thus followed the easiest and most direct route from the head of the Clearwater. Cf. accounts of this pass and its approaches from either side, as given by Gass (pp. 342, 343), and by Stevens (Explor. for R.R. to Pacific, xii, pp. 213–215); and see Clark's description, post, in scientific data, vol. vi of the present work.—Ed. betwen the waters of the Columbia and Missouri rivers at 1/4 of a mile, from this gap which is low and an easy ascent on the W. side the fort mountain bears North East, and appears to be distant about 20 Miles.2 2 Fort Mountain is south of Fort Shaw, identified as Square Butte, always visible from Lewis and Clark Pass. For the explorer's first sight of this landmark, see vol. iii, pp. 228–231, ante.—Ed. the road for one and 3/4 miles decends the hill and continues down a branch. N. 20 W. 7 Ms. over several hills and hollows along the foot of the mountain hights passing five small rivulets running to the wright.1 1 The "rivulets running to the wright" were affluents of Dearborn River—the nearest route to the Missouri. Lewis, however, struck north for the upper waters of the Medicine or Sun River, in order to secure buffalo skins for the expedition.—Ed. saw some sighn of buffaloe early this morning in the valley where we encamped last evening from which it appears that the buffaloe do sometimes penetrate these mountains a few miles. we saw no buffaloe this evening. but much old appearance of dung, tracks &amp;c. encamped on a small run under the foot of the mountain, after we encamped Drewyer killed two beaver and shot a third which bit his knee very badly and escaped 32 July 8th. 1806. Set out at 6 A. M. N. 25 W. 3 1/2 M. to the top of a hill from whence we saw the Shishequaw mountain about 8 M. distant, immediately before us. passed torrant (Dearborns's) river at 3 M. this stream comes from the S. W. out of the mountains which are about 5 Ms. to our left. the bed of the river is about 100 yds. wide tho' the water occupys only about 30 yds. it appears to spread over it's bottoms at certain seasons of the year and runs a mear torrant tearing up the trees by the roots which stand in it's bottom hense the name we have given it. the Shishiquaw mountain is a high insulated conic mountain standing several miles in advance of the Eastern range of the rocky mountains. Country broken and mountainous to our wright. North 14 1/2 Ms. through an open plain to Shishequaw Creek 20 yds wide bottoms and considerable quantity of timber it leaves the mountain to the S. E. and enters the mountains.1 1 The Shishequaw mountain is designated as the Heart, on the Stevens map; now called Haystack Butte. It stands between two forks of the South Fork of Medicine (or Sun) River. This South Fork is Lewis's Shishequaw Creek, which he left the Indian trail to reach, and followed down to its union with the main Sun River.—Ed. we struck it about 10 miles below the mountain which boar S. 32 W. from us. the road continued along the foot of the mountain to the West of north which not being anything like our course and the country becoming tolerably level at the commencement of this course we steered through the plains leaving the road with a view to strike Medicine river and hunt down it to it's mouth in order to procure the necessary skins to make geer, and meat for the three men whom we mean to leave at the falls as none of them are hunters. we halted and dined on Shishequaw Creek R. Fields killed a fine buck and a goat; Josp. Fields saw two buffaloe below us some distance which are the first that have been seen. we saw a great number of deer goats and wolves as we passed through the plains this morning but no Elk or buffaloe. saw some barking squirrils much rejoiced at finding ourselves in the plains of the Missouri which abound with game. N. 50. E. 2 M. to the discharge of Shishequaw Creek into the Medicine River through an extensive beautifull and level bottom. N. 85° E. 8. M. to our encampment of this evening on a large island. the bottoms continue leve[l] low and extensive plains level and not very elivated particularly on the N. E. side of the river. the land of neither the plains nor bottoms is fertile. it is of a light colour intermixed with a considerable proportion of gravel the grass generally about 9 inghes high. the hunters were unsuccessful this evening. I killed a very large and the whitest woolf I have seen. 28 July 9th 1806. Set out early and had not proceeded far before it began to rain. the air extreemly cold. halted a few minutes in some old lodges untill it c[e]ased to rain in some measure. we then proceeded and it rained without intermission wet us to the skin. N. 80° E. 4 M. through a handsome level wide bottom in which there is a considerable quan[ti]ty of narrow leafed cottonwood timber. the river is generally about 80 yds. wide rapid yet I think it might be navigated. it's bed is loose gravel and pebbles. the banks low but seldom overflow. water clear. S. 85 E. 4. Ms. Still on the S.W. side of the river through wide and level bottoms some timber. Joseph feilds killed a very fat buffaloe bull and we halted to dine.1 1 Near the west border of Fort Shaw Military Reservation.—Ed. we took the best of the meat as much as we could possibly carry on our horses. the day continuing rainy and cold I concluded to remain all day. we feasted on the buffaloe. saw a number of deer wolves and antelopes. killed two deer. July 10th 1806. Set out early and continued down the S. W. bank of the river. N 75 E 24 M. to our encampment in a grove of cottonwood timber. the latter part of this course for 7 Miles there is no timber in the river bottom, the other parts of the river possesses bottoms of the wide leafed cottonwood. much the greater part of the bottom is untimbered. the bottoms are wide and level the high praries or plains are also beautiful level and smooth. great quantities of prickly pear of two kinds on the plains. the ground is renderd so miry by the rain which fell yesterday that it is excessively fatiegueing to the horses to travel. we came 10 miles and halted for dinner the wind blowing down the river in the fore part of the day was unfavourable to the hunters. they saw several gangs of Elk but they having the wind of them ran off. in the evening the wind set from the West and we fell in with a few elk of which R. Fields and myself killed 3 one of which swam the river and fell on the opposit [side] so we therefore lost it's skin I sent the packhorses on with Sergt. Gass directing them to halt and encamp at the first timber which proved to be about 7 Ms. I retained frazier to assist in skining the Elk. we wer[e] about this time joined by drawer. a large brown bear swam the river near where we were and Drewyer shot and killed it. by the time we butchered the[s]e 2 elk and bar it was near dark we loaded our horses with the best of the meat and pursued the party and found them encamped as they had been directed in the first timber. we did not reach them until 9 P.M. they informed us that they had seen a very large bear in the plains which had pursued Sergt. Gass and Thomson some distance but their horses enabled them to keep out of it's reach. they were affraid to fire on the bear least their horses should throw them as they were unaccustomed to the gun. we killed five deer 3 Elk and a bear to day saw vast herds of buffaloe in the evening below us on the river. we he[a]red them bellowing about us all night. vast assemblages of wolves. saw a large herd of Elk making down the river. passed a considerable rapid in medicine river after dark. the river about a hundred yards wide is deep and in many parts rappid and today has been much crouded with islands. from our encampment1 1 The encampment was on the south bank of Sun River, below entrance of Big Muddy Creek from the north. All this region must have been familiar to Lewis and his party, from explorations during their sojourn on White Bear Island, near the mouth of Sun River, June 20–July 13, 1805.—Ed. down we know the river and there is no rapids and scarcely any courant. goosberries are very abundant of the common red kind and are begining to ripen. no currants on this river. both species of the prickly pears just in blume. July 11th 1806. the morning was fair and the plains looked beatifull the grass much improved by the late rain. the air was pleasant and a vast assemblage of little birds which croud to the groves on the river sung most enchantingly. we set out early. I sent the hunters down Medicine river to hunt Elk and proceeded with the party across the plain to the white bear Islands which I found to be 8 Ms. distant my course S. 75 E. through a level beautifull and extensive high plain covered with immence hirds of buffaloe. it is now the season at which the buffaloe begin to coppelate and the bulls keep a tremendious roaring we could hear them for many miles and there are such numbers of them that there is one continual roar. our horses had not been acquainted with the buffaloe they appeared much allarmed at their appearance and bellowing. when I arrived in sight of the white-bear Islands the missouri bottoms on both sides of the river were crouded with buffaloe I sincerely beleif that there were not less than 10 thousand buffaloe within a circle of 2 miles arround that place. I met with the hunters at a little grove of timber opposite to the island where they had killed a cow and were waiting our arrival. they had met with no elk. I directed the hunters to kill some buffaloe as well for the benifit of their skins to enable us to pass the river as for their meat for the men I meant to leave at this place. we unloaded our horses and encamped opposite to the Islands. had the cow skined, and some willows sticks collected to make canoes of the hides by 12 OCk. they killed eleven buffaloe most of them in fine order. the bulls are now generally much fatter than the cows and are fine beef. I sent out all hands with the horses to assist in but[c]hering and bringing in the meat by 3 in the evening. we had brought in a large quantity of fine beef and as many hides as we wanted for canoes shelters and geer. I then set all hands to prepare two canoes the one we made after the mandan fassion with a single skin in the form of a bason and the other we constructed of two skins on a plan of our own. we were unable to compleat our canoes this evening. the wind blew very hard. we continued our operations untill dark and then retired to rest. I intend giving my horses a couple of days rest at this place and deposit all my baggage which is not necessary to my voyage up medicine river.1 1 Apparently a lapsus calami for Maria's River.—Ed. July 12th. 1806. We arrose early and resumed our operations in compleating our canoes which we completed by 10 A. M. about this time two of the men whom I had dispatched this morning in quest of the horses returned with seven of them only. the remaining ten of our best horses were absent and not to be found. I fear that they are stolen. I dispatch[ed] two men on horseback in surch of them. the wind blew so violently that 1 did not think it prudent to attempt passing the river. at Noon Werner returned having found three others of the horses near Fort Mountain Sergt. Gass did not return untill 3 P.M. not having found the horses. he had been about 8 ms. up Medecine river. I now dispatched Joseph Fields and Drewyer in quest of them the former returned at dark unsuccessfull and the latter con tinued absent all night. at 5 P.M. the wind abated and we transported our baggage and meat to the opposite shore in our canoes which we found answered even beyond our expectations. we swam our horses over also and encamped at sunset. Musquetoes extreemly troublesome. I think the river is somewhat higher than when we were here last summer. the present season has been much more moist than the preceeding one. the grass and weeds are much more luxouriant than they were when I left this place on the 13th of July 1805. saw the brown thrush, pigeons, doves &amp;c. the yellow Currants begining to ripen. 13th July. removed above to my old station opposite the upper point of the white bear island. formed our camp and set Thompson etc at work to complete the geer for the horses. had the cash opened found my bearskins entirly destroyed by the water, the river having risen so high that the water had penitrated. all my specimens of plants also lost. the Chart of the Missouri fortunately escaped. opened my trunks and boxes and exposed the articles to dry. found my papers damp and several articles damp. the stoper had come out of a phial of laudinum and the contents had run into the drawer and distroyed a gre[a]t part of my medicine in such manner that it was past recovery. waited very impatiently for the return of Drewyer he did not arrive. Musquetoes excessively troublesome insomuch that without the protection of my musquetoe bier I should have found it impossible to wright a moment. the buffaloe are leaving us fast and passing on to the S. East. killed a buffaloe pecker [picker] a beatifull bird.1 1 The cowbird, or cow-blackbird (Molothrus ater), which alights on the backs of cattle, to pick the ticks from their hides.—Ed. 14th July. Had the carriage wheels dug up. found them in good order. the iron frame of the boat had not suffered materially. had the meat cut thiner and exposed to dry in the sun. and some roots of cows of which I have yet a small stock pounded into meal for my journey. I find the fat buffaloe meat a great improvement to the mush of these roots. the old cash being too damp to venture to deposit my trunks &amp;c. in I sent them over to the Large island and had them put on a high scaffold among some thick brush and covered with skins. I take this precaution lest some indians may visit the men I leave here before the arrival of the main party and rob them. the hunters killed a couple of wolves, the buffaloe have almost entirely disappeared. saw the bee martin. the wolves are in great numbers howling arround us and loling about in the plains in view at the distance of two or three hundred yards. I counted 27 about the carcase of a buffaloe which lies in the water at the upper point of the large island. these are generally of the large kind. Drewyer did not return this evening. 15 July 1806. Sent McNeal down this morning to the lower part of the portage to see whether the large perogue and cash were safe. Drewyer returned without the horses and reported that he had tracked them to beyond our camp of the1 1 Codex La ends here, unfinished. A memorandum written by Clark says: "A part of M. L. notes to Come into the book No. 12—the 4th. July." We resume Lewis's record as given in Codex L, at p. 99.—Ed. Tuesday July 15th. 1806. Dispatched McNeal early this morning to the lower part of portage in order to learn whether the Cash and white perogue remained untouched or in what state they were. the men employed in drying the meat, dressing deerskins and preparing for the reception of the canoes. at 1.P.M. Drewyer returned without the horses and reported that after a diligent surch of 2 days he had discovered where the horses had passed Dearborn's river at which place there were 15 lodges that had been abandoned about the time our horses were taken; he pursued the tracks of a number of horses from these lodges to the road which we had traveled over the mountains which they struck about 3 ms. South of our encampment of the 7th. inst. and had pursued this road Westwardly; I have no doubt but they are a party of the Tushapahs who have been on a buffaloe hunt. Drewyer informed that there camp was in a small bottom on the river of about 5 acres inclosed by the steep and rocky and lofty clifts of the river and that so closely had they kept themselves and horses within this little spot that there was not a track to be seen of them within a quarter of a mile of that place. every spire of grass was eaten up by their horses near their camp which had the appearance of their having remained here some time. his horse being much fatiegued with the ride he had given him and finding that the indians had at least 2 days the start of him thought it best to return. his safe return has releived me from great anxiety. I had already settled it in my mind that a white-bear had killed him and should have set out tomorrow in surch of him, and if I could not find him to continue my rout to Maria's river. I knew that if he met with a bear in the plains even he would attack him. and that if any accedent should happen to seperate him from his horse in that situation the chances in favour of his being killed would be as 9 to 10. I felt so perfectly satisfyed that he had returned in safety that I thought but little of the horses although they were seven of the best I had. this loss great as it is, is not intirely irreparable, or at least dose not defeat my design of exploring Maria's river. I have yet 10 horses remaining, two of the best and two of the worst of which I leave to assist the party in taking the canoes and baggage over the portage and take the remaining 6 with me; these are but indifferent horses most of them but I hope they may answer our purposes. I shall leave three of my intended party, (viz) Gass, Frazier and Werner, and take the two Feildses and Drewyer. by having two spare horses we can releive those we ride. having made this arrangement I gave orders for an early departure in the morning, indeed I should have set out instantly but McNeal road one of the horses which I intend to take and has not yet returned. a little before dark McNeal returned with his musquet broken off at the breach, and informed me that on his arrival at willow run [on the portage] he had approached a white bear within ten feet without discover[ing] him the bear being in the thick brush, the horse took the allarm and turning short threw him immediately under the bear; this animal raised himself on his hinder feet for battle, and gave him time to recover from his fall which he did in an instant and with his clubbed musquet he struck the bear over the head and cut him with the guard of the gun and broke off the breech, the bear stunned with the stroke fell to the ground and began to scratch his head with his feet; this gave McNeal time to climb a willow tree which was near at hand and thus fortunately made his escape. the bear waited at the foot of the tree untill late in the evening before he left him, when McNeal ventured down and caught his horse which had by this time strayed off to the distance of 2 Ms. and returned to camp. these bear are a most tremenduous animal; it seems that the hand of providence has been most wonderfully in our favor with rispect to them, or some of us would long since have fallen a sacrifice to their farosity. there seems to be a sertain fatality attatched to the neighbourhood of these falls, for there is always a chapter of accedents prepared for us during our residence at them. the musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist; for my own part I am confined by them to my bier at least 3/4ths of my time. my dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them, they are almost insupportable, they are so numerous that we frequently get them in our thr[o]ats as we breath. Wednesday July 16th. 1806. I dispatched a man early this morning to drive up the horses as usual, he returned at 8 A. M. with one of them only. allarmed at this occurrence I dispatched one of my best hands on horseback in surch of them he returned at 10 A.M. with them and I immediately set out. sent Drewyer and R. Fields with the horses to the lower side of Medecine river, and proceeded myself with all our baggage and J. Fields down the missouri to the mouth of Medecine river in our canoe of buffaloe skins we were compelled to swim the horses above the whitebear island and again across medicine river as the Missouri is of great width below the mouth of that river. having arrived safely below Medicine river we immediately sadled our horses and proceeded down the river to the handsom fall of 47 feet where I halted about 2 hours and took a haisty sketch of these falls; in the mean time we had some meat cooked and took dinner after which we proceeded to the grand falls where we arrived at sunset. on our way we saw two very large bear on the opposite side of the river. as we arrived in sight of the little wood below the falls we saw two other bear enter it; this being the only wood in the neighbourhood we were compelled of course to contend with the bear for possession, and therefore left our horses in a place of security and entered the wood which we surched in vain for the bear, they had fled. here we encamped and the evening having the appearance of rain made our beds and slept under a shelving rock. these falls have abated much of their grandure since I first arrived at them in June 1805, the water being much lower at prese[n]t than it was at that moment, however they are still a sublimely grand object. I determined to take a second drawing of it in the morning. we saw a few buffaloe as we passed today, the immence hirds which were about this place on our arrival have principally passed the river and directed their course downwards. we see a number of goats or antilopes always in passing through the plains of the Missouri above the Mandans. at this season they are thinly scattered over the plains but seem universally distributed in every part; they appear very inquisitive usually to learn what we are as we pass, and frequently accompany us at no great distance for miles, frequently halting and giving a loud whistle through their nostrils, they are a very pretty animal and astonishingly fleet and active. we spent this evening free from the torture of the Musquetoes. there are a great number of geese which usually raise their young above these falls about the entrance of Medicine river we saw them in large flocks of several hundred as we passed today. I saw both yesterday and today the Cookkoo or as it is sometimes called the rain craw. this bird is not met with west of the Rocky Mountains nor within them.1 1 Coccygus erythrophthalmus.—Coues. Thursday July 17th. 1806. I arrose early this morning and made a drawing of the falls. after which we took breakfast and departed. it being my design to strike Maria's river about the place at which I left it on my return to it's mouth in the begining of June 1805. I steered my course through the wide and level plains which have somewhat the appearance of an ocean, not a tree nor a shrub to be seen. the land is not fertile, at least far less so, than the plains of the Columbia or those lower down this river, it is a light colored soil intermixed with a considerable proportion of coarse gravel without sand, when dry it cracks and appears thursty and is very hard, in it's wet state, it is as soft and slipry as so much soft soap. the grass is naturally but short and at present has been rendered much more so by the graizing of the buffaloe, the whole face of the country as far as the eye can reach looks like a well shaved bowling green, in which immence and numerous herds of buffaloe were seen feeding attended by their scarcely less numerous sheepherds the wolves. we saw a number of goats as usual today, also the party coloured plover with the brick red head and neck; this bird remains about the little ponds which are distributed over the face of these plains and here raise their young. we killed a buffaloe cow as we passed throug[h] the plains and took the hump and tonge which furnish ample rations for four men one day. at 5 P. M. we arrived at rose [Tansy]1 1 The Teton, a tributary of Maria's River.—Ed. river where I purposed remaining all night as I could not reach maria's river this evening and unless I did there would be but little probability of our finding any wood and very probably no water either. on our arrival at the river we saw where a wounded and bleading buffaloe had just passed and concluded it was probable that the indians had been runing them and were near at hand. the Minnetares of Fort de prarie and the blackfoot indians rove through this quarter of the country and as they are a vicious lawless and reather an abandoned set of wretches I wish to avoid an interview with them if possible. I have no doubt but they would steel our horses if they have it in their power and finding us weak should they happen to be numerous wil most probably attempt to rob us of our arms and baggage; at all events I am determined to take every possible precaution to avoid them if possible. I hurried over the river to a thick wood and turned out the horses to graize; sent Drewyer to pursue and kill the wounded buffaloe in order to determine whether it had been wounded by the indians or not, and proceeded myself to reconnoitre the adjacent country having sent R. Fields for the same purpose a different rout. I ascended the river hills and by the help of my glass examined the plains but could make no discovery, in about an hour I returned to camp, where I met with the others who had been as unsuccessfull as myself. Drewyer could not find the wounded buffaloe. J. Fields whom I had left at camp had already roasted some of the buffaloe meat and we took dinner after which I sent Drewyer and R. Fields to resume their resurches for the Indians; and set myself down to record the transactions of the day. rose (Tansy) river is at this place fifty yards wide, the water which is only about 3 feet deep occupys about 35 yds. and is very terbid of a white colour. the general course of this river is from East to West so far as I can discover it's track through the plains, it's bottoms are wide and well timbered with cottonwood [of] both the broad and narrow leafed speceis. the bed of this stream is small gravel and mud; it's banks are low but never overflow, the hills are about 100 or 150 feet high; it possesses bluffs of earth like the lower part of the Missouri; except the debth and valocity of it's stream and it is the Missouri in miniture. from the size of rose river at this place and it's direction I have no doubt but it takes it's source within the first range of the Rocky mountains. the bush which bears the red berry is here in great plenty in the river bottoms Courses and distances July 17th. 1806.

We set out this morning a little before sunrise ascended the river hills and continued our rout as yesterday through the open plains at about 6 miles we reached the top of an elivated plain which divides the waters of the rose river from those of Maria's river.1 1 This watershed at its western end is now known as The Knee, and as Beque d'Otard at its eastern extremity.—Ed. from hence the North mountains, the South mountains, the falls mountains and the tower mountain and those arround and to the East of the latter were visible. our course led us nearly parrallel with a creek of Maria's river which takes it's rise in these high plains at the place we passed them; at noon we struck this creek about 6 ms. from its junction with Maria's river where we found some cottonwood timber; here we halted to dine and graize our horses.2 2 The present Antelope or Pondera Creek.—Ed. the bed of this creek is about 25 yds. wide at this place but is nearly dry at present, the water being confined to little pools in the deeper parts of it's bed. from hence downwards there is a considerable quantity of timber in it's bottom. we passed immence herds of buffaloe on our way in short for about 12 miles it appeared as one herd only the whole plains and vally of this creek being covered with them; saw a number of wolves of both speceis, also Antelopes and some horses. after dinner we proceeded about 5 miles across the plain to Maria's river where we arrived at 6 P. M. we killed a couple of buffaloe in the bottom of this river and encamped on it's west side in a grove of cottonwood some miles above the entrance of the creek. being now convinced that we were above the point to which I had formerly ascended this river and f[e]aring that a fork of this stream might fall in on the North side between this place and the point to which I had ascended it, I directed Drewyer who was with me on my former excurtion, and Joseph Fields to decend the river early in the morning to the place from whence I had returned, and examine whether any stream fell inn or not. I keep a strict lookout every night, I take my tour of watch with the men. Courses and distances of July 18th 1806. N. 25. W. 7.

E. they killed 8 deer and two Antelopes on their way; most of the deer were large fat mule bucks. having completed my observation of the sun's meridian Altitude we set out, ascended the river hills having passed the river and proceeded through the open plains up the N. side of the river 20 miles and encamped. at 15 miles we passed a large creek on N. side a little above it's entrance; there is but little running water in this creek at present, it's bed is about 30 yds. wide and appears to come from the broken Mountains. so called from their raggid and irregular shape there are three of them extending from east to West almost unconnected, the center mountain terminates in a conic spire and is that which I have called the tower mountain1 1 Now known as the Three Buttes, or Sweetgrass Hills. See vol. iii, p. 123, ante.—Ed. they are destitute of timber. from the entrance of this creek they bore N. 10°.

In this day's journey Lewis crossed the route of the Great Northern Railway branch line from Shelby Junction to Great Falls.—Ed. the bluffs of the river and creeks are steep and principally formed of earth, though there are sometimes thin stratas of freestone intermixed near the top of the bluffs. Ms. 2O Sunday July 20th. 1806. We set [out] at sunrise and proceed[ed] through the open plain as yesterday up the North side of the river. the plains are more broken than they were yesterday and have become more inferior in point of soil; a great quanty of small gravel is every where distributed over the surface of the earth which renders travling extreemly painfull to our bearfoot horses. the soil is generally a white or whiteish blue clay, this where it has been trodden by the buffaloe when wet has now become as firm as a brickbat and stands in an inumerable little points quite as formidable to our horses feet as the gravel. the mineral salts common to the plains of the missouri has been more abundant today than usual. the bluffs of the river are about 200 feet high, steep irregular and formed of earth which readily desolves with water, slips and precipitates itself into the river as before mentioned frequently of the bluffs of the Missouri below which they resemble in every particular, differing essencially from those of the Missouri above the entrance of this river, they being composed of firm red or yellow clay which dose not yield readily to the rains and a large quantity of rock. the soil of the river bottom is fertile and well timbered, I saw some trees today which would make small canoes. the tibmer is generally low. the underbrush the same as before mentioned. we have seen fewer buffaloe today than usual, though more Elk and not less wolves and Antelopes also some mule deer; this speceis of deer seems most prevalent in this quarter. saw some gees ducks and other birds common to the country. there is much appearance of beaver on this river, but not any of otter. from the apparent decent of the country to the North and above the broken mountains I am induced to beleive that the South branch of the Suskashawan receives a part of it's waters from the plain even to the borders of this river and from the brakes [breaks] visible in the plains in a no[r]thern direction think that a branch of that river decending from the rocky mountains passes at no great distance from Maria's river and to the N. E. of the broken mountains.1 1 Through the valley which Lewis saw, the Milk River runs, not a branch of the Saskatchewan.—Ed. the day has proved excessively warm and we lay by four hours during the heat of it; we traveled 28 miles and encamped as usual in the river bottom on it's N. side. there is scarcely any water at present in the plains and what there is, lies in small pools and is so strongly impregnated with the mineral salts that it is unfit for any purpose except the uce of the buffaloe. these animals appear to prefer this water to that of the river. the wild liquorice and sunflower are very abundant in the plains and river bottoms, the latter is now in full blume; the silk grass and sand rush are also common to the bottom lands. the musquetoes have not been troublesome to us since we left the whitebear islands. Courses and distances July 20th. 1806. S. 80°. W. 28 ms. with the river in it's course upwards to our encampment of this evening on it's N. side, river 120 yds. wide and deep, water appears to be but little diminis[h]ed, somewhat more transparent. passed a creek on S. side at 6 ms. also another 22 ms. on the N. side this last has no water some little timber, bed 15yds. wide. the general course of this river is very streight, and it meanders through a vally of about 1/2 a mile in width from side to side. Monday July 21st. 1806. We set out at sunrise and proceeded a short distance up the North side of the river; we found the ravines which made in on this side were so steep and numerous that we passed the river in doing which the pack horse which carried my instruments missed the ford and wet the instruments. this accident detained us about half an ho[u]r. I took the Instruments out wiped them and dryed their cases, they sustained no material injury. we continued on the S. side of the river about 3 miles when we again passed over to the N. side and took our course through the plains at some distance from the river. we saw a large herd of Elk this morning. the buffaloe still become more scarce, at 2 P. M. we struck a northern branch of Maria's river about 30 yds.. wide at the distance of about 8 miles from it's entrance. this stream is closely confined between clifts of freestone rocks the bottom narrow below us and above the rocks confine it on each side; some little timber below but not any above; the water of this stream is nearly clear. from the appearance of this rock and the apparent hight of the bed of the streem I am induced to beleive that there are falls in these rivers somewhere about their junction. being convinced that this stream came from the mountains I determined to pursue it as it will lead me to the most no[r]thern point to which the waters of Maria's river extend which I now fear will not be as far north as I wished and expected.1 1 The forks of the Maria are formed by Two Medicine River and Cut Bank Creek, both draining the Blackfoot Indian Reservation. The latter is the northern branch, up which Lewis took his route.—Ed. after dinner we set out up the North branch keeping on it's S. side; we pursued it untill dark and not finding any timber halted and made a fire of the dung of the buffaloe. we lay on the south side in a narrow bottom under a Clift. Our provision is nearly out, we wounded a buffaloe this evening but could not get him. Courses and distances July 21st. 1806. S. 80°.

Miles 28 Tuesday July 22ed. 1806. We set out very early this morning as usual and proceeded up the river. for the first seven miles of our travel this morning the country was broken the land poor and intermixed with a greater quantity of grave[l] than usual; the ravines were steep and numerous and our horses feet have become extreemly soar in traveling over the gravel we therefore traveled but slow. we met with a doe Elk which we wounded but did not get her. the river is confined closely between clifts of perpendicular rocks in most parts. after the distance of seven miles the country became more level les gravly and some bottoms to the river but not a particle of timber nor underbrush of any discription is to be seen, we continued up the river on it's South side for 17 miles when we halted to graize our horses and eat; there being no wood we were compelled to make our fire with the buffaloe dung which I found answered the purpose very well. we cooked and eat all the meat we had except a small peice of buffaloe meat which was a little tainted. after dinner we passed the river and took our course through a level and beautifull plain on the N. side. the country has now become level, the river bottoms wide and the adjoining plains but little elivated above them; the banks of the river are not usually more than from 3 to four feet yet it dose not appear ever to overflow them. we found no timber untill we had traveled 12 miles further when we arrived at a clump of large cottonwood trees in a beautifull and extensive bottom of the river about 10 miles below the foot of the rocky Mountains where this river enters them; as I could see from hence very distinctly where the river entered the mountains and the bearing of this point being S of West I thought it unnecessary to proceed further and therefore encamped resolving to rest ourselves and horses a couple of days at this place and take the necessary observations.1 1 This camp was at a point (approximately) in long. 113° W., and lat. 48° 40′ N. on the Cut Bank branch of the Maria, about in the centre of the present Blackfoot Indian Reservation, and eight or ten miles north of Blackfoot, a station on the Great Northern Railway. This railway goes through Maria's Pass, from which Maria's River flows.—O. D. Wheeler. this plain on which we are is very high; the rocky mountains to the S. W. of us appear but low from their base up yet are partially covered with snow nearly to their bases. there is no timber on those mountains within our view; they are very irregular and broken in their form and seem to be composed principally of clay with but little rock or stone. the river appears to possess at least double the vollume of water which it had where we first arrived on it below; this no doubt proceeds from the avapporation caused by the sun and air and the absorbing of the earth in it's passage through these open plains. The course of the mountains still continues from S. E. to N. W. the front rang[e] appears to terminate abrubtly about 35 ms. to the N. W. of us. I believe that the waters of the Suskashawan apporoach the borders of this river very nearly. I now have lost all hope of the waters of this river ever extending to N. Latitude 50°. though I still hope and think it more than probable that both white earth river and milk river extend as far north as latd. 50°. we have seen but few buffaloe today no deer and very few Antelopes; gam[e] of every discription is extreemly wild which induces me to beleive that the Indians are now, or have been lately in this neighbourhood. we wounded a buffaloe this evening but our horses were so much fatiegued that we were unable to pursue it with success.

Ms 28 Wednesday July 23rd. 1806. I dispatched Drewyer an[d] Joseph fields this morning to hunt. I directed Drewyer who went up the river to observe it's bearings and the point at which it entered the mountains, this he did and on his return I observed the point at which the river entered to bear S. 50° W. distant about ten miles the river making a considerable bend to the West just above us. both these hunters returned unsuccessful and reported that there was no game nor the appearance of any in this quarter. we now rendered the grease from our tainted meat and made some mush of cows with a part of it, reserving as much meal of cows and grease as would afford us one more meal tomorrow. Drewyer informed us that there was an Indian camp of eleven leather lodges which appeared to have been abandoned about 10 days, the poles only of the lodges remained, we are confident that these are the Minnetares of fort de prarie and suspect that they are probably at this time somewhere on the main branch of Maria's river on the borders of the buffaloe, under this impression I shall not strike that river on my return untill about the mouth of the North branch. near this place I observe a number of the whistleing squirrel of the speceis common to the plains and country watered by the Columbia river, this is the first instance in which I have found this squirrel in the plains of the Missouri. the Cottonwood of this place is also of the speceis common to the Columbia. we have a delightfull pasture for our horses where we are.

Musquetoes uncommonly large and reather troublesome. Thursday July 24th. 1806. At 8 A. M. the sun made it's appearance for a few minutes and I took it's altitude but it shortly after clouded up again and continued to rain the ballance of the day I was therefore unable to complete the observations I wished to take at this place. I determined to remain another day in the hope of it's being fair. we have still a little bread of cows remaining of which we made a kettle of mush which together with a few pigeons that we were fortunate enough to kill served us with food for this day. I sent the hunters out but they shortly returned without having killed anything and declared that it was useless to hunt within 6 or 8 miles of this place that there was no appearance of game within that distance. the air has become extreemly cold which in addition to the wind and rain renders our situation extreemly unpleasant. several wolves visited our camp today, I fired on and wounded one of them very badly. the small speceis of wolf barks like a dog, they frequently salute us with this note as we pass through the plains. Friday July 25th. 1806. The weather still continues cold cloudy and rainy, the wind also has blown all day with more than usual violence from the N. W. this morning we eat the last of our birds and cows, I therefore directed Drewyer and J. Fields to take a couple of the horses and proceed to the S. E. as far as the main branch of Maria's river which I expected was at no great distance and indeavour to kill some meat; they set out immediately and I remained in camp with R. Fields to avail myself of every opportunity to make my observations should any offer, but it continued to rain and I did not see the sun through the whole course of the day R. Fields and myself killed nine pige[ons] which lit in the trees near our camp on these we dined. late in the evening Drewyer and J. Fields returned the former had killed a fine buck on which we now fared sumptuously. they informed me that it was about 10 miles to the main branch of Maria's River, that the vally formed by the river in that quarter was wide extensive and level with a considerable quantity of timber; here they found some wintering camps of the natives and a great number of others of a more recent date or that had from appearance been evacuated about 6 weeks; we consider ourselves extreemly fortunate in not having met with these people. I determined that if tomorrow continued cloudy to set out as I now begin to be apprehensive that I shall not reach the United States within this season unless I make every exertion in my power which I shall certainly not omit when once I leave this place which I shall do with much reluctance without having obtained the necessary data to establish it's longitude as if the fates were against me my chronometer from some unknown cause stoped today, when I set her to going she went as usual. Saturday July 26th. 1806. The mor[n]ing was cloudy and continued to rain as usual, tho' the cloud seemed somewhat thiner I therefore posponed seting out untill 9 A. M. in the hope that it would clear off but finding the contrary result I had the horses caught and we set out biding a lasting adieu to this place which I now call camp disappointment. I took my rout through the open plains S. E. 5 ms. passing a small creek at 2 ms. from the mountains when I changed my direction to S. 75 E. for 7 ms. further and struck a principal branch of Maria's river 65 yds. wide, not very deep, I passed this stream to it's south side and continued down it 2 ms. on the last mentioned course when another branch of nearly the same dignity formed a junction with it, coming from the S. W. this last is shallow and rappid; has the appearance of overflowing it's banks frequently and discharging vast torrants of water at certain seasons of the year.1 1 Leaving Camp Disappointment—the most northern point reached by the expedition —Lewis crossed Willow Creek, next the line of the Great Northern between Blackfoot and Carlow stations, and forded Two Medicine branch of the Maria, two miles above its junction with Badger Creek, which he calls the South Branch.—Ed. the beds of both these streams are pebbly particularly the S. branch. the water of the N. branch is very terbid while that of the S. branch is nearly clear notwithstanding the late rains. I passed the S. branch just above it's junction and continued down the river which runs a little to the N. of E. 1 ms. and halted to dine and graize our horses, here I found some Indian lodges which appeared to have been inhabited last winter in a large and fertile bottom well stocked with cottonwood timber. the rose honeysuckle and redberry bushes constitute the undergrowth there being but little willow in this quarter both these rivers abov their junction appeared to be well stocked with timber or comparatively so with other parts of this country. here it is that we find the three species of cottonwood which I have remarked in my voyage assembled together; that speceis common to the Columbia I have never before seen on the waters of the Missouri, also the narrow and broad leafed speceis. during our stay at this place R. Fields killed a buck a part of the flesh of which we took with us. we saw a few Antelopes some wolves and 2 of the smallest speceis of fox of a redish brown colour with the extremity of the tail black. it is about the size of the common domestic cat and burrows in the plains. after dinner I continued my rout down the river to the North of Ea[s]t about 3 Ms. when the hills puting in close on the S. side I determined to ascend them to the high plain which I did accordingly, keeping the Fieldes with me; Drewyer passed the river and kept down the vally of the river. I had intended to decend this river with it's course to it's junction with the fork which I had ascended and from thence have taken across the country obliquely to rose river and decend that stream to it's confluence with Maria's river. the country through which this portion of Maria's river passes to the fork which I ascended appears much more broken than that above and between this and the mountains. I had scarcely ascended the hills before I discovered to my left at the distance of a mile an assemblage of about 30 horses, I halted and used my spye glass by the help of which I discovered several indians on the top of an eminence just above them who appeared to be looking down towards the river I presumed at Drewyer. about half the horses were saddled. this was a very unpleasant sight, however I resolved to make the best of our situation and to approach them in a friendly manner. I directed J. Fields to display the flag which I had brought for that purpose and advanced slowly toward them, about this time they discovered us and appeared to run about in a very confused manner as if much allarmed, their attention had been previously so fixed on Drewyer that they did not discover us untill we had began to advance upon them, some of them decended the hill on which they were and drove their horses within shot of it's summit and again returned to the hight as if to wate our arrival or to defend themselves. I calculated on their number being nearly or quite equal to that of their horses, that our runing would invite pursuit as it would convince them that we were their enimies and our horses were so indifferent that we could not hope to make our escape by flight; added to this Drewyer was seperated from us and I feared that his not being apprized of the indians in the event of our attempting to escape he would most probably fall a sacrefice. under these considerations I still advanced towards them; when we had arrived within a quarter of a mile of them,1 1 The place where Lewis encountered the Indians was on the south side of Two Medicine River, about four miles below the mouth of Badger Creek, on the eastern edge of the Blackfoot Reservation.—Ed. one of them mounted his horse and rode full speed towards us, which when I discovered I halted and alighted from my horse; he came within a hundred paces halted looked at us and turned his horse about and returned as briskly to his party as he had advanced; while he halted near us I held out my hand and becconed to him to approach but he paid no attention to my overtures. on his return to his party they all decended the hill and mounted their horses and advanced towards us leaving their horses behind them, we also advanced to meet them. I counted eight of them but still supposed that there were others concealed as there were several other horses saddled. I told the two men with me that I apprehended that these were the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie and from their known character I expected that we were to have some difficulty with them; that if they thought themselves sufficiently strong I was convinced they would attempt to rob us in which case be their numbers what they would I should resist to the last extremity prefering death to that of being deprived of my papers instruments and gun and desired that they would form the same resolution and be allert and on their guard. when we arrived within a hundred yards of each other the Indians except one halted I directed the two men with me to do the same and advanced singly to meet the indian with whom I shook hands and passed on to those in his rear, as he did also to the two men in my rear; we now all assembled and alighted from our horses; the Indians soon asked to smoke with us, but I told them that the man whom they had seen pass down the river had my pipe and we could not smoke untill he joined us. I requested as they had seen which way he went that they would one of them go with one of my men in surch of him, this they readily concented to and a young man set out with R. Fields in surch of Drewyer. I now asked them by sighns if they were the Minnetares of the North which they answered in the affermative; I asked if there was any cheif among them and they pointed out 3 I did not believe them however I thought it best to please them and gave to one a medal to a second a flag and to the third a handkerchief, with which they appeared well satisfyed. they appeared much agitated with our first interview from which they had scarcely yet recovered, in fact I beleive they were more allarmed at this accedental interview than we were. from no more of them appearing I now concluded they were only eight in number and became much better satisfyed with our situation as I was convinced that we could mannage that number should they attempt any hostile measures. as it was growing late in the evening I proposed that we should remove to the nearest part of the river and encamp together, I told them that I was glad to see them and had a great deel to say to them. we mounted our horses and rode towards the river which was at but a short distance, on our way we were joined by Drewyer Fields and the indian. we decended a very steep bluff about 250 feet high to the river where there was a small bottom of nearly 1/2 a mile in length and about 250 yards wide in the widest part, the river washed the bluffs both above and below us and through it's course in this part is very deep; the bluffs are so steep that there are but few places where they could be ascended, and are broken in several places by deep nitches which extend back from the river several hundred yards, their bluffs being so steep that it is impossible to ascend them; in this bottom there stand t[h]ree solitary trees near one of which the indians formed a large simicircular camp of dressed buffaloe skins and invited us to partake of their shelter which Drewyer and myself accepted and the Fieldses lay near the fire in front of the she[l]ter. with the assistance of Drewyer I had much conversation with these people in the course of the evening. I learned from them that they were a part of a large band which lay encamped at present near the foot of the rocky mountains on the main branch of Maria's river one 1/2 days march from our present encampment; that there was a whiteman with their band; that there was another large band of their nation hunting buffaloe near the broken mountains and were on there way to the mouth of Maria's river where they would probably be in the course of a few days. they also informed us that from hence to the establishment where they trade on the Suskasawan river is only 6 days easy march or such as they usually travel with their women and childred[n] which may be estimated at about 150 ms. that from these traders they obtain arm[s] amunition sperituous liquor blankets &amp;c. in exchange for wolves and some beaver skins. I told these people that I had come a great way from the East up the large river which runs towards the rising sun, that I had been to the great waters where the sun sets and had seen a great many nations all of whom I had invited to come and trade with me on the rivers on this side of the mountains, that I had found most of them at war with their neighbours and had succeeded in restoring peace among them, that I was now on my way home and had left my party at the falls of the missouri with orders to decend that river to the entrance of Maria's river and there wait my arrival and that I had come in surch of them in order to prevail on them to be at peace with their neighbours particularly those on the West side of the mountains and to engage them to come and trade with me when the establishment is made at the entrance of this river to all which they readily gave their assent and declared it to be their wish to be at peace with the Tushepahs whom they said had killed a number of their relations lately and pointed to several of those present who had cut their hair1 1 As a sign of mourning.—Biddle (ii, p. 354). as an evidince of the truth of what they had asserted. I found them extreemly fond of smoking and plyed them with the pipe untill late at night. I told them that if they intended to do as I wished them they would send some of their young men to their band with an invitation to their chiefs and warriors to bring the whiteman with them and come down and council with me at the entrance of Maria's river and that the ballance of them would accompany me to that place, where I was anxious now to meet my men as I had been absent from them some time and knew that they would be uneasy untill they saw me. that if they would go with me I would give them 10 horses and some tobacco. to this; proposition they made no reply, I took the first watch, tonight and set up untill half after" eleven; the indians by this time were all asleep, I roused up R. Fields and laid down myself; I directed Fields to watch the movements of the indians and if any of them left the camp to awake us all as I apprehended they would attampt to s[t]eal our horses. this being done I feel into a profound sleep and did not wake untill the noise of the men and indians awoke me a little after light in the morning. July 27th. 1806. Sunday. This morning at daylight the indians got up and crouded around the fire, J. Fields who was on post had carelessly laid his gun down behi[n]d him near where his brother was sleeping, one of the indians the fellow to whom I had given the medal last evening sliped behind him and took his gun and that of his brother unperceived by him, at the same instant two others advanced and seized the guns of Drewyer and myself, J. Fields seeing this turned about to look for his gun and saw the fellow just runing off with her and his brother's he called to his brother who instantly jumped up and pursued the indian with him whom they overtook at the distance of 50 or 60 paces from the camp s[e]ized their guns and rested them from him and R. Fields as he seized his gun stabed the indian to the heart with his knife the fellow ran about 15 steps and fell dead; of this I did not know untill afterwards,1 1 For the Indian tradition of the encounter here described, see Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clark, ii, pp. 311–314. The name of the first man killed was Side Hill Calf. The long-continued hostility of the Blackfeet to the whites has often been attributed to this incident. But Chittenden (History of American Fur Trade, p. 714) declares that Manuel Lisa found that the Indians of that tribe justified the action of Lewis, and were inclined to be friendly to the whites. The real cause of the Blackfeet enmity was the appearance of white trappers in the ranks of their enemies, the Crows, in a battle which occurred in 1807. It is noteworthy that Drouillard (Drewyer) finally lost his life in a contest with the Blackfeet.—Ed. having recovered their guns they ran back instantly to the camp; Drewyer who was awake saw the indian take hold of his gun and instantly jumped up and s[e]ized her and rested her from him but the indian still retained his pouch, his jumping up and crying damn you let go my gun awakened me I jumped up and asked what was the matter which I quickly learned when I saw drewyer in a scuffle with the indian for his gun. I reached to seize my gun but found her gone, I then drew a pistol from my holster and terning myself about saw the indian making off with my gun I ran at him with my pistol and bid him lay down my gun which he was in the act of doing when the Fieldses returned and drew up their guns to shoot him which I forbid as he did not appear to be about to make any resistance or commit any offensive act, he droped the gun and walked slowly off, I picked her up instantly, Drewyer having about this time recovered his gun and pouch asked me if he might not kill the fellow which I also forbid as the indian did not appear to wish to kill us, as soon as they found us all in possession of our arms they ran and indeavored to drive off all the horses I now hollowed to the men and told them to fire on them if they attempted to drive off our horses, they accordingly pursued the main party who were dr[i]ving the horses up the river and I pursued the man who had taken my gun who with another was driving off a part of the horses which were to the left of the camp. I pursued them so closely that they could not take twelve of their own horses but continued to drive one of mine with some others; at the distance of three hundred paces they entered one of those steep nitches in the bluff with the horses before them being nearly out of breath I could pursue no further, If called to them as I had done several times before that I would shoot them if they did not give me my horse and raised my gun, one of them jumped behind a rock and spoke to the other who turned arround and stoped at the distance of 30 steps from me and I shot him through the belly, he fell to his knees and on his wright elbow from which position he partly raised himself up and fired at me, and turning himself about crawled in behind a rock which was a few feet from him. he overshot me, being bearheaded I felt the wind of his bullet very distinctly.' not having my shotpouch I could not reload my peice and as there were two of them behind good shelters from me I did not think it prudent to rush on them with my pistol which had I discharged I had not the means of reloading untill I reached camp; I therefore returned leasurly towards camp, on my way I met with Drewyer who having heared the report of the guns had returned in surch of me and left the Fieldes to pursue the indians, I desired him to haisten to the camp with me and assist in catching as many of the indian horses as were necessary and to call to the Fieldes if he could make them hear to come back that we still had a sufficient number of horses, this he did but they were too far to hear him. we reached the camp and began to catch the horses and saddle them and put on the packs, the reason I had not my pouch with me was that I had not time to return about 50 yards to camp after geting my gun before I was obliged to pursue the indians or suffer them to collect and drive off all the horses. we had caught and saddled the horses and began to arrange the packs when the Fieldses returned with four of our horses; we left one of our horses and took four of the best of those of the Indian's; while the men were preparing the horses I put four sheilds and two bows and quivers of arrows which had been left on the fire, with sundry other articles; they left all their baggage at our mercy. they had but 2 guns and one of them they left the others were armed with bows and arrows and eyedaggs. the gun we took with us. I also retook the flagg but left the medal about the neck of the dead man that they might be informed who we were. we took some of their buffaloe meat and set out ascending the bluffs by the same rout we had decended last evening leaving the ballance of nine of their horses which we did not want. the Fieldses told me that three of the indians whom they pursued swam the river one of them on my horse. and that two others ascended the hill and escaped from them with a part of their horses, two I had pursued into the nitch one lay dead near the camp and the eighth we could not account for but suppose that he ran off early in the contest, having ascended the hill we took our course through a beatifull level plain a little to the S. of East, my design was to hasten to the entrance of Maria's river as quick as possibly in the hope of meeting with the canoes and party at that place having no doubt but that they [the Indians] would pursue us with a large party and as there was a band near the broken mountains or probably between them and the mouth of that river we might expect them to receive inteligence from us and arrive at that place nearly as soon as we could, no time was therefore to be lost and we pushed our horses as hard as they would bear. at 8 miles we passed a large branch 40 yds. wide which I called battle river.1 1 Now Birch Creek, the largest southern tributary of the Big Medicine.—Ed. at 3 P. M. we arrived at rose river about 5 miles above where we had passed it as we went out, having traveled by my estimate compared with our former distances and cou[r]ses about 63 ms. here we halted an hour and a half took some refreshment and suffered our horses to graize; the day proved warm but the late rains had supplyed the little reservors in the plains with water and had put them in fine order for traveling, our whole rout so far was as level as a bowling green with but little stone and few prickly pears. after dinner we pursued the bottoms of rose river but finding [it] inconvenient to pass the river so often we again ascended the hills on the S. W. side and took the open plains; by dark we had traveled about 17 miles further, we now halted to rest ourselves and horses about 2 hours, we killed a buffaloe cow and took a small quantity of the meat. afte refreshing ourselves we again set out by moonlight and traveled leasurely, heavy thunderclouds lowered arround us on every quarter but that from which the moon gave us light. we continued to pass immence herds of buffaloe all night as we had done in the latter part of the day. we traveled untill 2 OCk in the morning having come by my estimate after dark about 20 ms. we now turned out our horses and laid ourselves down to rest in the plain very much fatiegued as may be readily conceived.1 1 The bivouac for this night was not far from the site of Fort Benton.—Ed. my indian horse carried me very well in short much better than my own would have done and leaves me with but little reason to complain of the robery. July 28th. 1806. Monday. The morning proved fair, I slept sound but fortunately awoke as day appeared, I awaked the men and directed the horses to be saddled, I was so soar from my ride yesterday that I could scarcely stand, and the men complained of being in a similar situation however I encouraged them by telling them that our own lives as well as those of our friends and fellow travellers depended on our exertions at this moment; they were allert soon prepared the horses and we again resumed our march; the men proposed to pass the missouri at the grog spring where rose river approaches it so nearly and pass down on the S. W. side, to this I objected as it would delay us almost all day to reach the point2 2 The rendezvous at the mouth of Maria's River.—Ed. by this circuetous rout and would give the enemy time to surprise and cut off the party at the point if they had arrived there, I told them that we owed much to the safety of our friends and that we must wrisk our lives on this occasion, that I should proceed immediately to the point and if the party had not arrived that I would raft the missouri a small distance above, hide our baggage and march on foot up the river through the timber untill I met the canoes or joined them at the falls; I now told them that it was my determination that if we were attacked in the plains on our way to the point that the bridles of the horses should be tied together and we would stand and defend them, or sell our lives as dear as we could, we had proceeded about 12 miles on an East course when we found ourselves near the missouri; we heard a report which we took to be that of a gun but were not certain; still continuing down the N. E. bank of the missouri about 8 miles further, being then within five miles of the grog spring we heared the report of several rifles very distinctly on the river to our right, we quickly repared to this joyfull sound and on arriving at the bank of the river had the unspeakable satisfaction to see our canoes coming down. we hurried down from the bluff on which we were and joined them striped our horses and gave them a final discharge imbarking without loss of time with our baggage. I now learned that they had brought all things safe having sustaned no loss nor met with any accident of importance. Wiser had cut his leg badly with a knife and was unable in consequence to work we decended the river opposite to our principal cash which we proceeded to open after reconnoitering the adjacent country. we found that the cash had caved in and most of the articles burried therin were injured; I sustained the loss of two very large bear skins which I much regret; most of the fur and baggage belonging to the men were injured. the gunpowder corn flour poark and salt had sustained but little injury the parched meal was spoiled or nearly so. having no time to air these things which they much wanted we droped down to the point to take in the several articles which had been buried at that place in several small cashes; these we found in good order, and recovered every article except 3 traps. belonging to Drewyer which could not be found, here as good fortune would have it Sergt Gass1 1 Gass relates in his Journal (pp. 347–356) his progress from the Falls of the Missouri to Maria's River, during July 16–28. His account contains nothing of special interest. Gass and Willard went overland, with the horses; the rest of his party went down the Missouri in their canoes.—Ed. and Willard who brought the horses from the falls joined us at 1 P. M. I had ordered them to bring down the horses to this place in order to assist them in collecting meat which I had direceted them to kill and dry here for our voyage, presuming that they would have arrived with the perogue and canoes at this place several days before my return. having now nothing to detain us we passed over immediately to the island in the entrance of Maria's river to launch the red perogue, but found her so much decayed that it was impossible with the means we had to repare her and therefore mearly took the nails and other ironworks about her which might be of service to us and left her. we now reimbarked on board the white perog[u]e and five small canoes and decended the river about 15 m3 and encamped on the S. W. side near a few cottonwood trees, one of them being of the narrow leafed speceis and was the first of that kind which we had remarked on our passage up the river. we encamped late but having little meat I sent out a couple of hunters who soon returned with a sufficient quantity of the flesh of a fat cow. there are immence quantities of buffaloe and Elk about the junction of the Missouri and Maria's rivers. during the time we halted at the entrance of Maria's river we experienced a very heavy shower of rain and hail attended with violent thunder and lightning. Tuesday July 29th. 1806. Shortly after dark last evening a violent storm came on from N. W. attended with rain hail Thunder and lightning which continued the greater part of the night. no[t] having the means of making a shelter I lay in the water all night. the rain continued with but little intermission all day. I intend halting as soon as the weather proves fair in order to dry our baggage which much wants it. I placed the two Fieldses and Colter and Collins in the two smallest canoes with orders to hunt, and kill meat for the party and obtain as many Elk-skins as are necessary to cover our canoes and furnish us with shelters from the rain. we set out early and the currant being strong we proceeded with great rapidity. at 11 A. M. we passed that very interesting part of the Missouri where the natural walls appear, particularly discribed in my outward bound journey. we continued our rout untill late in the evening and encamped on the N. E. side of the river at the same place we had encamped on the 29th. of May 1805. on our way today we killed 9 bighorns of which I preserved the skins and skeletons of 2 females and one male; the flesh of this aninmal is extreemly delicate tender and well flavored; they are now in fine order. their flesh both in colour and flavor much resembles mutton though it is not so strong as our mutton. the eye is large and prominant, the puple of a pale sea green the iris of a light yellowish brown colour. these animals abound in this quarter keeping themselves principally confined to the steep clifts and bluffs of the river. we saw immence hirds of buffaloe in the high plains today on either hand of the river. saw but few Elk. the brown Curloo has left the plains I presume it has raised it's young and retired to some other climate and country. as I have been very particular in my discription of the country as I ascended this river I presume it is unnecesssesary here to add any-thing further on that subject. the river is now nearly as high as it has been this season and is so thick with mud and sand that it is with difficulty I can drink it. every little rivulet now discharges a torrant of water bringing down imme[n]ce boddies of mud sand and filth from the plains and broken bluffs. Wednesday July 30th. 1806. The rain still continued this morning it was therefore unnecessary to remain as we could not dry our baggage I consequently set out early as usual and pursued my rout downwards. the currant being strong and the men anxious to get on they plyed their oars faithfully and we went at the rate of about seven miles an hour. we halted several times in the course of the day to kill some bighorns being anxious to procure a few more skins and skeletons of this animal; I was fortunate enough to procure one other male and female for this purpose which I had prepared accordingly. seven others were killed by the party also 2 buffaloe [one Elk] 2 beaver with &amp; a female brown bear with tallons 6-1/4 inches in length. I preserved the skin of this bear also with the tallons; it was not large and in but low order. we arrived this evening at an island about 2 ms. above Goodriches Island and encamped on it's N. E. side. the rain continued with but little intermission all day; the air is cold and extreemly disagreeable. nothing extraordinary happened today. Thursday July 31st. 1806. The rain still continuing I set out early and proceeded on as fast as possible. at 9 A. M. we fell in with a large herd of Elk of which we killed 15 and took their skins. the bottoms in the latter part of the day became wider better timbered and abound in game. the party killed 14 deer in the course of the day without attempting to hunt but little for them. we also killed 2 bighorns and 1 beaver; saw but few buffaloe. the river is still rising and excessively muddy more so I think than I ever saw it. we experienced some very heavy showers of rain today. we have been passing high pine hills all day. late in the evening we came too on the N. E. side of the river and took she[l]ter in some indian lodges built of sticks, about 8 ms. below the entrance of North mountain creek. these lodges appeared to have been built in the course of the last winter. these lodges with the addition of some Elk skins afforded us a good shelter from the rain which continued to fall powerfully all night. I think it probable that the minnetares of Fort de Prarie visit this part of the river; we meet with their old lodges in every bottom. Friday August 1st. 1806. The rain still continuing I set out early as usual and proceeded on at a good rate. at 9. A. M. we saw a large brown bear swiming from an island to the main shore we pursued him and as he landed Drewyer and myself shot and killed him; we took him on board the perogue and continued our rout, at 11. A. M. we passed the entrance of Mussel shell river. at 1 in the evening we arrived at a bottom on S. W. side where there were several spacious Indian lodges built of sticks and an excellent landing. as the rain still continued with but little intermission and appearances seemed unfavorable to it's becomeing fair shortly, I determined to halt at this place at least for this evening and indeavour to dry my skins of the bighorn which had every appearance of spoiling, an event which I would not should happen on any consideration as we have now passed the country in which they are found and I therefore could not supply the deficiency were I to loose these I have. I halted at this place being about 15 ms. below Missel shell river, had fires built in the lodges and my skins exposed to dry. shortly after we landed the rain ceased tho' it still continued cloudy all the evening. a white bear came within 50 paces of our camp before we perceived it; it stood erect on it's hinder feet and looked at us with much apparent unconsern, we seized our guns which are always by us and several of us fired at it and killed it. it was a female in fine order, we fleesed it and extracted several gallons of oil. this speceis of bear are nearly as poor at this season of the year as the common black bear nor are they ever as fat as the black bear is found in winter; as they feed principally on flesh, like the wolf, they are most fatt when they can procure a sufficiency of food without rispect to the season of the year. the oil of this bear is much harder than that of the black bear being nearly as much so as the lard of a hog. the flesh is by no means as agreeable as that of the black bear, or Yahkah or partycoloured bear of the West side of the rocky mountains, on our way to-day we killed a buck Elk in fine order the skins and a part of the flesh of which we preserved. after encamping this evening the hunters killed 4 deer and a beaver. The Elk are now in fine order particularly the males. their horns have obtained their full growth but have not yet shed the velvet or skin which covers them. the does are found in large herds with their young and a few young bucks with them. the old bucks yet herd together in parties of two to 7 or 8. Saturday August 2nd 1806. The morning proved fair and I determined to remain all day and dry the baggage and give the men an opportunity to dry and air their skins and furr. had the powder parched meal and every article which wanted drying exposed to the sun. the day proved warm fair and favourable for our purpose. I permitted the Fieldses to go on a few miles to hunt. by evening we had dryed our baggage and repacked it in readiness to load and set out early in the morning. the river fell 18 inches since yesterday evening. the hunters killed several deer in the course of the day. nothing remarkable took place today. we are all extreemly anxious to reach the entrance of the Yellowstone river where we expect to join Capt. Clark and party. Sunday August 3rd. 1806. I arrose early this morning and had the perogue and canoes loaded and set out at half after 6 A. M. we soon passed the canoe of Colter and Collins who were on shore hunting, the men hailed them but received no answer we proceeded, and shortly after overtook J. and R. Fields who had killed 25 deer since they left us yesterday; deer are very abundant in the timbered bottoms of the river and extreemly gentle. we did not halt today to cook and dine as usual having directed that in future the party should cook as much meat in the evening after encamping as would be sufficient to serve them the next day; by this means we forward our journey at least 12 or 15 miles Pr. day. we saw but few buffaloe in the course of this day, tho' a great number of Elk, deer, wolves, some bear, beaver, geese a few ducks, the party coloured co[r]vus [magpie], one Callamet Eagle, a number of bald Eagles, red headed woodpeckers &amp;c. we encamped this evening on N. E. side of the river 2 ms. above our encampment of the 12th. of May 1805. soon after we encamp[ed] Drewyer killed a fat doe. the Fieldses arrived at dark with the flesh of two fine bucks, besides which they had killed two does since we passed them making in all 29 deer since yesterday morning. Collins and Colter did not overtake us this evening. Monday August 4th. 1806. Set out at 4 A. M. this morning. permited Willard and Sergt. Ordway to exchange with the Fieldses and take their small canoe to hunt today. at 1/2 after eleven O'Ck. passed the entrance of big dry river; found the water in this river about 60 yds. wide tho' shallow. it runs with a boald even current. at 3 P. M. we arrived at the entrance of Milk river where we halted a few minutes. this stream is full at present and it's water is much the colour of that of the Missouri; it affords as much water at present as Maria's river and I have no doubt extends itself to a considerable distance North. during our halt we killed a very large rattlesnake of the speceis common to our country. it had 176 scutæ on the abdomen and 25 on the tail, it's length 5 feet, the scutæ on the tail folly formed. after passing this river we saw several large herds of buffaloe and Elk we killed one of each of these animals and took as much of the flesh as we wished. we encamped this evening two miles below the gulph on the N. E. side of the river. Tonight for the first time this season I heard the small whippoorwill or goatsucker of the Missouri cry. Colter and Collins have not yet overtaken us. Ordway and Willard delayed so much time in hunting today that they did not overtake us untill about midnight. they killed one bear and 2 deer. in passing a bend just below the gulph it being dark they were drawn by the currant in among a parsel of sawyers, under one of which the canoe was driven and throwed Willard who was steering overboard; he caught the sawyer and held by it; Ordway with the canoe drifted down about half a mile among the sawyers under a falling bank, the canoe struck frequently but did not overset; he at length gained the shore and returned by land to learn the fate of Willard whom he found was yet on the sawyer; it was impossible for him to take the canoe to his relief. Willard at length tied a couple of sticks together which had lodged against the sawyers on which he was and set himself adrift among the sawyers which he fortunately escaped and was taken up about a mile below by Ordway with the canoe; they sustained no loss on this occasion. it was fortunate for Willard that he could swim tolerably well. Tuesday August 5th. 1806. Colter and Collins not having arrived induced me to remain this morning for them. the hunters killed four deer this morning near our encampment. I remained untill noon when I again reimbarked and set out concluding that as Colter and Collins had not arrived by that time that they had passed us after dark the night of the 3rd. inst. as Sergt. Ordway informed me he should have done last evening had not the centinel hailed him. we continued our rout untill late in the evening when I came too and encamped on the South side about 10 miles below little dry river. on our way we killed a fat cow and took as much of the flesh as was necessary for us. The Fieldses killed 2 large bear this evening one of them measured nine feet from the extremity of the nose to that of his tail, this is the largest bear except one that I have seen. we saw several bear today as we passed but did not kill any of them. we also saw on our way immence herds of buffaloe &amp; Elk, many deer Antelopes, wolves, geese Eagles &amp;c. but few ducks or prarie hens. the geese cannot fly at present; I saw a solitary Pillacon [pelican] the other day in the same situation, this happens from their sheding or casting the f[e]athers of the wings at this season. Wednesday August 6th. 1806. A little after dark last evening a violent storm arrose to the N. E. and shortly after came on attended with violent Thunder lightning and some hail; the rain fell in a mere torrant and the wind blew so violently that it was with difficulty I could have the small canoes unloaded before they filled with water; they sustained no injury. our situation was open and exposed to the storm. in attending to the canoes I got wet to the skin and having no shelter on land I betook myself to the orning of the perogue which I had, formed of Elkskin, here I obtained a few hours of broken rest; the wind and rain continued almost all night and the air became very cold. we set out early this morning and decended the river about 10 miles below Porcupine river when the wind became so violent that I laid by untill 4 P. M. the wind then abaiting in some measure we again resumed our voyage, and decended the river about 5 miles below our encampment of the 1st. of May 1805 where we halted for the night on the S. W. side of the river. after halting we killed three fat cows and a buck. we had previously killed today 4 deer a buck Elk and a fat cow. in short game is so abundant and gentle that we kill it when we please. the Feildses went on ahead this evening and we did not overtake them. we saw several bear in the course of the day. Thursday August 7th. 1806. It began to rain about midnight and continued with but little intermission until 10 A. M. today. the air was cold and extreemly unpleasant. we set out early resolving if possible to reach the Yelowstone river today which was at the distance of 83 ms. from our encampment of the last evening; the currant favoured our progress being more rapid than yesterday, the men plyed their oars faithfully and we went at a good rate. at 8 A. M. we passed the entrance of Marthy's river which has changed it's entrance since we passed it last year, falling in at preasent about a quarter of a mile lower down. at or just below the entrance of this river we meet with the first appearance of Coal birnt hills and pumicestone, these appearances seem to be coextensive. here it is also that we find the first Elm and dwarf cedar on the bluffs, the ash first appears in the instance of one solletary tree at the Ash rapid, about the Elk rapid and from thence down we occasionally meet with it scattered through the bottoms but it is generally small. from Marthy's river to Milk river on the N. E. side there is a most beautifull level plain country; the soil is much more fertile here than above. we overtook the Fieldses at noon. they had killed 2 bear and seen 6 others, we saw and fired on two from our perogue but killed neither of them. these bear resort the river where they lie in wate at the crossing places of the game for the Elk and weak cattle; when they procure a subject of either they lie by the carcase and keep the wolves off untill they devour it. the bear appear to be very abundant on this part of the river. we saw a number of buffaloe Elk &amp;c. as we passed but did not detain to kill any of them. we also saw an unusual flight of white gulls about the size of a pigeon with the top of their heads black.1 1 Coues says these were terns, probably Sterna forsteri.—Ed. at 4 P. M. we arrived at the entrance of the Yellowstone river. I landed at the point and found that Capt. Clark had been encamped at this place and from appearances had left it about 7 or 8 days. I found a paper on a pole at the point which mearly contained my name in the hand wrighting of Capt. C. we also found the remnant of a note which had been attatched to a peace of Elk'shorns in the camp; from this fragment I learned that game was scarce at the point and musquetoes troublesome which were the reasons given for his going on; I also learnt that he intended halting a few miles below where he intended waiting my arrival.2 2 We discovered nothing to inform us where he was gone, except a few words written or traced in the sand, which were "W. C. a few miles farther down on the right-hand side."—Gass (p. 360). I now wrote a note directed to Colter and Collins provided they were behind, ordering them to come on without loss of time; this note I wraped in leather and attatched to the same pole which Capt. C. had planted at the point; this being done I instantly reimbarked and decended the river in the hope of reaching Capt. C's camp before night. about 7 miles below the point on the S. W. shore I saw some meat that had been lately fleased and hung on a pole; I directed Sergt. Ordway to go on shore [and] examine the place; on his return he reported that he saw the tracks of two men which appeared so resent that he beleived they had been there today, the fire he found at the plce was blaizing and appeared to have been mended up afresh or within the course of an hour past. he found at this place a part of a Chinnook hat which my men recognized as the hat of Gibson; from these circumstances we concluded that Capt. C's camp could not be distant and pursued our rout untill dark with the hope of reaching his camp in this however we were disappointed and night coming on compelled us to encamp on the N. E. shore in the next bottom above our encampment of the 23rd. and 24th. of April 1805. as we came too a herd of buffaloe assembled on the shore of which we killed a fat cow. Friday August 8th. 1806. Beleiving from the recent appearances about the fire which we past last evening that Capt. Clark could be at no great distance below I set out early; the wind heard [hard] from the N. E. but by the force of the oars and currant we traveled at a good rate untill 10 A. M. by which time we reached the center of the beaver bends about 8 ms. by water and 3 by land above the entrance of White earth river.1 1 See Clark's remark about the great number of beaver at this point, vol. ii, p. 331, ante,—Ed. not finding Capt. Clark I knew not what calculation to make with rispect to his halting and therefore determined to proceed as tho' he was not before me and leave the rest to the chapter of accedents. at this place I found a good beach for the purpose of drawing out the perogue and one of the canoes which wanted corking and reparing. the men with me have not had leasure since we left the West side of the Rocky mountains to dress any skins or make themselves cloaths and most of them are therefore extreemly bare. I therefore determined to halt at this place untill the perog[u]e and canoe could be repared and the men dress skins and make themselves the necessary cloathing. we encamped on the N. E. side of the river; we found the Musquetoes extreemly troublesome but in this rispect there is but little choise of camps from hence down to St. Louis, from this place to the little Missouri there is an abundance of game I shall therefore when I leave this place travel at my leasure and avail myself of every opportunity to collect and dry meat untill I provide a sufficient quantity for our voyage not knowing what provision Capt. C. has made in this rispect. I formed a camp unloaded the canoes and perogue, had the latter and one of the canoes drawn out to dry, fleased what meat we had collected and hung it on poles in the sun, after which the men busied themselves in dressing skins and making themselves cloaths. Drewyer killed 2. Elk and a deer this evening, the air is cold yet the Musquetoes continue to be troublesome.2 2 Here ends the journal as contained in Codex L, and the following words appear in Clark's writing, "a Suplt. to come in here." This refers to the fragment (written by Lewis) which forms Codex Lb; it continues the journal for four days (through Aug. 12), and was the last journalizing by Lewis.—Ed. Saturday August 9th. 1806. The day proved fair and favourable for our purposes, the men were all engaged dressing skins and making themselves cloathes except R. &amp; J. Fields whom I sent this morning over the river with orders to proceed to the entrance of the White earth river in surch of Capt. C. and to hunt and kill Elk or buffaloe should they find any convenient to the river, in the evening these men returned and informed me that they saw no appearance of Capt. Clark or party, they found no game nor was there a buffaloe to be seen in the plains as far as the eye could reach. nothing remarkable took place in the course of the day. Colter and Collins have not yet overtaken us I fear some missfortune has happened them for their previous fidelity and orderly deportment induces me to beleive that they would not thus intentionally delay, the Perogue is not yet sufficiently dry for reparing. we have no pitch and will therefore be compelled to use coal and tallow. Sunday August 10th. 1806. The morning was somewhat cloudy I therefore apprehended rain however it shortly after became fair. I hastened the repairs which were necessary to the perogue and canoe which were compleated by 2 P. M. those not engaged about this business employed themselves as yesterday, at 4 in the evening it clouded up and began to rain which puting a stop to the opperation of skindressing we had nothing further to detain us, I therefore directed the vessels to be loaded and at 5 P. M. got under way the wind has blown very hard all day but did not prove so much so this evening as absolutely to detain us. we decended this evening as low nearly as the entrance of white-Earth river and encamped on the S.W. side, the musquetoes more than usually troublesome this evening. Monday August 11th. 1806. We set out very early this morning, it being my wish to arrive at the birnt hills by noon in order to take the latitude of that place as it is the most northern point of the Missouri, I enformed the party of ray design and requested that they would exert themselves to reach the place in time as it would save us the delay of nearly one day; being as anxious to get forward as I was they plyed their oars faithfully and we proceeded rapidly. I had instructed the small [c]anoes that if they saw any game on the river to halt and kill it and follow on; however we saw but little game untill about 9 A.M. when we came up with a buffaloe swiming the river which I shot and killed; leaving the small canoes to dress it and bring on the meat I proceeded, we had gone but little way before I saw a very large grizzly bear and put too in order to kill it, but it took wind of us and ran off. the small canoes overtook us and informed that the flesh of the buffaloe was unfit for uce and that they had therefore left it. half after n A.M. we saw a large herd of Elk on the N. E. shore and I directed the men in the small canoes to halt and kill some of them and continued on in the perogue to the birnt hills; when I arrived here it was about 20 minutes after noon and of course the observation for the ?'s meridian Altitude was lost. jus[t] opposite to the birnt hills there happened to be a herd of Elk on a thick willow bar and finding that my observation was lost for the present I determined to land and kill some of them accordingly we put too and I went out with Cruzatte only. we fired on the Elk I killed one and he wounded another, we reloaded our guns and took different routs through the thick willows in pursuit of the Elk; I was in the act of firing on the Elk a second time when a ball struck my left thye about an inch below my hip joint, missing the bone it passed through the left thye and cut the thickness of the bullet across the hinder part of the right thye; the stroke was very severe; I instantly supposed that Cruzatte had shot me in mistake for an Elk as I was dressed in brown leather and he cannot see very well; under this impression I called out to him damn you, you have shot me, and looked towards the place from whence the ball had come, seeing nothing I called Cruzatte several times as loud as I could but received no answer; I was now preswaded that it was an Indian that had shot me as the report of the gun did not appear to be more than 40 paces from me and Cruzatte appeared to be out of hearing of me; in this situation not knowing how many indians there might be concealed in the bushes I thought best to make good my retreat to the perogue, calling out as I ran for the first hundred paces as loud as I could to Cruzatte to retreat that there were indians hoping to allarm him in time to make his escape also; I still retained the charge in my gun which I was about to discharge at the moment the ball struck me. when I arrived in sight of the perogue I called the men to their arms to which they flew in an instant, I told them that I was wounded but I hoped not mortally, by an indian I beleived and directed them to follow me that I would return &amp; give them battle and releive Cruzatte if possible who I feared had fallen into their hands; the men followed me as they were bid and I returned about a hundred paces when my wounds became so painfull and my thye so stiff that I could scarcely get on; in short I was compelled to halt and ordered the men to proceed and if they found themselves overpowered by numbers to retreat in order keeping up a fire. I now got back to the perogue as well as I could and prepared my self with a pistol my rifle and air-gun being determined as a retreat was impracticable to sell my life as deerly as possible. in this state of anxiety and suspense I remained about 20 minutes when the party returned with Cruzatte and reported that there were no indians nor the appearance of any; Cruzatte seemed much allarmed and declared if he had shot me it was not his intention, that he had shot an Elk in the willows after he left or seperated from me. I asked him whether he did not hear me when I called to him so frequently which he absolutely denied. I do not beleive that the fellow did it intentionally but after finding that he had shot me was anxious to conceal his knowledge of having done so. the ball had lodged in my breeches which I knew to be the ball of the short rifles such as that he had, and there being no person out with me but him and no indians that we could discover I have no doubt in my own mind of his having shot me. with the assistance of Sergt. Gass I took off my cloaths and dressed my wounds myself as well as I could, introducing tents of patent lint into the ball holes, the wounds blead considerably but I was hapy to find that it had touched neither bone nor artery. I sent the men to dress the two Elk which Cruzatte and myself had killed which they did in a few minutes and brought the meat to the river. the small canoes came up shortly after with the flesh of one Elk. my wounds being so situated that I could not without infinite pain make an observation I determined to relinquish it and proceeded on. we came within eight miles of our encampment of the 15th. of April 1805 and encamped on N. E. side. as it was painfull to me to be removed I slept on board the perogue; the pain I experienced excited a high fever and I had a very uncomfortable night. at 4 P. M. we passed an encampment which had been evacuated this morning by Capt. Clark, here I found a note from Capt. C. informing me that he had left a letter for me at the entrance of the Yelow stone river, but that Sergt. Pryor who had passed that place since he left it had taken the letter; that Sergt. Pryor having been robed of all his horses had decended the Yelowstone river in skin canoes and had overtaken him at this encampment. this I fear puts an end to our prospects of obtaining the Sioux Cheifs to accompany us as we have not now leasure to send and engage Mr. Heney on this service, or at least he would not have time to engage them to go as early as it is absolutely necessary we should decend the river. Tuesday August 12th. 1806. Being anxious to overtake Capt. Clark who from the appearance of his camps could be at no great distance before me, we set out early and proceeded with all possible expedition at 8 A. M. the bowsman informed me that there was a canoe and a camp he beleived of whitemen on the N.E. shore. I directed the perogue and canoes to come too at this place and found it to be the camp of two hunters from the Illinois by name Joseph Dickson and Forest Hancock.1 1 These men, whom Clark met the previous day, were the first whites, save their own party, which the explorers had seen since the winter at Fort Mandan, Joseph Dickson was a native of Pennsylvania, who emigrated to St. Clair County, Illinois, in 1802. Several years later he removed to Sangamon County, where he was one of the earliest settlers. His death occurred in 1844 at Franklin, Ill. His son, Capt. Joseph Dickson, commanded a company of scouts in the Black Hawk War (1832), and was a pioneer of Platteville, Grant County, Wis. See Wis. Hist. Colls., v, pp. 3I5–317—Ed. these men informed me that Capt. C. had passed them about noon the day before. they also informed me that they had left the Illinois in the summer [of] 1804 since which time they had been ascended the Missouri, hunting and traping beaver; that they had been robed by the indians and the former wounded last winter by the Tetons of the birnt woods; that they had hitherto been unsuccessfull in their voyage having as yet caught but little beaver, but were still determined to proceed. I gave them a short discription of the Missouri, a list of distances to the most conspicuous streams and remarkable places on the river above and pointed out to them the places where the beaver most abounded. I also gave them a file and a couple of pounds of powder with some lead. these were articles which they assured me they were in great want of. I remained with these men an hour and a half when I took leave of them and proceeded. while I halted with these men Colter and Collins who seperated from us on the 3rd i[n]st rejoined us. they were well no accedent having happened. they informed me that after proceeding the first day and not overtaking us that they had concluded that we were behind and had delayed several days in waiting for us and had thus been unable to join us untill the present mome[n]t. my wounds felt very stiff and soar this morning but gave me no considerable pain. there was much less inflamation than I had reason to apprehend there would be. I had last evening applyed a poltice of peruvian barks. at 1 P. M. I overtook Capt. Clark and party and had the pleasure of finding them all well. as wrighting in my present situation is extreemly painfull to me I shall desist untill I recover and leave to my fri[e]nd Capt. C. the continuation of our journal. however I must notice a singular Cherry which is found on the Missouri in the bottom lands about the beaver bends and some little distance below the white earth river, this production is not very abundant even in the small tract of country to which it seems to be confined. the stem is compound erect and subdivided or branching without any regular order it rises to the hight of eight or ten feet seldom puting up more than one stem from the same root not growing in cops as the Choke Cherry dose. the bark is smooth and of a dark brown colour. the leaf is peteolate, oval accutely pointed at it's apex, from one and a 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches in length and from 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in width, finely or minutely serrate, pale green and free from pubessence. the fruit is a globular berry about the size of a buck-shot of a fine scarlet red; like the cherries cultivated in the U' States each is supported by a seperate celindric flexable branch peduncle which issue from the extremities of the boughs the peduncle of this cherry swells as it approaches the fruit being largest at the point of insertion. the pulp of this fruit is of an agreeable ascid flavour and is now ripe. the style and stigma are permanent. I have never seen it in blume.1 1 Here ends Codex Lb, the last of Lewis's journalizing, save his description of the Yellowstone which we insert in the ensuing chapter, under date of August 3. A line at the end of the page, in clark's handwriting, reads: "To be anexed to Book No. 12. at the last." We now return to Codex M in order to take up Clark's record of his separate journey in another direction (p. 48, date July 3).—Ed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter XXXI CLARK'S EXPLORATION OF THE YELLOWSTONE Clark's Journal, July 3–August 12, 1806 Entry by Lewis, August 3 [Clark:] Thursday July 3rd. 1806 WE colected our horses and after brackfast I took My leave of Capt. Lewis and the indians and at 8 A M Set out with [blank space in MS.]1 1 Clark was accompanied by twenty men, besides the Indian woman and her child.—Ed. Men interpreter Shabono &amp; his wife &amp; child (as an interpreter &amp; interpretes[s] for the Crow Inds. and the latter for the Shoshoni) with (50) horses. we proceeded on through the Vally of Clarks river on the West Side of the [river] nearly South 18 Miles and halted on the upper side of a large Creek, haveing Crossed 8 Streams 4 of which weres Small. this vally is from 10 to 15 Ms. in width tolerably leavel and partially timberd. with long leaf &amp; pitch pine, some cotton wood, Birch, and sweet willow on the borders of the streams. I observed 2 Species of Clover in this vally one the white clover common in the Western parts of the U. States, the other species which is much smaller than either the red or white both it's leaf &amp; blossom the horses are excessively fond of this Species. after letting our horses graze a Sufficient length of time to fill themselves, and taking dinner of venison we again resumed our journey up the Vally which we found more boutifully versified with small open plains covered with a great variety of Sweet cented plants, flowers &amp; grass. this evening we crossed 10 Streams 8 of which were large Creeks which comes roleing their currents with Velocity into the river. those Creeks take their rise in the mountains to the West which mountains is at this time covered with Snow for about 1/5 of the way from their tops downwards.1 1 The Bitter Root Mountains, from which numbers of creeks flow into the river of the same name, up whose valley Clark was now passing.—Ed. Some Snow is also to be Seen on the high points and hollows of the Mountains to the East of us. our course this evening was nearly South 18 Ms. makeing a total of 36 miles today. we encamped on the N. Side of a large Creek2 2 The town of Corvallis is about opposite this encampment.—Ed. where we found tolerable food for our horses. Labeish killed a Deer this evening. We saw great numbers of deer and 1 bear today. I also observed the burr[ow]ing Squirel of the Species common about the quawmarsh flatts West of the Rocky Mountains. Musquetors very troublesom. one man Jo: Potts very unwell this evening owing to rideing a hard trotting horse; I give him a pill of Opiom which soon releve[d] him. Friday July 4th. 1806 I order three hunters to Set out early this morning to hunt &amp; kill some meat, and by 7 A. M. we collected our horses took brackfast and Set out proceeded on up the Vally on the West Side of Clarks river crossing three large deep and rapid Creeks, and two of a smaller size to a small branch in the Spurs of the mountain and dined. the last Creek or river which we pass'd was so deep and the water so rapid that several of the horses were sweped down some distance and the Water run over several others which wet several articles. after crossing this little river, I observed in the road the tracks of two men whome I prosume is of the Shoshone nation. our hunters joined us with 2 deer in tolerable order. on the side of the Hill near the place we dined saw a gange of Ibex or big horn Animals I shot at them running and missed. This being the day of the decleration of Independence of the United States and a Day commonly scelebrated by my Country I had every disposition to selebrate this day and therefore halted early and partook of a Sumptious Dinner of a fat Saddle of Venison and Mush of Cows (roots) after Dinner we proceeded on about one mile to a very large Creek which we assended some distance to find a foard to cross. in crossing this creek several articles got wet, the water was so strong, alto' the debth was not much above the horses belly, the water passed over the backs and loads of the horses. those Creeks are emensely rapid has great decnt (descent). the bottoms of the Creek as well as the low lands on each side is thickly covered with large stone. after passing this Creek I inclined to the left and fell into the road on which we had passed down last fall near the place we had dined on the 7th. of Sept. and continued on the road passing up on the W. side of Clarks river 13 Miles to the West fork1 1 It has heretofore been assumed that the expedition on its outward journey passed down the east bank of Bitter Root River. This remark would indicate that the Indian route forded that river once or twice in its upper course. The West Fork is the Nez Percé, which unites with East Fork to form the Bitter Root.—Ed. of Sd. river and Encamped on an arm of the same I Sent out 2 men to hunt, and 3 in Serch of a foard to pass the river. at dark they all returned and reported that they had found a place that the river might be passed but with some risque of the loads getting wet I order them to get up their horses and accompany me to those places &amp;c. our hunters killed 4 deer to day. we made 30 Ms. to day on a course nearly South Vally from 8 to 10 Ms. wide, contains a good portion of Pitch pine. we passed three large deep rapid Creeks this after noon Satturday July 5th. 1806 I rose at day light this morning despatched Labeach after a Buck which he killed late last evening; and I [went] with the three men who I had Sent in serch of a ford across the West fork of Clarks river, and examined each ford neither of them I thought would answer to pass the fork without wetting all the loads. near one of those places pointed out by Colter I found a practiable foard and returned to camp, ordered every thing packed up and after Brackfast we set out passed 5 chanels of the river which is divided by small Islands in passing the 6th. &amp; last chanel Colter['s] horse swam and with some dificuelty he made the Opposite Shore, Shannon took a different derection from Colter rained his horse up the stream and passed over very well I derected all to follow Shannon and pass quartering up the river which they done and passed over tolerably well the water running over the back of the 2 smaller horses only. unfortunately my trunk &amp; portmantue containing Sea otter Skins flags some curosites &amp; necessary articles in them got wet, also an esortment of Medicine, and my roots, about 1 mile [further] we struck the East fork which had fallen and was not higher than when we passed it last fall. we had not proceeded up this fork more than 1 mile cer we struck the road by which we passed down last fall and kept it at one mile we crossed the river at a very good foard and continued up on the East Side to the foot of the Mountain nearly opposite flour Cr[e]ek &amp; halted to let our horses graze and dry our wet articles. I saw fresh sign of 2 horses and a fire burning on the side of the road. I prosume that those indians are spies from the Shoshones. Shannon &amp; Crusat killed each a deer this morning and J. Shields killed a female Ibex or bighorn on the side of the Mountain, this Animal was very meager. Shannon left his tomahawk at the place he killed his deer. I derect him to return for it and join me in the Vally on the East side of this mountain. gave Shields permission to proceed on over to the 1st Vally and there hunt untill my arival this evening at that place, after drying every article which detained us untill 1/2 past 4 P.M. we packed up and crossed the Mountain into the vally [where] we first met with the flatheads here I overtook Shields he had not killed anything. I crossed the river which heads in a high peecked mountain covered with Snow N.E. of the Vally at about 20 Miles. (See note) Shields informed me that the Flat head indians passed up the small creek which we came down last fall about 2 miles above our Encampment of the 4h. &amp; 5th. of Sept. I proceeded up this South branch 2 Miles and encamped on the E. side of the Creek, and sent out several men to examine the road. Shields returned at dark and informed me that the best road turned up the hill from the creek 3 Miles higher up, and appeared to be a plain beaten parth. as this rout of the Oat-lash-shoots can be followed it will evidently shorten our rout at least 2 days and as the indians informed me last fall [it is] a much better rout than the one we came out. at all events I am deturmined to make the attempt and follow their trail if possible if I can prosue it my rout will be nearer and much better than the one we came from the Shoshones, &amp; if I should not be able to follow their road; our rout can't possibly be much wors. The hunters killed two deer this evening. The after part of the day we only come 8 miles makeing a total of 20 Miles. Shannon came up about sunset haveing found his tomahawk. Sunday 6th. July 1806 Some frost this morning the last night was so cold that I could not sleep. we collected our horses which were much scattered which detained us untill 9 A.M. at which time we set out and proceeded up the creek on which we camped 3 Miles and left the road which we came on last fall to our right and assended a ridge with a gentle slope to the dividing mountain1 1 Having entered (the preceding day) the valley called Ross's Hole, Clark encamped for the night on Camp Creek, two miles north of the town of Lula; he now crossed the divide at Gibbons's Pass, whose slope is gentle compared with those of the Lolo Pass.—Ed. which Seperates the waters from (of) the Middle fork of Clarks river from those [blank space in MS.] (of Wisdom) and Lewis's river and passed over prosueing the rout of the Oatlashshute band which we met last fall to the head of (Glade Cr:) a branch of Wisdom R and down the said branch crossing it frequently2 2 Apparently the present Trail Creek, flowing incto the North Fork of Wisdom River.—Ed. on each Side of this [are] handsom glades in which I observe great quantities of quawmash just beginning to blume, on each side of those glades the timber is small and a great propotion of it Killed by the fires. I observe the appearance of old buffalow roads and some heads on this part of the mountain. (proving that formerly Buffs. roved there &amp; also that this is the best route, for the Buffs. and the Indians always have the best route &amp; here both were joined) The Snow appears to [be] lying in considerable masses on the mountain from which we decended on the 4th. of Sept. last. I observe great numbers of the whistleing squirel which burrows their holes scattered on each side of the glades through which we passed. Shields killed a hare of the large Mountain Species. the after part of the day we passed on the hill Side N of the Creek for 6 Ms. (down glade Cr) and entered an extensive open Leavel plain in which the Indian trail scattered in such a manner that we could not pursue it. the Indian woman wife to Shabono informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well that the creek which we decended was a branch of Wisdom river and when we assended the higher part of the plain we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction to the canoes, and when we arived at that gap we would see a high point of a mountain covered with snow in our direction to the canoes. we proceeded on 1 mile and Crossd. a large Creek from the right which heads in a snow Mountain and Fish Creek over which there was a road thro' a gap.1 1 The large creek from the right was the Pioneer, which heads upon the east side of the same range of the Rockies as Fish Creek does upon the west, and along whose course is a pass (now called the Big Hole) which Clark noted Sept. 2, 1805. See vol. iii, p. 50.—Ed. we assended a small rise and beheld an open beutifull Leavel Vally or plain of about 20 (15) Miles wide and near 60 (30) long extending N &amp; S. in every direction around which I could see high points of Mountains covered with snow. I discovered one at a distance very high covered with snow which bore S. 80°. E. The Squar pointed to the gap through which she said we must pass which was S. 56°. E she said we would pass the river before we reached the gap. we had not proceeded more than 2 Miles in the last Creek before a violent storm of wind arose accompand. with hard rain from the S W. imediately from off the Snow Mountains this rain was cold and lasted 1 1/2 hours. I discovd. the rain wind as it approached and halted and formd. a solid column to protect ourselves from the Violency of the gust. after it was over I proceeded on aboat 5 Miles to some small dry timber on a small Creek and encampd. made large fires and dryed our selves.1 1 Near the encampment for this night was fought the Battle of Big Hole, in the Nez Percé War, Aug. 9, 1877. The Indians under Chief Joseph escaped. A monument has been erected upon the battlefield.—Ed. here I observed some fresh Indian Signs where they had been gathering quawmash. (This is the great plain where Shoshonees gather quawmash &amp; cows &amp;c. our woman had done so. many beaver) Courses and distance &amp;c.

Miles   26 Monday 7th.. July 1806 This morning our horses were very much scattered; I sent out men in every direction in Serch of them they brought all except 9 by 6 oClock and informed me that they could not find those 9. I then ordered 6 men to take horses and go different directions and at a greater distance those men all returned by 10 A.M. and informed me that they had [made] circles in every direction to 6 or 8 Miles around Camp and could not see any signs of them. that they had reasons to believe that the indians had stolen them in the course of the night, and founded their reasons on the quallity of the horses, all being the most valuable horses we had, and Several of them so attached to horses of inferior quallity which we have they could not be seperated from each other when driveing with their loads on in the course of the day. I thought it probable that they might be stolen by some skulking shoshones, but as it was yet possible that they may have taken our back rout or rambled to a greater distance I deturmined to leave a small party and hunt for them to day, and proceed on with the main party and all the baggage to the canoes, raise them out of the water and expose them to the sun to dry by the time this party should overtake me. I left Sergt. Ordway, Shannon, Gibson Collins &amp; Labeech with directions to hunt this day for the horses without they should discover that the Inds. had taken them into the Mountains, and prosue our trail &amp;c. at 1/2 past 10 A.M. I set out and proceeded on through an open rich vally crossing four large Creeks with extensive low and mirey bottoms, and a small river keeping the course I had set out on S.56°.E. after crossing the river I kept up on ihe N E. side, sometimes following an old road which frequently disappeared, at the distance of 16 miles we arived at a Boiling Spring Situated about 100 paces from a large Easterly fork of the small river in a leavel open vally plain and nearly opposit &amp; E of the 3 forks of this little river which heads in the Snowey Mountains to the S E. &amp; S W of the Springs. this Spring (15 yds.. in circums. boils up all over bottom which is stoney) contains a very considerable quantity of water, and actually blubbers with heat for 20 paces below where it rises. it has every appearance of boiling, too hot for a man to endure his hand in it 3 seconds. I directd Sergt. Pryor and John Shields to put each a peice of meat in the water of different Sises. the one about the size of my 3 fingers cooked dun in 25 minits the other much thicker was 32 minits before it became sufficiently dun. this water boils up through some loose hard gritty Stone, a little sulferish. after takeing dinner and letting our horses graize 1 hour and a half we proceeded on Crossed this easterly branch and up on the N. side of this middle fork 9 miles crossed it near the head of an Easterly branch and passed through a gap of a mountain on the Easterly side of which we encamped near some butifull (Springs) which fall into Willards Creek.1 1 Apparently the expedition followed the South Fork of Wisdom River, crossing several of its tributaries until the divide was reached between the waters of Wisdom (Big Hole) and Jefferson (Beaverhead) Rivers. They came out upon the upper waters of Willard's (Grasshopper) Creek, somewhere northwest of the town of Bannack.—Ed. I directed that the rambling horses should be hobbled, and the Sentinal to examine the horses after the moon rose. emence beaver sign. Course distance &amp;c. July 7th. Miles S. 56°.

I now take my leave of this butifull extensive vally which I call the hot spring Vally, and behold one less extensive and much more rugid on Willards Creek for near 12 Miles in length, remarkable cold night Tuesday 8th.. July 1806 Our horses being scattered we were detained untill 8 A.M before we set out. we proceeded on down Willards Creek on the S.W. side about 11 miles near which the Creek passes through the mountain we then Steared S. 20°. E. to the West branch of Jeffersons river in Snake Indian cove2 2 To Shoshone Cove on Prairie Creek. The cache was at its mouth, at the two forks of Jefferson River.—Ed. about 7 Miles and halted two hours to let the horses graize. after dinner we proceeded on down the forke which is here but small 9 Miles to our encampment of 17 Augt. at which place we Sunk our Canoes &amp; buried some articles, as before mentioned the most of the Party with me being Chewers of Tobacco become so impatient to be chewing it that they scercely gave themselves time to take their saddles off their horses before they were off to the deposit. I found every article safe, except a little damp. I gave to each man who used tobacco about two feet off a part of a role took one third of the ballance myself and put up 2/3 in a box to send down with the most of the articles which had been left at this place, by the canoes to Capt. Lewis, as it was late nothing could be done with the canoes this evening. I examined them and found them all safe except one of the largest which had a large hole in one Side &amp; Split in bow. The country through which we passed to day was diversified high dry and uneaven Stoney open plains and low bottoms very boggy with high mountains on the tops and North sides of which there was Snow, great quantities of the Species of hysoop &amp; shrubs common to the Missouri plains are scattered in those Vallys and hill sides.

Shields killed an Antelope. Wednesday 9th. July 1806. rose early had the horses brought up. after which I had the canoes raised washed, brough[t] down and drawn up on shore to dry and repared. Set several men to work digging for the Tobacco Capt Lewis informed me he had buried in the place the lodge stood when we lay here last summer, they serched diligently without rinding anything. at 10 A M Sergt. Ordway and party arrived with the horses we had lost. he reported that he found those horses near the head of the Creek on which we encamped, makeing off as fast as they could and much scattered. nothing material took place with his party in their absence. I had the canoes repared men &amp; lodes appo[r]tioned ready to embark tomorrow morning. I also formd. the party to accomp[any] me to the river Rejhone [Rochejaune] from applicants and apportioned what little baggage I intended to carry as also the Spear horses. this day was windy and cold. The Squar brought me a Plant the root of which the nativs eat. this root resembles a carrot in form and Size and something of its colour, being of a pailer yellow than that of our carrot, the Stem and leaf is much like the common carrot, and the taste not unlike, it is a native of moist land. John Shields and Collins each killed a Deer this morning. the wind dried our canoes very much they will be sufficiently dry by tomorrow morning to Set out in them down the river. Thursday 10th. July 1806 last night was very cold and this morning everything was white with frost and the grass stiff frozend. I had some water exposed in a bason in which the ice was 3/4 of an inch thick this morning. I had all the Canoes put into the water and every article which was intended to be sent down put on board, and the horses collected and packed with what fiew articles I intend takeing with me to the River Rochejhone, and after brackfast we all Set out at the same time &amp; proceeded on Down Jeffersons river on the East Side through Sarviss (Service) Vally1 1 l An allusion to the quantity of service berries which were found in this valley on the outward journey.

I saw also on the sides of the rock in rattle snake mountain 15 big horn animals, those animals feed on the grass which grow on the Sides of the Mountn. and in the narrow bottoms on the Water courses near the Steep sides of the mountains on which they can make their escape from the pursute of wolves Bear &amp;c. at Meridian I halted to let the horses Graze haveing come 15 Miles. I ordered the (canoes) to land. Sergt. Ordway informed me that the party with him had come on very well, and he thought the canoes could go as farst as the horses &amp;c. as the river now become wider and not so sholl, I deturmined to put all the baggage &amp;c. which I intend takeing with me to the river Rochejhone in the canoes and proceed on down with them myself to the 3 forks or Madisons &amp; galletens rivers. leaveing the horses to be taken down by Sergt. Pryor and 6 of the men of the party to accompany me to the river Rochejhone and directed Sergt. Pryor to proceed on moderately and if possible encamp with us every night, after dinner had my baggage put on board and Set out, and proceeded on tolerable well to the head of the 3000 Mile Island on which we had encamped on the (11th) of Augt. last.1 1 See vol. ii, p. 332.—Ed. the canoes passed six of my encampments assending, opposit this island I encamped on the East side. the Musquetors were troublesom all day and untill one hour after Sunset when it became cool and they disappeared. in passing down in the course of this day we saw great numbers of beaver lying on the Shores in the Sun. wild young Gees and ducks are common in this river. we killed two young gees this evening. I saw several large rattle snakes in passing the rattle Snake Mountain they were fierce. Friday 11th July 1806 Sent on 4 of the best hunters in 2 canoes to proceed on a fiew miles a head and hunt untill I came up with them, after an early brackfast I proceeded on down a very crooked chanel, at 8 a.m I overtook one canoe with a Deer which Collins had killed, at Meridian passed Sergt. Pryors camp near a high point of land on the left side which the Shoshones call the beavers head. the wind rose and blew with great violence from the S W imediately off Some high mountains covered with Snow. the violence of this wind retarded our progress very much and the river being emencely crooked we had it imediately in our face nearly every bend. at 6 P M I passed Phalanthrophy river which I proceved was very low. the wind Shifted about to the N E. and bley[w] very hard tho' much wormer than the forepart of the day. at 7 P M I arrived at the Enterance of Wisdom River and Encampd. in the Spot we had encamped the (6th) of August last. here we found a Bayonet which had been left &amp; the canoe quite safe. I directed that all the nails be taken out of this canoe and paddles to be made of her sides &amp;c. here I came up with Gibson &amp; Colter whome I had sent on a head for the purpose of hunting this morning, they had killed a fat Buck and 5 young gees nearly grown. Wisdom river is very high and falling. I have Seen great Nos. of Beaver on the banks and in the water as I passed down to day, also some Deer and great numbers [of] young gees, Sandhill cranes &amp;c. &amp;c. Sgt. Pryor left a deer on the shore Saturday 12th. July 1806 Sergt. Pryor did not join me last night he has proceeded on down. the beaver was flacking (flapping their tails) in the river about us all the last night, this Morning I was detained untill 7 A M makeing Paddles and drawing the nails of the Canoe to be left at this place and the one we had before left here. after completing the paddles &amp;c. and takeing some Brackfast I set out the current I find much stronger below the forks than above and the river tolerably streight as low as Panther Creek1 1 See vol. ii, p. 304.—Ed. when it became much more crooked the Wind rose and blew hard off the Snowey mountains to the N. W. and renderd. it very difficuelt to keep the canoes from running against the Shore at 2 P. M. the canoe in which I was in was driven by a suden puff of wind under a log which projected over the water from the bank, and the man in the Stern Howard was caught in between the canoe and the log and a little hurt, after disingaging ourselves from this log the canoe was driven imediately under a drift which projected over and a little abov[e] the Water, here the canoe was very near turning over we with much exertion after takeing out some of the baggage hauled her out, and proceeded on without rece[i]ving any damage. the men in the other canoes Seeing our situation landed and come with as much Speed as possible through the briers and thick brush to our assistance. but from the thickness of the brush did not get up to our assistance untill we had got clear. at 3 P M we halted at the enterance of Fields Creek and dined here Willard and Collins over took us with two deer which they had killd. this morning, and by takeing a different side of an Island from which we came, we had passed them. after dinner I proceeded on and Encamped a little below our encampmt of the 31st. of July last. the Musquetoes very troublesom this evening. Some old buffalow Signs. I killed 4 young gees and Collins killed 2 bever this evening. Sunday 13th.. July 1806 Set out early this morning and preceded on very well to the enterance of Madicines river at our old Encampment of the 27th. July last at 12 [o'clock] where I found Sergt. Pryor and party with the horses, they had arived at this place one hour before us. his party had killed 6 deer &amp; a white bear. I had all the horses driven across Madicine &amp; gallitines rivers and halted to dine and let the horses feed imediately below the enterance of Gallitine. had all the baggage of the land party taken out of the canoes and after dinner the 6 canoes and the party of 10 men under the direction of Sergt. Ordway set out. previous to their departur[e] I gave instructions how they were to proceed &amp;c. I also wrote to Capt Lewis by Sergt. Ordway. My party now Consists of the following persons Viz: Sergeant N. Pryor, Jo. Shields, G. Shannon William Bratton, Labiech, Windsor, H. Hall, Gibson, Interpreter Shabono his wife &amp; child and my man york; with 49 horses and a colt. the horses feet are very sore and Several of them can scercely proceed on. at 5. P. M. I set out from the head of Missouri at the 3 forks, and proceeded on nearly East 4 miles and Encamped on the bank of Gallitines River which is a butifull navigable Stream.1 1 Opposite the site of the present town of Logan.—Ed. Saw a large Gange of Elk in the plains and Deer in the river bottoms. I also observe beaver and Several otter in galletines river as I passed along. Gibson killed an otter the fur of which was much longer and whiter than any which I had seen. Willard killed 2 deer this morning. all the meat I had put into the canoes except a sufficiency for supper. The country in the forks between Gallitins &amp; Madisens rivers is a butifull leavel plain covered with low grass. on the lower or N E. Side of Gallitins river the country rises gradually to the foot of a mountain which runs nearly parrelal. those plains are indefferant or the Soil of which is not very rich they are Stoney &amp; contain several stratas of white rock. the current of the river is rapid and near the mouth contains several islands, it is navigable for canoes. I saw several Antelope common Deer, wolves, beaver, otter, Eagles, hawks, crows, wild gees both old and young, does &amp;c. &amp;c. I observe Several leading roads which appear to pass to a gap of the mountain in a E. N E. direction about 18 or 20 miles distant. The indian woman who has been of great service to me as a pilot through this country recommends a gap in the mountain more south which I shall cross.1 1 The first pass noticed by Clark is the Bridger. Sacajawea recommended the Bozeman—the one chosen for the Northern Pacific Railway.—Ed. Monday 14th. July 1806 Sent Shields a head to kill a deer for our brackfast, and at an early hour set out with the party crossed Gallitines river which makes a considerable bend to the N. E. and proceeded on nearly S. 78°. E through an open Leavel plain at 6 Miles I struck the river and crossed a part of it and attempted to proceed on through the river bottoms which was several Miles wide at this place, I crossed several chanels of the river running through the bottom in defferent directions. I proceeded on about two miles crossing those defferent chanels all of which was damed with beaver in such a manner as to render the passage impracticable and after [being] swamped as I may say in this bottom of beaver, I was compelled to turn short about to the right and after some difficuelty made my way good to an open low but firm plain which was an Island and extended nearly the course I wished to proceed, here the squar informed me that there was a large road passing through the upper part of this low plain from Madicins river through the gap which I was Stearing my course to. I proceeded up this plain 4 miles and crossed the main chanel of the river, having passed through a skirt of cotton timber to an open low plain on the N E. side of the river and nooned it. the river is much divided and on all the small streams inoumerable quantities of beaver dams, tho' the river is yet navagable for canoes I overtook Shields soon after I set out; he had killed a large fat Buck. I saw Elk, deer &amp; Antelopes, and great deel of old signs of buffalow. their roads is in every direction. The Indian woman informs me that a fiew years ago Buffalow was very plenty in those plains &amp; Vallies quit[e] as high as the head of Jeffersons river, but fiew of them ever come into those vallys of late years owing to the Shoshones who are fearfull of passing in-to the plains West of the mountains and subsist on what game they can catch in the Mountains principally and the fish which they take in the E. fork of Lewis's river. Small parties of Shoshones do pass over to the plains for a few days at a time an[d] kill buffalow for their skins and dried meat, and return imediately into the Mountains, after Dinner we proceeded on a little to the South of East through an open leavel plain to the three forks of the E branch of Gallitines River at about 12 Miles, crossed the most Southerly of those forks and struck an old buffalow road (the one our Indn. woman meant) which I kept continuing nearly the same course up the middle fork crossed it and camped on a small branch of the middle fork on the N E. side at the commencement of the gap of the mountain1 1 When I first came to Bozeman in 1870, the main "buffalo road" crossed Sour Dough (or Bozeman) creek about half a mile above the cemetery and entered the foothills through a low depression through the bluff. It kept the foothills until it crossed the East Gallatin in a little more than two miles, opposite old Fort Ellis. It was very plain and deeply worn. Clark may have followed that all the way; but coming from the direction he did, I am inclined to think that he would not have crossed Sour Dough (the southerly branch of E. Gallatin River) so far south, but probably passed right across the present site of Bozeman, entering the main trail a little east of the crossing. This theory agrees well, I think, with the language of the journal.—Peter Koch (Bozeman, Mont.). Coues wrongly locates Clark's route through Rocky Cañon, where the Northern Pacific now runs. The trail ran over a low divide, and did not strike the route of the railroad until near the tunnel.—Ed. —the road leading up this branch, several other roads all old come in from the right &amp; left. emence quantities of beaver on this Fork quit[e] down, and their dams very much impeed the navigation of it from the 3 forks down, tho I beleive it practicable for small canoes by unloading at a fiew of the worst of those dams. Deer are plenty Shannon Shields and Sergt. Pryor each killed one which were very fat much more so than they are commonly at this Season of the year. The Main fork of Gallitins River turn South and enter the Mountains which are yet covered with Snow. Madicens river makes a Great bend to the East and enters the same mountain. a leavel plain between the two rivers below the mountain. Tuesday 15th July 1806 We collected our horses and after an early brackft. at 8 A M set out and proceeded up the branch to the head thence over a low gap in the mountain thence across the heads of the N E. branch of the (i. e., the Easterly) fork of Gallitins river which we camped near last night passing over a low dividing ridge to the head of a water course which runs into the Rochejhone, prosueing an old buffalow road which enlargenes by one which joins it from the most Easterly (Northerly) branch of the East fork of Galetine R. proceeding down the branch a little to the N. of East keeping on the North Side of the branch to the River rochejhone at which place I arrived at 2 P M.1 1 The expedition reached the Yellowstone not far from the site of the present town of Livingston, Mont., whence a spur of the Northern Pacific Railway runs to Yellowstone National Park.—Ed. The distance from the three forks of the Easterly fork of Galletines river (from whence it may be navigated down with small canoes) to the river Rochejhone is 18 Miles on an excellent high dry firm road with very inco[nsi]derable hills. from this river to the nearest part of the main fork of Gallitine is 29 miles mostly through a leavel plain, from the head of the Missouri at the 3 forks 48 miles through a leavel plain the most of the way as may be seen by the remarks.2 2 Wheeler says that Clark underestimates these distances.

S. 78°. E. 12 Miles to the most southerly of the three easterly branches of the Easterly fork of Galletines river. passed through an open leavel plain in which there is three small streams of water from the snow Mountains to the South. Great quantities of snow yet remains on the Mountains to the S.ESouth. S W.

Ms 48 in the evening after the usial delay of 3 hours to give the horses time to feed and rest and allowing ourselves time also to cook and eate Dinner, I proceeded on down the river on an old buffalow road at the distance of 9 miles below the Mountains Shield River1 1 Named for one of the party; it still retains that name.—Ed. discharges itself into the Rochejhone on it's N W. side above a high rocky Clift, this river is 35 yards wide deep and affords a great quantity of water it heads in those snowey Mountains to the N W with Howards Creek,2 2 See vol. ii, p. 272, ante. This remark is an instance of dark's topographical intuition.—Ed. it contains some Timber such as cotton &amp; willow in it's bottoms, and Great numbers of beaver the river also abounds in those animals as far as I have seen. passed the creek and over a high rocky hill and encamped in the upper part of a large bottom. The horses feet are very sore many of them can scercely proceed on over the Stone and gravel in every other respect they are Sound and in good Sperits. I saw two black bear on the side of the mountains this morning. Several gangs of Elk from 100 to 200 in a gangue on the river, great numbers of Antelopes, one Elk only killed to day. The Roche passes out of a high rugid mountain covered with snow. the bottoms are narrow within the mountains but wider [from ? a M. to 2 Ms.] in the Vally below, those bottoms are subject to over flow, they contain some tall Cotton wood, and willow rose bushes &amp; rushes Honey suckle &amp;c. a Second bottom on the N E. side which rises to about 20 feet higher [than] the first [&amp; is 1 M. wide] this bottom is coars gravel pebils &amp; sand with some earth on which the grass grow very Short and at this time is quit[e] dry this 2d. bottom over flows in high floods. on the opposit Side of the river the plain is much higher and extendes quite to the foot of the Mountain.1 1 The second bottom is known as the bench lands, and is of much value for pasturage.—Ed.

I can See no timber Sufficient[ly] large for a Canoe which will carry more than 3 men and such a one would be too small to answer my purpose. Wednesday 16th.. July 1806 I gave Labeech permission to proceed on early this morning a head and kill a fat Elk or Buffalow. our horses haveing rambled to a long distance down the river detained us much later than common. we did not set out untill 9 A M. we had not proceeded on far before I saw a buffalow &amp; sent Shannon to kill it this buffalow provd. to be a very fat Bull I had most of the flesh brought on an[d] a part of the Skin to make mockersons (remarkable sort of bag round foot) for Some of our lame horses. proceeded on down the river without finding any trees sufficiently large for a Canoe about 10 Miles and halted having passed over to an Island on which there was good food for our horses to let them graze &amp; Dine. I have not seen Labeech as yet. Saw a large gangue of about 200 Elk and nearly as many Antilope also two white or Grey Bear in the plains, one of them I chased on horse back about 2 Miles to the rugid part of the plain where I was compelled to give up the chase two of the horses was so lame owing to their feet being worn quit[e] Smooth and to the quick, the hind feet was much the worst I had Mockersons made of green Buffalow Skin and put on their feet which seams to releve them very much in passing over the stoney plains. after dinner I proceeded on soon after I had set out Labeech joined us with part of a fat Elk which he had killed. I passed over a stoney point at which place the river runs close to the high land on the N W. side crossed a small Creek and Encamped on the river a little below its' Enterance. Saw emence heards of Elk feeding on the opposit side of the river. I saw a great number of young gees in the river. one of the men brought me a fish of a species I am unacquainted [with]; it was 8 inches long formed like a trout. it's mouth was placed like that of the Sturgeon a red streak passed down each side from the gills to the tail.1 1 Coues identifies this fish as Pantosteus jordani. For the camping places, see our atlas volume.—Ed. The rocks which the high lands are faced with and which may also be seen in perpendicular Straters in the high plains, is a dark freestone. the greater part of this rock is of an excellent grit for Grindstones hard and sharp. I observe the Silkgrass sunflower &amp; Wild indigo all in blume. but fiew other flowers are to be seen in those plains. The river and Creek bottoms abound in Cotton wood trees, tho' none of them sufficiently large for canoes. and the current of the Rochejhone is too rapid (&amp; [we are] not willing) to depend on skinn canoes (which are not so easy managed &amp; we did not know the river) no other alternetive for me but to proceed on down untill I can find a tree Sufficiently large &amp;c. to make a canoe.

The high lands approach the river on either side much nearer than it does above and their sides are partially covered with low pine &amp; cedar, none of which are sufficiently large for Canoes, nor have I seen a Cotton tree in the low bottoms sufficiently large for that purpose. Buffalow is getting much more plenty than they were above. not so many Elk &amp; more deer Shannon killed one deer. I saw in one of those small bottoms which I passed this evening an Indian fort which appears to have been built last summer. this fort was built of logs and bark. the logs was put up very closely (ends supporting each other) lapping on each other about 5 feet (high) and closely chinked. around which bark was set up on end so as to cover the Logs. the enterance was also guarded by a Work on each side of it and faceing the river. this work is about 50 feet Diameter &amp; nearly round. the Squaw informs me that when the war parties (of Minnit Crows &amp;c, who fight Shoshonees) find themselves pursued they make those forts to defend themselves in from the pursuers whose superior numbers might otherwise over power them and cut them off without receiveing much injurey on horsback &amp;c.

I think the purple superior to any I have ever tasted. The river here is about 200 yards wide rapid as usial and the water gliding over corse gravel and round stones of various sizes of an excellent grite for whetestones. the bottoms of the river are narrow. the hills are not exceeding 200 feet in hight the sides of them are generally rocky and composed of rocks of the same texture of a dark colour of Grit well calculated for grindstones &amp;c. The high bottoms is composed of gravel and stone like those in the chanel of the river, with a mixture of earth of a dark brown colour The country back from the river on each side is generally open wavering plains. Some pine is to be seen in every direction in those plains on the Sides of the hills &amp;c. at 11 A.M. I observed a Smoke rise to the S.S.E in the plains towards the termonation of the rocky mountains in that direction (which is covered with snow) this Smoke must be raisd. by the Crow Indians in that direction as a Signal for us, or other bands. I think it most probable that they have discovered our trail and takeing us to be Shoshones &amp;c. in Serch of them the Crow Indians (now at peace with them) to trade as is their custom, have made this Smoke to Shew where they are—or otherwise takeing us to be their Enemy made this signal for other bands to be on their guard. I halted in a bottom of fine grass to let the horses graze. Shields killed a fat Buck on which we all Dined. after dinner and a delay of 3 hours to allow the horses time to feed, we set out at 4 P.M. I set out and proceeded down the river through a butifull bottom, passing an Indian fort on the head of a Small island near the Lard shore and Encamped on a small Island seperated from the Lard Shore by a very narrow Chanel.1 1 Above the mouth of Stillwater River, sometimes called the Rosebud, but not to be confused with the larger affluent of the same name lower down.—Ed.

I also sent Labech Shabono &amp; hall to [bring the] skin &amp; some of the flesh of the Elk Labeech had killed last evening they returned with one skin the wolves haveing eaten the most of the other four Elk. I also sent two men in serch of wood soutable for ax handles they found some choke cherry which is the best wood which can be precured in this country. Saw a Bear on an Island opposit and Several Elk. Sergt. Pryor and Shields returned at half past 11 A M. and informed me that they had preceded down the the timbered bottoms of the river for about 12 miles without finding a tree better than those near my Camp. I deturmined to have two canoes made out of the largest of those trees and lash them together which will cause them to be Study and fully sufficient to take my small party &amp; Self with what little baggage we have down this river. had handles put in the 3 axes and after Sharpening them with a file fell[ed] the two trees which I intended for the two canoes, those trees appeared tolerably Sound and will make canoes of 28 feet in length and about 16 or 18 inches deep and from 16 to 24 inches wide. the men with the three axes set in and worked untill dark. Sergt. Pryor dressed Some Skins to make him Clothes. Gibsons wound looks very well. I dressed it. The horses being fatigued and their feet very Sore, I shall let them rest a fiew days. during which time the party intended for to take them by land to the Mandans will dress their skins and make themselves clothes to ware, as they are nearly naked.

Monday 21st of July 1806 This morning I was informed that Half of our horses were absent. Sent out Shannon Bratten and Shabono to hunt them. Shabono went up the river Shanon down and Bratten in the bottom near Camp, Shabono and Bratten returned at 10 A M and informed me that they saw no Signs of the horses. Shannon proceeded on down the river about 14 Miles and did not return untill late in the evening, he was equally unsuckcessfull. Shannon informed me that he Saw a remarkable large Lodge about 12 miles below, covered with bushes and the top Deckorated with Skins &amp;c. and had the appearance of haveing been built about 2 years. I sent out two men on hors back to kill a fat cow which they did and returned in 3 hours the men work very diligently on the canoes one of them nearly finished ready to put in the water. Gibsons wound is beginning to heal. I am in great hope that it will get well in time for him to accompany Sgt. Pryor with the horses to the Mandans. This evening late a very black cloud from the S.E. accompanied with Thunder and lightning with hard winds which Shifted about and was worm and disagreeable. I am apprehensive that the Indians have Stolen our horses, and probably those who had made the Smoke a new days passed towards the S.W. I determined to have the ballance of the horses guarded and for that purpose sent out 3 men. on their approach near the horses were so alarmed that they ran away and entered the woods and the men returned. a Great number of Geese which raise their young on this river passed down frequently Since my arival at this place. we appear to be in the beginning of the buffalow Country. the plains are butifull and leavel but the soil is but thin Stoney and in maney parts of the plains &amp; bottoms there are great quantity of prickly pears. Saw Several herds of buffalow Since I arived at this Camp also antelops, wolves, pigions, Dovs, Hawks, ravins, crows, larks, Sparrows, Eagles &amp; bank martins &amp;c. &amp;c. The wolves which are the constant attendants of the Buffalow are in great numbers on the Scents of those large gangues which are to be Seen in every direction in those praries Tuesday 22nd. of July 1806 The wind continued to blow very hard from the N. E. and a little before day light was moderately cool. I sent Sergt. Pryor and Shabono in Serch of the horses with directions to proceed up the river as far as the 1st. narrows and examine particularly for their tracks, they returned at 3 P M and informed me that they had proceeded up the distance I derected them to go and could see neither horses nor tracks; the Plains imediately out from Camp is so dry and hard that the track of a horse cannot be seen without close examination I therefore derected Sergt. Pryor Shannon Shabono &amp; Bratten to incircle the camp at some distance around and find the tracks of the horses and prosuse them. they serched for tracks all the evening without finding which course the horses had taken, the plains being so remarkably hard and dry as to render it impossible to See a track of a horse passing through the hard parts of them. I begin to Suspect that they are taken by the Indians and taken over the hard plains to prevent our following them. my suspicions is grounded on the improbibility of the horses leaveing the grass and rushes of the river bottoms of which they are very fond, and taking imediately out into the open dry plains where the grass is but Short and dry. if they had continued in the bottoms either up or down, their tracks could be followed very well. I directed Labeech who understands tra[c]king very well to set out early in the morning and find what rout the horses had taken if possible. Wednesday 23rd.. July 1806. last night the wolves or dogs came into our camp and eat the most of our dryed meat which was on a scaffold Labeech went out early agreeable to my directions of last evening. Sergt. Pryor and Windsor also went out. Sgt. pryor found an Indian Mockerson and a Small piece of a roab, the mockerson worn out on the bottom &amp; yet wet, and have every appearance of haveing been worn but a fiew hours before. those Indian Signs is conclusive with me that they have taken the 24 horses which we lost on the night of the 20th. instant, and that those who were about last night were in serch of the ballance of our horses which they could not find as they had fortunately got into a small Prarie Serounded with thick timber in the bottom. Labeech returned haveing taken a great circle and informed me that he saw the tracks of the horses makeing off into the open plains and were by the tracks going very fast. The Indians who took the horses bent their course reather down the river. the men finished both canoes by 12 oClock to day, and I sent them to make Oars &amp; get poles after which I sent Shields and Labeech to kill a fat Buffalow out of a gangue which has been in a fiew miles of us all day. I gave Sergt. Pryor his instructions and a letter to Mr. Haney and directed that he G. Shannon &amp; Windser take the remaining horses to the Mandans, where he is to enquire for Mr. H. Heney if at the establishments on the Assinniboin river to take 12 or 14 horses and proceed on to that place and deliver Mr. Heney the letter which is with a view to engage Mr Heney to provale on some of the best informed and most influential Chiefs of the different bands of Sieoux to accompany us to the Seat of our Government with a view to let them see our population and resourses &amp;c. which I believe is the Surest garentee of Savage fidelity to any nation that of a Governmt. possessing the power of punishing promptly every aggression. Sergt. Pryor is directed to leave the ballance of the horses with the grand Chief of the Mandans untill our arrival at his village, also to keep a journal of his rout courses distances water courses soil productions, &amp; animals to be particularly noted. Shields and Labeech killed three buffalow two of them very fat I had as much of the meat saved as we could conveniently carry. in the evening had the two canoes put into the water and lashed together ores and every thing fixed ready to set out early in the morning, at which time I have derected Sergt. Pryor to Set out with the horses and proceed on to the enterance of the big horn river (which we suppose to be at no great distance) at which place the canoes will meat him and set him across the Rochejhone below the enterance of that river. [Letter to Hugh Henney, referred to above by Clark.]1 1 The draft of this letter, addressed by Clark to Henney, is found in the Clark-Voorhis collection, in Clark's handwriting.—Ed. Camp on the River Rochejhone East of the Rocky Mountains July 20.th 1806 a copy Sir In the winter of 1805, you were so obliging as to express a disposition to assist us in the execution of any measure relative to the Savages with whome you were conversant, or that you would lend your aid in furthering the friendly views of our government in relation to the Same. no object as we then informed you did at that time present itself to our view, which we conceived worthy of your attention. at present we have a commission to charge you with, which if executed, we have no doubt will tend to advance your private interest, while it will also promote those of the U. States in relation to the intercourse of her citizens with the Indian nations in the interior of North America. It is that of provailing on some of the most influensial Chiefs of those bands of Sioux who usially resort the borders of the Missouri to visit the Seat of our Government, and to accompany them there yourself with us. The Tetons of the burnt woods, Teton Ockandandas, and other bands of Tetons, Cisitons, and yanktons of the Plains are the Objects of our attention on this occasion, Particularly the Bands of Tetons; those untill some effectual measures be taken to render them pacific, will always prove a serious source of inconveniance to the free navigation of the Missouri, or at least to it's upper branches, from whence the richest portion of it's fur trade is to be derived. The ardent wish of our government has ever been to conciliate the esteem and secure the friendship of all the Savage nations within their territory by the exercise of every consistent and pacific measure in her power, applying those of coercion only in the last resort; certain we are that her disposition towards the native inhabitants of her newly acquired Territory of Louisiana is not less friendly; but we are also positive that she will not long suffer her citizens to be deprived of the free navigation of the Missouri by a fiew comparitively feeble bands of Savages who may be so illy advised as to refuse her proffered friendship and continue their depridation on her citizens who may in future assend or decend that river. We believe that the sureest guarantee of savage fidility to any nation is a thorough conviction on their minds that their government possesses the power of punishing promptly every act of aggression committed on their part against the person or property of their citizens; to produce this conviction without the use of violence, is the wish of our government; and to effect it, we cannot devise a more expedient method than that of takeing some of the best informed and most influential Chiefs with us to the U. States, where they will have an ample view of our population and resources, become convinced themselves, and on their return convince their nations of the futility of an attempt to oppose the Will of our government, particularly when they shall find, that their acquiescence will be productive of greater advantages to their nation than their most sanguine hopes could lead them to expect from oppersition. We have before mentioned to you the intention of our government to form tradeing establishments on the Missouri with a view to secure the attatchments of the nativs and emeliorate their sufferings by furnishing them with such articles as are necessary for their comfort on the most moderate terms in exchange for their peltries and furs. forming those establishments will most probably be delayed untill our return for the want of sufficient information relitive to the state of the country. We have recommended a position in the neighbourhood of the enterance of the Chyenne river as an eligible situation for one of those establishments principally with a view to the accomodation of the Sioux. an Indian Agent will of course be necessary at that post, your long acquaintance and influence with those people necessary places your protentions to that appointment on the fairest Ground, and should you think proper to under take the commission now proposed, it will still further advance those pretentions. if you wish such an office you may rest assured of our wormest intersessions in your behalf with our government. The emoluments attatched to the office of an Indian Agent in our service is 75$ pr. month and six rations pr. day, which last at so distant a post might safely be calculated at 20 cts. pr. ration or one Dollar &amp; 20 cents pr. day in addition to the Monthly pay makeing a total of 111$ pr. month. Under this view of the Subject should you think proper to engage in the business proposed, we promise you in behalf of our governmt. one dollar pr. day while you are employed in that service whether you succeed or not, recconing from the date at which you receive this letter. all necessary expenses incedent to traveling, hireing guides, expresses &amp;c. which may accur in the course of your transactions will also be allowed. In order the better to ensure you success, you are at liberty to take with you on this occasion any amount in merchandize not exceeding 200$ which you may conceive necessary by way of presents to those people. as horses will also be necessary for your journey you are at liberty to take any three of those which the men who hand you this, may bring with them to the establishments on the Assinniboin river or to the Mandans. we have directed Sergt Pryor to take 12 horses to the Establishments on the Assinniboin for the several purposes of exchangeing for a fiew articles which are necessary to the comfort of our party, to furnish you with as maney as will be necessary for your journey, and to pay the amount of the merchindize which we have instructed you to take on that occasion. should the Merchents not be disposed to barter for the horses and prefur Bills on our Government or furs at the Mandans, either of the latter will be delivered them imediately on our arival. in all pecuniary transactions where the case will permit it, you will take bills of particulars and receipts as vouchers in the settlement of your public accounts. Haveing accomplished our voyage to the Pacific Ocian by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers we are now on our return to the United States where we must arive if possible in the course of this Season. we shall spend a fiew weeks in exploring the country on the River Rochejhone and a large northerly branch of the Missouri dischargeing itself 50 miles below the Great falls of that river to which we have given the name of Maria's river. in order that no time shall be lost, we have in the interim dispatched a party over land from the upper part of the Rochejhone or Yellow Stone river to the Mandans and thence to your establishment on the assinniboin, with a view to give you as much time as possible to collect the Sioux chiefs at some convenient part of the Missouri against our arival, that we may not experience any detention. we shall in all probability arrive at the Mandans about the beginning of September, perhaps earlyer; at all events we wish you to lose no time in collecting the chiefs and repairing to the Missouri where you will wait our arrival, informing us if possible of your position. perhaps the Ricaras Village, if they have not removed will be an eligible place of rendezvouz, but in this respect we shall not pretend to controal you, as you will be on the ground and can better judge of the most expedient position for this purpose. It may possibly so happen that you will be absent from the Missouri at the time of our arrival at the Mandans and Ricaras, and as some communication may be necessary between us in such case, we wish you to concert a plan with Sergt. Pryor for that purpose. Should you not suceed in prevailing on the chiefs to go on with us as early as we wish, if you will meat us yourself on the Missouri we will make some other arrangement by which you will be enabled perhaps to bring them on afterwards youself; but it would be preferable in every point of view that they should go on with us. The number of chiefs and their attendance must not exceed 12 persons, as we cannot possibly accommodate more. In your communication with the Sioux, in addition to other considerations which may suggest themselves to your mind, you will be pleased to assure them of the friendly views of our government towards them, their power and resourses, their intention of establishing trading houses in their neighbourhood and the objects of those establishments, inform them that the mouth of all the rivers through [which] traders convey Merchindize to their country are now in the possession of the United States, who can at pleasure cut off all communication between themselves and their accustomed traders, and consequently the interest they have in cultivateing our friendship. You may also promis them in the event of their going on with us, that they shall receive from our government a considerable preasent in Merchindize, which will be conveyed at the public expence with them to their nation on their return. urge them also to go imediately, on the ground, that their doing so will haisten the establishment of the tradeing house in contemplation. You no doubt are acquainted with the influence which Mr. Cammaron1 1 See vol. i, p. 267, note 2.—Ed. and other traders of the River St. Peters possess over those people, the implicit confidence which they place in the power and resourses of those traders, the hitherto unfriendly dispositions of those men in relation to the trade of the Missouri, and thence the aggressions practised by the Sicoux on the traders of that river. Their long established prejudices in favour of the Traders of the river St. Peters will probably prove a serious bar to your present negociations, unless our government has taken some measures on this subject in consequence of the representation which we made them in the Spring 1805. if so, and those traders have been prevented from bringing out their merchindize this spring as they were accustomed to do, the Indians will most probably not long hesitate in complying with our wishes; however be this as it may, the most perfect reliance is placed in your exertions by Your friends and obedent Servents W Clark Capt &amp;c Mr. Hugh Heney at the N W Co.

Pryor Sir   You will with George Shannon, George Gibson &amp; Richard Windser take the horses which we have brought with us to the Mandans Village on the Missouri when you arrive at the Mandans, you will enquire of Mr. Jussomme and any british Traders who may be in neighbourhood of this place for Mr. Hugh Heney if you are informed, or have reasons to believe that he still remains at the establishments on the Assinniboin River, you will hire a pilot to conduct you and proceed on to those establishments and deliver Mr. Heney the letter which is directed to him. You will take with you to the Establishments on the Assinniboin River 12 or 14 horses, 3 of which Mr. Heney is to have choise if he agrees to engage in the Mission preposed to him. as maney of the remaining horses as may be necessary you will barter with the traders for such articles as we may stand in need of such as Flints three or 4 Doz. Knives, a fiew lbs. of Paint, some Pepper, Sugar &amp; Coffee or Tea, 2 Doz. Cors Handkerchiefs, 2 small Kegs of Sperits, 2 Cappoes, Tobacco sufficient, Glaubr. Salts, and such curious species of fur as you may see. or such of those articles as you may be enabled to get and we are most in want of viz. Tobacco Knives &amp; flints &amp;c. The Horses which you do not take with you from the Mandans you will leave in the care of the Black Cat Grand Chief of that nation untill we arive. They together with those you may not dispose of as before directed is to pay for $200 of Merchendize to be put in the hands of Mr. Heney as presents for the Soux chiefs as an inducement for them to accompany us to the Seat of our Government, and to purchase cors robes and such other articles as the party may stand in need of. Should Mr. Heney not be at the Establishments on the Assinniboin River or at the Mandans, you will remain with Mandans untill our arival at that place. Should Mr. Heney agree to undertake the Mission preposed in the letter you are to agre with him upon some plan by which means we may hear from him in the event that he should not Suckceed with the Sioux chiefs as soon as he expects; or what point he will meet us at on the Missouri. haveing the fullest confidence of your exertions on this enterprise, health hapiness and a safe journey is the sincere wish of your Frend W Clark Cpt. &amp;c Thursday 24.th July 1806. had all our baggage put on board of the two small canoes which when lashed together is very Study and I am convinced will [carry] the party I intend takeing down with me. at 8 AM. we Set out and proceeded on very well to a riffle about 1 mile above the enterance of [Clarks fork or] big horn river (a river 150 Yds. wide comes in from S West, we thought it the B. H. but aftds. when we found the B. H. we called it Clarks fork, a bold river washing plain. The Indians call this [blank space in MS.] or "The lodge where all dance")1 1 This river, rising on the borders of Yellowstone Park, is still called clark's Fork, and is one of the largest tributaries of the Upper Yellowstone. Considerable coal is now mined in its valley, up which a spur of the Northern Pacific extends to Red Lodge.—Ed. at this rif[f]le the small canoes took in a good deel of water which obliged us to land a little above the enterance of the [this river which the [blank space] has called Clarks fork] to dry our articles and bail the canoes. I also had Buffalow skin tacked on so as to prevent the waters flacking in between the two canoes. This last River is 150 yards wide at it's Mouth and 100 a short destance up the water of a light Muddy colour and much Colder than that of the Rochejhone a Small Island is Situated imediately in its mouth, the direction of this river is South and East of that part of the rocky mountains which can be seen from its enterance and which seem to termonate in that direction. (good place for fort &amp;c here the beaver country begins—best between this &amp; Rochejaune.) I thought it probable that this might be the big horn river, and as the Rochejhone appeared to make a great bend to the N. I deturmined to set the horses across on S. side. ones chanel of the river passes under a high black bluff from one mile below the place we built the Canoes to within 3 miles of the enterance of Clarks fork when the bottoms widen on each side those on the Stard. Side from 1/2 to a mile in width, river much divided by Islands, at 6 Ms. below the fork I halted on a large Island Seperated from the Stard. Shore by a narrow Chanel, on this, This being a good place to cross the river I deturmined to wait for Sergt. pryor and put him across the river at this place. on this Island I observd. a large lodge the same which Shannon informed me of a fiew days past. this Lodge [is] a council lodge, it is of a Conocil form 60 feet diameter at its base built of 2[0] poles each pole a 2? feet in secumpherance and 45 feet long built in the form of a lodge &amp; covered with bushes. in this Lodge I obse[r]ved a Cedar bush Sticking up on the opposit side of the lodge fronting the dore, on one side was a Buffalow head, and on the other several Sticks bent and stuck in the ground. a Stuffed Buffalow skin was suspended from the Center with the back down. the top of those poles were deckerated with feathers of the Eagle &amp; Calumet Eagle also several curious pieces of wood bent in Circleler form with sticks across them in form of a Griddle hung on tops of the lodge poles others in form of a large Sturrip. This Lodge was errected last Summer. It is situated in the center of a butifull Island thinly covered with Cotton wood under which the earth which is rich is covered with wild rye and a Species of grass resembling the bluegrass, and a mixture of Sweet grass which the Indian plat and ware around their necks for its cent which is of a strong sent like that of the Vinella1 1 Coues says the latter is the well-known holy-grass, Hierochloa borealis, also called Seneca-grass.—Ed. after Dinner I proceeded on passed the enterance of a Small creek and some wood on the Stard Side2 2 This was Cañon Creek, upon whose banks, not far from the Yellowstone, General Sturgis attempted to arrest the retreat of the Nez Percés (Sept., 1877). For the account of the battle by a participant, see Montana Hist. Soc. Colls., ii, pp. 277– 281.—Ed. where I met with Sergt. Pryor, Shannon &amp; Windser with the horses they had but just arived at that place. Sergt. Pryor informed me that it would be impossible for the two men with him to drive on the horses after him without tireing all the good ones in pursute of the more indifferent to keep them on the course. that in passing every gangue of buffalow several of which he had met with, the loos horses as soon as they saw the Buffalow would imediately pursue them and run around them. All those that [had] speed sufficient would head the buffalow and those of less speed would pursue on as fast as they could. he at length found that the only practiacable method would be for one of them to proceed on and when ever they saw a gang of Buffalow to Scear them off before the horses got up. This disposition in the horses is no doubt owing to their being frequently exercised in chasing different animals by their former owners the Indians as it is their Custom to chase every species of wild animal with horses, for which purpose they train all their horses. I had the horses drove across the river and set Sergt. Pryor and his party across. H. Hall who cannot swim expressed a Willi[ng]ness to proceed on with Sergt. Pryor by land, and as another man was necessary to assist in driveing the horses, but observed he was necked, I gave him one of my two remaining Shirts a par of leather Legins and 3 pr. of mockersons which equipt him completely and sent him on with the party by land to the Mandans. I proceeded on [down] the river much better than above the enterance of the Clarks fork deep (more navigable) and the Current regularly rapid from 2 to 300 yards in width where it is all together, much divided by islands maney of which are large and well Supplyed with cotton wood trees, some of them large, Saw emence number of Deer Elk and buffalow on the banks. Some beaver. I landed on the Lard Side walked out into the bottom and Killed the fatest Buck I every saw; Shields killed a deer and my man york killed a Buffalow Bull, as he informed me for his tongue and marrow bones. for me to mention or give an estimate of the differant Species of wild animals on this river particularly Buffalow, Elk Antelopes &amp; Wolves would be increditable. I shall therefore be silent on the subject further. So it is we have a great abundance of the best of meat. we made 70 Ms. to day current rapid and much divided by islands. [Campd. a little below Pryors river1 1 During this day the expedition passed the site of the present city of Billings, an important station on the Northern Pacific and the head of steamboat navigation on the Yellowstone.

We Set out at Sunrise and proceeded on very well for three hours. Saw a large gange of Buffalow on the Lard. Bank. I concluded to halt and kill a fat one, dureing which time some brackfast was ordered to be cooked. we killed 2 Buffalow and took as much of their flesh as I wished. Shields killed two fat deer and after a delay of one hour and a half we again proceeded on. and had not proceeded far before a heavy shower of rain pored down upon us, and the wind blew hard from the S W. the wind increased and the rain continued to fall. I halted on the Stard. Side had some logs set up on [end] close together and covered with deerskins to keep off the rain, and a large fire made to dry ourselves. the rain continued moderately untill near twelve oClock when it cleared away and become fair. the wind contin[u]ed high untill 2 P M. I proceeded on after the (rain) lay a little and at 4 P M arived at a remarkable rock situated in an extensive bottom on the Stard. Side of the river &amp; 250 paces from it. this rock I ascended and from it's top had a most extensive view in every direction. This rock which I shall call Pompy's Tower is 200 feet high and 400 paces in secumpherance and only axcessable on one Side which is from the N. E the other parts of it being a perpendicular clift of lightish coloured gritty rock on the top there is a tolerable soil of about 5 or 6 feet thick covered with short grass. The Indians have made 2 piles of stone on the top of this Tower. The nativs have ingraved on the face of this rock the figures of animals &amp;c. near which I marked my name and the day of the month &amp; year.1 1 See description and illustrations of this remarkable pile of rock (named Pompey's Pillar), and of the still legible inscription cut by Clark, in Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clark, ii, pp. 348–353. An iron screen has been placed over the name of Clark, by the officials of the Northern Pacific Railway, to protect it from vandals. The action of the water has worn away the ground between the rock and the river, so that the latter now washes its base.—Ed. From the top of this Tower I could discover two low Mountains &amp; the Rocky Mts. covered with Snow S W. one of them appeared to be extencive and bore S.15°.E. about 40 Miles. the other I take to be what the indians call the Little wolf Mtn. I can only see the Southern extremity of it which bears N55°.W. about 35 Miles.2 2 Wheeler identifies the southwest mountains as the Big Horn Range, and those to the southeast as a portion of the Wolf or Cheetish Mountains, more commonly known as the Rosebud Range.—Ed. The plains to the South rise from the distance of about 6 Miles the width of the bottom gradually to the mountains in that derection. a large creek with an extencive Vally the direction of which is S.25°.E. meanders boutifully through this plain. a range of high land covered with pine appears to run in a N. &amp; S. direction approaching the river below. on the Northerly Side of the river high romantic clifts approach &amp; jut over the water for some distance both above and below. a large Brook which at this time has some running muddy water falls in to the Rochejhone imediately opposit Pompys Tower. back from the river for some distance on that Side the hills are ruged &amp; some pine back the plains are open and extensive. after Satisfying my self sufficiently in this delightfull prospect of the extensive country around, and the emence herds of Buffalow, Elk and wolves in which it abounded, I decended and proceeded on a fiew miles, saw a gang of about 40 Big horn animals fired at them and killed 2 on the sides of the rocks which we did not get. I directed the canoes to land, and I walked up through a crevis in the rocks almost inaxcessiable and killed 2 of those animals one a large doe and the other a yearlin Buck. I wished very much to kill a large buck, had there been one with the gang I should have killd. him. dureing the time the men were getting the two big horns which I had killed to the river I employed my self in getting pieces of the rib of a fish which was Semented within the face of the rock this rib is (about 3) inches in Secumpherance about the middle it is 3 feet in length tho a part of the end appears to have been broken off (the fallen rock is near the water—the face of the rock where rib is is perpendr.— 4is lengthwise, a little barb projects) I have several peces of this rib the bone is neither decayed nor petrified but very rotten. the part which I could not get out may be seen, it is about 6 or 7 Miles below Pompys Tower in the face of the Lard. Clift about 20 feet above the water. after getting the big horn on board &amp;c. I proceeded on a Short Distance and encamped, an earlyer [hour] than I intended on account of a heavy cloud which was comeing up from the S.S.W. and some appearance of a Violent wind. I walked out and killed a small Buck for his skin which the party are in want of for clothes. about Sunset the wind blew hard from the W. and some little rain. I encamped on the Stard. Side imediately below the enterance [of] Shannons River about 22 Yards wide, and at this time discharges a great portion of water which is very Muddy. emence herds of Buffalow about our [camp] as it is now running time with those animals the bulls keep such a grunting nois which is [a] very loud and disagreeable sound that we are compelled to scear them away before we can sleep the men fire several shot at them and scear them away.

The country back on each side is wavering lands with scattering pine. passed 2 Small Brooks on the Stard. Side and two large ones on the Lard. Side. I shot a Buck from the Canoe and killed one other on a Small Island. and late in the evening passed a part of the river which was rock under the Lard Clifts fortunately for us we found an excellent chanel to pass down on the right of a Stoney Island half a Mile below this bad place, we arived at the enterance of Big Horn River on the Stard. Side, here I landed imediately in the point which is a Sof[t] Mud mixed with the Sand and Subject to overflow for Some distance back in between the two rivers. I walked up the big horn 1/2 a mile and crossed over to the lower Side, and formed a camp on a high point. I with one of my men Labeech walked up the N E Side of Big horn river 7 miles to thenterance of a Creek which falls in on the N E. Side and is (28) Yds wide some running water which is very Muddy this Creek I call Muddy Creek3 3 Apparently Tulloch's Fork, although its mouth is now somewhat farther down the Big Horn. At the confluence of the Big Horn and Yellowstone the first trading post of this region was built by Manuel Lisa in 1807. It was probably abandoned in 1811. Its successors were Fort Benton (1822–23), and Fort Cass (1832–35). See Chittenden, History of Fur Trade, pp. 964–965.—Ed. Some fiew miles above this Creek the river bent around to the East of South. The courses as I assended it as follows Viz: S.35°.E. 3 miles to a low clift on the right passed a point on the right at 1 1/2 Ms. an island Situatd. close to the left hand Shore. under this clift is some swift rapid water and high waves S.61°.E. 3 Miles to a high bank of a Second bottom in the left hand bend passed head of the Isld. 8.38°.W. 4 miles to a right hand bend, passing a large creek of muddly water on the left Side at 1 Mile, opposit a Sand bar from the right. The bottoms of the Bighorn river are extencive and Covered with timber principally Cotton. it's current is regularly Swift, like the Missouri, it washes away its banks on one Side while it forms extensive sand bars on the other. contains much less portion of large gravel than the R: Rochjhone and its water more mudy and of a brownish colour, while that of the rochejhone is of a lightish colour. the width of those two rivers are very nearly the same imediately at their enterances the river Rochejhone much the deepest and contain most water. I measured the debth of the big horn quit[e] across a[t] 1/2 a mile above its junction and found it from 5 to 7 feet only while that of the River (rochejaune) is in the deepest part 10 or 12 feet water. on the lower Side of the bighorn is [an] extencive boutifull and leavil bottom thinly covered with cotton wood under which there grows great quantities of rose bushes. I am informed by the Menetarres Indians and others that this River takes its rise in the Rocky mountains with the heads of the river plate and at no great distance from the river Rochejhone and passes between the Coat Nor [Côte Noir] or Black Mountains and the Most Easterly range of Rocky Mountains. it is very long and contains a great perpotion of timber on which there is a variety of wild animals, perticularly the big horn which are to be found in great numbers on this river. (2 large forks come in on Sth. &amp; 1 on North)1 1 The northwestern branch is Beauvais Fork; the southeastern branches are Rotten-Grass Creek and the Little Big Horn. Upon the latter occurred (June 25, 1876) the Custer massacre, where five companies of that general's command were annihilated. The battlefield is now marked by a monument, and has been made a national military cemetery, whither have been removed the remains of many victims of Indian warfare. Custer was interred at West Point in 1877.—Ed. Buffalow, Elk, Deer and Antelopes are plenty and the river is said to abound in beaver it is inhabited by a great number of roveing Indians of the Crow Nation, the paunch Nation (a band of Crows) and the Castahanas (a band of Snake In.)2 2 For the Crow (Absaroka), see our vol. i, p. 130, note 2. The Big Horn valley was the centre of the Crow territory, and is still within the reservation for that tribe. The Castahanas are the tribe now known as Comanche—the eastern branch of Shoshonean stock. For all these tribes, see "Estimate of the Eastern Indians" in our vol. vi, nos. 34, 35, 36.—Ed. all of those nations who are Subdivided rove and prosue the Buffalow of which they make their principal food, their Skins together with those of the Big horn and Antilope serve them for Clothes. This river is said to be navagable a long way for perogues without falls and waters a fine rich open Country. it is 200 yds water &amp; 1/4 of a Ml. wd. I returned to camp a little after dark, haveing killed one deer, finding my self fatigued went to bed without my supper. Shields killed 2 Bull[s] &amp; 3 Elk.

Children We have been to the great lake of the west and are now on our return to my country. I have seen all my read children quite to that great lake and talked with them, and taken them by the hand in the name of their great father the Great Chief of all the white people. Children We did not see the [blank space in MS.] or the nations to the North. I have [come] across over high mountains and bad road to this river to see the [blank space in MS.] Natn I have come down the river from the foot of the great snowey mountain to see you, and have looked in every derection for you, without seeing you untill now Children I heard from some of your people [blank space in MS.] nights past by my horses who complained to me of your people haveing taken 4 [24] of their cummerads. Children The object of my comeing to see you is not to do you injurey but to do you good the Great Chief of all the white people who has more goods at his command than could be piled up in the circle of your camp, wishing that all his read children should be happy has sent me here to know your wants that he may supply them. Children Your great father the Chief of the white people intends to build a house and fill it with such things as you may want and exchange with you for your skins &amp; furs at a very low price. &amp; has derected me [to] enquire of you, at what place would be most convenient for to build this house. and what articles you are in want of that he might send them imediately on my return Children The people in my country is like the grass in your plains noumerous they are also rich and bountifull. and love their read brethren who inhabit the waters of the Missoure Children I have been out from my country two winters, I am pore necked and nothing to keep of[f] the rain, when I set out from my country I had a plenty but have given it all to my read children whome I have seen on my way to the Great Lake of the West, and have now nothing. Children Your Great father will be very sorry to here of the [blank space in MS.] stealing the horses of his Chiefs &amp; Warrors whome he sent out to do good to his red children on the waters of Missoure. [Two lines in MS. so worn and torn as to be illegible.] their ears to his good counsels he will shut them and not let any goods &amp; guns be brought to the red people. but to those who open their Ears to his counsels he will send every thing they want into their country. and build a house where they may come to and be supplyed whenever they wish. Children Your Great father the Chief of all the white people has derected me [to] inform his red children to be at peace with each other, and with the white people who may come into your country under the protection of the Flag of your great father which you. those people who may visit you under the protection of that flag are good people and will do you no harm Children Your great father has derected me to tell you not to suffer your young and thoughtless men to take the horses or property of your neighbours or the white people, but to trade with them fairly and honestly, as those of his red children below. Children The red children of your great father who live near him and have opened their ears to his counsels are rich and hapy have plenty of horses cows &amp; Hogs fowls bread &amp;c. &amp;c. live in good houses, and sleep sound. and all those of his red children who inhabit the waters of the Missouri who open their ears to what I say and follow the counsels of their great father the President of the United States, will in a feew years be a[s] hapy as those mentioned &amp;c. Children It is the wish of your Great father the Chief of all the white people that some 2 of the principal Chiefs of this [blank space in MS.] Nation should Visit him at his great city and receive from his own mouth. his good counsels, and from his own hands his abundant gifts, Those of his red children who visit him do not return with empty hands, he [will] send them to their nation loaded with presents Children If any one two or 3 of your great chiefs wishes to visit your great father and will go with me, he will send you back next Summer loaded with presents and some goods for the nation. You will then see with your own eyes and here with your own years what the white people can do for you. they do not speak with two tongues nor promis what they can't perform Children Consult together and give me an answer as soon as possible your great father is anxious to here from. (&amp; see his red children who wish to visit him) I cannot stay but must proceed on &amp; inform him &amp;c. Sunday 27th. July 1806 I marked my name with red paint on a cotton tree near my camp, and Set out at an early hour and proceeded on very well the river is much wider from 4 to 600 yards much divided by Islands and sand bars, passed a large dry Creek at [15] Miles (call Elk creek) and halted at the enterance of River 50 yards wide on the Lard. Side (I call R. Labeech) killed 4 Buffalow and saved as much of their flesh as we could carry took brackfast.1 1 Elk is the present Alkali Creek; Labiech's River is that now known as Sarpy, from an American For Company fort of that name built about 1850 and abandoned ten years later. Fort Sarpy was somewhat above the mouth of this creek; it was named in honor of John B. Sarpy, a noted St. Louis fur merchant.—Ed. The Buffalow and Elk is estonishingly noumerous on the banks of the river on each side, particularly the Elk which lay on almost every point in large gangs and are so jintle that we frequently pass within 20 or 30 paces of them without their being the least alarms the buffalow are Generally at a greater distance from the river, and keep a continueing bellowing in every direction, much more beaver Sign than above the big-horn, I saw several of those animals on the bank to day. the antilopes are scerce as also the bighorns and the deer by no means so plenty as they were near the Rocky Mountains. when we pass the Big horn I take my leave of the View of the tremendious chain of Rocky Mountains white with Snow in View of which I have been since the 1st of May last. about sunset I shot a very large fat buck elk from the Canoe near which I encamped, and was near being bit by a rattle snake. Shields killed a Deer &amp; a antilope to day for the skins which the party is in want of for Clothes. this river below the big horn river resembles the Missouri in almost every perticular except that it's islands are more noumerous &amp; current more rapid, it's banks are generally low and falling in the bottoms on the Stard. Side low and extencive and covered with timber near the river such as Cotton wood willow of the different species rose bushes and Grapevines together with the red berry or Buffalow Grees bushes &amp; a species of shoemake with dark brown bark, of[f] those bottoms the Country rises gradually to about 100 feet and has some pine. back is leavel plains. on the Lard Side the river runs under the clifts and Bluffs of high which is from 70 to 150 feet in hight and near the river is some scattering low pine back the plains become leavel and extencive. the clifts are composed of a light gritty stone which is not very hard, and the yound stone (round stones) which is mixed with the Sand and forms bars is much smaller than they appeared from above the bighorn, and may here be termed Gravel, the colour of the water is a yellowish white and less muddy than the Missouri below the mouth of this river.

I take this river to be the one the Indians Call the Little Big Horn river.2 2 This is the Rosebud River (not to be confounded with the Little Big Horn, a branch of the Big Horn). Near its mouth was a fur-trade fort concerning whose identity there is a difference of opinion. See Chittenden, History of the Fur Trade, p. 965; Coues, Forty Years a Fur Trader on the Upper Missouri: Larpenteur's Autobiography (New York, 1896), pp. 47, 171–173.—Ed.

Beaver plenty Tuesday 29.th July 1806 A slight rain last night with hard thunder and Sharp lightning accompanied with a violent N. E. wind. I set out early this morning wind So hard a head that w[e] made but little way. in the fore part of the day, I saw great numbers of Buffalow on the banks. the country on either side is like that of yesterday. passed three large dry Brooks on the Stard. Side and four on the Lard. Side. great quantities of coal in all the hills I passed this day. late in the evening I arived at the enterance of a River which I take to be (called by Indians) the [Lazeka or Tongue River] it discharges itself on the Stard. Side and is 150 yards wide of water the banks are much wider. I intended to encamp on an eligable spot imediately below this river, but finding that it's water [is] so Muddy and worm as to render it very disagreeable to drink, I crossed the rochejhone and encamped on an island close to the Lard. Shore. The water of this river is nearly milk worm very muddy and of a lightish brown colour, the current rapid and the chanel contains great numbers of snags, near its enterance there is great quantities of wood such as is common in the low bottoms of the Rochejhone and Missouri, (it heads in Cote Noir has 2 branches I heads with the Chayenne &amp; I with one of the Big H's branches tho' I believe that the country back thro' which this river passes is an open one where the water is exposed to the sun which heats it in its passage, it is Shallow and throws out great quantities of mud and some cors gravel.1 1 The Tongue is one of the largest, affluents of the Yellowstone; its chief southeastern tributary is the Pumpkin, but the valley of Powder River lies between that and the sources of the Cheyenne. The western sources of the Tongue mingle with those of the Little Big Horn. At the mouth of the former was an unnamed cantonment, from which Ouster's forces set out in June, 1876. This military post is now Fort Keogh, named for an officer who fell in the Custer massacre.—Ed. below this river and on the Stard. Side at a fiew Miles from the Rochejhone the hills are high and ruged containing Coal in great quantities. Beaver is very plenty on this part of the Rochejhone. The river widens I think it may be generally Calculated at from 500 yards to half a mile in width more Sand and gravelly bars than above. cought 3 cat fish. they wer small and fat. also a Soft Shell turtle.

Side near a high bluff. passed a Succession of those Shoals for 6 Miles the lower of which was quit[e] across the river and appeared to have a decent of about 3 feet, here we were compeled to let the canoes down by hand for fear of their Striking a rock under water and splitting. This is by far the worst place which I have seen on this river from the Rocky mountains to this place a distance of 694 miles by water, a Perogue or large canoe would with Safty pass through the worst of those Shoals, which I call the Buffalow Sholes from the circumstance of one of those animals being in them. the rock which passes the river at those sholes appear hard and gritty of a dark brown colour. the clifts on the Stard. Side is about 100 feet in hight, on the Lard. Side the country is low and the bottom rises gradually back. here is the first appearance of Birnt hills which I have seen on this river they are at a distance from the river on the Lard. Side.1 1 Clark now enters what are popularly known as the Bad Lands, extending from Miles City (at the mouth of Tongue River) to Glendive. The rapids still retain the names assigned them by this Expedition—Buffalo, Bear, Wolf, etc.—Ed. I landed at the enterance of a dry Creek on the Lard. side below the Shoals and took brackfast. Those Dry Rivers, Creeks &amp;c are like those of the Missouri which take their rise in and are the conveyance of the water from those plains. they have the appearance of dischargeing emence torrents of water. the late rains which has fallen in the plains raised sudenly those Brooks which receive the water of those plains on which those suden &amp; heavy showers of rain must have fallen, Several of which I have seen dischargeing those waters, whiles those below heading or takeing their rise in the same neighbourhood, as I passed them appears to have latterly been high, those Brood[k]s discharge emencely of mud also, which contributes much to the muddiness of the river. after Brackfast proceeded on the river much narrower than above from 3 to 400 yards wide only and only a fiew scattering trees to be seen on the banks. at 20 miles below the Buffalow Shoals passed a rapid which is by no means dangerous it has a number of large rocks in different parts of the river which causes high waves a very good chanel on the Lard. Side. this rapid I call Bear rapid from the circumstance of a bears being on a rock in the Middle of this rapid when I arived at it. a violent storm from the N W. obliged us to land imediately below this rapid, draw up the canoes and take Shelter in an old Indian Lodge above the enterance of a river which is nearly dry it has laterly been very high and Spread over nearly 1/4 [of] a mile in width. its chanel is 88 yards and in this there is not more water than could pass through an inch auger hole. [I call it Yorks dry R.] after the rain and wind passed over I proceeded on at 7 Miles passed the enterance of a river the water of which is 100 Yds, the bead of this river nearly 1/4 of a mile this river is Shallow and the water very muddy and of the Colour of the banks a darkish brown. I observe great quantities of red Stone thrown out of this river that &amp; from the appearance of the hills at a distance on its lower Side induced me to call this red Stone river. (By a coincidence I found the Indian name Wa ha Sah.)1 1 Now Powder River, the last great branch of the Yellowstone. The significance of the Indian name was red stone.—Ed. as the water was disagreeably muddy I could not camp on that Side below its mouth. however I landed at its enterance and sent out and killed two fat Cows, and took as much of the flesh as the canoes would conveniently carry and crossed the river and encamped at the enterance of a Brook on the Lard. Side under a large Spredding Cotton tree. The river on which we passed to day is not so wide as above containing but fiew islands with a small quantity of Cotton timber. no timber of any kind to be seen on the high lands on either Side.

I also saw some of the Bighorn Animals at a distance on the hills. Gibson is now able to walk, he walked out this evening and killed an antilope. Saturday 31st. of July 1806 I was much disturbed last night by the noise of the buffalow which were about me. one gang swam the river near our Camp which alarmed me a little for fear of their Crossing our Canoes and Splitting them to pieces. Set out as usial about Sun rise passed a rapid which I call wolf rapid from the circumstance of one of those animals being at the rapid. here the river approaches the high mountainous country on the N W. Side. those hills appear to be composed of various coloured earth and coal without much rock. I observe several conical pounds (mounds) which appear to have been burnt. this high country is washed into curious formed mounds &amp; hills and is cut much with reveens. the country again opens and at the distance of 23 miles below the Redstone [or War har-sah] River I landed in the enterance of a small river on the Stard. Side 40 yards wid[e] shallow and muddy. it has lately been very high. haveing passed the Enterance of a River on the Lard. Side 100 yards wide which has running water. this river I take to be the one the Menetarres Call little wolf or Sa-a-shah River1 1 Probably Maynadier Creek.—Ed. The high Country is entirely bar of timber. great quantities of Coal or carbonated wood is to be seen in every Bluff and in the high hills at a distance on each side. Saw more Buffalow and Elk and antilopes this evening than usial. 18 Miles below the last river on the Stard. Side, I passed one 60 yards wide which had running water. this Stream I call Qak-tar-pon-er or Coal River [it] has very steep banks on each side of it.2 2 Now O'Fallon Creek, named for one of Clark's nephews who entered the fur-trade at St. Louis, and became a prominent citizen of that place.—Ed. passed several large Brooks some of them had a little running water, also Several Islands some high black looking Bluffs and encamped on the Stard. Side on a low point. the country like that of yesterday is open extencive plains. as I was about landing this evening Saw a white bear and the largest I ever saw eating a dead buffalow on a sand bar. we fired two shot into him, he Swam to the main Shore and walked down the bank. I landed and fired 2 more shot into this tremendious animal without killing him. night comeing on we could not pursue him he bled profusely. Showers all this day.

Side1 1 The encampment for this night was in the vicinity of Glendive, where the Northern Pacific Railway enters the Yellowstone Valley.—Ed. 2 1/2 Miles 66 Sunday 1st. of August 1806. We set out early as usial the wind was high and ahead which caused the water to be a little rough and delayed us very much aded to this we had showers of rain repeatedly all day at the intermition of only a fiew minits between them. this rendered My situation a very disagreeable one. in an open canoe wet and without a possibility of keeping my self dry. the country through which we passed is in every respect like that through which I passed yesterday. The brooks have all some water in them from the rains which has fallen. this water is excessively muddy. Several of those brooks have some trees on their borders as far as I can see up them. I observe some low pine an[d] cedar on the sides of the rugid hills on the Stard. Side, and Some ash timber in the high bottoms. the river has more Sand bars today than usial, and more soft mud. the current less rapid. at 2 P. M. I was obliged to land to let the Buffalow cross over. not withstanding an island of half a mile in width over which this gangue of Buffalow had to pass and the chanel of the river on each side nearly 1/4 of a mile in width, this gangue of Buffalow was entirely across and as thick as they could swim. the chanel on the side of the island the[y] went into the river was crouded with those animals for 1/2 an hour. (I was obliged to lay to for one hour) the other Side of the island for more than 3/4 of an hour. I took 4 of the men and killed 4 fat cows for their fat and what portion of their flesh the small canoes could carry, that which we had killed a few days ago being nearly spoiled from the wet weather. encamped on an Island close to the Lard.

The Country on the N W. Side rises to a low plain and extends leavel for great extent. Some high rugid hills in the forepart of this day on the S E side on which I saw the big horns but could not get near them. Saw emence numbers of Elk Buffalow and wolves today, the wolves do catch the elk. I saw 2 wolves in pursute of [a] doe Elk which I beleive they cought they [were] very near her when She entered a Small wood in which I expect they cought her as She did not pass out of the small wood during my remaining in view of it which was 15 or 20 minits &amp;c. passed the enterance of several brooks on each side, a small river 30 Yds wide with steep banks on the Stard. Side, which I call [Ibex] River the river in this days decent is less rapid crouded with Islds. and muddy bars, and is generally about one mile in wedth. as the islands and bars frequently hide the enterance of Brooks &amp;c. from me as I pass'd maney of them I have not noticed. about 8 A.M. this morning a Bear of the large vicious species being on a Sand bar raised himself up on his hind feet and looked at us as we passed down near the middle of the river. he plunged into the water and swam towards us, either from a disposition to attack't or from the cent of the meat which was in the canoes. we Shot him with three balls and he returned to Shore badly wounded. in the evening I saw a very large Bear take the water above us. I ordered the boat to land on the opposit side with a view to attack't him when he came within shot of the shore. when the bear was in a fiew paces of the Shore I shot it in the head. the men hauled her on Shore and proved to be an old Shee which was so old that her tuskes had worn Smooth, and Much the largest feemale bear I ever saw. after taking off her Skin, I proceeded on and encampd. a little above the enterance of Jo: Fields Creek on Stard. Side in a high bottom covered with low Ash and elm.1 1 For Fields's discovery of this stream, see our vol. i, p. 343. The name of Charbonneau has now been transferred to this creek.—Ed. the Musquetors excessively troublesom. I have noticed a great preportion [of] Buck Elks on this lower part of the river, and but very fiew above. those above which are emencely noumerous are feemales Generally. Shields killed a Deer this morning dureing the time we were at Brackfast. we were very near being detained by the Buffalow to day which were crossing the river we got through the line between 2 gangues.

Field's Creek 35 yds wide imediately above a high bluff which is falling into the river very fast. on the side of this bluff I saw some of the Mountain Bighorn animals. I assended the hill below the Bluff. the Musquetors were so noumerous that I could not Shute with any certainty and therefore soon returned to the Canoes. I had not proceeded far before I saw a larger gangue of ewes &amp; yearlins &amp; fawns or lambs of the big horn, and at a distance alone I saw a ram. landed and Sent Labeech to kill the ram, which he did kill and brought him on board. this ram is not near as large as maney I have Seen. however he is sufficiently large for a Sample. I directed Bratten to skin him with his head horns &amp; feet to the Skin and Save all the bone. I have now the skin &amp; bone of a Ram a Ewe &amp; a yearlin ram of those big Horn animals. at 8. A.M. I arived at the junction of the Rochejhone with the Missouri, and formed my camp imediately in the point between the two river[s] at which place the party had all encamped the 26th. of April, 1805. at landing I observed several Elk feeding on the young willows in the point among which was a large Buck Elk which I shot &amp; had his flesh dryed in the sun for a Store down the river. had the Canoes unloaded and every article exposed to dry &amp; Sun. Maney of our things were wet, and nearly all the Store of meat which had been killed above Spoiled. I ordered it to be thrown into the river. Several skins are also spoiled which is a loss, as they are our principal dependence for Clothes to last us to our homes &amp;c. Course distance &amp; Remarks Augt. 3rd 1806. West. along the Stard.

John Shields, George Gibson, William Bratten, W. Labeech, Toust. Shabono his wife &amp; child &amp; my man York. The Rochejhone or Yellow Stone river is large and navagable with but fiew obstructions quite into the rocky Mountains. and probably to-head [near it's source]. The country through which it passes from those Mounts. to its junction is Generaly fertile rich open plains the upper portion of which is roleing and the high hills and hill Sides are partially covered with pine and Stoney. The middle portion or from the enterance of [Clarks] Fork as low as the Buffalow Shoals the high lands contain Some Scattering pine on the Lard Side. on the Stard. or S. E. Side is Some hills thickly Supplied with pine. The lower portion of the river but fiew pines are to be Seen the Country opens into extencive plains river widens and contains more islands and bars; of corse gravel sand and Mud. The Current of this river may be estimated at 4 Miles and 1/2 pr. hour from the Rocky Mts. as low as [Clarks]] Fork, at [3 1/2] Miles pr. hour from thence as low as the Bighorn, at 3 Miles pr. hour from thence as low as the Tongue river, at [2 3/4] Miles pt. hour from thence as low as Wolf rapid and at 2 1/2 miles pr. hour from thence to its enterance into the Missouri The colour of the Water differs from that of the Missouri it being of a yellowish brown, whilst that of the Missouri is of a deep drab colour containing a greater portion of Mud than the Rochejhone. [Lewis:]1 1 The following entry, describing the Yellowstone River, is in Lewis's handwriting, undoubtedly of a later date. Clark resumes the record on the next day, Aug. 4.—Ed. This deligh[t]full river from indian information has it's extreem sources with the North river in the Rocky mountains on the confines of New Mexico. it also most probably has it's westerly sources connected with [*] the Multnomah and those (of) the main Southerly branch of [*] (those of)2 Lewis's river while it's Easterly branches head with those of Clark's R. the bighorn and River Platte and may be said to water the middle portion of the Rocky Mountains from N W to S. E. for several hundred miles. the indians inform us that a good road passes up this river to it's extreem source from whence it is but a short distance to the Spanish settlements. [*] there is also a considerable fall on this river within the mountains but at what distance from it's source we never could learn. [*] (no)2 2 In these sentences the words between bracketed asterisks are marked with red in the original MS., to indicate that, in the first, these words are to be replaced by those which here follow in parenthesis; in the second, the statement is denied, "no" being written after it.—Ed. like all other branches of the Missouri which penetrate the Rocky Mountains all that portion of it lying within those mountains abound in fine beaver and Otter, it's streams also which issuing from the rocky mountain and discharg themselves above Clark's fork inclusive also furnish an abundance of beaver and Otter and possess considerable portions of small timber in their vallies. to an establishment on this river at clarks Fork the Shoshones both within and West of the Rocky Mountains would willingly resort for the purposes of trade as they would in a great measure be relived from the fear of being attacked by their enimies the blackfoot Indians and Minnetares of fort de Prarie, which would most probably happen were they to visit any establishment which could be conveniently formed on the Missouri. I have no doubt but the same regard to personal safety would also induce many numerous nations inhabiting the Columbia and Lewis's river West of the mountains to visit this establishment in preference to that at the entrance of Maria's river, particularly during the first years of those Western establishments. the Crow Indians, Paunch Indians Castahanah's and others East of the Mountains and south of this place would also visit this establishment; it may therefore be looked to as one of the most important establishments of the western fur trade. at the entrance of Clark's fork1 1 By an inadvertence, the Biddle text substitutes in this passage the phrase, "at the mouth of the Yellowstone," which has led to a misconception. Lewis discusses in this paragraph the advantages of an establishment at the mouth of Clark's Fork, where Clark had already, on July 24, noted an eligible site.—Ed. there is a sufficiency of timber to support an establishment, an advantage that no position possesses from thence to the Rocky Mountains. The banks of the yellowstone river a[re] bold not very high yet are not subject to be overflown, except for a few miles immediately below where the river issues from the mountain. the bed of this river is almost entirely composed of loose pebb. nor is it's bed interrupted by chains of rock except in one place and that even furnishes no considerable obstruction to it's navigation. as you decend with the river from the mountain the pebble becomes smaller and the quantity of mud increased untill you rea[c]h Tongue river where the pebble ceases and the sand then increases and predominates near it's mouth. This river can be navigated to greater advantage in perogues than any other craft yet it possesses suficient debth of water for battauxs even to the mountains; nor is there any of those moving sand bars so formidable to the navigation of many parts of the Missouri.1 1 The first fort built near the mouth of the Yellowstone appears to have been the post of Ashley and Henry, begun in 1822 and abandoned the autumn of the next year. Fort Union, for over seventy years the central station of the American Fur Company, was begun (as Fort Floyd) in 1828. The military post of Fort Buford was established below Fort Union in 1866. For a description of the life at this latter post, see "Maximilian's Voyage in the Interior of North America," in Thwaites, Early Western Travels, vols. xxii–xxv.—Ed. The Bighorn R and Clark's fork may be navigated a considerable distance in perogues and canoes. Tongue river is also navigable for canoes a considerable distance. [Clark:] Wednesday 4th. August 1806 Musquetors excessively troublesom so much so that the men complained that they could not work at their Skins for those troublesom insects. and I find it entirely impossible to hunt in the bottoms, those insects being so noumerous and tormenting as to render it imposseable for a man to continue in the timbered lands and our best retreat from those insects is on the Sand bars in the river and even those Situations are only clear of them when the Wind Should happen to blow which it did to day for a fiew hours in the middle of the day. the evenings nights and mornings they are almost [un]indureable perticularly by the party with me who have no Bears [biers] to keep them off at night, and nothing to Screen them but their blankets which are worn and have maney holes. The torments of those Missquetors and the want of a Suffice[n]cy of Buffalow meat to dry, those animals not to be found in this neighbourhood induce me to deturmine to proceed on to a more eliagiable Spot on the Missouri below at which place the Musquetors will be less troublesom and Buffalow more plenty. I will here observe that Elk is abundant but their flesh &amp; fat is hard to dry in the sun, and when dry is much easi[e]r spoiled than either the Buffalow or Deer) I ordered the Canoes to be reloaded with our baggage &amp; dryed meat which had been saved on the Rochejhone together with the Elk killed at this place. wrote a note to Capt Lewis informing him of my intentions and tied it to a pole which I had stuck up in the point. At 5 P.M. Set out and proceeded on down to the 2d. point which appeared to be an eligable Situation for my purpose [killed a porcupine] on this point the Musquetors were so abundant that we were tormented much worst than at the point. The child of Shabono has been so much bitten by the Musquetors that his face is much puffed up &amp; Swelled. I encamped on this extensive Sand bar which is on the N W. Side. Thursday 5th. August 1806 The Musquetors was so troublesom to the men last night that they slept but very little, indeed they were excessive troublesom to me. my Musquetor Bear has a number of small holes worn through [which] they pass in. I set out at an early hour intending to proceed to some other Situation. I had not proceded on far before I saw a ram of the big horn animal near the top of a Lard. Bluff I assended the hill with a view to kill the ram. the Musquetors was so noumerous that I could not keep them off my gun long enough to take sight and by that means Missed. at 10 A.M. the wind rose with a gentle breeze from the N.W. which in some measure thinned the Musquetors. I landed on a sand bar from the South Point intending to form a Camp at this place and continue untill Capt Lewis should arive. killed two Buck Elks and a Deer the best of their flesh &amp; fat I had saved. had all the dryed meat &amp; fat put out to sun and continued at this place untill late in the evening finding that there were no buffalow or fresh sign I deturmined to proceed on accordingly set out at 4 P. M and proceeded on but a fiew Miles eer I saw a Bear of the white Species walking on a Sand bar. I with one man went on the Sand bear and killed the Bear which proved to be a feemale very large and fat. much the fattest animale we have killed on the rout as this bear had got into the river before we killed her I had her toed across to the South Side under a high Bluff where [we] formed a Camp, had the bear Skined and fleaced. our Situation was exposed to a light breeze of wind which continued all the forepart of the night from the S W. and blew away the Musquetors. Friday 6th. August 1806 I rose very wet. about 11 P M last night the wind become very hard for a fiew minits suckceeded by Sharp lightning and hard claps of Thunder and rained for about 2 hours very hard after which it continued Cloudy the balance of the night. as we were about Setting out a female Bighorn animal came on the bluff imediately above us and looked down. I derected Labeech to shoot it which he did, after skinning this animal we set out and proceeded on to a Sand bar on the S W. side below the enterance of White earth river where I landed and had the meat skins and bedding all put out to dry. wind hard from the N W. I halted on the N W. side of this river in the bend above White earth river, where I saw the Indians had been digging a root which they eate and use in Suip, (Soup) not more than 7 or 8 days past. This morning a very large Bear of [the] white Species, discovered us floating in the water and takeing us, as I prosume to be Buffalow imediately plunged into the river and prosued us. I directed the men to be still. this animal Came within about 40 yards of us, and tacked. about. we all fired into him without killing him, and the wind so high that we could not pursue hi[m], by which means he made his escape to the shore badly wounded. I have observed buffalow floating down which I suppose must have been drounded in crossing above. more or less of those animals drown or mire in passing this river. I observed several floating buffalow on the R. Rochejhone imediately below where large gangues had crossed. The wind blew hard all the after part of the day. I derected the men to dress their skins except one which I took with me and walkd. through the bottom the foot of the hills I killed five deer and the man with me killed 2. four others were killed in the course of the day by the party only 2 of those deer were fat owing as I suppose to the Musquetors which are so noumerous and troublesom to them that they cannot feed except under the torments of millions of those Musquetors. Saturday 7th. August 1806 Some hard rain this morning after daylight which wet us all. I formed a Sort of Camped and delayed untill 11 A. M. when it stoped raining for a short time. I directed everything put on board and proceeded on down. the rain continued at intervales all day tho' not hard in the evening saw a Bear on the bank but could not get a Shoot at it. at 6 P M. I landed on a Sand bar on the South Side and Campd. Soon after we landed the wind blew very hard for about 2 hours, when it lulled a little. the air was exceedingly clear and cold and not a musquetor to be seen, which is a joyfull circumstance to the Party. Sunday 8th. of August 1806 A cool windey morning I derected Shields and Gibson to turn out and hunt this morning. at 8 A.M. Sergt. N. Pryor Shannon, hall &amp; Windsor came down the river in two canoes made of Buffalow Skins. Sergt. Pryor informed me that the second night after he parted with me on the river Rochejhone he arived about 4 P.M. on the banks of a large creek which contained no running water. he halted to let the horses graze dureing which time a heavy shower of rain raised the creek so high that several horses which had stragled across the chanel of this creek was obliged to Swim back. here he deturmined to continue all night it being in good food for the horses. In the morning he could see no horses. in look.g about their Camp they discovered Several tracks within 100 paces of their Camp, which they pursued found where they had caught and drove off all the horses. they prosued on five miles the Indians there divided into two parties. they Continued in pursute of the largest party five miles further finding that there was not the Smallest chance of overtakeing them, they returned to their camp and packed up their baggage on their backs and Steared a N.E. course to the River Rochejhone which they Struck at pompys Tower, there they killed a Buffalow Bull and made a canoe (Shannon killed Bufl &amp; made a Canoe) in the form and shape of the mandans &amp; Ricares (the form of a bason) and made in the following manner. Viz: 2 Sticks of 1 1/4 inch diameter is tied together so as to form a round hoop of the size you wish the canoe, or as large as the Skin will allow to cover, two of those hoops are made one for the top or brim and the [other] for the bottom the deabth you wish the canoe, then Sticks of the same size are crossed at right angles and fastened with a throng to each hoop and also where each Stick crosses each other. then the Skin when green is drawn tight over this fraim and fastened with throngs to the brim or outer hoop so as to form a perfect bason. one of those canoes will carry 6 or 8 Men and their loads.1 1 Commonly known as "bull-boats," because made from (bull) buffalo hide.—Ed. Those two canoes are nearly the same size 7 feet 3 inches diameter &amp; 16 inches deep 15 ribs or cross Sticks in each. Sergt. Pryor informs me that the cause of his building two Canoes was for fear of one meating with some accedent in passing down the rochejhone a river entirely unknown to either of them by which means they might loose their guns and amunition and be left entirely destitute of the means of precureing food. he informed me that they passed through the worst parts of the rapids &amp; Shoals in the river without takeing a drop of water, and waves raised from the hardest winds dose not effect them. on the night of the 26th. ulto: the night after the horses had been stolen a Wolf bit Sergt. Pryor through his hand when asleep, and this animal was so vicious as to make an attempt to seize Windsor, when Shannon fortunately Shot him. Sergt. Pryers hand has nearly recovered. The country through which St. Pryor Passed after he parted with me is a broken open country. he passed one Small river which I have called Pryors river which (rises) in a Mtn. to the South of Pompys tower. The note I left on a pole at the Mouth of the River Rochejhone Sergt. Pryor concluding that Capt Lewis had passed took the note and brought it with him. Capt. Lewis I expect will be certain of my passing by the Sign which I have made and the encampment imediately in the point. Sergt. Pryor being anxious to overtake me Set out some time before day this morning and forgot his Saddlebags which contains his papers &amp;c. I Sent Bratten back with him in serch of them. I also sent Shannon over to hunt the bottom on the opposit Side. Shields and Gibson returned at 10 A.M. with the Skins and part of the flesh of three deer which they had killed in this bottom. I derected them to take one of the Skin Canoes and proceed down to the next bottom and [hunt] untill my arival which will be this evening if Sergt. Pryor returns in time. My object is to precure as many skins as possible for the purpose of purchaseing Corn and Beans of the Mandans. as we have now no article of Merchandize nor horses to purchase with, our only resort is Skins which those people were very fond [of] the winter we were Stationed near them. after dark Sergt. Pryor returned with his Saddlebeggs &amp;c. they were much further up than he expected. Monday 9th. August 1806 a heavy dew this morning. loaded the canoes and proceeded on down about 6 miles and landed at the Camp of the 2 hunters Shields and Gibson whome I had sent down to hunt last evening, they had killed five deer two of which were in good order which they brought in. here I took brackfast and proceeded on a fiew miles and I walked on Shore across a point of near 10 miles in extent in this bottom which was mostly open I saw some fiew deer and Elk. I killed 3 of the deer which were Meagure the Elk appeared fat. I did not kill any of them as the distance to the river was too great for the men to carry the meat at the lower part of this bottom a large creek of running water 25 yds wide falls in which meanders through an open roleing plain of great extent. in the low bottoms of this Creek I observed some timber Such as Cottonwood, ash &amp; Elm. on my arival at the lower part of the bottom found that the canoes had been in waiting for me nearly two hours. The Squaw brought me a (1800 Miles up the Missouri I found a) large and well flavoured Goose berry of a rich crimsin colour, and [a] deep purple berry of the large Cherry of the Current Species which is common on this river as low as the Mandans, the engagees call it the Indian Current. I landed opposit to a high plain on the S.E. side late in the evening and walked in a Grove of timber where I met with an Elk which I killed. this Elk was the largest Buck I ever Saw and the fattest animal which have been killed on the rout. I had the flesh and fat of this Elk brough to Camp and cut thin ready to dry. the hunters killed nothing this evening. Tuesday 10th: August 1806 (1800 Mile up Missouri) had the flesh of the elk hung on poles to dry, and sent out all the hunters. wind blew hard from the East all day. in the after part of the day it was (cloudy) &amp; a fiew drops of rain. I finished a copy of my Sketches of the River Rochejhone. Shields killed a black tail deer &amp; an antilope. the other hunters killed nothing. deer are very Scerce on this part of the river. I found a Species of Chery in the bottom the s[h]rub or bush [of] which are different from any which I have ever Seen and not very abundant even in this Small tract of country to which it seems to be confined. the Stem is compound erect and subdivided or branching without any regular order. it rises to the hight of 8 or 10 feet seldom putting out more than one Stem from the same root not growing in cops as the choke cherry does, the bark is Smooth and of a dark brown colour. the leaf is petialate, oval accutely pointed at it's apex, from 1 and a 1/4 to one and a 1/2 inch in length and from a half to 3/4 of an inch in wedth, finely or Manutely Serrate, pale green and free from pubessance. The fruit is a globular berry about the Size of a buck Shot of a fine Scarlet red; like the cherries cultivated in the U. States each is supported by a Seperate celindric flexable branch peduncle which issues from the extremities of the boughs. the peduncle of this cherry Swells as it approaches the fruit being largest at the point of insertion. the pulp of this fruit is of an agreeable ascid flavour and is now ripe. the Style and Stigma are permanent. I have never Seen it in blume. it is found on the high Stiff lands or hill Sides. the men dug great parcel of the root which the Nativs call Hankee and the engagees the white apple1 1 Also called "prairie potato" and "bread root"—Psoralea esculenta. It is a common and esteemed article of food among various tribes, especially the Sioux. See description and illustration of this root in U. S. Dept. of Agriculture Report, 1870, pp. 406, 408.—Ed. which they boiled and made use of with their meat. This is a large insipid root and very tasteless. the nativs use the root after it is dry and pounded in their Scup. Wednesday 11th. August 1806 I set out early this morning, at 10 A. M. landed on a Sand bar and brackfast dureing brackfast and my delay at this place which was 2 hours had the Elk meat exposed to the Sun. at Meridian I set out and had not proceeded more than 2 miles before I observed a canoe near the Shore. I derected the canoes to land here I found two men from the illinoies Jos. Dixon, and [blank space in MS.] Handcock those men are on a trapping expedition up the River Rochejhone. They inform me that they left the Illinois in the Summer 1804. the last winter they Spent with the Tetons in company with a Mr. Coartong (Qu: Ceautoin) who brought up goods to trade The tetons robed him of the greater part of the goods and wounded this Dixon in the leg with a hard wad. The Tetons gave Mr. Coartong some new robes for the articles they took from him. Those men further informed me that they met the Boat and party we Sent down from Fort Mandan near the Kanzas river on board of which was a chief of the Ricaras, that he met the Yankton chiefs with Mr. Deurion, McClellen &amp; Several other traders on their way down. that the Mandans and Menitarrais wer at war with the Ricaras and had killed two of the latter. the Assinniboins were also at war with the Mandans &amp;c. and had prohibited the N W. traders from comeing to the Missouri to trade. they have latterly killed one Trader near the Mous River and are now in wait for Mr. Mc. Kenzey one of the Clerks who have been for a long time with Menetarras.1 1 For this trader, see vol. i, pp. 227, 229, 277, ante.—Ed. Those dificulties if true will I fear be a bar to our expectations of having the Mandan Minetarra &amp; Ricara chief to acompany us to the U. States. Tho we shall endeaver to bring about a peace between Mandans Mennetarres &amp; Ricaras and provail on some of their Chiefs to accompany us to the U. States proceeded on to a point on the S W Side nearly opposit the enterance of Goat pen creek1 1 See vol. i, p. 313 ante, for the origin of this name. Probably it was Little Knife River, not far below which the two sections of the expedition were finally reunited.—Ed. and encamped found the Musquetors excessively troublesom. Thursday 12.th August 1806 I set out early this morning and had not proceeded on far before Shannon discovered he had lost his Tomahk. I derected him to land his Skin Canoe and go back to our camp of last night in serch of it, and proceeded on my self with the two wood and one Skin canoe to a large bottom on the N E. Side above the head of Jins (Qu: an) island and landed to take brackfast as well as to delay untill Shannon &amp; Gibson should arive. Sent out Shields &amp; Labiech to hunt deer in the bottom, at 2 P. M. Shannon and gibson arived having found the toma-hawk at our camp. they killed 3 Elk &amp;c. one of the canoes of Buffalow Skin by accident got a hole peirced in her of about 6 inches diameter. I derected two of the men to patch the canoe with a piece of Elk skin over the hole, which they did and it proved all sufficient, after which the Canoe did not leak one drop. The two hunters returned without haveing killed any thing. at Meridian Capt Lewis hove in Sight with the party which went by way of the Missouri as well as that which accompanied him from Travellers rest on Clarks river; I was alarmed on the landing of the Canoes to be informed that Capt. Lewis was wounded by an accident. I found him lying in the Perogue, he informed me that his wound was slight and would be well in 20 or 30 days this information relieved me very much. I examined the wound and found it a very bad flesh wound the ball had passed through the fleshey part of his left thy below the hip bone and cut the cheek of the right buttock for 3 inches in length and the debth of the ball. Capt. L. informed me the accident happened the day before by one of the men "Peter Crusat misstaking him in the thick bushes to be an Elk. Capt Lewis with this Crusat and several other men were out in the bottom Shooting of Elk, and had Scattered in a thick part of the woods in pursute of the Elk. Crusat seeing Capt L. passing through the bushes and taking him to be an Elk from the colour of his cloathes which were of leather and very nearly that of the Elk fired and unfortunately the ball passed through the thy as aforesaid. Capt. Lewis thinking it indians who had Shot him hobbled to the canoes as fast as possible and was followed by Crusat, the Mistake was then discovered. This Crusat is near Sighted and has the use of but one eye, he is an attentive industrious man and one whome we both have placed the greatest confidence in dureing the whole rout. After Capt. Lewis and myself parted at Trevellers rest, he with the Indians proceeded down the West Side of Clarks river seven miles and crossed on rafts 2 miles below the East fork 120 yards wide, after crossing the river he proceeded up the North Side of the east fork and encampd. here the Indians left him and proceeded down Clarks river in Serch of Tushepaws an Indian man came up with Capt L. from the W. of the mountains and proceeded on with those who had accompanied us Capt L. proceeded up the E. fork of Clarks river 17 M8. to the enterance of Cokahlarishkit river or the river to [the] buffalow, he proceeded up on the North Side of this river which is 60 yards wide crossing several small streams and the N. fork, passing over part of the dividing mountain onto the waters of Dearbourns river in the plains and in a Derection to the N. extremity of Easte range of rocky mountains which pass the Missouri at the pine Island Rapid. from thence he bore his course to the N E untill he Struck Meadicin river near where that river Enters the rocky Mts and proceeded down Medicine river to the Missouri at the white bear Islands at the upper part of the portage. this rout is a very good one tho not the most derect rout, the most derect rout would be to proceed up the Missouri above Dearborns river and take a right hand road &amp; fall on a South branch of the Cokatlarishkit R. and proceed down that river to the main road but the best rout would be from the falls of the Missouri by fort mountain and passing the N. extremity of that range of the Rocky Mountains which pass the Missouri at the pine Island rapid Course nearly S.W. and to the gap through which the great road passes the dividing Mountain the distance from the falls to this gap about 45 Miles through a tolerable leavel plain on an old indian road. and the distance from thence to Clarks river is 105 miles The total distance from the falls of the Missouri to Clarks river is only 150 miles of a tolerable road Capt L. arived at the white Bear Islands and encampd. on the West Side of the Missouri and in the morning he discovered that the Indians had taken of[f] seven of his best horses, drewyer prosued the indians two day's on the rout towards Clarks river. he Saw their camp on Dearborns river near the road on which Capt. Lewis &amp; party come on by a place where they had left only one or two day[s] at this encampment he Saw great appearance of horses on the return of Drewyer Capt L. took Drewyer &amp; the 2 fieldses &amp; proceeded on his intended rout up Marias river leaving Sergt. Gass, Thompson, Frazier, Werner, Mc Neal &amp; Goodrich at the portage to prepare Geer and repar the wheels &amp; carrage against the arival of the canoes and he also left 4 horses for the purpose of hauling the canoes across. The canoes arrived on the 16th, and on the 26th. they had all except one across, the Plains becom so muddy from the emence rains which had fallen, that they could not get her over the portage. on the 28th. they joined Capt. Lewis at the Grog Spring a fiew miles above the enterance of Marias river. From the Falls of Missouri Capt. L. proceeded on with Drewyer &amp; the 2 fieldses— Cours[e]s 17th July N.10°.

E. 4 Miles down Marias river and Met with 8 Indians of the Blackfoot nation with about 30 horses, those Indians professed friendship and Set out with him and encamped together the night of the night of the 26th. of July, they informed him that there was two large bands of their nation in that quarter one of which would be at the enterance of Marias river in a fiew days. they also informed that a french Trader was with one of those bands, that they traded with the white people on the Suskashwen River at 6 easy days march or about 150 miles distant from whome they precured Guns Powder Lead blankets &amp; in exchange for wolf and beaver Skins. Capt Lewis gave them a Flag Meadel &amp; Handkerchief. Capt. L. informed those Indians where he was from &amp; where he had been and his objects &amp; friendly views &amp;c. of which they appeared to be well satisfied. on the morning of the 27th. at day light the indians got up and crouded around the fire, Jo. Field who was on post had carelessly laid his gun down behind him near where his brother was sleeping. one of the Indians Slipd. behind him and took his gun and that of his brother unperceived by him, at the Same instant two others advanced and Seized the guns of Drewyer and Capt Lewis who were yet asleep. Jo. Fields seeing this turned about to take his gun and saw the fellow running off with his and his brothers, he called to his brother who instantly jumped up and prosued the indian with him whome they overtook at the distance of 50 or 60 paces Seized their guns and rested them from him and R. Field as he Seized his gun stabed the indian to the heart with his knife who fell dead; (this Capt L. did not know untill some time after. drewyer who awoke at the first alarm jumped up and Seized &amp; rested his gun from the indian &amp;c. Capt L. awoke and asked what was the matter, Seeing Drewyer in a scuffle for his gun he turned to get his gun and found her gorn, he drew a pistol from his holsters and prosued the Indian whom he saw in possession of his gun making off he presented the pistol and the indian lay down the gun. the two Fields came up and drew up to shoot the Indian which Capt L. forbid the indians then attempted to drive off all the horses. Capt L. derected the men to fire on them if they attempted to drive off the horses, and prosued two fellows who continued to drive of[f] his horses he Shot the Indian who had taken his gun and [was] then in possession of his horse through the belly, he fell and raised on his elbow and fired at Capt L. the other made his escape into a nitch out of Sight with his bow and arrows and as Capt L. guns was empty and he without his Shot pouch, he returnd. to the Camp where the 2 fields and Drewyer joined him having prosued the indians across the river the[y] were now in possession of the most of their own as well as the indian horses and a gun several bows &amp; arrows and all the indians baggage the gun &amp; some feathers and flag they took and burnt all the other articles. and Saddled up a[s] many of the best horses as they wished with Some Spear horses, and Set out for to intersept the party at Marias river and poeceded on a little to the S. of East 112 Miles to the Missouri at the Grog Spring. here they met with Canoes and party decending joined them leaving their horses on the river bank, and proceeded on to the enterance of Marias river opened the deposits, found Several articles damaged. 3 Beaver traps could not be found, the red perogue unfit for Service, from thence they proceeded without delay to the River Rochejhone see cources of Capt Lewis rout in next book. at 2 P.M.

August 1806 [Friday correct] THE last night was very cold with a Stiff breeze from the N.W. all hands were on board and we Set out at sunrize and proceeded on very well with a Stiff breeze astern the greater part of the day. passed the enterance of the Little Missouri river at 8 A. M. and arived at the Enterance of Myry river1 1 See vol. i, p. 290, ante.—Ed. at sun set and encamped on the N E Side haveing came by the assistance of the wind, the current and our oars 86 miles. below the little bason I with Drewyer walked through the N.E point, we Saw an Elk and Several deer. Drewyer wounded the Elk but could not get him. I joined the perogues &amp; party again in the bend below and proceeded on. Some indians were Seen in a Skin canoe below, they were decending from an old camp of theirs on the S.W. Side, those I suppose to be some of the Minetaras who had been up on a hunting expedition, one Canoe was left at their camp, we had not proceeded far before I discovered two indians on a high hill. nothing very remarkable took place, the Misquetors are not so troublesom this evening as they have been, the air is cool &amp;c. Thursday (Saturday) 14th: August 1806 Set out at Sunrise and proceeded on. when we were opposit the Minetares Grand Village2 2 The party missed by a few weeks a meeting with Alexander Henry, who remained at the Mandan and Minitaree villages during July 19–29; see his Journal (Coues's ed.), i, pp. 322–404. He mentions Lewis and Clark several times, and relates many interesting details regarding the Indian tribes at this place.—Ed. we Saw a number of the Nativs viewing of [us] we derected the Blunderbuses fired Several times, Soon after we Came too at a Croud of the nativs on the bank opposit the Village of the Shoe Indians or Mah-har-ha? at which place I saw the principal Chief of the Little Village of the Menitarre &amp; the principal Chief of the Mah-har-has. those people were extreamly pleased to See us. the chief of the little Village of the Menetarras cried Most imoderately, I enquired the cause and was informed it was for the loss of his Son who had been killed latterly by the Blackfoot Indians. after a delay of a fiew minits I proceeded on to the black cats (Mandan) Village on the N.E. side of the Missouri where I intended to Encamp but the Sand blew in Such a manner that we deturmined not to continue on that side but return to the side we had left. here we were visited by all the inhabitants of this village who appeared equally as well pleased to see us as those above. I walked up to the Black Cats village &amp; eate some simnins with him, and Smoked a pipe this Village I discovered had been rebuilt sin[c]e I left it and much smaller than it was; enquiring into the cause was informed that a quarrel had taken place and (a number of) Lodges had removed to the opposd. Side. I had soon as I landed despatched Shabono to the Minetarras inviting the Chiefs to visit us, &amp; Drewyer down to the lower Village of the Mandans to ask Mr. Jessomme to come and enterpret for us. Mr. Jessomme arived and I spoke to the chief of the Village informing them that we spoke to them as we had done when we were with them last and we now repeeted our invitation to the principal Chiefs of all the Villages to accompany us to the U States &amp;c. &amp;c. the Black Cat Chief of the Mandans, spoke and informed me that he wished to Visit the United States and his Great Father but was afraid of the Scioux who were yet at war with them and had killed several of their men since we had left them, and were on the river below and would certainly kill him if he attempted to go down. I indeavered to do away [with] his objections by informing him that we would not suffer those Indians to hurt any of our red children who should think proper to accompany us, and on their return they would be equally protected, and their presents which would be very liberal, with themselves, conveyed to their own Country at the expence of the U. States &amp;c &amp;c. The chief promised us some corn tomorrow. after the Council I directed the Canoes to cross the river to a brook opposit where we should be under the wind and in a plain where we would be clear of musquetors &amp;c. after crossing the Chief of the Mah-har-has told me if I would send with him he would let me have some corn. I directed Sergt Gass &amp; 2 men to accompany him to his Village, they Soon returned loaded with Corn. the Chief and his wife also came down. I gave his wife a fiew Needles &amp;c The Great Chief of all the Menitarras the one eye1 1 See vol. i, p. 270, ante.—Ed. came to camp also Several other Chiefs of the different Villages. I assembled all the Chiefs on a leavel Spot on the band[k] and spoke to them (see next book).2 2 Here ends the journal in Codex M; the remainder (four leaves) is occupied by the weather record for June–August, 1806, which we transfer to "Meteorology," in our vol. vi. The journal continues from this point in Codex N, also written by Clark, through August 15–September 26—the party having reached St. Louis on September 23.—Ed. Thursday August 15th. 1806 (continued) Mandans Vilg. after assembling the Chiefs and Smokeing one pipe, I informed them that I still Spoke the Same words which we had Spoken to them when we first arived in their Country in the fall of 1804. we then envited them to visit their great father the president of the U. States and to hear his own Councils and recieve his Gifts from his own hands as also See the population of a government which can at their pleasure protect and Secure you from all your enimies, and chastize all those who will shut their years to his Councils. we now offer to take you at the expense of our Government and Send you back to your Country again with a considerable present in Merchendize which you will receive of your great Father. I urged the necessity of their going on with us as it would be the means of hastening those Suppl[i]es of Merchindize which would be Sent to their Country and exchanged as before mentioned for a moderate price in Pelteries and furs &amp;c. the great chief of the Menetaras Spoke, he Said he wished to go down and see his great father very much, but that the Scioux were in the road and would most certainly kill him or any others who should go down they were bad people and would not listen to any thing which was told them. when he Saw us last we told him that we had made peace with all the nations below, Since that time the Seioux had killed 8 of their people and Stole a number of their horses. he Said that he had opened his ears and followed our Councils, he had made peace with the Chyennes and rocky Mountains indians, and repieted the same objecctions as mentioned. that he went to war against none and was willing to recieve all nations as friends. he Said that the Ricaras had Stolen from his people a number of horses at different times and his people had killed 2 Ricaras. if the Sieoux were at peace with them and could be depended on he as also other Chiefs of the villages would be glad to go and See their great father, but as they were all afraid of the Sieoux they should not go down &amp;c. The Black Cat Chief of the Mandans Village on the North Side of the Missouri sent over and requested me to go over to his village which invertation I axceptd and crossed over to his Village. he had a parcel of corn about 12 bushels in a pile in his lodge. he told me that his people had but little corn part of which they had given me. after takeing a Smoke he informed me that as the Scioux were very troublesom and the road to his great father dangerous none of this village would go down with us. I told the Cheifs and wariers of the village who were then present that we were anxious that some of the village Should go and See their great father and hear his good words &amp; receve his bountifull gifts &amp;c. and told them to pitch on Some Man on which they could rely on and Send him to see their Great father, they made the same objections which the Chief had done before. a young man offered to go down, and they all agreed for him to go down the charactor of this young man I knew as a bad one and made an objection as to his age and Chareckter at this time Gibson who was with me informed me that this young man had Stole his knife and had it then in his possession, this I informed the Chief and directed him to give up the knife he delivered the knife with a very faint apology for his haveing it in his possession. I then reproached those people for wishing to send such a man to See and hear the words of so great a man as their great father, they hung their heads and said nothing for some time when the Cheif spoke and Said that they were afraid to Send any one for fear of their being killed by the Sieux. after smoking a pipe and relateing some passages I recrossed to our Camp. being informed by one of our enterpreters that the 2d. Chief of the Mandans comonly called the little crow1 1 This is the chief Kagohanis, or Little Raven; see vol. i, p. 212, ante.—Ed. intended to accompany us down, I took Charbono and walked to the Village to see this Chief and talk with him on the subject he told me he had deturmined to go down, but wished to have a council first with his people which would be in the after part of the day. I smoked a pipe with the little Crow and returned to the boat. Colter one of our men expressed a desire to join Some trappers [the two Illinois Men we met, &amp; who now came down to us] who offered to become shearers with [him] and furnish traps &amp;c. the offer [was] a very advantagious one, to him, his services could be dispenced with from this down and as we were disposed to be of service to any one of our party who had performed their duty as well as Colter had done, we agreed to allow him the privilage provided no one of the party would ask or expect a Similar permission to which they all agreeed that they wished Colter every suckcess and that as we did not wish any of them to Seperate untill we Should arive at St. Louis they would not apply or expect it &amp;c.2 2 Colter remained on the upper rivers and in the mountains until the spring of 1810, during which time he had many adventures—the most perilous of which was his capture by the Blackfoot Indians, and his race against them for his life, with which he barely escaped. On returning to St. Louis (1810) he gave valuable geographical information to William Clark, which the latter used in his large map of the Great West, published in the Biddle edition. Colter was the first explorer of a considerable region, including notably the Yellowstone National Park. See account of his life and explorations in Chittenden, Amer. Fur Trade, ii, pp. 713–723; Wheeler, Trail of Lewis and Clari, i, pp. 98–105.—Ed. The Maharha Chief brought us Some Corn, as did also the Chief of the little village of the Menetarras on mules of which they have Several. [bought from the Crow. Inds. who get or Steal them from the Spaniards] The evening is cool and windy. great number of the nativs of the different villages came to view us and exchange robes with our men for their Skins we gave Jo Colter Some Small articles which we did not want and some powder &amp; lead. the party also gave him several articles which will be usefull to him on his expedittion. This evening Charbono informed me that our back was scercely turned before a war party from the two menetarry villages followed on and attacked and killed the Snake Indians whome we had seen and in the engagement between them and the Snake Indians they had lost two men one of which was the Son of the principal Chief of the little village of the Menitarras. that they had also went to war from the Menetarras and killed two Ricaras. he further informed me that a missunderstanding had taken place between the Mandans &amp; Minetarras and had very nearly come to blows about a woman, the Menitarres at length presented a pipe and a reconsilliation took place between them. Friday 16th. August 1806 a cool morning. Sent up Sergt. Pryor to the Mandan village for some corn which they offered to give us. he informed that they had more corn collected for us than our Canoes could carry six load of which he brought down. I thanked the Chief for his kindness and informed him that our canoes would not carry any more corn than we had already brought down. at 10 A.M. the Chiefs of the different villages came to see us and smoke a pipe &amp;c. as our swivel could no longer be Serveceable to us as it could not be fireed on board the largest Perogue, we concluded to make a present of it to the Great Chief of the Menitaras (the One Eye) with a view to ingratiate him more Strongly in our favour I had the Swivel Charged and Collected the Chiefs in a circle around it and adressed them with great ceremoney. told them I had listened with much attention to what the One Eye had Said yesterday and beleived that he was sincere &amp; Spoke from his heart. I reproached them very severely for not attending to what had been said to them by us in council in the fall of 1804 and at different times in the winter of 1804 &amp; 5, and told them our backs were scercely turned befor a party followed and killed the pore defenceless Snake indians whom we had taken by the hand &amp; told them not to be afraid that you would never them Strike again &amp;c. also mentioned the ricer[a]s &amp;c. The little cherry old Chief of the Menetarras1 1 Apparently Caltarcota, or Cherry growing on a bush; see vol. i, p. 213, ante.—Ed. spoke as follows Viz: "Father we wish to go down with you to See our Great Father, but we know the nations below and are afraid of the Scioux who will be on the river and will kill us on our return home. The Scioux has Stolen our horses and killed 8 of our men Since you left us, and the Ricaras have also Struck us. we Staid at home and listened to what you had told us. we at length went to war against the Scioux and met with Ricaras and killed two of them, they were on their way to strike us. We will attend to your word and not hurt any people all Shall be Welcom and we Shall do as you direct." The One Eye said his ears would always be open to the word of his great father and Shut against bad council &amp;c. I then [with] a good deel of ceremony made a preasent of the swivel to the One Eye Chief, and told him when he fired this gun to remember the words of his great father which we had given him. this gun had anounced the words of his great father to all the nations which we had seen &amp;c. &amp;c. after the council was over the gun was fired &amp; delivered, they chief appeared to be much pleased and conveyed it immediately to his village &amp;c. we Settled with and discharged colter. in the evening I walked to the village to see the little crow and know when he would be ready, took with me a flag intending to give him to leave at his lodge but to my astonishment he informed me he had declined going down the reason of which I found was through a jellousy between himself and the principal Chief. he refused a flag &amp; we Sent for Mr. Jessomme and told him to use his influence to prevail on one of the Chiefs to accompany us and we would employ him. he informed us soon after that the big white Chief would go if we would take his wife &amp; Son &amp; Jessoms wife &amp; 2 children [which] we wer[e] obliged to agree to do Saturday 17th. of August 1806 a cool morning gave some powder &amp; Ball to Big White Chief Settled with Touisant Chabono for his services as an enterpreter the price of a horse and Lodge purchased of him for public Service in all amounting to 500$ 33 1/3 cents. derected two of the largest of the Canoes be fastened together with poles tied across them So as to make them Study [steady] for the purpose of Conveying the Indians and enterpreter and their families we were visited by all the principal Chiefs of the Menetarras to take their leave of us at 2 oClock we left our encampment after takeing leave of Colter who also Set out up the river in company with Messrs. Dickson &amp; Handcock.1 1 On the fly-leaf of Codex L is the following memorandum: "Joseph Dickson [and] Forrest Hancock. from the Illinois the former the latter from Boon's settlement;" see pp. 242, 243, note, ante.—Ed. we also took our leave of T. Chabono, his Snake Indian wife and their child [son] who had accompanied us on our rout to the pacific ocean in the capacity of interpreter and interprete[s]s. T. Chabono wished much to accompany us in the said Capacity if we could have prevailed [upon] the Menetarre Chiefs to dec[e]nd the river with us to the U. States, but as none of those Chiefs of whoes language he was Conversent would accompany us, his services were no longer of use to the U. States and he was therefore discharged and paid up.2 2 The interpreter, who intends settling among these Indians, and to whom they [Lewis and Clark] gave the blacksmith's tools, supposing they might be useful to the nation.—Gass (p. 366). See Appendix, in our vol. vii, for letter written to Charbonneau by Clark, three days later.—Ed. we offered to convey him down to the Illinois if he chose to go, he declined proceeding on at present, observing that he had no acquaintance or prospects of makeing a liveing below, and must continue to live in the way that he had done. I offered to take his little son a butifull promising child who is 19 months old to which they both himself &amp; wife wer willing provided the child had been weened. they observed that in one year the boy would be sufficiently old to leave his mother &amp; he would then take him to me if I would be so freindly as to raise the child for him in such a manner as I thought proper, to which I agreeed &amp;c. we droped down to the Big White Cheifs Mandan village ? a mile below on the South Side, all the Indians proceeded on down by land. and I walked to the lodge of the Chief whome I found sorounded by his friends the men were Setting in a circle Smokeing and the womin crying. he Sent his baggage with his wife &amp; son, with the Interpreter Jessomme &amp; his wife and 2 children to the Canoes provided for them. after Smokeing one pipe, and distributing some powder &amp; lead which we had given him, he informed me that he was ready and we were accompd. to the Canoes by all the village Maney of them Cried out aloud.1 1 See p. 393, note 3, post, for data relative to Shahaka (Big White, Fr. Le Blanc), and his subsequent adventures.—Ed. as I was about to shake with the Grand Cheifs of all the villages there assembled they requested me to Set one minit longer with them which I readily agreed to and directed a pipe to be lit. the Cheifs informed that when we first came to their Country they did not beleive all we Said we then told them, but they were now convinced that every thing we had told them were true, that they should keep in memory every thing which we had said to them, and Strictly attend to our advice, that their young men Should Stay at home and Should no[t] go again to war against any nation, that if any atacted them they should defend themselves, that we might depend on what they said, and requested us to inform their great father. the also requested me to tell the Ricaras to come and see them, not to be afraid that no harm Should be done them, that they were anxious to be in peace with them. The Seeoux they said they had no dependance in and Should kill them whenever they came into their country to do them harm &amp;c. I told them that we had always told them to defend themselves, but not to strike those nations we had taken by the hand, the Sieoux with whome they were at war we had never seen on our return we Should inform their great father of their conduct towards his faithfull red children and he would take Such Steps as will bring about a lasting peace between them and his faithfull red children. I informed them that we should inform the ricaras what they had requested &amp;c. The Grand Chief of the Minetarres said that the Great Cheif who was going down with [us] to see their great father was a[s] well as if he went also, and on his return he would be fully informed of the words of his great father, and requested us to take care of this Gt. Chief. we then saluted them with a gun and set out and proceeded on to Fort Mandan where I landed and went to view the old works the houses except one in the rear bastion was burnt by accident, some pickets were standing in front next to the river.1 1 The erosion of the river wore away the site of Fort Mandan, and when Prince Maximilian visited this country in 1833 there was not the smallest trace of the post. See Thwaites, Early Western Travels, xxii–xxiv.—Ed. we proceeded on to the old Ricara village the S E wind was so hard and the waves so high that we were obliged to come too, &amp; camp on the S W Side near the old Village (18 Mil[e]s) Monday 18th. August 1806 moderate rain last night, the wind of this morning from the S.E. as to cause the water to be so rough that we could not proceed on untill 8 a.m. at which time it fell a little &amp; we proceeded on tho' the waves were yet high and the wind Strong. Saw Several Indians on either side of the river. at 9 A.M. I saw an Indian running down the beech and appd. to be anxious to speak to us I derected the Canoes to land. this Indian proved to be the brother of the Chief we had on board and came down from his Camp at no great distance to take his leave of his brother. the Chief gave him a par of Legins and took an effectunate leave of his brother and we procedeed on haveing previously sent on 2 canoes with hunters to kill some meat at 2 P.M. we overtook the Canoe hunters, they had killed three deer which was divided and we halted and cooked some dinner on the Sandbar. wind still high and from the same point. The Chief pointed out Several places where he Said his nation formerly lived and related some extroadinary Stories of their tredition. after Dinner we proceeded on to a point on the NE. side opposit the remains of an old Mandan village a little below the enterance of Chiss-che-tor [Heart] River and the place we Encamped as we assended this river 20th. of October 1804 haveing come 40 miles to day.1 1 See vol. i, p. 201, note 2, ante.—Ed. after landing which was a little before night the hunters run out into the bottom and Killed four deer. The winds blew hard from the S.E. all day which retarded our progress very much after the fires were made I set my self down with the bigwhite man Chiefe and made a number of enquiries into the tredition of his nation as well as the time of their inhabiting the number of villages the remains of which we see on different parts of the river, as also the cause of their evacuation. he told me his nation first came out of the ground where they had a great village. a grape vine grew down through the Earth to their village and they Saw light Some of their people assended by the grape vine upon the earth, and saw Buffalow and every kind of animal also Grapes plumbs &amp;c. they gathered some grapes &amp; took down the vine to the village, and they tasted and found them good, and deturmined to go up and live upon earth, and great numbers climbed the vine and got upon earth men womin and children. at length a large big bellied woman in climbing broke the vine and fell and all that were left in the village below has remained there ever since (The Mandans beleive when they die that they return to this village)2 2 Maximilian (op. cit.) gives a tradition similar to this, which he says occurred after a great deluge.—Ed. Those who were left on earth made a village on the river below and were very noumerous &amp;c. he said that he was born [about 40 years] [ago] in the Village Opposit to our camp and at that time his nation inhabited 7 villages as large as that and were full of people, the Sieoux and Smallpox killed the greater part of them and made them so weak that all that were left only made two small villages when collected, which were built near the old Ricaras village above, their troubles with the Seeoux &amp; Pawnees or Ricaras Compelled them to move and build a village where they now live. [Qu: The Village of the Mandans on the North East side was formed of two villages [who] formerly lived on the East side opposite the 7. War &amp; Small pox reduced them to one vill which crossed &amp; joined the 2 vills. near ricaras haveing first settled (before the 7 came into 2) on East side Then they moved with the 2 to where they now live, so that the vills originally was of 9 vills (See Note)] he Said that the Menitarras Came out of the water to the East and came to this country and built a village near the mandans from whome they got corn beens &amp;c. they were very noumerous and resided in one village a little above this place on the opposit side. they quarreled about a buffalow, and two bands left the village and went into the plains, (those two bands are now known bye the title Pounch, and Crow Indians.1 1 On the relation between the Minitaree and the Crow, see our vol. i, p. 130, note 2; p. 208, note 2.—Ed. the ballance of the Menetaras moved their village to where it now Stands where they have lived ever Since Tuesday 19th. of August 1806 Some rain last night and this morning the wind rose and blew with great Violence untill 4 P.M. and as our camp was on a Sand bar we were very much distressd with the clouds of sand. I directed the hunters to proceed on down the bottom and kill and butcher some meat and if the wind Should lie that I should proceed on down to their Camp &amp;c. Capt. Lewis'es wounds are heeling very fast, I am much in hope of his being able to walk in 8 or 10 days. at 4 P.M. the wind seased to blow with that violence which it had done all day we Set out and proceeded on down. the hunters which was sent out this morning killed 4 Elk &amp; 12 deer near the river we came too and brought in the most of the flesh and proceeded on to a Sand [bar] on the N E Side and Encamped. the wind rose and become very strong from the S.E. and a great appearance of rain. Jessomme the Interpreter let me have a piece of a lodge and the Squars pitched or Stretched it over Some Sticks, under this piece of leather I Slept dry, it is the only covering which I have had Sufficient to keep off the rain Since I left the Columbia. it began to rain moderately soon after night. The indians appear well satisfyed with the party and mode of proceedure. we decended only 10 Miles to day saw some Elk and buffalow on the Shore near where we Encamped. the Elk beginning to run. the Buffalow are done running &amp; the bulls are pore. Wednesday 20th. of August 1806 a violent hard rain about day light this morning. all wet except myself and the indians. we embarked a little after Sun rise wind moderate and ahead. we proceeded on at Meridn. passed the enterance of cannonball river imediately above is the remains of a large Sieoux encampment which appears to have been made this Spring. at 3 P M passed the enterance of Wardepon1 1 Written Warreconne, when the explorers first saw this stream (Oct. 16, 1804); now Big Beaver Creek. See vol. i, p. 195, ante.—Ed. River [Scioux boundary to which they claim the country] Saw great number of wolves on the bank some Buffalow &amp; Elk, tho' not so abundant as near the River Rochejhone. passed the place where we left the last encampment of Ricaras in the fall 1804 and encamped on a Sandbar from the N.E. Side, haveing made 81 miles only, the wind blew hard all day which caused the waves to rise high and flack over into the Small Canoes in such a manner as to employ one hand in throwing the water out. The plains begin to change their appearance the grass is turning of a yellow colour. I observe a great alteration in the Current course and appearance of this pt. of the Missouri. in places where there was Sand bars in the fall 1804 at this time the main current passes, and where the current then passed is now a Sand bar. Sand bars which were then naked are now covered with willow several feet high. the enterance of some of the Rivers &amp; creeks changed owing to the mud thrown into them, and a layor of mud over some of the bottoms of 8 inches thick. Thursday 21th. August 1806 Musquetors very troublesom in the early part of last night and again this morning I directed Sergt. Ordway to proceed on to where there was some ash and get enough for two ores which were wanting. Men all put their arms in perfect order and we set out at 5 a.m. over took Sergt. ordway with wood for oars &amp;c. at 8 A.M. Met three frenchmen Comeing up, they proved to be three men from the Ricaras two of them Reeved1 1 Among the first settlers of the State of Oregon were two old Frenchmen who claimed to have been with the expedition of Lewis and Clark; one of them was Francis Rivet.—Eva E. Dye. See our vol. i, p. 283, note 2.—Ed. &amp; Greinyea wintered with us at the mandans in 1804 we Came too, those men informed us that they were on their way to the Mandans, and intended to go down to the Illinois this fall. one of them quit[e] a young lad2 2 A young man who formerly belonged to the Northwest Company of traders.— Gass (p. 368). requested a passage down to the Illinois, we concented and he got into a Canoe to [ply]an Ore. Those men informd. us that 700 Seeoux had passed the Ricaras on their way to war with the Mandans &amp; Menitarras and that their encampment where the Squaws and children wer, was Some place near the Big Bend of this river below. no ricaras had accompanied them but were all at home, they also informed us that no trader had arived at the Ricaras this Season, and that they were informed that the Pania or Ricara Chief who went to the United States last Spring was a year, died on his return at Some place near the Sieoux river &amp;c.3 3 See our vol. i, pp. 283, 286.—Ed. those men had nether powder nor lead we gave them a horn of powder and some balls and after a delay of an hour we parted from the 2 men Reevey &amp; Grienway and proceeded on. the wind rose and bley[w] from the N.W. at half past 11 a.m. we arived in view of the upper Ricara villages, a Great number of womin Collecting wood on the banks, we Saluted the village with four guns and they returned the Salute by fireing Several guns in the village, I observed Several very white Lodges on the hill above the Town which the ricaras from the Shore informed me were Chyennes who had just arived.4 4 For the Cheyenne, see our vol. i, p. 172, note 2.—Ed. we landed opposit to the 2d. Village and were met by the most of the men women and children of each village as also the Chyennes, they all appeared anxious to take us by the hand and much rejoiced to See us return. I steped on Shore and was Saluted by the two great Chiefs, whome we had made or given Medals to as we assend[ed] this river in 1804, and also Saluted by a great number both of Ricaras &amp; Chyennes, as they appeared anxious to here what we had done &amp;c. as well as to here Something about the Mandans &amp; Menetarras. I Set my self down on the Side of the Bank and the Chiefs &amp; brave men of the Ricaras &amp; Chyennes formed a cercle around me. after takeing a Smoke of Mandan tobacco which the Big white Chief who was seated on my left hand furnished, I informed them as I had before informed the Mandans &amp; Menitarras, where we had been, what we had done and said to the different nations in there favour and envited Some of their chiefs to accompany us down and See their great father and receve from his own mouth his good councils and from his own hands his bountifull gifts &amp;c. telling pretty much the Same which I had told the mandans and menitarras. told them not to be afraid of any nation below that none would hurt them &amp;c. a man of about 32 years of age was intreduced to me as the 1st Cheif of the nation this man they call the grey eyes1 1 Grey Eyes (Les Yeux Gris) was met by Bradbury upon his expedition to the Upper Missouri in 1811. See Thwaites, Early Western Travels, v, p. 130. This same chief was killed by Leavenworth's artillery, which shelled the villages in 1823; the officers were told that he had been the instigator of the opposition of his tribe to the white traders.—Ed. or [blank space in MS.] he was absent from the Nation at the time we passed up, the man whome we had acknowledged as the principal chief informed me that the Grey eyes was a greater Chief than himself and that he had given up all his pretentions with the Flag and Medal to the Grey eyes. The principal chief of the Chyenne's [Ricaras] was then introduced he is a Stout jolley fellow of about 35 years of age whome the Ricaras call the Grey Eyes I also told the ricaras that I was very sorrey to here that they were not on friendly terms with their neighbours the Mandans &amp; Menetarras, and had not listened to what we had said to them but had Suffered their young men to join the Sieoux who had killed 8 Mandans &amp;c. that their young men had Stolen the horses of the Minetarras, in retaliation for those enjories the Mandans &amp; Menetarras had sent out a war party and killed 2 ricaras. how could they expect other nations would be at peace with them when they themselves would not listen to what their great father had told them. I further informed them that the Mandans &amp; Menetaras had opened their ears to what we had said to them but had Staid at home untill they were Struck that they were still disposed to be friendly and on good terms with the ricaras, they then Saw the great chief of the Mandans by my Side who was on his way to see his great father, and was derected by his nation &amp; the Menetaras &amp; Maharhas, to Smoke in the pipe of peace with you and to tell you not to be afraid to go to their towns, or take the Birds in the plains that their ears were open to our councils and no harm Should be done to a Ricara. The Chief will speak presently. The Grey eyes Chief of the ricaras made a very animated Speach in which he mentioned his willi[ng]ness of following the councels which we had given them that they had some bad young men who would not listen to the councels but would join the Seioux, those men they had discarded and drove out of their villages, that the Sieoux were the cause of their Missunderstanding &amp;c. that they were a bad peoples, that they had killed Several of the Ricaras Since I Saw them That Several of the chiefs wished to accompany us down to See their great father, but wi[s]hed to see the Chief who went down last Sumer return first, he expressed some apprehention as to the Safty of that chiefs in passing the Sieoux. that the Ricaras had every wish to be friendly with the Mandans &amp;c. that every mandan &amp;c. who chose to visit the ricares should be Safe that he Should continue with his nation and See that they followed the council which we had given them &amp;c. The Sun being very hot the Chyenne Chief envited us to his Lodge which was pitched in the plain at no great distance from the River. I accepted the invitation and accompanied him to his lodge which was new and much larger than any which I have Seen it was made of 20 dressed Buffalow Skins in the Same form of the Seeoux and lodges of other nations of this quarter about this lodges was 20 others several of them of nearly the Same Size. I enquired for the ballance of the nation and was informed that they were near at hand and would arive on tomorrow and when all together amounted to 120 Lodges. after Smokeing I gave a medal of the Small size to the Chyenne Chief &amp;c. which appeared to alarm him, he had a robe and a fleece of fat Buffalow meat brought and gave me with the meadel back and informed me that he knew that the white people were all medecine and that he was afraid of the midal or any thing that white people gave to them.1 1 The Big Bellies pretended to say that these ornaments conveyed bad medicine to them and their children. They are exceedingly superstitious, and, therefore, supposed that they could not better dispose of those articles than by giving them to the natives with whom they frequently warred, in hope the ill-luck would be conveyed to them. They were disgusted at the high-sounding language the American captains bestowed upon themselves and their own nation . . . these haughty savages, who have too high an opinion of themselves to entertain the least idea of acknowledging any race to be their superiors.—Alexander Henry (Journal, Coues's ed., i, p. 350). I had previously explained the cause of my g[i]veing him the medal &amp; flag, and again told him the use of the medal and the caus[e] of my giveing it to him, and again put it about his neck delivering him up his preasent of a roab &amp; meat, informing him that this was the medecene which his Great father directed me to deliver to all the great chiefs who listened to his word and followed his councils, that he had done so and I should leave the medal with him as a token of his cincerity &amp;c. he doubled the quantity of meat, and received the medal The Big White chief of the Mandans Spoke at some length explaining the cause of the Misunderstanding between his nation and the ricaras, informing them of his wish to be on the most friendly termes &amp;c. the Chyennes accused both nations of being in folt [fault]. I told to them all that if they wished to be hapy that they must Shake off all intimecy with the Seioux and unite themselves in a Strong allience and attend to what we had told them &amp;c. which they promesed all to do and we Smoked and parted on the best terms, the Mandan Chief was Saluted by Several Cheifs and brave men on his way with me to the river. I had requested the ricaras &amp; Chyennes to inform me as Soon as possible of their intentions of going down with us to see their great father or not. in the evening the Great Chief requested that I would walk to his house which I did, he gave me about 2 quarts (carrots) of Tobacco, 2 beaver Skins and a trencher of boiled corn &amp; beans to eat (as it is the custom of all the Nations on the Missouri to give Something to every white man who enters their lodge something to eat) this chief informed me that none of his chiefs wished to go down with us they all wished to see the cheif who went down return first, that the Chyennes were a wild people and were afraid to go. that they Should all listen to what I had said. I gave him Some ribon to Suspend his Medal to and a Shell which the Snake indians gave me for which he was very much pleased. The interpreter informed me that the cheifs of those villages had no intention of going down one the cheifs of the village on the island talkd. of going down. I returned to the boat where I found the principal chief of the lower vilege who had cut part of his hair and disfigured himself in Such a manner that I did not know him, he informed me the Seeux had killed his nephew and that [he] Was in tears for him &amp;c. we deturmined to proceed down to the Island and accordingly took the chief on board and proceeded on down to the 1sd. village at which place we arived a little before dark and were met as before by nearly every individual of the Village, we Saluted them and landed imediately opposit the town. The one arm 2d. Cheif of this village whome we had expected to accompany us down Spoke to the mandan Cheif in a loud and thretening tone which caused me to be Some what alarmed for the Safty of that cheif, I inform the Ricaras of this village that the Mandans had opened their ears to and fold. our councils, that this cheif was on his way to see their Great Father the P. of U S. and was under our protection that if any enjorey was done to him by any nation that we Should all die to a man. I told the Ricaras that they had told us lies, they promised to be at peace with the mandans &amp; Menetarras. that our back was Scercely turned before they went to war &amp; Killd. them and Stole their horses &amp;c. The Cheif then envited me &amp; the Mandan Chief to his house to talk there. I accompanied him, after takeing a very Serimonious Smoke the 2d. Cheif informd. me that he had opened his ears to what we had said to him at the time we gave him the medal that we had not been to war against any Natn. since, that [he had] once been to See the mandans and they were going to kill him, they had not killed the Mandans it was the Seeoux who killed them and not the ricaras, he Said that the Mandan cheif was as Safe as if he was in his own vilg that he had opened his ears and could here as well as the mandans. I then informd them what I had told the upper villages and we all become perfectly reconsiled all to each other and Smoked in the most perfect harmony we had invatations to go into their lodges and eate. I at length went to the grand chiefs Lodge by his particular invitation, the Mandan chief Stuck close to me the Chief had prepd. a Supper of boiled young corn, beens &amp; [s]quashes of which he gave me in Wooden bowls he also gave me near 2 quarts of the Tobacco (Seed), &amp; informed me he had always had his ears open to what we had Said, that he was well convinced that the Seeoux was the caus[e] of all the trouble between the Mandans &amp; them the Ricaras had Stolen horses from the Mandan which had been returned all except one which could not be got, this mischief was done by some young men who was bad. a long conversation of explanations took place between the Ricara &amp; mandan chiefs which appeared to be Satisfactory on both Sides. the Chief gave a pipe with great form and every thing appeared to be made up. I returned to the river &amp; went to bead. the Indians contd. on board. made 22 miles to day only. Friday 22nd. August 1806 rained all the last night every person and all our bedding wet, the morning cloudy, at 8 A.M. I was requested to go to the Chiefs, I walkd up and he informed me that he Should not go down but would Stay and take care of the village and prevent the young men from doing rong and Spoke much to the Same porpt of the Grey Eyes, the 2d. chief Spoke to the Same and all they Said was only a repitition of what they had Said before. the Chief gave me some Soft corn and the 2d chief Some Tobacco seed. the Interpreter Garrow1 1 For this man, see our vol. 1, pp. 7, 272.—Ed. informed me that he had been Speeking to the chiefs &amp; warries this morning and assured me that they had no intention of going down untill the return of the cheif who went down last Spring was a year. I told the cheifs to attend to what we had Said to them, that in a Short time they would find our words true and councils good, they promised to attend Strictly to what had been Said to them, and observed that they must trade with the Sieoux one more time to get guns and powder; that they had no guns or powder and had more horses than they had use for, after they got guns and powder that they would never again have any thing to do with them &amp;c. &amp;c. I returned [to] the canoes &amp; derected the men to prepare to Set out. Some chyennes from two Lodges on the Main S E Shore came and Smoked with me and at 11 A.M. we Set out haveing parted with those people who appeared to be Sorry to part with us. at this nation we found a french man by the name of Rokey who was one of our Engagees as high as the Mandans this man had Spend all his wages, and requested to return with us we agreed to give him a passage down. I directed 2 guns to be fired. we proceeded on passed the Marapa and the We ter hoo [Grand] Rivers, and landed to dry our bedding and robes &amp;c which were all wet. here we delayed untill 6 P.M. and dryed our things which were much Spoiled I derected 5 of the hunters to proceed on to grouse Island a fiew miles below and hunt on that island untill we arived, we proceeded on to the Main N E Shore below the Island and encamped, the hunters joined us without any thing. they Saw no game on the island. we made only 17 Miles to day below the ricaras the river Widens and the Sand bars are emencely noumerous much less timber in the bottoms than above The Chyenne's are portly Indians much the complections of the Mandans &amp; ricaras high Cheeks, Streight limbed [&amp; high noses] the men are large, their dress in Sumner is Simpelly a roab of a light buffalow Skin with or without the hair and a Breach clout [&amp; mockerson] Some ware leagins and mockersons, their ornaments are but fiew and those are composed principally of such articles as they precure from other indians Such as blue beeds, Shell, red paint rings of brass broaches &amp;c. they also ware Bears claws about their necks, Strips of otter Skin (which they as well as the ricaras are excessively fond of) around their neck[s] falling back behind. their ears are cut at the lower part, but fiew of them wore ornements in them, their hair is generally cut in the forehead above their eyes and Small ornimented plats in front of each Sholder the remainder of the hair is either twisted in with horse or buffalow hair divided into two plats over the Sholder or what is most common flow's back, Their women are homely, corse feetured wide mouths they ware simpially a leather habit made in a plain form of two pieces of equal length and equal weadth, which is sewn together with Sinues from the tail to about half way from the hip to the arm, a String fastens the 2 pieces together over the Sholders leaveing a flap or lapells which fall over near half way [down] their body both before and behind. those dresses usially fall as low as mid leg, they are frequently ornemented with beeds and shells &amp; Elk tuskes of which all Indians are very fond of, those dresses are als[o] frequently Printed in various regular figures with hot sticks which are rubed on the leather with Such velosity as to nearly burn it this is very handsom. they were their hair flowing and are excessively fond of ornimenting their ears with blue beeds. this nation [is] peceably disposed they may be estimated at from 350 to 400 men inhabiting from 130 to 150 Lodges, they are rich in horses &amp; Dogs, the dogs carry a great preportion of their light baggage. they confess to be at war with no nation except the Sieoux with whome they have ever since their remembrance been on a difencive war, with the Bands of Sieoux. as I was about to leave the cheifs [of the Chyennes] lodge he requested me to Send Some traders to them, that their country was full of beaver and they would then be encouraged to kill beaver, but now they had no use for them as they could get nothing for their skins and did not know well, how to catch beaver. if the white people would come amongst them they would become acquainted and they [the white people] would learn them how to take the beaver. I promised the Nation that I would inform their Great father the President of the U States, and he would have them Supplied with goods, and mentioned in what manner they would be Supplied &amp;c. &amp;c. I am happy to have it in my power to Say that my worthy friend Capt. Lewis is recovering fast, he walked a little to day for the first time. I have discontinu[e]d the tent in the hole the ball came out I have before mentioned that the Mandans Maharhas Menetarras &amp; Ricarras, keep their horses in the Lodge with themselves at night. Saturday 23rd. August 1806 We Set out very early, the wind rose &amp; became very hard, we passed the Sar-war-kar-na-har [Owl, or Moreau] river at 10 A.M. and at half past eleven the wind became so high and the water so rough that we were obliged to put to Shore and continue untill 3 p.m. when we had a Small Shower of rain after which the wind lay, and we proceeded on. soon after we landed I sent Shields &amp; Jo. &amp; Reubin Fields down to the next bottom of timber to hunt untill our arival. we proceeded on Slowly and landed in the bottom. the hunters had killed three Elk and 3 Deer the deer were pore and Elk not fat had the[m] fleece[d] &amp; brought in. the Musqueters large and very troublesom. at 4 P.M. a cloud from the N W with a violent rain for about half an hour after the rain we again proceeded on. I observe great quantities of Grapes and choke cheries, also a speces of currunt which I had never before observed the lea[ve]s is larger than those above, the currt. black and very inferior to either the yellow, red, or perple. at dark we landed on a Small Sand bar under a Bluff on the S W. Side and encamped, this Situation was one which I had Chosen to avoid the Musquetors, they were not very troublesom after we landed. we came only 40 Miles to daye My Frend Capt. Lewis is recovering fast the hole in his thy where the Ball passed out is closed and appears to be nearly well. the one where the ball entered discharges very well. Sunday 24th. August 1806 a fair morning we Set out as usial about sunrise and proceeded on untill 2 P M when the wind blew so hard from the N.W. that we could not proceed came too on the S W. side where we continued untill 5 P.M. when the wind lay a little and we again proceeded on. at 8 a M. we passed La-hoo-cat's Island, opposit the lower point of this Island on the S.W. Side near the top of the Bluff I observed a Stratea of White stone I landed and examined it found it to be a Soft White Stone containing very fine grit, when expd. to the Sun and become Dry this Stone will Crumble the Clay of this bluff bothe above and below is remarkably Black. at half past 9 a.m. passed Good hope Island and at 11 a.m passed Caution Island a Short distance below this Island we came too. Sent out a hunter he Saw Several deer they were very wild and he re turned without haveing killed any, the deer on this pt. of the Missouri is mostly the Mule or black tail Species, we Saw only 6 buffalow to day. the Sieoux have been laterly encamped on the river and have Secured the most of the game opp. a large trail has passed on a derection to the enterance of the Chyenne this probably is the trail of a war party, at 5 P.M. we proceeded on a fiew miles and Encampd. on the gouge of the lookout bend of 20 miles around and 3/4 through, a little above an old tradeing house and 4 miles above of our outward bound encampment of the 1st. of October 1804, haveing made 43 miles to day. Monday 25th. August 1806 a cool clear morning a Stiff breeze a head we Set out at the usial hour and proceeded on very well. I derected Shields Collins Shannon and the two fieldses to proceed on in the two small canoes to the Pania Island and hunt on that Island untill we came on, they Set out before daylight. The Skirt of timber in the bend above the Chyenne is not very considerable the timber is scattered from 4 to 16 miles on the S W Side of the river, and the thickest part is at the distance of 6 &amp; 10 miles from the Chyenne, a narrow bottom of small cotton trees is also on the N E pt. at the distance of from 4 to 4 1/2 miles above the chyenne imediately at the enterance of that river I observe but fiew large trees some small Growth and willows on the lower Side bottom on the Missouri about 1/2 a mile and extends up the Chyen 1 mile about a quarter of a mile above is a 2d. bottom of cotton timber, in the point above the Chyenne there is a considerable bottom of about 2 miles on that river and a large timbered bottom a Short distance above. at 8 A.M. we came to at the mouth of the Chyenne to delay untill 12 to make a meridian Observation and directed 3 hunters to proceed up this river and hunt its bottoms untill twelve at which hour we Shall proceed on. the hunters returned with 2 deer. the Chyenne discharges but little water which is much the colour of the missouri tho not So muddy I observe a very eligable Situation on the bank of the chyenne on it's lower Side about 100 paces from it's enterance. this Situation is above the high floods and has a perfect command of each river we obtained a Meridian altitude with the Sextt. and artificial Horizon 112°. 50′ 00″—after which we proceeded on passed the pania Island and came up with Shields and Collins they had killed two deer only at 3 P.M. we passed the place where we Saw the last encampement of Troublesom Tetons below the old pania village on the S W Side, a very large timbered bottom on the N. E. Side imediately below the Pania Island. Latd. of Chyenne is [blanko spaces′ in MS.″] North. at Sunset we landed about the center of a large bottom on the N E Side a little below the enterance of No timber Creek and below our Encampment of 29th. of Sept. 1804. Dreyer killed a deer after we encamped. a little above our encampmt the ricaras had formerly a large village on each side which was destroyed by the Seioux. there is the remains of 5 other villages on the S W. side below the Chyenne river and one on Lehocatts Isld. all those villages have been broken up by the Seioux. This day proved a fine Still day and the men played their oars and we made 48 miles to day. The 2 fields and Shannon did not join this evening which caused me to encamp earlier than usial for them. we Saw no game on the plains to day. the Tetons have been on the river not long since. Tuesday 26th. of August 1806 a heavy dew this morning the hunters or Shannon &amp; the 2 fields came up at Sunrise and we Set out, they had killed only 2 Small deer one of which they had eat at 8 passed the place the Tetons were encamped at the time they attempted to Stop us in Sept. 1804, and at 9 A.M. passed the enterance of Teton River. Saw Several black tail or Mule deer and Sent out to kill them but they were wild and the hunters could not get a Shot at either of them. a fiew miles below the Teton river I observed a buffalow Skin Canoe lying on the S Shore and a Short distance lower a raft which induces me to suspect that the Tetons are not on the Missouri at the big bend as we were informed by the Ricaras, but up the Teton river. at Meridn. we halted on the N E. Side opposit a handsom leavel plain in which there is great quantities of plumbs which are not yet ripe. we passed the enterance of Smoke Creek and landed and continued two hours to Stop a leak in the perogue and fix the Stearing oare, Saw great quantities of Grapes, they are black tho' not thurerly ripe. at 5 P.M. we landed a[t] Louisells fort on Ceder Island, this fort is entire and every part appears to be in the same state it was when we passed it in Sept. 1804 I observed the appearance of 3 fires in the houses which appeared to have been made 10 or 12 days past. we proceeded on about 10 miles lower and encamped on the S.W. Side opposit our outward bound encampment of the 21st. of Septr. 1804, a fiew miles above Tylors [Medicine Hill] River. we had a Stiff breeze from the S.E. which continued to blow the greater part of the night dry and pleasent. as we were now in the country where we were informed the Seioux were assembled we were much on our guard deturmined to put up with no insults from those bands of Seioux, all the arms &amp;c. in perfect order. Capt. L. is Still on the mending hand he walks a little. I have discontinued the tent in the hole where the ball entered, agreeable to his request he tells me that he is fully convinced that the wound is sufficiently heeled for the tents to be discontinued. we made 60 miles to day with the wind ahead greater part of the day. Wednesday 27th. Augt. 1806 Set out before Sunrise a Stiff breeze a head from the East proceeded to the enterance of Tylors river on the S W Side and landed on a Sand bar and Sent out the hunters to kill Some meat. our Stock of meat being now exausted and this the most favourable place to procure a fresh supply, the hunters returned in 3 hours without haveing killed any thing. they informed me that the bottoms were entirely beaten up and the grass laid flat by the emence number of Buffalow which had been here a short time past. the deer had all left the bottom. they saw several Buffalow Bulls which they did not think proper to kill as they were unfit for use. here we discover the first Signs of the wild turkey. at 1 P. M. we halted in the big bend and killed a fat buck elk near the river, which was very timely as our meat was entirely exhosted. at 2 P. M. we again proceeded on down saw Several Buffalow Bulls on each side of the river also some deer of the common kind. at 6 P. M. we herd the bellowing of the Buffalow Bulls in the lower Isld. of the Big bend below the Gouge which induced a belief that there was some fat cows, 5 men went out from the 2 Small canoes which was a little ahead, and killed two cows one Bull and a calf nether of them were fat. we droped the Perogue &amp; Canoes to the lower part of the Island near to where the buffalow was killed and incamped haveing come 45 Miles only to day. had the buffalow butch[er]ed and brought in and divided. My friend Capt. Lewis hurt himself very much by takeing a longer walk on the sand bar in my absence at the buffalow than he had strength to undergo, which caused him to remain very unwell all night. Thursday 28th. of August 1806 Capt. Lewis had [a] bad nights rest and is not very well this morning. we set out early and proceded on very well, Saw a number of Buffalow bulls on the banks in different places. passd. the 3 rivers of the Scioux pass at 9 A. M. a Short distance below on the S W Side sent out Ruebin &amp; Joseph Field to hunt for the Mule deer or the antilope neither of which we have either the Skins or scellitens of, we derected those two men to proceed on down to the places we encamped the 16th &amp; 17th of Septr. 1804 and which place the party had called pleasant camp1 1 A name not mentioned heretofore. See our vol. i, p. 151, where this camping place was called "Plumb Camb."—Ed. from the great abundance of Game Such as Buffalow, Elk, antilopes, Blacktail or Mule deer, fallow deer common deer wolves barking Squirels, Turkies and a variety of other animals, aded to which there was a great abundance of the most delicious plumbs and grapes. [At] this Situation which is a short distance above the enterance of Corvus [Crow, or American] Creek we are deturmined to delay one day for the purpose of precureing the sceletins of the Mule deer &amp; antilope, and some barking Squirels. a fiew miles below the place the 2 fields were Set on Shore we Set Drewyer and Labeech on shore with the Same directions which had been given to the 2 field's at 12 oClock we Landed on the S W. Side at the Same Spot which we had encamped on the 16th and 17th of September 1804, and formed a camp, Sent out Serjt. Pryor, Shields, Go. Gibson, Willard and Collins to hunt in the plains up Corvus Creek for the antilope and Mule deer sent out Bratten and Frazier to kill the barking Squirel, and Gave directions to all of them to kill the Magpye if they Should See any of them several of the men and the Squaws of the enterpreter Jessomme and the Mandan Chief went to some plumb bushes in the bottom and geathered more plumbs than the party could eate in 2 days, those plumbs are of 3 speces, the most of them large and well flavored. our Situation is pleasent a high bottom thinly timbered and covered with low grass without misquitors. at 3 P. M. Drewyer and Labeech arived, the latter haveing killd. a Deer of the Common Species only. in the evening late all the hunters returned without any Species of animal we were in want of, they killed 4 common deer and two buffalow a part of the best of the meat of those animals they brought in. we precured two of the barking Squirels only. as we could not precure any Mule deer or antelope we concluded to send the hunters on a head early in the morning and delay untill 10 A.M to give them time to hunt. I derected Shannon and Collins to go on the opposit Side and Labeech and Willard to proceed down on this side at some distance from the river and join the party at the round Island &amp;c. and R. Field to proceed on slowly in the Small Canoe to that place and take in any thing which the hunters might kill. Made 32 Miles to day. The hunters informed me that they Saw great numbers of Buffalow in the Plains. I Saw Several herds of those animals on either Side to day at a distance. Friday 29th. August 1806 A cloudy morning the hunters proceeded on agreeable to their orders of last night. I sent out two men to the village of barking Squirels with directions to kill some of them. they after 2 hours returned and informed me that not one of those Squirels were to be seen out of their holes. the skins of the party which they had been dressing since yesterday being now completely dressed I derected all loose baggage to be put on board the Canoes and at 10 A. M. set out and proceeded on passed the White river at 12 oClock and halted below the enterance of Shannons Creek where we were joined by Labeech Shannon and Willard, they had killed 2 common de[e]r but no Mule deer or antilopes. Willard informed me that he saw 2 antilopes but could not get near to them. Willard and Labeech waded White river a fiew miles above its enterance and inform me that they found it 2 feet water and 200 yards wide. the water of this river at this time [is] nearly as white as milk. put Drewyer out to hunt on the S.W. side and proceeded on below the round Island and landed on the N. E. side I with Several of the men went out in pursute of Buffalow. the men killed 2 Bulls near me they were very pore. I assended to the high Country and from an eminance I had a view of the plains for a great distance. from this eminance I had a view of a greater number of buffalow than I had ever seen before at one time. I must have seen near 20,000 of those animals feeding on this plain. I have observed that in the country between the nations which are at war with each other the greatest numbers of wild animals are to be found. on my return to the river I killed 2 young deer. after Dinner I proceeded down the river about 3 mile to the Camp of Jo. &amp; Rubin fields and Collins, and encamped on the S. W. Side a little below our encampment of 13 Septr. 1804, haveing made 20 Miles only. neither of the hunters killed either a Black tail deer or an antilope. Jo. Fields &amp; Shields each killed a porcupin and two others of the hunters killed Deer, Drewyer did not join us untill 10 P. M. he informed that he Saw some antilopes and Mule deer but could kill none of them. Jo. Field informed that he wounded [a] female of the Mule deer a little below our camp late in the evening and could not prosue her I directed him to set out with 3 others and follow the Deer and get her if possible early in the morning. Saturday 30th. of August 1806. Capt. Lewis is mending Slowly. we set out at the usial hour and proceeded on very well a fiew miles Jo Field who was on the shore being behind I derected one of the Small Canoes with R. Fields &amp; Shannon to continue on the point of a Sand bar untill he coms up. I took 3 hunters and walked on the N. E. Shore with a view to kill some fat meet. we had not proceeded far before Saw a large plumb orchd. of the most delicious plumbs, out of this orchard 2 large Buck Elks ran the hunters killed them. I stoped the canoes and brought in the flesh which was fat and fine, here the party collected as many plumbs as they could eate and Several pecks of which they put by &amp;c. after a delay of nearly 2 hours we again proceeded on downwards passed 3 small Islands and as we were about to land at the place appointed to wait for the 2 fields and Shannon, I saw Several men on horseback which with the help of a spie glass I found to be Indians on the high hills to the N. E. we landed on the S. W. side and I sent out two men to a village of Barking Squirels to kill some of those animals imedeatily after landing about 20 Indians was discovered on an eminance a little above us on the opposite Side. one of those men I took to be a french man from his [having] a blanket capo[t]e &amp; a handkerchief around his head, imediately after 80 or 90 Indian men all armed with fusees &amp; Bows &amp; arrows came out of a wood on the opposite bank about 1/4 of a mile below us. they fired. of[f] their guns as a Salute we returned the Salute with 2 rounds. We were at a loss to deturmin of what nation those indians were. from their hostile appearance we were apprehensive they were Tetons, but from the country through which they roved we were willing to believe them either the Yanktons, Pon[c]ars or Mahars either of which nations are well disposed towards the white people. I deturmined to find out who they were without running any risque of the party and indians, and therefore took three french men who could Speak the Mahar Pania and some Seeoux and in a Small canoe I went over to a Sand bar which extended Sufficiently near the opposite shore to converse. imedeately after I set out 3 young men set out from the opposite Side and swam next me on the Sand bar. I derected the men to Speak to them in the Pania and Mahar Languages first neither of Which they could understand I then derected the man who could speak a fiew words of Seioux to inquire what nation or tribe they belong to they informed me that they were Tetons and their chief was Tar-tack-kah-sab-bar or the black buffalow this chief I knew very well to be the one we had seen with his band at Teton river which band had attempted to detain us in the fall of 1804 as we assended this river and with whome we wer near comeing to blows. I told those Indians that they had been deef to our councils and ill treated us as we assended this river two years past, that they had abused all the whites who had visited them since. I believed them to be bad people &amp; should not suffer them to cross to the Side on which the party lay, and directed them to return with their band to their camp, that if any of them come near our camp we Should kill them certainly. I lef[t] them on the bear [bar] and returned to th[e] party and examined the arms &amp;c those indians seeing some corn in the canoe requested some of it which I refused being deturmined to have nothing to do with those people. Several others swam across one of which understood pania, and as our pania interpreter was a very good one we had it in our power to inform what we wished. I told this man to inform his nation that we had not forgot their treatment to us as we passed up this river &amp;c. that they had treated all the white people who had visited them very badly; robed them of their goods, and had wounded one man whom I had Seen, we viewed them as bad people and no more traders would be Suffered to come to them, and whenever the white people wished to visit the nations above they would come sufficiently Strong to whip any vilenous party who dare to oppose them and words to the same purpote. I also told them that I was informed that a part of all their bands were going to war against the Mandans &amp;c, and that they would be well whiped as the Mandans &amp; Minitarres &amp;[c] had a plenty of Guns Powder and ball, and we had given them a cannon to defend themselves. and derected them to return from the Sand bar and inform their chiefs what we had said to them, and to keep away from the river or we Should kill every one of them &amp;c. &amp;c. those fellows requested to be allowed to come across and make cumerads which we positively refused and I directed them to return imediately which they did and after they had informed the Chiefs &amp;c. as I suppose what we had said to them, they all set out on their return to their camps back of a high hill. 7 of them halted on the top of the hill and blackguarded us, told us to come across and they would kill us all &amp;c of which we took no notice. we all this time were extreamly anxious for the arival of the 2 fields &amp; Shannon whome we had left behind, and were some what consd. as to their Safty. to our great joy those men hove in Sight at 6 P. M. Jo. Fields had killed 3 black tail or mule deer. we then Set out, as I wished to see what those Indians on the hill would act, we steared across near the opposit Shore, this notion put them [in] some agitation as to our intentions, some set out on the direction towards their Camps others walked about on the top of the hill and one man walked down the hill to meet us and invited us to land to which invitation I paid no kind of attention. this man I knew to be the one who had in the fall 1804 accompanied us 2 days and is said to be the friend to the white people. after we passd him he returned on the top of the hill and gave 3 strokes with the gun (on the earth—this is swearing by the earth) he had in his hand this I am informed is a great oath among the indians. we proceeded on down about 6 miles and encamped on a large Sand bar in the middle of the river about 2 miles above our encampment on Mud Island on the 10th. Septr. 1804 haveing made 22 miles only to Day. Saw Several indians on the hills at a distance this evening viewing us. our encampment of this evening was a very disagreeable one, bleak exposed to the winds, and the sand wet. I pitched on this Situation to prevent being disturbed by those Scioux in the course of the night as well as to avoid the musquetors. Killed 9 whistleing squirels. Sunday 31st August 1806 all wet and disagreeable this morning. at half past 11 P. M. last night the wind Shifted about to the N. W. and it began to rain with hard claps of thunder and lightning the clouds passd over and the wind Shifted about to the S W. &amp; blew with great violence so much so that all hands were obliged to hold the Canoes &amp; Perogue to prevent their being blown off from the sand bar, however a Sudan Squal of wind broke the cables of the two Small Canoes and with Some difficuelty they were got to Shore Soon after the 2 canoes in which Sergt Pryor and the indians go in broke loose with wiser and Willard in them and were blown quite across the river to the N. E. Shore where fortunately they arived Safe, I sent Sergt Jo. Ordway with a Small Perogue and 6 men to prosue the 2 Canoes and assist them in effecting a landing, those 2 canoes being tied together 2 men could not manage them, the wind Slackened a little and by 2 A. M. Sergt Ordway with Willard Wiser and the 2 Canoes returned all safe, the wind continued to blow and it rained untill day light all wet and disagreeable. all the party examined their arms and put them in order, and we set out and proceeded on down. Saw Several Indians on the hills untill we passed the Island of Cedar at 9 A. M. the morning cloudy and wind down th[e] river at 4 P. M. passed the doome1 1 For this landmark, which Clark elsewhere calls the "Cupola," instead of the Dome, see also our vol. i, p. 141, note 2.—Ed. and lowest village of Barking Squirels. this is also the highest up the river where I observed the fox Squirel in the bottom above the doome on N. E. side I killed 2 fox Squirels. we Saw no game of any kind to day as [on] the banks as usial. the Sun Shone with a number of flying Clouds. we encamped on the N. E. Side a little below our Encampment of the 5th. of Septr. on no preserve Island [near Chouteau bluffs] haveing come 70 Miles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter XXXIII THE HOME STRETCH Clark's Journal, September 1–26, 1806 [Clark:] Monday 1st of September 1806 MUSQUITORS very troublesom last night, we set out at the usial hour and had not proceeded on far before the fog became so thick that we were oblige[d] to come too and delay half an hour for the fog to pass off which it did in some measure and we again proceded on R. [and] Jo. Fields and Shannon landed on an Island [Ponceras]1 1 At the mouth of Ponca River.—Ed. to try to kill Some deer which was seen on the beech and the Canoes all passed them at 9 A. M we passed the enterance of River Quiequur [Qui Court, or Niobrara] which had the Same appearance it had when we passed up water rapid and of a milky white colour about two miles below the Quicurre, 9 Indians ran down the bank and beckened to us to land, they appeared to be a war party, and I took them to be Tetons and paid no kind of attention to them further than an enquirey to what tribe they belonged, they did not give me any answer, I prosume they did not understand the man who Spoke to them as he Spoke but little of their language. as one canoe was yet behind we landed in an open commanding Situation out of sight of the indians deturmined to delay untill they came up. about 15 minits after we had landed Several guns were fired by the indians, which we expected was at the three men behind. I calld out 15 men and ran up with a full deturmination to cover them if possible let the number of the indians be what they might. Capt. Lewis hobled up on the bank and formed the remainder of the party in a Situation well calculated to defend themselves and the Canoes &amp;c. when I had proceeded to the point about 250 yards I discovered the Canoe about I mile above &amp; the indians where we had left them. I then walked on the Sand beech and the indians came down to meet me I gave them my hand and enquired of them what they were Shooting at, they informed me that they were Shooting off their guns at an old Keg which we had thrown out of one of the Canoes and was floating down. those indians informed me they were Yanktons, one of the men with me knew one of the Indians to be the brother of young Durion's wife.1 1 For the Dorions, father and son, see our vol. i, pp. 47, 128. The squaw of the younger Dorion accompanied him on the overland Astorian expedition, and had a thrilling adventure upon the Boise River, Idaho. See "Franchère's Narrative" in Thwaites, Early Western Travels, vi, pp. 342–344. She was still living in Oregon as late as 1850.—Ed. finding those indians to be Yanktons I invited them down to the boats to Smoke. when we arived at the Canoes they all eagerly Saluted the Mandan Chief, and we all set and smoked Several pipes. I told them that we took them to be a party of Tetons and the fireing I expected was at the three men in the rear Canoe and I had went up with a full intention to kill them all if they had been tetons &amp; fired on the canoe as we first expected, but finding them Yanktons and good men we were glad to see them and take them by the hand as faithfull Children who had opened their ears to our Councils. one of them Spoke and Said that their nation had opened their years &amp; done as we had directed them ever since we gave the Meadel to their great Chief, and should continue to do as we had told them we enquired if any of their chiefs had gone down with Mr. Durion, the[y] answered that their great Chief and many of their brave men had gone down, that the white people had built a house near the Mahar village where they traded.2 2 For some years past, this had been a favorite site for traders. See Cruzatte's experience here, as instanced in our vol. i, p. 99.—Ed. we tied a piece of ribon to each mans hair and gave them some corn of which they appeared much pleased. The Mandan chief gave a par of elegant Legins to the principal man of the indian party, which is an indian fashion (to make presents) the Canoe &amp; 3 men haveing joined us we took our leave of this party telling them to return to their band and listen to our councils which we had before given to them. Their band of 80 Lodges were on plum creek1 1 By some inadvertence, Coues (L, and C., iii, p. 1201) seeks to identify this with the White Paint Creek of Sept. 4, 1804. Clark named it Plum Creek, September 3; see our vol. i, p. 138.—Ed. a fiew miles to the north. those nine men had five fusees and 4 bows &amp; quivers of arrows. at 2 P. M. we came too on the upper point of bon homme opposit the antient fortification and sent out men to hunt on each Side and on the island. and the canoes on each Side of the island to receive any meat which might be killed I walked on the N. E. main Shore found the bottom rich and thickly covered with Peavine rich weed grass interwoven in Such a manner with grape vines that I could not get through, and was obliged to assend a high plain the passing through which I also found tiresom. the grass was nearly as high as my head and the musquitors excessively bad. at the lower point of the Island all the canoes &amp; hunters came together. Labeech killed an Elk only the flesh of which was brought on in the perogue. at this Island we brought 2 years together or on the 1st. of Sepr. 1804 we Encamped at the lower point of this Island. after we all came together we again proceeded on down to a large Sand bar imediately opposit to the place where we met the Yanktons in council at the Calumet Bluffs and which place we left on the 1t. of Septr. 1804. I observed our old flag Staff or pole Standing as we left it. the Musquitors excessively troublesom untill about 10 P. M. when the S W wind became Strong and blew the most of them off. we came 52 miles to day only with a head wind. the country on either Side are butifull and the plains much richer below the Quequer river than above that river. Tuesday 2nd. of September 1806 Set out at the usial hour passed the River Jacque [James] at 8 A. M. in the first bottom below on the N E. Side I observed the remains of a house which had been built since we passed up, this most probably was Mc.Clellins1 1 Both Lewis and Clark had known Robert McClellan while he served as a scout in Wayne's army (1794–95). See Roosevelt, Winning of the West, iv, pp. 80–82, on this portion of his career. Removing to St. Louis, he entered upon the fur trade, forming (1807) a partnership with Ramsay Crooks, and later embarking in the Astorian enterprise (1811). For his experiences in that expedition, see journals of Bradbury, Brackenridge, Franchère, and Ross in Thwaites, Early Western Travels, v, vi, and vii. Having crossed the continent amid innumerable hardships, he arrived at Astoria in January, 1812, and spent nine months upon the return journey, arriving in St. Louis April 30, 1813. His death occurred three years later.—Ed. tradeing house with the Yanktons in the Winter of 1804 &amp; 5. the wind was hard a head &amp; continued to increas which obliged us to lay by nearly all day. as our Store of meat [was small], I took with me 8 men and prosued a Small Gang of Cows in the plains 3 miles and killed two which was in very good order, had them butchered and each man took a load as much as he could carry and returned to the Canoes, the wind Still high and water rough we did not Set out untill near Sun Set we proceded to a Sand bar a short distance below the place we had come too on account of the wind and Encamped on a Sand bar, the woods being the harbor of the musquitors and the party without the means of Screaning themselves from those tormenting insects. on the Sand bars the wind which generaly blows moderately at night blows off those pests and we Sleep Soundly. The wind continued to blow hard from the same point S. E. untill 3 P.M. I saw in my walk to day Lynn and Slipery Elm. the plains are tolerably leavel on each Side and very fertile. I saw 4 prarie fowls Common to the Illinois, those are the highest up which have been seen, White Oak is very common also white ash on the riveens and high bottoms. two turkys killed to day of which the Indians very much admired being the first which they ever Saw. Capt. L. is mending fast we made only 22 Miles to day. Wednesday 3rd September 1806 Wind continued to blow very hard this morning. it Shifted last night to the S W. and blew the sand over us in Such a manner as to render the after part of the night very disagreeable. the wind luled a little and we Set out and proceeded on with the wind a head passed the enterance of redstone River on the N. E. Side1 1 Clark appears to be in doubt as to the translation of the Indian word for this stream. Aug. 24, 1804, he called it "White stone"; the following day, simply "Stone River" (see our vol. i, pp. 119, 123). "Redstone" more nearly approaches its present name—Vermilion River.—Ed. at 11 A M. and at half past 4 P.M we Spied two boats &amp; Several men, our party p[l]eyed their ores and we soon landed on the Side of the Boats the men of [these] boats Saluted us with their Small arms I landed &amp; was met by a Mr. James Airs from Mackanaw by way of Prarie Dechien and St. Louis. this Gentleman is of the house of Dickson &amp; Co.2 2 Robert Dickson of Prairie du Chien was a prominent Canadian trader, and had great influence with the Indians of Wisconsin and the Upper Mississippi country. In the War of 1812–15, he and Clark were arrayed upon opposing sides of the struggle. See his biography in Wis. Hist. Colls., xii, pp. 133–153, and papers in vols. x, xi, xii, on the capture of Prairie du Chien. James Aird was a Scotch trader, who early settled at that Wisconsin outpost, dying there in 1819. He made frequent journeys up the Missouri, where Bradbury met him in 1810 (see Thwaites, Early Western Travels, v, p. 87). He aided Dickson on the British side in the War of 1812–15. Aird is described as a large man, of much ability, highly respected both by whites and Indians.—Ed. of Prarie de Chian who has a Licence to trade for one year with the Sieoux he has 2 Batteaux loaded with Merchendize for that purpose. This Gentleman receved both Capt. Lewis and my self with every mark of friendship he was himself at the time with a chill of the agu on him which he has had for Several days. our first enquirey was after the President of our country and then our friends and the State of the politicks of our country &amp;c. and the State [of] Indian affairs to all of which enquireys Mr. Aires gave us as Satisfactory information as he had it in his power to have collected in the Illinois which was not a great deel. soon after we Landed a violent Storm of Thunder Lightning and rain from the N. W. which was violent with hard claps of thunder and Sharp Lightning which continued untill 10 P M after which the wind blew hard. I set up late and partook of the tent of Mr. Aires which was dry. Mr. Aires unfortunately had his boat Sunk on the 25 of July last by a violent storm of Wind and hail by which accident he lost the most of his usefull articles as he informed us. this Gentleman informed us of maney changes &amp; misfortunes which had taken place in the Illinois amongst others the loss of Mr Cady Choteaus1 1 Pierre Chouteau, Jr., known as Pierre Cadet (Cady). He was born at St. Louis in 1789, and spent two years (1806–09) with Julien Dubuque at the lead mines on the Mississippi. Later, he embarked in the fur trade, and became one of the noted merchants of St. Louis, and a member of the State Constitutional Convention (1820), dying in 1865. His grandson Pierre is (1905) one of the most prominent citizens of St. Louis, and active in the councils of the Missouri Historical Society.—Ed. house and furniture by fire. for this misfortune of our friend Choteaus I feel my self very much concernd &amp;c. he also informed us that Genl. Wilkinson was the governor of the Louisiana and at St. Louis, 300 of the american Troops had been cantuned on the Missouri a fiew miles above it's mouth, Some disturbance with the Spaniards in the Nackatosh [Natchitoches] Country is the cause of their being called down to that country, the Spaniards had taken one of the U. States frigates in the Mediteranean, Two British Ships of the line had fired on an American Ship in the port of New York, and killed the Capts. brother. 2 Indians had been hung in St. Louis for murder and several others in jale. and that Mr. Burr &amp; Genl. Hambleton fought a Duel, the latter was killed2 2 Gen. James Wilkinson was Governor of Louisiana Territory from July, 1805, to July, 1807. The duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, resulting in the latter's death, occurred at Weehawken, near New York City, July 11, 1804. At that time the relations of the United States with both England and Spain were more or less strained, especially as English ships frequently impressed American sailors —Proceedings which were among the causes of the War of 1812–15. The incident to which reference is here made was the killing of John Pierce, seaman on the "Richard," about two miles off Sandy Hook, by a shot from the British man-of-war "Leander" (April 25, 1806). Great excitement was caused in New York, and the funeral was the occasion of a popular demonstration, hostile to Great Britain. The rumor of a ship being captured by Spaniards probably arose from the fact that in the autumn of 1804 the U. S. frigate "President" was fired at by some Spanish gunboats near the port of Algeciras, Spain.—Ed. &amp;c. &amp;c. I am happy to find that my worthy friend Capt. L's is so well as to walk about with ease to himself &amp;c., we made 60 Miles to day the river much crowded with Sand bars, which are very differently Situated from what they were when we went up. Thursday 4th September 1806. The Musquitors became troublesom early this morning I rose at the usial hour found all the party as wet as rain could make them. as we were in want of some tobacco I purposed to Mr. Airs to furnish us with 4 carrots for which we would Pay the amount to any Merchant of St. Louis he very readily agreed to furnish us with tobacco and gave to each man as much as it is necessary for them to use between this and St. Louis, an instance of Generossity for which every man of the party appears to acknowledge. Mr. Airs also insisted on our accepting a barrel of flour. we gave to this gentleman what corn we could Spear amounting to about 6 bushels, this corn was well calculated for his purpose as he was about to make his establishment and would have it in his power to hull the corn &amp;c. The flower was very acceptable to us we have yet a little flour part of what we carried up from the Illinois as high as Maria's river and buried it there untill our return &amp;c. at 8 A. M. we took our leave and Set out, and proceeded on very well, at 11 A. M. passed the Enterance of the big Sieoux River which is low, and at meridian we came too at Floyds Bluff below the Enterance of Floyds river and assended the hill, with Capt. Lewis and Several men, found the grave had been opened by the nativs and left half covered. we had this grave completely filled up, and returned to the canoes and proceeded on to the Sand bar on which we encamped from the 12th. to the 20th. of August 1804 near the Mahar Village, here we came to and derected every wet article put out to dry, all the bedding of the party and Skins being wet. as it was late in the evening we deturmined to continue all night. had issued to each man of the party a cup of flour. we See no Species of Game on the river as usial except wild geese and pelicans. I observed near Sergt. Floyds Grave a number of flurishing black walnut trees, these are the first which I have seen decending the river1 1 For the death of Sergeant Charles Floyd, see our vol. i, p. 114. His journal is given in our vol. vii.—Ed. . a little before night Several Guns were heard below and in a direction towards the Mahar village which induced us to suspect that Mr. McClellin who we was informed was on his way up to trade with the Mahars had arived at the Creek below and that those reports of Guns was some of his party out hunting. every thing being dry we derected the Perogue &amp; canoes to be loaded and in readiness to Set out in the morning early. at dark the Musquetors became troublesom and continued so all night the party obtained but little Sleep we made 36 miles only to day. Friday 5th September 1806 The Musquetors being so excessively tormenting that the party was all on board and we set out at day light and proceeded on very well. here the river is bordered on both [sides] with timber &amp;c. becoms much narrower more crooked and the current more rapid and crouded with Snags or Sawyers than it is above, and continus So all day. We did not meet with McClellin as we expected at the Creek. the report of the guns which was heard must have been the Mahars who most probably have just arrived at their village from hunting the buffalow. this is a season they usialy return to their village to secure their crops of corn Beens punkins &amp;c &amp;c. proceeded on very well passd the blue Stone bluff1 1 A name not before given, although the bluff is noted Aug. 10, 1804, as a "clift of Yellow Sand Stone." See our vol. i, p. 105.—Ed. at 3 P. M. here the river leaves the high lands and meanders through a low rich bottom. Encamped on the S. W. Side on a Sand bar at a cut off a little below our Encampment of the 9th. of August 1804. haveing made 73 Miles to day. Capt. Lewis still in a convelesent State. We Saw no game on the Shores to day worth killing only such as pelicans Geese ducks, Eagles and Hawks &amp;c. Saturday 6th. September 1806. The Musquetors excessively troublesom we Set out early at the great cut off Saw a herd of Elk, we landed and Sent out Several hunters to kill Some of the Elk, they returned without killing any as the Elk was wild and ran off much fritened. I sent the two Small Canoes on a head with derections to hunt in two bottoms below, and after a delay of half an hour proceeded on wind-hard a head at the lower point of Pelecan Island a little above the Petite River de Seeoux we met a tradeing boat of Mr. Og. Choteaux [Auguste Chouteau] of St. Louis bound to the River Jacque to trade with the Yanktons, this boat was in care of a Mr. Henry Delorn, [Delaunay?]1 1 For these St. Louis families, see our vol. i, p. 22, note 1.—Ed. he had exposed all his loading (to dry) and sent out five of his hands to hunt they soon arived with an Elk. we purchased a gallon of whiskey of this man (promised to pay Choteau who would not receive any pay) and gave to each man of the party a dram which is the first spiritious licquor which had been tasted by any of them since the 4 of July 1805. several of the party exchanged leather for linen Shirts and beaver for corse hats. Those men could inform us nothing more than that all the troops had movd. from the Illinois and that Genl. Wilkinson was prepareing to leave St. Louis. We advised this trader to treat the Tetons with as much contempt as possible and stated to him where he would be benefited by such treatment &amp;c &amp;c. and at 1 P. M. set out those men gave us 2 Shots from a Swivell they had on the bow of their boat which we returned in our turn. proceeded on about 3 miles and came up with two of the hunters, they had not killd. any thing. at 5 miles we over took the Canoe of the other hunters with Shannon in it floating down, the two fields being in the woods behind we came too on a Sand bar on the N. E. Side and delayed all the after part of the [day] for the two Fields, sent out 3 men to hunt in the bottom up the river and observe if they Saw any sign of the hunters. the evening proved cloudy and the wind blew hard two pelicans were killed to day. we came 30 Miles only to day the 2 fieldses did not join us I think they are below. The Chief &amp; the Squaws &amp; children are awarey [a-weary] of their journey. Children cry &amp;c. Sunday 7th September 1806. as we were doubtfull that the two fieldses were behind I derected Sergt. Ordway with 4 men to continue untill meridian and if those men did not arive by that hour to proceed on. if we met with them at any Short distance a gun Should be fired which would be a Signal for him to proceed on. we had proceeded on about 8 miles by water and the distance through not more than I mile when we saw the fire of those 2 men, I derected a gun fired as a Signal for Sergt. ordway to proceed on, and took the boys on board. they had killed nothing &amp; informed me they had been Some what almd. at our delay, that the distance across from the little Sicoux river was about 1 ? miles only, the bottoms thick and Grass very high. we proceeded on with a Stiff Breeze ahead (note the evaperation on this portion of the Missouri has been noticed as we assended this river, and it now appears to be greater than it was at that time. I am obliged to replenish my ink Stand every day with fresh ink at least 9/10 of which must evaperate. we proceded on to a bottom on the S W side a little above the Soldiers river and came too and Sent out all the hunters. they killed 3 Elk which was at no great distance we Sent out the men and had the flesh brought in cooked and Dined. Sergt. Ordway came up &amp; after takeing a Sumptious Dinner we all Set out at 4 P. M. wind a head as usial. at Dusk we came too on the lower part of a Sand bar on the S W side found the Musquetors excessively tormenting notwithstanding a Stiff breeze from the S. E. a little after dark the wind increased the Musquetors dispersed our Camp of this night is about 2 miles below our Encampment of the 4th of august 1804 assending we came 44 miles to day only. Munday 8th September 1806 Set out very early this morning, passed an old tradeing house on the S W Side a few miles above the Council bluffs, at 11 A M we came too at the bluffs and Capt. Lewis and my self walked up on the bluffs and around to examine the Country and Situation more particularly, the Situation appeared to us eaqually as eligable as when we passed up for an establishment, the hill high and commanding with a high rich bottom of great extent below. we proceeded on very well all being anxious to get to the River Platt to day they ply'd their orers very well, and we arived at our old encampment at White Catfish Camp 12 miles above the river platt at which place we lay from the 22th. to the 26th. of July 1804 here we encamped haveing made 78 Miles to day. The Missouri at this place does not appear to contain more water than it did 1000 Miles above this, the evaperation must be emence;1 1 The rate of evaporation in the region of the headwaters of the Missouri is excessively high even in winter, and it becomes more rapid as you ascend the valley. When the Chenook winds are blowing in winter, and the temperature is below freezing, snow is observed to disappear as if by magic. Professor Newell tells me that there is no probability that any water from the bed of the Missouri reaches the Dakota sandstones, as they lie a full thousand or more feet below that level. The artesian waters of the Dakotas come from the Black Hills region, where the Dakota sandstones are exposed.—Prof. F. H. KING, Bureau of Soils, U. S. Department of Agriculture. in the last 1000 miles this river receives the water [of] 20 rivers and maney Creeks Several of the Rivers large and the Size of this river or the quantity of water does not appear to increas any. Tuesday 9th September 1806 Set out early at 8 A.M. passed the enterance of the great river Platt which is at this time low the water nearly clear the current turbelant as usial; the Sand bars which choked up the Missouri and confined the [river] to a narrow Snagey Chanel are wastd. a way and nothing remains but a fiew Small remains of the bear [bar] which is covered with drift wood. below the R. Platt the current of the Missouri becomes evidently more rapid than above and the Snags much more noumerous and bad to pass late in the evening we arived at the Bald pated prarie and encamped imediately opposit our encampment of the 16th. and 17th. of July 1804. haveing made 73 miles only to day. The river bottoms are extencive rich and covered with tall large timber, and the hollows of the reveens may be Said to be covered with timber Such as Oake ash Elm and some walnut &amp; hickory. our party appears extreamly anxious to get on, and every day appears [to] produce new anxieties in them to get to their country and friends. My worthy friend Cap Lewis has entirely recovered his wounds are heeled up and he can walk and even run nearly as well as ever he could, the parts are yet tender &amp;c &amp;c. The Musquetors are yet troublesom, tho' not so much so as they were above the River platt. the climate is every day preceptably wormer and air more Sultery than I have experienced for a long time. the nights are now so worm that I sleep comfortable under a thin blanket, a fiew days past 2 was not more than sufficient. Wednesday 10th September 1806. we Set out very early this morning and proceeded on very well with wind moderately a head at [blank in MS.] P M we met a Mr. Alexander La fass and three french men from St. Louis in a Small perogue on his way to the River Platt to trade with the Pania Luup or Wolf Indians. this man was extreemly friendly to us he offered us any thing he had, we axcepted of a bottle of whisky only which we gave to our party, Mr. la frost informed us that Genl. Wilkinson and all the troops had decended the Mississippi and Mr. Pike1 1 Referring to the expedition undertaken by Captain (afterward General) Zebulon M. Pike to explore the interior of the newly acquired Louisiana territory, especially the region of the Red and Arkansas rivers. See his Expeditions (Phila., 1810) and the later edition of that work by Coues (N. Y., 1895). Pike was accompanied by James D., a son of Gen. James Wilkinson.—Ed. and young Mr. Wilkinson had Set out on an expedition up the Arkansaw river or in that direction after a delay of half an hour we proceedd on about 3 miles and met a large perogue and 7 Men from St Louis bound to the Mahars for the purpose of trade, this perogue was in Charge of a Mr. La Craw (Croix)2 2 A family of La Croix lived at Cahokia in the early days of American occupation, and on several occasions proved serviceable to the first governor, John Todd.—Ed. we made Some fiew enquiries of this man and again proceeded on through a very bad part of the river crouded with Snags &amp; Sawyers and incamped on a Sand bar about 4 miles above the Grand Nemahar. we find the river in this timbered country narrow and more moveing Sands and a much greater quantity of Sawyers or Snags than above. Great caution and much attention is required to Stear clear of all those dificuelties in this low State of the water. we made 65 miles to day. We Saw Deer rackoons and turkies on the Shores to day one of the men killed a racoon which the indians very much admired. Thursday 11th Sept 1806. a heavy cloud and wind from the N W. detained us untill after Sunrise at which time we set out and proceeded on very well, passed the nemahar which was low and did not appear as wide as when we passed up. Wolf river scercely runs at all, at 3 P. M we halted a little above the Nadawa river on the S. Side of the Missouri to kill Some meat that which we killed a fiew days past being all spoiled. Sent out 6 hunters they killed and brought in two Deer only, we proceeded on a fiew miles below the Nadawa Island and encamped on a Small Isld. near the N. E. Side, haveing came 40 Miles only to day, river rapid and in maney places crouded with Snag's. I observe on the Shores much deer Sign the [musquitos] are no longer troublesome on the river, from what cause they are noumerous above and not so on this part of the river I cannot account. Wolves were howling in different directions this evening after we had encamped, and the barking of the little prarie wolves [so] resembled those of our Common small Dogs that 3/4 of the party believed them to be the dogs of Some boat assending which was yet below us. the barking of those little wolves I have frequently taken notice of on this as also the other Side of the Rocky mountains, and their bark so much resembles or Sounds to me like our common Small cur dogs that I have frequently mistaken them for that Species of dog. The papaws nearly ripe. Friday 12th of September 1806 a thick fog a little before day which blew of[f] at day light, a heavy Dew this morning. we Set out at Sunrise the usial hour and proceeded on very well about 7 miles met 2 perogues from St. Louis one contained the property of Mr. Choteau bound to the panias or River Platt, the other going up trapping as high as the Mahars. here we met one of the french men who had accompanied us as high as the Mandans he informed us that Mr. McClellan was a fiew miles below the wind blew a head soon after we passed those perogues, we Saw a man on Shore who informed us that he was one of Mr. Mc.Clellins party and that he was a Short distance below, we took this man on board and proceeded on and Met Mr. Mc.Clellin1 1 This was Captain Robert McClellan; see p. 373, note, ante.—Ed. at the St. Michls. Prarie we came too here we found Mr. Jo. Gravelin the Ricaras enterpreter whome we had Sent down with a Ricaras Chief in the Spring of 1805.2 2 See our vol. i, pp. 184, 283, 284.—Ed. and old M. Durion the Sieux enterpreter, we examined the instructions of those interpreters and found that Gravelin was ordered to the Ricaras with a Speach from the president of the U. States to that nation and some presents which had been given the Ricara Chief who had visited the U. States and unfortunately died at the City of Washington, he was instructed to teach the Ricaras agriculture &amp; make every enquirey after Capt. Lewis my self and the party. Mr. Durion was enstructed to accompany Gravelin and through his influence pass him with his presents &amp;[c.] by the tetons bands of Sieux, and to provale on Some of the Principal chiefs of those bands not exceeding six to Visit the Seat of the Government next Spring. he was also enstructed to make every enquirey after us. we made Some Small addition to his instructions by extending the number of Chiefs to 10 or 12 or 3 from each band including the Yanktons &amp;c. Mr. Mc.Clellin receved us very politely, and gave us all the news and occurrences which had taken place in the Illinois within his knowledge the evening proveing to be wet and cloudy we concluded to continue all night, we despatched the two Canoes a head to hunt with 5 hunters in them [blank space in MS. for half a page.] Saturday 13th. September 1806 rose early Mr. McClellen (an old acquaintance in the army) gave each man a Dram and a little after Sunrise we Set out the wind hard a head from the S E at 8 A. M. we landed at the Camp of the 5 hunters whome we had Sent a head, they had killed nothing, the wind being too high for us to proceed in Safty through the eme[n]city of Snags which was imediately below we concluded to lye by and Sent on the Small canoes a Short distance to hunt and kill Some meat, we Sent out 2 men in the bottom they soon returned with one turky and informed that the rushes was so high and thick that it was impossible to kill any deer. I felt my self very unwell and derected a little Chocolate which Mr. Mc.Clellin gave us, prepared of which I drank about a pint and found great relief. at 11 A. M. we proceeded on about 1 mile and come up with the hunters who had killed 4 deer, here we delayed until 5 P. M. when the hunters all joined us and we again proceded on down a fiew miles and encamped on the N. E. Side of the Missouri haveing decended 18 Miles only to day. the day disagreeably worm. one man George Shannon left his horn and pouch with his powder ball and knife and did not think of it untill night. I walked in the bottom in the thick rushes and the Growth of timber Common to the Illinois such as cotton wood, Sycamore, ash mulberry, Elm of different species, walnut, hickory, horn beem, pappaw arrow wood willow, prickly ash, &amp;c and Grape vines, pees of 3 species &amp;c &amp;c. Birds most common the buzzard crow the hooting owl and hawks, &amp;c &amp;c Sunday 14th Septr 1806 Set out early and proceeded on very well. this being the part of the Missouri the Kanzas nation resort to at this season of the year for the purpose of robbing the perogues passing up to other nations above, we have every reason to expect to meet with them, and agreeably to their common custom of examining every thing in the perogues and takeing what they want out of them, it is probable they may wish to take those liberties with us, which we are deturmined not to allow of and for the Smallest insult we shall fire on them. at 2 P. M. a little below the lower [end] of the old Kanzas Village we met three large boats bound to the Yanktons and Mahars the property of Mr. Lacroy, Mr Aiten &amp; Mr. Coutau all from St. Louis, those young men received us with great friendship and pressed on us Some whisky for our men, Bisquet, Pork and Onions, &amp; part of their Stores, we continued near 2 hours with those boats, makeing every enquirey into the state of our friends and country &amp;c. those men were much affraid of meeting with the Kanzas. we Saw 37 Deer on the banks and in the river to day 5 of which we killed those deer were Meager. we proceeded on to an Island near the middle of the river below our encampment of the 1st of July 1804 and encamped haveing decended only 53 miles to day. our party received a dram and Sung Songs until 11 oClock at night in the greatest harmoney. Monday 15th of September 1806 we set out early with a Stiff Breeze a head saw Several deer Swiming the river soon after we Set out. at 11 A. M. passed the enterance of the Kanzas river which was very low, about a mile below we landed and Capt. Lewis and my self assended a hill which appeared to have a commanding situation for a fort, the Shore is bold and rocky imediately at the foot of the hill, from the top of the hill you have a perfect command of the river, this hill fronts the Kanzas and has a view of the Missouri a Short distance above that river. we landed one time only to let the men geather Pappaws or the custard apple of which this country abounds, and the men are very fond of. we discovered a Buck Elk on a Small Island, and sent the 2 fields and Shannon in pursute of it they soon came up with and killed the Elk, he was large and in fine order we had his flesh Secured and divided. as the winds were unfavourable the greater part of the day we only decended 49 Miles and encamped a Short distance Above Hay cabin Creek. we are not tormented by the Musquetors in this lower portion of the river, as we were above the river platt and as high up as the Rochejhone and for a fiew miles up that river, and above its' enterance into the Missouri. we passd. some of the most charming bottom lands to day and the uplands by no means bad, all well timberd. the weather disagreeably worm and if it was not for the constant winds which blow from the S and S E. we should be almost suficated comeing out of a northern Country open and Cool between the Latds. of 46d. and 49th North in which we had been for nearly two years, rapidly decending into a woody country in a wormer climate between the Latds. 38° &amp; 39° North is probably the cause of our experiencing the heat much more senceable than those who have continued within the paralel of Latitude. Tuesday 16th. September 1806 we Set out early this morning and proceded on tolerably well the Day proved excessively worm and disagreeable, so much so that the men rowed but little, at 10 A. M. we met a large tradeing perogue bound for the Panias we continued but a Short time with them. at 11 A. M we met young Mr. Bobidoux1 1 The Robidoux were a well-known family of French Canadians, whose father, Joseph, came early from Montreal to Kaskaskia and acquired a competence by fur trading. At his house in St. Louis the first territorial legislature of Missouri was held (1812). Joseph, Jr., born in St. Louis, 1783, had already erected a post (1800) upon the site of the present city of St. Joseph, Mo., and later was its first permanent settler, maintaining a store and trading-post for the American Fur Company (1826–30). He died in the city which he founded, in 1868. Another brother, Antoine, was a famous scout and trader on the Santa Fé trail, accompanying General Kearny to California.—Ed. with a large boat of six ores and 2 canoes, the licenes of this young man was to trade with the Panias Mahars and ottoes reather an extroardanary a license for [so] young a man and without the Seal of the teritory anexed, as Genl. Wilkinsons Signeture was not to this instrement we were somewhat doubtfull of it. Mr. Browns Signiture we were not acquainted with without the Teritorial Seal. We made Some enquireys of this young man and cautioned him against prosueing the Steps of his brother in attempting to degrade the American Charector in the eyes of the Indians. we proceeded on to an Island a little above our encampment of the 16th. &amp; 17th. of June 1804 haveing came 52 miles only to day. Wednesday 17th September 1806 We Set out as usial early pass the Island of the little osage Village which is considered by the navigater[s] of this river to be the worst place in it. at this place [the] water of the Missouri is confined between an Island and the S E main Shore and passes through a narrow chanel for more than 2 miles which is crouded with Snags in maney places quit[e] across obligeing the navigater to pick his passage between those Snags as he can, in maney places the current passing with great velocity against the banks which cause them to fall &amp;c. at 11 A. M. we met a Captain Mc.Clellin late a Capt. of Artily. of the U States Army1 1 John McClallan, of New York, appointed captain in the artillery July 24, 1798.—Ed. assending in a large boat. this gentleman an acquaintance of my friend Capt. Lewis was Somewhat astonished to see us return and appeared rejoiced to meet us. we found him a man of information and from whome we received a partial account of the political State of our country, we were makeing enquires and exchangeing answers &amp;c. untill near mid night. this Gentleman informed us that we had been long Since given out [up] by the people of the U S Generaly and almost forgotton, the President of the U. States had yet hopes of us; we received some civilities of Capt. Mc.Clellin, he gave us Some Buisquit, Chocolate Sugar &amp; whiskey, for which our party were in want and for which we made a return of a barrel of corn &amp; much obliged to him. Capt. McClellin informed us that he was on reather a speculative expedition to the confines of New Spain, with the view to entroduce a trade with those people. his plan is to proceede up this river to the Enterance of the river platt there to form an establishment from which to trade partially with the Panas &amp; Ottoes, to form an acquaintance with the Panias and provail [on] Some of their principal Chiefs to accompany him to Santa Fee where he will appear in a stile calculated to atract the Spanish government in that quarter and through the influence of a handsome present he expects to be promited to exchange his merchindize for Silver &amp; gold of which those people abound. he has a kind of introductory Speach from Govr. Wilkinson to the Panias and Ottoes and a quantity of presents of his own which he purposes distributing to the Panias and ELeatans2 2 A misspelling of Aliatans, an appellation of the Comanche.—Ed. with a view to gain their protection in the execution of his plans, if the Spanish Governmt. favour his plans, he purpose takeing his merchendize on mules &amp; horses which can easily be procured of the panias, to some point convenient to the Spanish Settlements within the Louisiana Teritory to which place the inhabitants of New mexico may meet him for the purpose of trade &amp;c. Capt. Mc.Clellins plan I think a very good one if strictly prosued &amp;c. Thursday 18th of September 1806 we rose early Capt. McClellin wrote a letter and we took our leave, and proceeded on passed the Grand river at 7 A. M. a Short distance below we came up with our hunters, they had killed nothing. at 10 oClock we came too and gathered pottows [papaws] to eate we have nothing but a fiew Buisquit to eate and are partly compelled to eate poppows which we find in great quantities on the Shores, the weather we found excessively hot as usial. the lands fine particularly the bottoms. a charming Oake bottom on the S. E. Side of the Missouri above the 2 charletons rivers we find the current of this part of the Missouri much more jentle than it was as we assended, the water is now low and where it is much confin'd it is rapid. we saw very little appearance of deer, saw one bear at a distance and 3 turkeys only to day. our party entirely out of provisions subsisting on poppaws. we divide[d] the buiskit which amounted to nearly one buisket per man, this in addition to the poppaws is to last us down to the Settlement's which is 150 miles the party appear perfectly contented and tell us that they can live very well on the pappaws. we made 52 miles to day only. one of our party J. Potts complains very much of one of his eyes which is burnt by the Sun from exposeing his face without a cover from the Sun. Shannon also complains of his face &amp; eyes &amp;c. Encamped on an Island nearly opposit to the enterance of Mine river. Friday 19th. of Septr. 1806. Set out this morning a little after day &amp; proceeded on very well the men plyd their oares &amp; we decended with great velocity, only came too once for the purpose of gathering pap-pows, our anxiety as also the wish of the party to proceed on as expeditiously as possible to the Illinois enduce us to continue on without halting to hunt. we calculate on ariveing at the first Settlements on tomorrow evening which is 140 miles, and [the] objecet of our party is to divide the distance into two days, this day to the Osarge River, and tomorrow to the Charreton a Small french Village. we arived at the Enterance of Osage River at dark and encamped on the Spot we had encamped on the 1st. &amp; 2nd. of June 1804 haveing came 72 miles. a very singular disorder is takeing place amongst our party that of the Sore eyes. three of the party have their eyes inflamed and Sweled in Such a manner as to render them extreamly painfull, particularly when exposed to the light, the eye ball is much inflaimed and the lid appears burnt with the Sun, the cause of this complaint of the eye I can't [account] for. from it's sudden appearance I am willing to believe it may be owing to the reflection of the sun on the water. Saturday 20th Septr. 1806 as three of the party was unabled to row from the State of their eyes we found it necessary to leave one of our crafts and divide the men into the other Canoes, we left the two Canoes lashed together which I had made high up the River Rochejhone, those Canoes we Set a drift and a little after day light we Set out and proceeded on very well. The Osage river [is] very low and discharges but a Small quantity of water at this time for so large a river. at meridian we passed the enterance of the Gasconnade river below which we met a perogue with 5 french men bound to the Osarge Gd. village. the party being extreemly anxious to get down ply their ores very well, we saw some cows on the bank which was a joyfull Sight to the party and caused a Shout to be raised for joy at [blank in MS.] P M we came in Sight of the little french Village called Charriton (Charrette) the men raised a Shout and Sprung upon their ores and we soon landed opposit to the Village.1 1 For an account of this last white settlement upon the Missouri, see our vol. i, pp. 28, 29. La Charette was founded early in the Spanish regime (probably about 1766), and for many years maintained a precarious existence. When Brackenridge passed (1810), there were thirty houses. The site has long since been engulfed in the river. It was near the present Marthasville, Warren County. As evidence of the rapid increase of settlement, the travellers of 1810 found pioneer outposts nearly up to Fort Osage, two hundred and seventy-five miles above La Charette. See Thwaites, Early Western Travels, v, vi.—Ed. our party requested to be permited to fire off their Guns which was alowed &amp; they discharged 3 rounds with a harty cheer, which was returned from five tradeing boats which lay opposit the village. we landed and were very politely received by two young Scotch men from Canada one in the employ of Mr. Aird a Mr. [blank space in MS.] and the other Mr. Reed, two other boats the property of Mr Lacomb &amp; Mr. [blank space in MS.] all of those boats were bound to the Osage and Ottoes. those two young Scotch gentlemen furnished us with Beef flower and some pork for our men, and gave us a very agreeable supper. as it was like to rain we accepted of a bed in one of their tents. we purchased of a citizen two gallons of Whiskey for our party for which we were obliged to give Eight dollars in Cash, an imposition on the part of the citizen. every person, both French and americans seem to express great pleasure at our return, and acknowledged themselves much astonished in seeing us return. they informed us that we were supposed to have been lost long since, and were entirely given out by every person &amp;c. Those boats are from Canada in the batteaux form and wide in perpotion to their length. their length [is] about 30 feet and the width 8 feet &amp; pointed bow and stern, flat bottom and rowing six ores only the Skenackeity [Schenectady] form. those Bottoms are prepared for the navigation of this river, I beleive them to be the best calculated for the navigation of this river of any which I have Seen2 2 Schenectady boats were almost exclusively used on the Canadian waterways. See "Long's Voyages," in Early Western Travels, ii, p. 213. Stoddard, Sketches of Louisiana, p. 303, compares favorably the efficiency of these craft with the usual Missouri keel-boats.—Ed. . they are wide and flat not Subject to the dangers of the roleing Sands, which larger boats are on this river. the American inhabitants express great disgust for the govermt. of this Teritory. from what I can lern it arises from a disapmt. of getting all the Spanish Grants Confirmed1 1 The Spanish grant question was difficult to adjust. In the latter years of the occupancy by Spain (after 1795), inducements were held out to American immigrants. Large grants were made to them without surveys, and with but the written or verbal permission of the Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Louisiana; complete titles could be obtained only at New Orleans. As most of the settlers were too poor to undertake this expensive journey, probably not one-fourth of the land was held by perfect titles. After the rumor of French domination began to spread (1800), large numbers of fraudulent grants were made (see report of Major Stoddard, in American State Papers, "Public Lands," i, pp. 173, 177); whereupon Congress (in the act of March 26, 1804), in organizing the newly acquired territory, declared all grants of public land after the treaty of San Ildefonso (1800) null and void, with, however, a proviso to protect bona fide settlers. The dissatisfaction of the inhabitants of Upper Louisiana found expression in a petition to Congress, January, 1805 (American State Papers, "Miscellaneous," vol. i, pp. 400–406). Two months later, Congress passed an act providing for a commission to adjust titles and take evidence upon claims. The President appointed to this duty John B. C. Lucas, Clement B. Penrose, and James Lowry Donaldson—the last-named being superseded by Frederick Bates—which commission met for the first time in St. Louis on the very day Clark penned the above observation on the existing discontent. The commission continued its work until 1812, when a report was made to Congress, adjusting many hundreds of titles. For this report see American State Papers, "Public Lands," ii, pp. 388–603.—Ed. . Came 68 ms day. Sunday 21st Septr. 1806 rose early this morning colected our men several of them had axcepted of the invitation of the citizens and visited their families. at half after 7 A. M we Set out. passed 12 canoes of Kickapoos assending on a hunting expedition. Saw Several persons also stock of different kind on the bank which reviv'd the party very much. at 3 P M we met two large boats assending. at 4 P M we arived in Sight of St. Charles, the party rejoiced at the Sight of this hospita[b]l[e] village plyed thear ores with great dexterity and we Soon arived opposit the Town this day being Sunday we observed a number of Gentlemen and ladies walking on the bank, we saluted the Village by three rounds from our blunderbuts and the Small arms of the party, and landed near the lower part of the town. we were met by great numbers of the inhabitants, we found them excessively polite. we received invitations from Several of those Gentlemen a Mr. Proulx, Taboe, Decett, Tice Dejonah &amp; Quarie and several who were pressing on us to go to their houses, we could only visit Mr. Proulx and Mr. Deucett in the course of the evening1 1 Probably Basil Proulx, one of the early inhabitants of St. Charles; and Francis Duquette, who came from Quebec to the Illinois (1774), and settling first at Ste. Geneviève, removed to St. Charles about 1796, where he died in 1816. He was the most prominent trader and land-holder of the village, and first judge of the district. See our vol. i, p. 18.—Ed. . Mr. Querie under took to Supply our party with provisions &amp;c. the inhabitants of this village appear much delighted at our return and seem to vie with each other in their politeness to us all. we came only 48 miles to day. the banks of the river thinly settled &amp;c. (some Settlements since we went up) Monday 22nd.. of Septr. 1806 This morning being very wet and the rain Still continueing hard, and our party being all sheltered in the houses of those hospitable people, we did not [think] proper to proceed on until after the rain was over, and continued at the house of Mr. Proulx. I took this oppertunity of writeing to my friends in Kentucky &amp;c. at 10 A M. it seased raining and we colected our party and Set out and proceeded on down to the Contonemt. at Coldwater Creek about 3 miles up the Missouri on it's Southern banks,2 2 Although the cession of Louisiana by France to Spain was signed November 3, 1762, it was not until 1766 that d'Ulloa, the first Spanish governor, arrived at New Orleans. The following year he sent a detachment of troops to St. Louis. Their commandant finding them obnoxious to the French settlers withdrew to this site and built a fort named Charles the Prince. In 1797, however, the land was granted by Governor Trudeau to a private citizen. When the Americans took possession, a treaty was made with the Sauk and Fox tribes, providing for the establishment of a factory where these tribes "can be supplied with goods at a more reasonable rate than they have been accustomed to procure them." Accordingly, Gen. James Wilkinson was directed to build a fort and factory, and in 1805 erected on the site of the old Spanish post Fort Bellefontaine—so called from "a fountain of pure water competent to supply a thousand men daily." Quarters for the men, a magazine, and storehouse were built of green logs cut upon the ground. Four iron field-pieces were brought from St. Louis and mounted in the rear of the cantonment. From 1809–15 Bellefontaine was headquarters of the department of Louisiana (including Forts Madison, Massac, Osage, and Vincennes), and was the starting-point of Pike's, Long's, and Atkinson's expeditions. During the War of 1812–15 it was frequently threatened by marauding bands of British Indians, but never attacked. The last return from this post is dated June 30, 1826, when it was garrisoned by four companies of the First Infantry. On July 10 of that year it was finally abandoned as a military post in favor of Jefferson Barracks; a small arsenal of deposit, however, was maintained until 1834, and two years later the land was sold by the government. A number of stone foundations are yet to be seen at this spot, and the stone magazine is still standing. In 1904 the bodies buried in the fort cemetery were removed to that of Jefferson Barracks.— Walter B. Douglas. at this place we found Col°. [Thomas] Hunt1 1 Col. Thomas Hunt was born at Watertown, Mass., Sept. 17, 1754. His ancestors had served the colony in military affairs, and he entered the Revolutionary army early in 1775, serving as sergeant at Lexington and Concord, ensign in a Massachusetts regiment in 1775, adjutant of the Twenty-fifth Continental Infantry in 1776, brigade major in October, 1776, and captain in 1779. He was wounded both at Stony Point (1779) and Yorktown (1781). In 1791 he was appointed captain of the Second Infantry, major in 1793, and after transference to the First Infantry (1796) was promoted to a colonelcy in April, 1803. His later service was under Wayne (1796), and after that campaign he held command successively of Forts Defiance, Wayne, Industry, Shelby at Detroit (1800), and Mackinac (1803). In 1805 he took command of the newly established Fort Bellefontaine, dying there in 1808. His body, with that of his wife, was removed to Jefferson Barracks in 1904.—Walter B. Douglas. &amp; a Lieut. Peters2 2 George Peter of Maryland was second lieutenant in the Ninth Infantry, 1799, lieutenant of artillery, 1801, captain, 1807, resigning from the army, 1809. He died at Washington, June 22, 1861.—Ed. &amp; one Company of Artillerists we were kindly received by the Gentlemen of this place. Mrs. Wilkinson the Lady of the Govr. &amp; Genl. we wer sorry to find in delicate health. we were honored with a Salute of [blank space in MS.] Guns and a harty welcom. at this place there is a publick store kept in which I am informed the U.S have 60000$ worth of indian Goods Tuesday 23rd. Septr. 1806 we rose early took the Chief3 3 This Mandan chief, Shahaka, remained a year among the whites; and in the summer of 1807, Clark, then Indian agent for Louisiana, sent him up the Missouri with two trading-parties and a small detachment of soldiers. During Shahaka's absence, his people and the Arikara had been engaged in hostilities, and the latter tribe had been joined by some Sioux; Clark says "(no doubt under the influence of the British Traders) to prevent all parties from assending the Missouri." On Sept. 9 these hostiles attacked the American party, which was conducted by Ensign Nathaniel Pryor, and compelled him to return to St. Louis. See letters by Clark and Pryor, narrating the circumstances of this affair, in Annals of Iowa, Jan., 1895, pp. 613– 620. Shahaka was finally sent to his home by Lewis, arriving there Sept. 24, 1809. See Chittenden, Amer. Fur Trade, i, pp. 139–141.—Ed. to the publick store &amp; furnished him with Some clothes &amp;c. took an early breckfast with Col°. Hunt and Set out decended to the Mississippi and down that river to St. Louis at which place we arived about 12 oClock. we Suffered the party to fire off their pieces as a Salute to the Town. we were met by all the village and received a harty welcom from it's inhabitants &amp;c. here I found my old acquaintance Majr. W. Christy who had settled in this town in a public line as a Tavern Keeper1 1 William Christy was a Scotch Irishman of Pennsylvania, whose father had served under Braddock (1755). Born at Carlisle in 1764, he early removed to Pittsburg and then to Kentucky, where he lived neighbor to the Clarks at Louisville. Having served both under St. Clair (1791) and Wayne (1794), his health became shattered; upon the advice of his physician he removed in 1804 to St. Louis, where he lived until his death in 1849, contributing largely to the upbuilding of the new community. He served in several public capacities—as judge, major of militia, auditor of public accounts, and register of the federal land office (1820–33).—Ed. . he furnished us with store rooms for our baggage and we accepted of the invitation of Mr. Peter Choteau and took a room in his house. we payed a friendly visit to Mr. August Chotau and some of our old friends this evening. as the post had departed from St. Louis Capt. Lewis wrote a note to Mr. Hay2 2 John Hays came from New York to Cahokia in the early days of the American regime. He embarked in the Mississippi fur trade, was sheriff of St. Clair County for a protracted term (1798–1818), and at this time was in charge of the United States mails at Cahokia.—Ed. in Kahoka [Cahokia] to detain the post at that place until 12 tomorrow which was reather later than his usial time of leaveing it Wednesday 24th of September 1806 I sleped but little last night however we rose early and commenc[e]d wrighting our letters Capt Lewis wrote one to the presidend3 3 See our vol. vii, Appendix, for Lewis's letter to Jefferson; also Clark's letter to George Rogers Clark (Sept. 24), Clark's letter to Charbonneau (Aug. 20), and contemporary newspaper notices of the expedition. and I wrote Govr.
