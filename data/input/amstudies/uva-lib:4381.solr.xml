LEWIS'S SUMMARY VIEW OF RIVERS AND CREEKS, ETC.1 1 Found in Codex O, pp. 19–128, and apparently written at Fort Mandan during the winter of 1804–05.—Ed. A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE RIVERS AND CREEKS, which discharge thems[elves] into the Missouri; containing a discription of their characters and peculiarities, their sources and connection with other rivers and Creeks, the quality of the lands, and the apparent face of the country through which they pass, and the width, and distance of their entrances from each other; to which is also added a short discription of some of the most remarkable points and places on the Missouri; taken from the information of Traders, Indians &amp; others; together with our own observations, from the junction of that river with the Mississippi, to Fort Mandan. The confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers is situated in 89°. 57′. 45″ Longitude West from Greenwich, and 38°. 55′. 19″. 6. North Latitude. Ascending the Missouri from hence, at the distance of 21 miles, you arrive at the Village of St. Charles, situated on the North bank of the river, in a narrow tho' elivated plain, which is bounded in the rear by a range of small hills; hence the appellation of Petit cote, a name by which, this village is better known to the inhabitants of the Illinois, than that of St. Charles. The village is bisected or divided into two equal parts by one prinsipal street about a mile in length, runing nearly parallel with the river. It contains a Chapple, one hundred dwelling houses and about 450 inhabitants. the houses are generally small and but illy constructed. a great majority of the inhabitants are miserably poor, illiterate, and when at home, excessively lazy; tho' they are polite, hospitable and by no means deficient in point of natural genious. they live in great harmony among themselves, and place as implicit confidence in the doctrines of their speritual pastor, (the Roman Catholic priest) as they yeald passive obedience to the will of their temporal master, the Commandant. A small garden of vegetables is the usual extent of their cultivation. this labour is commonly imposed on the old men and boys; those in the vigor of life view the cultivation of the soil as a degrading employment, and in order to gain the necessary subsistence for themselves and families, either undertake hunting voyages on their own account, or engage themselves as hirelings to such as possess sufficient capital to extend their traffic to the natives to the interior parts of the country. on those voyages in either case, they are frequently absent from their families or homes, the term of six, twelve, or eighteen months, during which time they are always subjected to severe and incessant labour, exposed to the ferosity of the lawless savages, the vicissitudes of the weather and climate, and dependant on chance and accedent alone, for food, raiment, or relief in the event of malady; yet they undertake those voyages with cheerfullness, and prefer the occupation of the hunter, or engage, to that of the domestic, and independent farmer. Ascending the Missoury at the distance of 12 miles, Bonhomme Creek discharges itself on the S. side. it is 23 yards wide at it's entrance is of no great length, &amp; passes through a fertile well timbered country, inhabited by American emigrants principally. At the distance of 9 miles higher up we pass the mouth of the Osage woman's river, which discharges itself on the N. side; it is 30 yards wide at it's entrance, heads with two small streams which discharge themselves into the Mississippi a small distance above the mouth of the Illinois River, is navigable for perogues some miles during the spring season, and waters a fertile well timbered country inhabited by about fifty American families. this part of the country is generally called Boon's settlement, having derived it's name from it's first inhabitant Col° Daniel Boon, a gentleman well known in the early settlement of the state of Kentucky. About 9 miles higher up, and 69, from the Mississippi, Chaurette Creek falls in on the N. side. it is 20 yards wide at it's mouth, waters a tolerable country well covered with timber, but is of no great extent. it heads with the waters of the River Ocuivre1 1 The Cuivre River, which falls into the Mississippi a little below Hastings, Ill.—Ed. a branch of the Mississippi. immediately below the mouth of this creek five French families reside, who subsist by hunting and a partial trade w[h]ich they mantain with a few detached Kickapoos who hunt in the neighbourhood. this is the last settlement of white persons which we meet with in ascending the Missouri. At the distance of 34 miles higher up the Gasconade disembogues on the S. side behind a small Island covered with willow. at it's entrance it is 157 yards wide, but is much narrower a little distance up, and is not navigable, (hence the name gasconade) this river is of no great length, heads with the Marameg &amp; St. Francis rivers. the country watered by this river, is generally broken, thickly covered with timber and tolerably fertile. the hills which border on the Missouri near the mo[u]th of this river are about 300 feet high, containing excellent limestone in great abundance. I have observed in ascending the Missouri to this place, that whenever the river washes the base of the hills on either side, it discloses large quarries of this stone, lying in horizontal stratas, from 10 to 40 feet in thickness. this stone is of light brown colour, with a smal tint of blue; fracture imperfect conchoidal; when broken it presents the appearance of a variety of small shells and other marine substances, of which it seems to be entirely composed. in this solid and massive rock, are inclosed stones of yellowish bro [w] n flint, of bulbous and indeterminate shapes, from an ounce, to ten or twelve pounds weight. these stratas of limestone are not unusually found overlaying a strata of freestone, or soft sandstone, from two to twenty feet in thickness. this stone produces lime of an excellent quality, and is the same with that, which makes it's appearance on the Mississippi from Cape Gerrardeau, to the entrance of the Missouri. F[i]fteen miles up we pass Muddy River which falls in on the N side. this river waters a most delightfull country; the land lies well for cultivation, and is fertile in the extreem, particularly on the Missouri, both above and below this river for many miles; it is covered with lofty and excellent timber, and supplyed with an abundance of fine bould springs of limestone water. this river is 50 yards wide several miles above it's mouth. 2 miles higher up Muddy creek discharges itself; it is 20 yards wide at it's mouth, heads with cedar Creek, and the branches of Muddy river. the country through which it passes is similar to that last mentioned. At the distance of 19 miles higher up, you arrive at the mouth of the Osage River; being 137 miles from the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi. it is 397 yards wide at it's mouth, opposite to which, the Missouri is 875 yards wide. it disembogues on the S. side just above a cluster of small Islands. it takes it's rise in an open country of Plains and Praries, with some of the Northern branches of the Arkansas; some of it's tributary streams on it's North side, also have their sou [r] ces in a similar country, with the Southern branches of the Kanzas river. The rivers Arkansas and Kanzas circumscribe the length of this river, and interlock their branches to the West of it. The country watered by this river, is generally level &amp; fertile, tho' it is more broken on the lower portion of the river; the bottom lands are wide, well timbered, and but partially liable to inundation; the soil consists of a black rich loam many feet in debth. the uplands also consist of a dark loam overlaying a yellow or red clay; a majority of the country consists of plains intersperced with groves of timber. the timber still diminishes in quantity as you proceed Westwardly with the river. on the South side of this river 30 leagues below the Osage Village, there is a large lick, at which some specimenes of the bones of the Mammoth have been found; these bones ar [e] said to be in considerable quantities, but those which have been obtained as yet, were in an imperfect state. Mr. Peter Chouteau, a gentleman of St. Louis, made an attempt some years since to explore this lick, but was compelled to desist from his labour, in consequence of the quantity of water discharged into the lick from a neighbouring spring, which he had not the means or the leasure to divert; since which time, no further attempt has been made. The specimens obtained by Mr. Couteau were large; but much mutilated. the Osage river is navigable 120 leages for boats and perogues of eight or ten tons burthen, during the fall and spring seasons; in winter it's navigation is obstructed by ice, and during the Summer months it experiences an unusual depression of it's waters, a characteristic of most streams, which have their sources in an open plain country, or which, in their courses pass through a majority of that discription of lands. the bed of the river is generally composed of mud, gravel and sand, and is but little obstructed by rocks or driftwood. At the distance of five miles above the mouth of the Osage river, Murrow[Moreau] Creek falls in on the S. side, 20 yards wide at it's mouth and navigable for perogues a few miles. it takes it's rise with the waters of the Osage river and those of Salt river (branch of the Missouri) it traverses in it's course to the Missouri, a tolerable country, well timbered and water[e]d. the mouth of this creek is the point at which the Saukes, Foxes, and Ayouways usually pass this river [to] wars with the Osages. 7 miles higher up, Cedar Creek falls in on the N. side, above an Island, on which there is Cedar, hence the name of the creek. it heads with muddy creek, and passes though a delightfull country in it's course to the Missouri. it is well timbered and abounds in springs of excellent water. at the distance of ten miles further you pass the mouth of Good-woman's Creek, about 20 yards wide. opposite to the entrance of this creek the Missouri washes the base of a high hill which is said to contain lead ore, our surch for this ore however pruved unsuccessfull and if it dose contain ore of any kind, it must be concealed. this Creek takes it['s] rise in the highlands with Split rock Creek and passes through a fertile country well timbered and watered. in the last nine miles of it's course it passes through an extensive fertile bottom nearly parallel with the Missouri. Nine miles higher you pass the mouth of Manitou Creek on the S. Side. it is but a small creek head [ing] a few miles back in an open country; the land ab[o]ut it's entrance on the Missouri are of an excellent quality and covered with good timber. Nine miles further Split rock Creek discharges itself on the N. side, twenty yards wide and navigable for perogues some miles. it waters a well timbered country; the land about the mouth, appears to be of the second quality, or at least inferior to that heretofore seen in ascending the Missouri. At the distance of 3 miles, still ascending, Salt river disembogues on the S. side; being 180 miles from the entrance of the Missouri. it is 30 yards wide and navigable for perogues 40 or 50 miles; passes through a delightfull country, intersperced with praries. so great is the quantity of salt licks and springs on this river that it's waters are said to be brackish at certain seasons of the year. one large lick and spring are situated on it's S. E. bank about nine miles from the Missouri. this river heads with the waters of the Osage river, Murrow Creek, and Mine river. Ascending the Missouri ten miles further we arrive at the entrance of Manitou river, which disembogues on the N. side, just below a high clift of limestone rock, in which we found a number of rattle-snakes of large size. this stream is about 30 yards wide, and is navigable for perogues some miles. about three miles from the Missouri on the lower side of this river there are three small springs of salt water which do not appear to be of the best quality. the country about the mouth of this river, particularly on it's lower side, is a charming one; the soil fertile in the extreme, and well covered with excellent timber. the country on the upper portion of this river is but little known. At the distance of nine miles further, Good-woman's river falls in on the N. side; it is 35 yards wide at it's entrance; meanders through an extensive rich bottom nearly parallel with the Missouri for some miles befor it discharges itself. it is navigable for perogues 15 or 20 miles, waters a fine farming country intersperced with open plains and praries, and heads with the little Shariton river. At the distance of nine miles Mine river discharges discharges itself on the S. side, it derives it's name from some lead mines which are said to have been discov[er]ed on it, tho' the local situation, quality, or quantity of this ore, I could never learn. this river is 70 yards wide at it's entrance, navigable for perogues 80 or 90 miles, and through the greater part of it's course runs parellel with the Missouri; at the distance of 70 miles up this river it is only 5 leagues distant from the Missouri. it takes it's rise in an open hilly country with Bluewater river and some of the Northern branches of the Osage river. the courant of this river is even and gentle. The country through which it passes is generally fertile, and consists of open plains and praries intersperced with groves of timber. near it's entrance the country is well timbered and watered, and the lands are of a superior quality. Twenty two miles higher up the two Shariton rivers discharge themselves on the N. side, the smaller falling into the larger on it's lower side at a small distance from the Missouri. the little Shariton river heads with Good-woman's river, and is 30 yards wide at it's entrance; this country has not been much explored, the portion of it which is known is fertile, and consists of a mixture of praries and woodlands. The larger Shariton is 70 yards wide above the entrance of the smaller, and is navigable for perogues nearly to it's source. it takes it's rise near the Red Cedar river a Western brance of the river Demoin. the country through which it passes is level, and fertile consisting of an irregular mixture of woodlands and praries, each alternately predominating in different parts. Twenty two miles higher up, the Grand river disembogues on the N. side just above a beatifull and extensive prarie in which the ancient village of the Missouris was situated. Old Fort Orleans is said to have stood on the lower point of an Island a few miles below this place, no traces of that work are to be seen. this river is 90 yards wide at it's entrance and is said to be navigable for boats and perogues a considerable distance. it heads with the Rackoon river a branch of the Demoin. The country through which it passes is similar to that discribed on the larger Shariton river. about the entrance of this river the lands are extreemly fertile; consisting of a happy mixture of praries and groves, exhibiting one of the most beatifull and picteresk seens that I ever beheld. At the distance of eight miles Snake creek falls in on the N. side. 18 yards wide at it's entrance. it runs parallel with the Missouri nearly it's whole extent, passing through a delightfull country, well timbered and watered. Thirty seven miles higher up Tigers Creek falls in on the N. side, opposite to the upper point of a large island. some excellent bottom lands in the neighbourhood of it's mouth; interior country not known. Fifteen miles higher up Eubert's river and Creek fall in on the S. side, opposite to an island, which concealed their entrances from our view. they are but small streams, head with the Mine river, and water an excellent country, consisting of a mixture of praries and woodlands. Twenty six miles further, Hay Cabbin Creek falls in on the S. side. it heads near the Bluewater river and passes through a good country. the land is very fine and well timbered near it's mouth. Seventeen miles above, Bluewater river falls in on the S. side; 36 yards wide at it's entrance; and navigable but a short distance. it has one considerable fall, and several rappids well situated for waterworks. it heads in an open country with Mine river, and passes through a roling country. the lands are tolerably good; it's bottom lands are wide, fertile and sufficiently covered with good timber; some beatifull natural meadows are also seen on it's borders. Still ascending the Missouri, at the distance of 9 miles the Kanzas river disembogues itself on the South side; being 364 miles from the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi. This river takes it's rise not very distant from the principal branch of the Arkansas in a high broken sandy country, forming the Southern extremity of the black hills. from hence it takes it's course nearly East about 300 leagues through fertile and leavel, plains &amp; praries, intersperced with groves of timbered land; it then enters a country equally fertile and well timbered, through which it meanders about 20 leagues further and discharges itself into the Missouri. it has been navigated 200 leagues and there is good reason to believe from the appearance of the river and country at that point that it is navigable for perogues much further perhaps nearly to it's source. The rivers Platte and Arkansas interlock their branches West of this stream. there are no obstructions to the navigation of the Kanzas, it's current is gentle, and the bed of the river composed of soft loam, gravel and sand; in the summer and autumn it's waters are trans parent. about 3/4 of a mile from the entrance of this river on it's North side there is a handsome bluff about 100 feet high, which furnishes an excellent situation for a fortification; there is an abundance of excellent timber for the purpose immediately at the place. The Colateral branches of this river, and the most remarkable places on the same so far as we have been enabled to inform ourselves are as follow— Names of Creeks rivers &amp; remarkable places distances from each other distances of each from the Mouth of the Kanzas. width in yards the side of the Kanzas into which they fall The three rivers, near each other and about the same size - 10 20 N.

On the West side of the Republican river, about sixty leagues above it's junction with the Kanzas, a small creek falls in on the S. W. side, called Salt creek, the water of this creek is excessively salt, salt in it's dry and granulated state, is to be found in large quantities on the borders of this stream throughout it's whole extent; the earth on which it forms, is remarkably furm, and the salt can be readily collected, free from any extranious substance, by sweeping with a brush of feathers. Ten miles higher up the Little river Platte falls in on the N. side, 60 yards wide at it's entrance. it heads in open plains between the Nadawa and grand rivers, and through the principal part of it's course passes through high open plains interspersed with groves of timber. 6 or seven leagues before it discharges itself into the Missouri, it meanders through a high fertile well timbered bottom nearly parallel with that river, and receives in it's course severall handsom creeks, which discharge themselves into it from the hills. at the distance of 12 leagues it's navigation is obstructed by a considerable fall, above which, it is shallow and interrupted by such a number of rappids, that it is no further practicable. This fall, and many of the rapids afford excellent situations for gristmills, and other water-works. Twenty five miles further Turkey Creek falls in on the S. side, this creek is but small, passes through open bottoms nearly parallel with the Missouri, and in rear of an Old Kanzas Village. this creek once furnished water to an old French garrison situated near it's mouth. Thirty three miles further Independance creek falls in on the S. side, a little below the second old village of the Kansas; is 22 yards wide at it's mouth; it possesses some excellent bottom lands, and waters a beatifull and fertile country consisting of high open plains and praries principally; on it's borders, and about it's entrance there is a sufficient quantity of timber. it takes it's rise with the Stranger's wife river, and the waters of Woolf river. we knew of no name by which this creek was called, and therefore gave it that of Independance, from the circumstance of our having arrived at it's mouth on the 4th. of July 1804. At the distance of 48 miles higher up Nadaway river discharges itself on the N. side nearly opposite to the upper point of a large Island, which bears it's name. it is 70 yards wide some miles above it's mouth, and is navigable for perogues a very considerable distance. it takes it's rise with grand River, Nish-nah-ba-to-na, and the waters of the river Demoin; and passes in it's course to the Missouri through a fine fertile country, consisting of a mixture of woodlands and plains; the lands about it's mouth are well timbered and water [e]d. Fourteen miles [further] up the Missouri, Woolf river discharges itself on the S. side. it is 60 yards wide at it's entrance and navigable for perogues a considerable distance; takes it's rise with the waters of the Kanzas and Ne-ma-haw rivers, and in it's course to the Missouri passes through a level fertile country principally open plains and praries, tho' generally well watered and possesses a sufficient quantity of timber on it's borders and near it's mouth. great quantities of grapes, plumbs &amp; raspberries are found in the neighbourhood of this stream. Sixteen miles higher up, Big Ne-ma-har falls in on the S. side, opposite to an Island covered with willows; it is 80 yards wide, and navigable for large boats some distance, and for perogues nearly to it's source. it heads with Blue-water river, branch of the Kanzas, and throughout it's whole course, passes through rich, and level plains, and praries. there is some timber on it's borders, and about it's entrance; it's tributary streams are also furnished with some timber. the country is well watered. Three miles further the Tarkio Creek falls in on the N. side, twenty three yards wide at it's entrance; it is navigable for perogues a short distance. it heads with the Nadiway and passes through a tolerable country of plains and woodland. Twenty five miles higher up The Nish-nah-ba-to-na River discharges itself opposite to the lower point of an Island on the N. Side, and is 50 yards in width at it's entrance. it heads with the Nadawa river and passes through a fertile country deversifyed with plains meadows and woodlands; considerable bodys of the latter appear in some parts of this country. at the Bald-pated prarie, it enters the Missouri bottom and approaches that river within 300 paces, when it returns again to the highlands, and continues it's course along the foot of the same about 30 miles before it discharges itself. at the Bald pated prarie it is 40 yards wide, possesses considerable debth of water, and is navigable many miles; the country lying between the Missouri and this river, from the Balld pated prarie nearly to it's mouth, is one of the most beautiful, level and fertile praries that I ever beheld; it is from one to three miles in width. there is a considerable quantity of timber on the banks of the Missouri, and but little on the Nishnabatona. At the distance of eight miles higher up, the Little Ne-ma-har River falls in on the S. side. 40 yards wide. it heads with salt River branch of the River Platte, and passes through an open fertile country in[t]ersperced with groves of timber. it is navigable some miles for large perogues. there are several handsome streams of fine water, which fall into the Missouri both above and below the mouth of this river in it's neighbourhood. Fifty two miles higher up, Weeping water Creek falls in on the S. side. it is 25 yards wide at it's entrance, heads in high broken plains near Salt River, and passes through a roling country, mostly uncovered with timber and not very fertile there is a scant proportion of timber on it[s] banks and some clumps of trees are scattered over the face of the country. there is some handsom bottom lands on this stream, and the country is generally well wartered. Thirty two miles higher up, and distant 630 from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi, the great river Platte disembogues on the S. side. The steady, regular, and incessant velocity of this stream, is perhaps unequaled by any on ea[r]th; notwithstanding it's great rapidity the surface of the water continues smooth, except when occasionally interruped by a boiling motion, or ebullition of it's waters. this motion of the water is also common to the Missouri, and Mississippi, below the mouth of that river, and always takes place in the most rappid part of the current; in this manner the water is seen to rise suddenly many inches higher than the common surface, then breaking with a rappid and roling motion, extends itself in a circular manner in every direction arround, interrupting the smooth, tho' rappid surface of the water for many yards. this ebullition of the water of those rivers, is a singular phenomenon, nor do I know to what cause to attribute it, unless it be, the irregular motion of large masses of sand and mud at their bottoms, which are constantly changing their positions. The bed of the river Platte is composes [d] almost entirely of white sand, the particles of which, are remarkably small and light; these collecting, form large masses, which being partially buoyed up, are hurryed along at the bottom by this impetuous torrent, with irresistible force; sometimes obstructed by each other, suddenly stop; and form large sand bars in the course of a few hours, which are again as suddonly dissipated to form others, and to give place perhaps to the deepest channel of the river. From the experiments and observations we are enabled to make, with rispect to the comparitive velocity of the currents of the Mississippi, Missouri and Platte rivers, it results, that a vessel will float in the Mississippi below the mouth of the Missouri, at the rate of four miles an hour; in the Missouri from it's junction with the Mississippi to the entrance of Osage river at the rate of 5 1/2 to 6 miles an hour; from thence to the Kanzas from 6 1/2 to 7; from thence to the Platte, from 5 1/2 to 6 miles an hour, while that of the Platte is at least 8. The current of the Missouri above the entrance of the Platte is equal to about 3 1/2 miles an hour as far as the mouth of the Chyenne river, when it abates to about 3 miles an hour, with which it continues as far as we have yet ascended it; and if we can rely on the information of the Indians, it's current continues about the same to the falls of the Missouri, situated five hundred miles above Fort Mandan. The river Platte dose not furnish the Missouri with it's colouring matter, as has been asserted by some; but it throws into it immence quant[it]ies of sand, and gives a celerity to it's current, of which it dose not abate untill it joins the Mississippi. The water of the Platte is turbid at all seasons of the year, but it is by no means as much so, as that of the Missouri; the sediment it deposits consists of small particals of white sand, while that of the Missouri is composed principally of a dark rich loam in much greater quantity. This river has in some few instances been navigated as high as the Pania Village with perogues, but it is attended with infinate labour and risk. Hunters have also ascended this river in small canoes as high as the Woolf river, a distance of 35 leagues; and the savages sometimes descend in small leather canoes made of a Buffaloe's skin. When the Plat enters the Missouri it's superior force changes and directs the current of the latter ag[a]inst it's Northern bank, compressing it within a channel of not more than one fifth of the width it had just before occupyed. this river is 600 yards wide at it's entrance; and when we passed it, on the 21st. of July, it's greatest debth of water was five feet. we were informed by one of our engages, who is well acquainted with this river for a considerable distance, that in many places it was from two to three miles wide, containing great numbers of small islands and sand bars, and that the navigation became wo[r]se, the higher he ascended. the banks of this river are very low, yet it is said, that it very seldom overflows them, or rises more than about 6 feet perpendicular above it's lowest tide. The position of the head of the Southern, or main branch of this river is not well asscertained; on connecting the sources of the rivers better known, it appears most probable, that it takes it's rise in the Rockey, or shineing Mountains with the Bravo or North river, and the Yellow stone river, branch of the Missouri; from whence it takes it's course nearly East, passing the heads of the Arkansas at no great distance from Santa Fee, continues it's rout to the Missouri, through immence level and fertile plains and meadows, in which, no timber is to be seen except on it's own borders and those of it's tributary streams. commencing at the Missouri and ascending this river, it's principal subsidiary streams are first the Salt river, seven leagues distant, falls in on the S. side, and is 50 yards in width. this stream is however more remarkable for the excellency of it's salt licks and springs than for it's magnitude. the whole courant of this river is brackis[h] in the Summer season quite to it's mouth. There are three principal salines on this stream; the first at the distance of 50 miles from it's mouth, and the others at no great distance above; two of these furnis[h] considerable quantities of salt in it's dry and granulated state, the other furnishes salt both granulated, and in compact masses. the granulated salt is found on the surface of a compact and hard earth composed of fine sand with a small proportion of clay producing no vegitable substance of any kind and is easily collected by sweeping it together with a soft broom or brush of feathers. the massive salt is formed by concretion, and is found either on the surface of the earth over which the water passes, or adhering to stones sticks or other furm substances washed by the salt water in it's passage. I have obtained no satisfactory account of any fossil salt being found in Louisiana, altho' repeated enquiries have been made off such as possess the best information of the interior parts of the country; I am therefore disposed to believe, that those travellers who have reported it's exhistance, must have mistaken this massive salt, formed by concretion, for that substance, saltpetre has been found in it's crystallized state in some limestone caverns near the head of this river. Thre[e] leagues above the salt river a beatifull clear and gentle stream called Corne des Cerfe, or hart's horn river discharges itself on the N. side. it is about sixty yards wide. it takes it's rise in some sandy plains between the Wolf River and the Quecurre; thence runing Eastwardly approaches the Missouri within a few leagues opposite to the entrance of the Sioux river, thence veering about to the S. E. passes through a fertile level country, parallel with the Missouri to the River Platte. it is navigable a considerable distance for canoes and light perogues. there is but little timber in the country through which it passes. Ascending the Platte five leagues further you pass the village of the Ottoes and Missouris situated on the S. side. 15 leagues higher up and on the same side, the Panias Proper, and Republican Panias reside in one large village. five leagues further still ascending, the Wolf river falls in on the N. side. 400 hundred yards wide, and is navigable for Perogues between 4 and 500 miles, and for large boats a very considerable distance. This stream takes it's rise in a remarkable large fountain, situated in a level plain, equadistant betwen the rivers Quicurre and Plat, at some little distance below the Cote noir or Black Hills; from whence it passes through level and fertile plains and meadows in which there is scarcely a tree to be seen except on it's own borders, and those of it's tributary streams. the current of this river is gentle and sufficiently deep; it's bed is composed principally of a brown sand, unbroken by rocks or drift wood, and has no rappids worthy of notice from it's source to it's mouth. At the distance of seventy five leagues higher up, Ringing Water river falls in on the S. side, about 300 yards wide. heads in the Black hills near the source of the Kanzas, and passes through an open tho' broken country about half it's course; it then decends into a level and fertile country composed almost entirely of open plains and meadows through which it passes to the Platte. Just above the black hills, th[r]ough which the Platte passes, a large river said to be nearly as large as the South fork, falls in on the N. side, after haveing continued it's rout along the Western side of the Black hills for a very considerable distance. the distance from the entrance of this river to the mouth of the Platte is not well asscertained. This is usually called the Paducas fork; it heads with the Bighorn river, branch of the Yellow Stone, in some broken ranges of the Rockey mountains. it's upper portion passes through a hilly, broken and Mountanous country, possessing considerable quantities of timber; it then descends to a plain open and level country lying between the Rockey Mounts and the black hills, through which it passes to join the Platte. there are some considerable bodies of woodland on and near this stream. The smaller branches of the rivers Platte &amp; Wolf so far as they are known to us are as follows; they uniformly water a level open country generally fertile.

Three miles above the entrance of the river Platte Butterfly Creek falls in on the S. side, 18 yards wide, heads in the plains between the Hart's Horn river and the Missouri; the courntry fertile with but little timber. 7 miles higher Musquetoe Creek falls in on the N. side; it is 22 yards wide and heads with the Nishnahbatona river in an open country. the Missouri bottom through which it passes is about 6 miles wide, level, extreemly fertile and about one half well covered with timber. 20 miles further Indian Creek falls in opposite to the lower point of an Island on the N. side, three miles above an old Ayouway's village. it heads in the highlands a few miles back; passes through the Missouri bottom and approaches the river within 20 feet, 6 miles above it's entrance; at this point it is 5 feet higher than the water of the Missouri. it is 15 yards wide. 8 miles higher up Bowyer's river falls in on the N. side. it is 25 yards wide, and navigable for perogues some distance; passes through a country tolerably fertile, with but little timber. Twelve miles above the mouth of Bowyer's river we arrive at the Council Bluff on the S. side. this is one of the points, which in our statistical view of the Indian Nations of Louisiana, we have recommended as an eligible position for a trading establishment. it is a delightfull situation for a fortification, &amp; commands a view of the river both above and below for a considerable distance. the base of the Bluff is washed by the river about a mile; it is about 60 feet high &amp; nearly perpendicular; at it's lower extremity it leaves the river nearly at right angles, decending with a handsome and regular declivity on it's lower side about 40 feet to a high, level, fertile and extensive bottom, lying betwen itself and the river. the top of the bluff is a level plain from one to two miles in width, and about five miles in length. This place would be sufficiently convenient for the Ottoes, Missouris, Panias Proper, Panias, Loups, Panias Republican, Poncaras, Mahas, &amp; the Yanktons Ahnah. if peace is established between the various tribes of Indians inhabiting this immence country, it is more than probable, that this post would also be visited by many of those wandering bands, who inhabit the country west of the black hills. The principal difficulty which will attend the erection of a fortification at this place is the want of proper timber with which to build. there is a sufficient quantity of a species of poplar common to all the bottom lands of the Missouri, called by the French inhabitants of the Illinois—Liard, and by the Americans Cotton-wood. it is a soft white wood, by no means dureable, and of which it is extreemly difficult to make plank or scantling. there is some oak in the neighbourhood but it is of an inferior quality. I concieve that the cheepest and best method would be to build of brick, the ea[r]th appears to be of an excellent quality for brick, and both lime and sand are convenient. The drift wood of the Missouri will always supply a sufficient quantity of fuell independant of that in the neighbourhood. with rispect to quality and quantity of timber, this bluff is better situated than any other for upwards of a thousand miles above it, and equal to any below it for many miles. Leaving the council Bluff and ascending the Missouri 39 miles we arrive at the mouth of Soldier's river 30 yards wide. it heads with the river Demoin, and passes to the Missouri through an open, level and fertile country. is navigable for perogues a considerable distance. 44 miles further up Ye-yeau War da-pon or stone river falls in on the N. side. this river is known to the traders of the Illinois by the name of little Sioux river, but as they have given the appellation of Sioux to four distinct streams we thought it best to adopt the name given it by the Siouxs, to whos[e] country it's entrance forms the lower boundary on the Missouri. this stream is 80 yards wide at it's entrance; takes it's rise in a small lake nine miles distant from the River demoin, with which, it communicates in high water through a small channel; the river demoin is but shallow at this point tho' it is 70 or 80 yards wide, and said to be navigable. this stream is navigable from it's sou[r]ce to the Missouri for perogues or canoes, passes through a broken country with but little timber. the land is tolerably fertile. an Easterly and most navigable fork of this river is formed by the discharge of Lake Dispree [d'Esprit or Spirit Lake] 22 leagues in circumference; this lake is long not very wide and approaches the river demoin within 15 miles. the country between the Demoin and Lake Dispree is level with but little timber, and interrupted with a number of small lakes or ponds. From the entrance of the Ye-yeau War da-pon, to the Old Maha Village, a distance of 100 miles, there is not a single stream which discharges itself into the Missouri, that is worthy of' notice. The Maha creek, on which the last village occupyed by that nation was situated at some little distance from the Missouri, discharges itself on the S. side through several channels. this creek is but small, takes it's rise in some level and fertile praries near the Hart's Horn river and passes through a delightfull country in it's course to the Missouri. the distance from the old Maha village to the Council Bluff is 90 miles by land. 16 miles higher up Floyds river falls in on the N. side 38 yards wide. This river is the smallest of those called by the trade[r]s of the Illinois the two rivers of the Sioux, but which with a view to discrimination, we have thought proper to call Floyd's river in honor of Sergt. Charles Floyd, a worthy and promising young man, one of our party who unfortunately died on the 20th. of August 1804, and was buried on a high bluff just below the entrance of this stream. This river takes it's rise with the waters of the rivers Sioux and Demoin; from whence it takes it's course nearly S. W. to the Missouri, meandering through level and fertile, plains and meadows, intersperced with groves of timber. it is navigable for perogues nearly to it's source. 3 miles above Floyds river, The river Sioux disembogues on the N. side above a bluff; it is one hundred and ten yards wide at it's entrance, and navigable nearly to it's source; with the exception of one fall of about twenty feet high, situated 70 leages from it's mouth. it takes it's rise with the St. Peter's and Vulter rivers, in a high broken and woody country called the Hills of the prarie. it waters a deversifyed country, generally level fertile and uncovered with timber; in some parts particularly, near the falls, it is broken &amp; stoney, and in others, intersected by a great number of small lakes which possess some timber generally on their borders. at no great distances below the falls and in a remarkable bend of the river, three handsom streams fall in on it's East Side at no great distance from each other; the 1st. ascending is the Prickley Pear river, which takes It's rise in some small lakes near the Demoin the 2nd. The River of the Rock, passes the head of the River Demoin, and takes it's rise in small lakes. the third is called red pipe stone river, which heads with the waters of the River St. Peters. the country watered by this last river is remarkable for furnishing a red stone, of which the savages make their most esteemed pipes. the Indians of many nations travel vast distances to obtain this stone, and it is ascerted, tho' with what justice I will not pretend to determine, that all nations are at peace with each other while in this district of country, or on the waters of this river. Sixty miles above the Sioux river the White Stone river discharges itself on the N. side. it is 30 yards wide at it's entrance, heads in a chain of Nobs West of the bend of the Sioux river, and passes in it's whole course through level—beautifull and fertile plains and meadows entirely destitute of timber. it is not navigable. 20 miles higher up little bow creek falls in on the S side, below an old Maha village. it is 20 yards wide and waters a beautifull, fertile, plain, and open country. the remains of two small ancient fortifications, are found on this creek at a short distance from it's entrance. 12 Miles higher up, and distant 974 from the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi, the river James discharges itself; it is 90 yards wide, and navigable for perogues a very considerable distance; it's current is gentle and it's bed composed of mud and sand. it takes it's rise with Chyinne river, branch of Red river which discharges itself into Lake Winipic. This st[r]eam pases through an open country of plains and meadows through it's whole course. the land is generally fertile, and a scant proportion of timber is found on the banks of the river. The Siouxs annually hold a fair on some part of this river, in the latter end of May. thither the Yanktons of the North, and the Sissitons, who trade with a Mr. Cammaron on the head of the St. Peters river, bring guns, pouder &amp; balls, kettles, axes, knives, and a variety of European manufactures, which they barter to the 4 bands of Tetons and the yanktons Ahnah, who inhabit the borders of the Missouri &amp; upper part of the River Demoin, and receive in exchange horses, leather lodges, and buffaloe robes, which they have either manufactured, or plundered from other Indian nations on the Missouri and west of it. This traffic is sufficient to keep the Siouxs of the Missouri tolerably well supplyed with arms and amunition, thus rendering them independant of the trade of the Missouri, and enableing them to continue their piratical aggressions on all who attempt to ascend that river, as well as to disturb perpetually the tranquility of all their Indian neighbours. I am perfectly convinced that untill such measures are taken by our government as will effectually prohibit all intercourse or traffic with the Siouxs by means of the rivers Demoin and St. Peters, that the Citizens of the United States can never enjoy, but partially, those important advantages which the navigation of the Missouri now presents. it appears to me that with the assistance of the garrisons of St. Louis, and Chicargoo, with the establishment of two others, the one at or near the entrance of the Oisconsin and the other on the Mississippi at Sand lake, that the passages of the trade[r]s to the rivers Demoin and St. Peters would be sufficiently guarded. by prohibiting the trade with the Siouxs through the St. Peters and Demoin for a few years, they will be made to feel their dependance on the will of our government for their supplies of merchandize, and in the course of two or three years, they may most probably be reduced to order without the necessity of bloodshed. in the mean time the trade of the Missouri will be acquiring a strength, and regularity within itself, and an influence among other Indian nations, which could not be easily interrupted by the Siouxs, when the government should hereafter t[h]ink proper to reestablish an intercourse with them, through the channels of the St. Peter's and Demoin rivers. At the distance of 38 miles higher up Plumb Creek falls in on the N. side. this creek is but small, heads in the highlands a few miles back, and passes through beatifull level and fertile praries in it's course to the Missouri. 8 miles higher up white Paint Creek, falls in on the S. side, 28 yards in width. it takes it's rise in a broken Hilly and open country between the Quicurre and Hart's horn rivers. passes through a broken country with some handsome plains an[d] praries, it is not navigable. but possesses many excellent situations for grist mills and other waterworks. 6 miles above this creek and at the distance of 1026 from the entrance of the Missouri, the River Quiccurre (Qui-court.) or rappid river, discharges itself on the S. side; where it is one hundred and fifty two yards wide. this river takes it's rise in the Black hills, about one hundred leages West of it's mouth, and passes through a variagated country. at it's source and for seventy five leagues below the country is mountanous rockey and thickly covered with timber, principally pine; the bed of the river is interrupted by immence quant[it]ies of loose and broken rocks, many ledges of rocks also lie ac[r]oss this stream over which it tumbles perpendicularly from 6 to 15 feet. in this country the Indians as well as some of the French hunters report the existence [of] many mines. some of lead, others of a metal resembleing lead, but of a lighter colour more dense &amp; equally malleable; it is not stated to be silver. this metal is said to be readily extracted from it's ore which is a loose earth, with the heat of a common fire of wood. there are said to be some sand plains of considerable extent lying between the upper portion of this river and the Hart's Horn river. the country on it's lower portion for 25 leagues consists of open plains and meadows, with but a very small proportion of timber; the bed of the river here consists entirely of a coarse brown sand. the velocity of it's current is nearly or quite equal to that of Platte. it is not navigable a single mile. 8 mile above the rappid rive[r] the Poncar river disembogues on the S side, 30 yards wide. Three miles from the mo[u]th of this river on it[s] S. side the Poncars resided a few years since in a fortifyed village, but have now joined the Mahas and become a wandering people. Poncar river heads in the open plains not far from the mouth of White river, and runs nearly parallel with the Missouri passing through some tolerably fertile plains and meadows. At the distance of 114 miles higher up, White river discharges itself on the S. side. it is 300 yards wide at it's entrance, and is navigable for boats and perogues for many leagues. this river is perfectly the Missouri in miniture, resembleing it in every particular. it takes it's rise short of the black hills, with the waters of the C[he]yenne and rappid rivers, in an open country; from whence it passes through level and fertile plains &amp; meadows, in which there is scarsely any timber to be seen. some pine most probably grows on it's borders, I discovered several sticks of that timber among the driftwood at it's entrance. 22 Miles higher up, the Three rivers of the Siouxs pass discharge themselves, on the N. side, opposite to a large Island well covered with timber. the 1st. of these streams which we meet with as we ascend is 35 yards wide, and is navigable for perogues some distance, with a few obstructions of rappids or shoals. it heads with James's river, and possesses but little timber on it's borders. the country on the upper side of this river is a high level and fertile plain of many leagues in exten[t] the lower side generally broken Praries, neither possessing any timber worthy of mention. the other two streams are small, extending only about 8 miles back, and water a country of high handsome and fertile plains, with but little timber. From hence to the commencement of the big bend is twenty miles; in this distance you pass four small Creeks, which discharge themselves on the S. side, and one on the N. side; these creeks take their rise at the distance of 6 or 7 miles in the open plains, and possess but little timber. the bottoms of the Missouri are generally wide and but badly timbered. the big bend of the Missouri lies in a circular form, and is 30 miles around, while it is only one mile and a quarter across the gorge. 5 miles above the uper extremity of this bend Tylor's river falls in, on the S. side. this river is about 35 yards wide, and is navigable some miles for perogues. it takes it's rise in an open country between the White river and river Teton, and passes through a level fertile and open country. below the mouth of this river on the Missouri there is an extensive bottom well covered with timber, consisting principally of red cedar. 55 miles higher up, the Teton River discharges itself on the S. side. this river is seventy yards wide, and is navigable for perogues many leagues. it heads with the waters of the Chyenne and White rivers, and passes through open and fertile plains and meadows. possesses some timber on it's borders, as do also it's tributary streams. in these plains there is rarely an instance of a tree to be seen. 47. miles above the entrance of the Teton river and 1327 from the Mouth of the Missouri, the rive[r] Chyenne disembogues on the S. side, and is abot 400 yards wide at it's entrance, and is navigable for perogues to it's forks near the black hills, a distance of 200 miles by land, nearly due west from it's entrance. The Northern branch of this river penetrates the Black hills, and passes through a high broken well timbered country to it's source, the Southern fork takes it's rise in the Black hills, on their E side, and passes through a broken country covered with timber, to it's junction with the N fork; from whence united, they take their course through a woody and broken country fror some few leagu[e]s, then entering an open fertile and level country it continues it's rout to the Missouri the timber of the Black hills, and on this river near them, consists of pine and Cedar principally; on it's lower portion Cottonwood and Cedar, of which however there is but a scant proportion and that confined immediately to the river hills and bottoms. about the entrance of this river we have recommended an establishment for the purpose of trading with the Indians. it's position is central and sufficiently convenient for a number of Nations and tribes; but the difficulty of procuring timber for the purpose of building is very considerable, tho' in this particular it is equal to any other for an emence distance both above and below it. a difficulty also arises with rispect to lime of which there is none in it's neighbourhood. large quantities of tar may be procured on the river near the Black hills, and may be readily brought down the river. tar and sand in the proportion of one gallon to the Bushel, make a furm and strong cement. if an establishment is made at this place, the work must of necessity be principally formed of brick; there being no stone and but little timber. the drift-wood of the Missouri will supply an ample quantity of fuell. 78 miles higher up, Otter Creek falls in on the N. side, 22 yards wide, navigable a few miles in high water. it takes it's rise in open plains nearly E. of it's entrance, and passes through a similar country; very little timber in it's vicinity. 3 miles higher up, and on the S. side, the Sar-war-car-na river discharges itself, 90 yards wide. it is navigable for perogues 40 or 50 leagues; takes it's rise short of the Black Hills with the waters of the Chyenne; from whence it meanders through fertile and level plains and meadows, almost entirely destitute of timber. 22 miles above, We-ter-hoo river discharges itself on the S. side. this stream is 120 yards wide; and may be navigated nearly to it's source in the Black Hills. It passes through a country similar to that discribed on the Sar-war-kar-na. 2 miles higher up, and the same distance below an island on which [is] the lower village of the Ricaras, the river Ma-ro-pa falls in, on the the S. side; it is 25 yards wide at it's entrance; takes it's rise about 5 leagues west of the the entrance of the war-re-con-ne river, in open plains. it passes through an uneven roling country, without timber, and but badly watered, for the distance of about 50 miles, nearly parallel to the Missouri, before it discharges itself. The Ricaras obtain a red and black earth on the borders of this stream, which they use for the purpose of painting their skins, or ornamenting their Buffaloe robes, which at all seasons of the year constitutes a principal article of their dress. Leaving the mouth of this river and ascending the Missouri, at the distance of 2 1/2 miles you pass the 1st. Ricara village, from 3 1/2 to 4 miles further, you pass two others situated on the South side near the river. still ascending at the distance of 24 miles above the entrance of Ma-ro-pa river, the Stone Idol Creek falls in on the N. side; 18 yards wide. it heads in a small lake a few leagues distant and passes through a rich level plain; the land is fertile but without timber. a canoe can pass from the river to this lake. 37 miles higher up, Sar-kar-nak or Beaver Creek falls in on the N. side, at the lower point of an Island. about 20 yards wide, heads in some small lakes a few miles from the river, and passes through a level fertile and open country. 3 Miles further still ascending, and at the distance of 1498 miles from the entrance of the Missouri, War-re-con-ne river falls in on the N. side just above an island. it is 35 yards wide at it's entrance, and is navigable in high water to it's source. takes it's rise in an assemblage of small lakes, in level and open plains, not very distant from the head of James's river. in it's course to the Missouri it passes through extensive, level and fertile, plains and meadows, in which scarsely a tree is to be seen. 13 miles higher up the Cannon Ball river falls in on the S. side, and is 140 yards wide. it is navigable for boats a considerable distance, with a few interruptions of rappids, and for perogues and Canoes nearly to it's source. it takes it's rise in a level country with the Chesschetar and the waters of the Wetarhoo rivers, from whence in it's course to the Missouri it passes through a variety of country, some broken &amp; partially timbered, near it's source; other parts broken, hilly and bare of timber, and in others beautifull and extensive plains and meadows, with but little timber, all sufficiently fertile, and some extreemly so. there is some Cottonwood, Ash and Elm on it's borders. 5 miles higher up the Fish Creek discharges itself on the N. Side; 28 yards wide. it takes it's rise in small lakes, in the open plains, and passes through handsome plains and meadows, in it's course to the Missouri; but little timber on it's borders. 35 miles higher up, Chess-che-tar, or heart river falls in on the S. W. side; 38 yards wide; not navigable except in high water, and then but a short distance. it heads with the waters of the Knife river in open plains S. W. of the turtle mountain. in it's course to the Missouri it passes through open plains and meadows, generally fertile, and always untimbered. there is some Ash, Cottonwood, and Elm on it's borders. 14 miles higher up, Hunting creek discharges itself on the S. side. it's bottom lands are wide and fertile with but little timber, takes it's rise in, and passes through an open country of high plains. 50 miles higher up at the distance of 1,615 miles from the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi, the Knife river falls in near the Village of the Ahwahharways on the S. side a little above the Mandans. this river is about 80 yards wide, but is not navigable, except for a few days in the spring of the year. It takes it's rise in the turtle Mountains about 90 Miles N. W. of it's mouth, and passes through an open fertile country. there is a considerable quantity of timber on the upper part of this river, and much more on it's borders generally than is met with on streams of the same size in this open country. The Minetares, Ahwahharways, and Mandans hunt principally on this river, and many of [the] Minetares pass the winter on it, in small parties, of 5 or six families. As we have only ascended the Missouri, a few miles above the Mouth of Knife river, the subsequent discription of this river, and it's subsidiary streams are taken altogether from Indian Information. the existence of these rivers, their connection with each other, and their relative positions with rispect to the Missouri, I conceive are entitled to some confidence. information has been obtained on this subject, in the course of the winter, from a number of individuals, questioned seperately and at different times. the information thus obtained has been carefully compared, and those points only in which they generally agreed, have been retained, their distances they give, by days travel, which we have estimated at 25 miles pr. day. About fifteen miles above the mouth of Knife river, the E-pe,-âh-zhah, or Miry river discharges itself on the N. Side. it is but an inconsiderable stream as to width, but extends itself through level and open plains about 30 miles N. E. of it's entrance, taking it's rise in some small lakes, strongly impregnated with Glauber Salts. not navigable. Ascending the Missouri about one hundred miles further, the E-mâh-tark', Ah'-zhah. or Little Missouri discharges itself on the S. side. about the width of Knife river. takes it's rise in the No [r] thern extremity of the Blackhills. and passes through a broken country with but little timber. it passes near the turtle mountain in it's course to the Missouri. it is said not to be navigable in consequence of it's rappidity and shoals. About 117 miles higher up, the Ok-hâh-Ah-zhah, or White earth river, discharges itself on the N. side. it is said to be about the size of the Cannonball river; takes it's rise N. Westwardly from it's mouth in level open plains with the waters of the S. fork of the Saskashawin river, and passes through an open and level country generally without timber some timber on the borders of this stream, it is navigable nearly to it's source, which is said not to be very distant, from the establishment of the N. West Company on the S. branch of the Saskashawin. if this information be correct it is highly probable that a line drawn due West from the lake of the Woods, in conformity to our treaty with Great Britain, would intersect the waters of this river, if so the boundary of the United States would pass Red river betwen the entrance of the Assinniboin and Lake Winnipic, including those rivers almost entirely, and with them the whole of the British trading establishments on the red Lake, Red river and the Assinniboin should the portage between the Saskashawin and White earth river, prove not to be very distant or difficult, it is easy to conceive the superior advantages, which the Missouri offers as a rout to the Athabasca country, compared with that commonly traveled by the traders of Canada. About 3 miles above the mouth of White Earth river the Me'-ah'-zah, or Yellowstone river discharges itself on the S. side. this river is said to be nearly as large as the Missouri, but is more rappid. it takes it's rise in the Rocky mountains, with the waters of a river on which the Spaniards reside; but whether this stream be the N. river, or the waters of the Gulph of California, our information dose not enable us to determine. from it's source it takes it's course for many miles through broken ranges of the Rocky mountains, principally broken, and stoney, and thickly timbered. the vallies said to be wide in many places and the lands fertile. after leaving the Rocky mountains it decends into a country more level, tho' still broken, fertile and well timbered. this discription of country continues as far down as the Oke-tar-pas-ah –ha, where the river enters an open level and fertile country through which it continues it's rout to the Missouri; even in this open country it possesses considerable bodies of well timbered land. there are no stream [s] worthy of notice which discharge themselves into this river on the N. side, the country between this river and the Missouri being watered by the Mussle shell river. the yellow Stone river is navigable at all seasons of the year, for boats or perogues to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, near which place, it is said to be not more than 20 miles distant from the most southernly of the three forks of the Missouri, which last is also navigable to this point. if Indian information can be relied on, this river waters one of the fairest portions of Louisiana, a country not yet hunted, and abounding in animals of the fur kind. The bed of this river is formed of sand gravel and yellow rock. from the great rapidity of this stream after it enters the rocky mountains, it is said not to be navigable. we are informed that there is a sufficiency of timber near the mouth of this river for the purpose of erecting a fortification, and the necessary buildings. in point of position, we have no hesitation in declaring our belief, of it's being one of the most eligible and necessary, that can be chosen on the Missouri, as well in a governmental point of view, as that of affording to our citizens the benefit of a most lucrative fur trade. this establishment might be made to hold in check the views of the British N. West Company on the fur-trade of the upper part of the Missouri, which we believe it is their intention to monopolize if in their power. They have for several years maintained a partial trade with the Indian nations on the Missouri near this place, over land from their establishment at the entrance of Mouse river on the Assinniboin, unlicenced by the Spanish government, then the sovereigns of the country. But since the U'States have acquired Louisiana, we are informed, that relying on the privilege extended to them by our treaty with Great Britain, they intend fixing a permanent establishment on the Missouri near the mouth of Knife river, in the course of the present summer. if this powerfull and ambitious company, are suffered uninterruptedly to prosecute their trade with the nations inhabiting the upper portion of the Missouri, and thus acquire an influence with those people; it is not difficult to conceive the obstructions, which they might hereafter through the medium of that influence, oppose to the will of our government, or the navigation of the Missouri. whether the privileges extended to British subjects, under existing treaties with that power, will equally effect a territory not in our possession at the time those treaties were entered into, is not for me to determine; but it appears to me, that in this rispect Liouisiana is differently situated, from the other territory of the United States. The tributary streams of the Yellow stone river so far as we have been enabled to inform ourselves are as follow. Names of the subsidiary streams of the Yellow Stone river, ascending from it's entrance distance from each other &amp; of the 1st. from the mouth of the river side on which they discharge. Miles Oke-tar-pas-ah-ha 75 S. War-rah-sash, or Powder river 75 S. Le-ze-ka, or tongue river 50 S. Mar-skas-kap river 100 S. Ark tar-ha river 125 S. Ar-sar-ta, or big-horn 75 S. Stinking Cabbin creek 175 S. About one hundred fifty miles on a direct line, a little to the N. of West, a river falls in on the N. side called by the Minetares Ah-mâh-tâh, ru-shush-sher or the river which scolds at all others. this river they state to be of considerable size, and from it's position and the direction which they give it, we believe it to be the channel through which, those small streams, on the E side of the Rocky mountains laid down by Mr. Fidler, pas to the Missouri. it takes it's source in the Rocky mountains S. of the waters of the Askow or bad river. and passes through a broken country in which, there is a mixture of woodlands and praries. it is worthy of remark that, the Missouri in it's course from the mouth of the yellow stone river to the entrance of this rivr. passes considerably further to the North than the mouths of either of these rivers; this information we have received since our map has been completed. it will be observed by reference to the map, that there are no streams falling in-to the Askow on it's S. side, from which, it is probable, that the country nearly to it's borders, is watered by the streams of some other river, and as the Missouri runs considerably N. above the Mouth of the Yellow stone river. and that on it's nothern border no stream of any magnitude discharges itself except the scolding river, the probability is that the country very near to the Askow is watered by the little rivulets of the Missouri, and the branches of the s[c]olding river. I have scarsely a doubt, but that a line drawn due West from the Lake of the Woods, in conformity to our treaty with Great Britain, will intersect the waters of the Missouri, if not the main body of that river itself. About 120 miles on a direct line, nearly S. W. the Mah-tush,-ah-zhah, or Muscle shell river falls in on the S. side. this river is about the size of the Cannonball river, heads in a range of mountains which commence about the falls of the Missouri, and extending themselves nearly South terminate near the yellow stone river. this stream passes through a broken and woody country. The woody country commences on the Missouri just above the mouth of this river. About 120 miles further a little to the S. of West, on a direct line, the great falls of the Missouri are situated, this is discribed by the Indians as a most tremendious Cataract. they state that the nois it makes can be heard at a great distance, that the whole body of the river tumbles over a precipice of solid and even rock, many feet high; that such is the velocity of the water before it arrives at the precipice, that it projects itself many feet beyond the base of the rock, between which, and itself, it leaves a vacancy sufficiently wide for several persons to pass abrest underneath the torrent, from bank to bank, without weting their feet, they also state that there is a fine open plain on the N. side of the falls, through which, canoes and baggage may be readily transported. this portage they assert is not greater than half a mile, and that the river then assumes it's usual appearance, being perfectly navigable. About 15 miles further on a direct line a little to the S. of W. a large stream called Mah-pah-pah,-ah-zhah, or Medicine river falls in on the N. side. this river heads in the rocky Mountains opposite to a river which also takes it's rise in the same mountains and which runing West discharges itself into a large river, which passes at no great distance from the Rocky mountains, runing from N. to South. it passes through a mountanous, broken and woody country. not navigable in consequence of it's rapidity and shoals. About 60 miles further on a direct line nearly S. W. the Missouri passes through the first connected chain of the Rocky mountains. and is said to be rapid and shoaly from hence to the second chain of the rocky Mountains a distance of 75 miles further, about the same course last mentioned. above this second range of mountains the current of the Missouri is said to be smoth even and gentle; here two small rivers fall in on the S. side, receiving their waters from the west side [of] these mountains between the Missouri and the Yellow stone river. Still proceeding S. W. about 75 miles further the Missouri divides itself into three nearly equal branches just above a third chain of very high mountains, all these streams are navigable for some distance. the most No [r] thern is the largest, and is navigable to [the] foot of [a] chain of high mountains, being the ridge which divides the the waters of the Atlantic from those of the Pacific ocean. the Indians assert that they can pass in half a day from the foot of this mountain on it's East side to a large river which washes it's Western base, runing from S. to N. at no great distance below the Flat-head Indians live in one considerable village on the western border of this river, this is the utmost extent of the war exurtions of the Minetares and we have therefore been unable to acquire any information further West than the view from the top of thes[e] mountains extend. The Indians inform us that the country on the Western side of this river consists of open &amp; level plains like those they themselves inhabit, with a number of barren sandy nobs irregularly scattered over the face of the country; the E. side of the river, betwen it and the mountains is broken, and thickly covered with pine. they state that there are no buffaloe west of the second range of the Rockey mountains, and that the Flat-heads live principally on a large fish, which they take in the river on which they reside. The Snake Indians also frequently visit this Western river at certain seasons of the year, for the purpose of taking fish which they dry in the sun and transport on horses to their villages on the three forks of the Missouri. This river we suppose to be the S. fork of the Columbia, and the fish the Salmon, with which we are informed the Columbia river abounds. this river is said to be rapid but as far as the Indian informants are acquainted with it is not intercepted with shoals. it's bed consists principally of sand and gravel. The waters of the Missouri are transparent at all seasons of the year above the falls. With rispect to other rivers, their Subsidiary streams, and their connection with other rivers and streams, the map which is herewith forwarded, will give you a more perfict idea, than a detaled discription of them would do. the mountains, salines, trading establishments, and all the other remarkable places, so far as known to us, are also laid down on this map. Meriwether Lewis Capt. 1st. U's Regt. Infty. C. CLARK'S SUMMARY STATEMENT OF RIVERS, CREEKS, AND MOST REMARKABLE PLACES. CLARK made three tabulations of this character: (1) That found in Codex C, pp. 242–253, having been drawn up at Fort Mandan; (2) another in Codex I, pp. 2–12 (also, substantially the same, in Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 4), made at Fort Clatsop, and giving the route out; and (3) a final draft, both in Codex N, pp. 128–142, and in Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 4, prepared apparently after the return home. The third tabulation seeks to give the best route from the mouth of the Missouri to the Pacific Ocean, and includes Lewis's short-cut path homeward, between Travellers' Rest Creek and the Falls of the Missouri —given, however, in the reverse order.

The rout by which we went out by the way of the Missouri to it's head 3096 miles thence by land, by way of Lewis'es River over to Clarks river and down that to the enterance of travellers rest Creek where all the roads from different routs come together thence across the ruged part of the rocky Mountains to the Navagable branches of the Columbia 398 Miles. thence down that river 640 miles to the Pacific Ocean makeing a Total distance of 4134 miles. On our return in 1806 from Travellers rest Creek directly to the falls of the Missouri River Shortens the distance about 579 miles, and a much better rout, reduceing the distance from Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean to 3555 miles. 25 75 miles of this distance is up the Missouri to the Falls of that river from thence passing through the plains and across the Rocky Mountains to the navagable part of Kooskooske river a branch of the Columbia 340 miles, 200 miles of which is a good road, 140 miles over a tremendious Mountain Steep and broken, 60 miles of which is covered Several feet deep with Snow on which we passed the last of June; from the navagable part of the Kooskooske we decended that rapid river 73 miles to its enterance into Lewis's river and down that river 154 miles to the Columbia and down that river 413 Miles to [its] enterance into the Pacific Ocian, about 180 miles of this distance is tide water. passed several bad rapids and narrows and one considerable fall 268 miles above the enterance of this river of 37 feet 8 inches the Total distance decending the Columbian waters 640 miles makeing a total of 3555 miles on the most direct rout from the Mississippi at the mouth of the Missouri to the pacific Ocean. The fur trade may be carried on from the heads of the Missouri to the mouth of Columbia much cheaper than by any rout by which it can be conveyed to the East indias. form an establishment on the River Rochejhone for the reception of the furs of that river &amp; South and one at Marias river below the great falls of Missouri. the Shoshones within the rocky mountains the Tushepaws on Clarks river and maney nations west of the Rocky mountains would visit those establishments from whome horses might be got on the most reasonable terms for the purpose of packing the furs across those mountains which may be passed from the 20th. of June untill the last of September. You may leave those establishments on the Missouri 15 or 20 of June and arive on the Kooskooske river between the 1st. &amp; 5th. of July. from that time you have untill the middle of September to decend the River and return to the mountains in time to pass them before the Snow becomes too Deep to cross them.

      <field name="fulltext">II. Ethnology EDITORIAL NOTE.—During the winter at Fort Mandan, Lewis and Clark prepared a large table of the Indian nations east of the Rockies, with data respecting their trade, etc. At least two copies were made, one of which was sent to the Secretary of War, and probably perished when the records of that department were burned in 1809, or in the stampede of 1814; what is apparently the second copy is now in the possession of the American Philosophical Society, at Philadelphia, and is a sheet 34 1/2 × 27 inches, composed of six pieces of paper pasted together. Owing to its unwieldy size and form, we have decided somewhat to recast the material as follows: To each of the columns in the original manuscript we have, for purpose of identification, assigned the appropriate letter, as explained by the explorers under the heading "Notation," below. In grouping into a paragraph, in narrative form, all the tabulated information concerning a tribe (which in the original manuscript occupies a line across the broad page), we have assigned to each item the letter [enclosed within brackets] corresponding to the column in which it appears in the original. The numeral assigned to each tribe is that given in the original manuscript. Upon the margin of the reverse of the manuscript, Clark made the following memorandum, showing that the copy sent to the Secretary of War contained considerable data not in the original tabulation : additional Remarks made on the Copy Sent to the Secretary at war 1stthe boundaries of the Countrey which they claim—the quantity of land &amp; face of the Countrey 2d.their Antient residence if known. 3the State of their Trade whether it can be expected to increase and in what proportion. 4ththeir Trafick with other Indian nations, in what it consists and where carried on. 5ththeir Disposition towards the whites, and their conduct to their Traders. 6to what place they might be provailed on to remove to make room for other nations. 7whether they cultivate or not. 8whether Stationary or roveing 9whether the Nations is increasing or Deminishing. Genl. remarks on the Trade &amp; remittences and amt. Estimated— Establishments in a Govmnt pt. of view—Notations on Indian Names Sub Divisions of the Sioux Bands &amp; names of their principal Chiefs. From the tabulated statement prepared by Clark for the Secretary of War, with the above "additional Remarks," President Jefferson had prepared and presented to Congress A Statistical View of the Indian Nations inhabiting the Territory of Louisiana and the Countries adjacent to its northern and Western boundaries (printed by A. &amp; G. Way, Washington, 1806).1 1 See Bibliographical Data, vol. i, p. lxiii, ante. We have selected from this publication all of the additional information contained therein, and appended the same to our compilation. Such matter we have indicated by two methods, according to the extent of the added data—(1) for mere words, phrases, figures, etc., printing the material in Italics and enclosing it within parentheses—e.g. (except the Little Osage); (2) for long sentences or paragraphs, printing it in smaller type.—Ed.] A.

The Indian Trade. The sums stated under and opposite [k] are the amounts of merchandise annually furnished the several nations of Indians, including all incidental expenses of transportation, &amp;c. incurred by the merchants which generally averages about one third of the whole amount. The merchandise is estimated at an advance of 125 per cent. on the sterling cost. It appears to me that the amount of merchandise which the Indians have been in the habit of receiving annually, is the best standard by which to regulate the quantities necessary for them in the first instance; they will always consume as much merchandise as they can pay for, and those with whom a regular trade has been carried on have generally received that quantity. The amount of their returns stated under and opposite [l] are estimated by the peltry standard of St. Louis, which is 40 cents per pound for deer skins; (i. e.) all furs and peltries are first reduced by their comparative value to lbs. of merchantable deer skins, which are then estimated at 40 cents per lb. These establishments are not mentioned as being thought important at present in a governmental point of view. 1.[a] Grand Osarge; [b] Bar-har-cha; [c] Grand Ose or zo; [d]* Osarge; [e] 2; [f]—; [g] 1200; [h] 5000; [i] a Co : at St Louis; [j] at their Village &amp; the 3 forks of the Arkansaw River; [k] $15,000; [1] $20,000; [m] Skins of the small Deer, some Beaver a fiew Bear, &amp; otter skins; [n] Beaver, otter, small Deer, Black Bear, &amp; racoons Skins; [o]at the 3 forks of the Arkansaw 600 Miles up that river and 60 Lg S. West of their Village [p] With all Nations of Indians (except the Little Osage) untill the United States took possession of Louisiana; [q]—(with the Little Osage only); [r]—; [s] Their villages are (80) Leagues up the Osarge River on the S. E. Side, they claim all the Countrey included in the following boundrey. Viz begining at a S. E. branch of the Osarge called Neangua R up that river to the head from thence Southerley to the Arkansaw 100 miles below the three forks up the Arkansaw and a Southerly fork Some Distance above the Great Saline, &amp; the Ctry nearly to the Kanzus river. Cultivate Corn, Beens &amp;c. &amp;c. embracing the waters of the upper portion of the Osage river, and thence obliquely approaching the same to the beginning. The climate is delightful, and the soil fertile in the extreme. The face of the country is generally level, and well watered; the eastern part of the country is covered with a variety of excellent timber; the western and middle country high prairies. It embraces within its limits four salines, which are, in point of magnitude and excellence, unequalled by any known in North America; there are also many others of less note. The principal part of the Great Osage have always resided at their villages, on the Osage river, since they have been known to the inhabitants of Louisiana. About three years since, nearly one half of this nation, headed by their chief the Big-track, emigrated to the three forks of the Arkansas, near which, and on its north side, they established a village, where they now reside. The Little Osage formerly resided on the S. W. side of the Missouri, near the mouth of Grand river; but being reduced by continual warfare with their neighbors, were compelled to seek the protection of the Great Osage, near whom they now reside. There is no doubt but their trade will increase : they could furnish a much larger quantity of beaver than they do. I think two villages, on the Osage river, might be prevailed on to remove to the Arkansas, and the Kansas, higher up the Missouri, and thus leave a sufficient scope of country for the Shawnees, Dillewars, Miames, and Kickapoos. 2.[a] Little Osarge; [b] ooed-za-tar, [c] Petite Ose (or little zo; [d] [Same as for No. 1]; [e] 1; [f]—; [g] 300; [h] 1300; [i] [Same as for No. 1]; [j] near their Village; [k] $5000; [l] $8000; [m] [Same as for No. 1]; [n] [Same as for No. 1]; [o] [Same as for No. 1]; [p](With all their Indian neighbors, except the Great Osage); [q] (With the Great Osage only); [r] on Kanzes R.; [s] [Included in No.1[s]]. 3.[a] Kanzas; [b] Karsea; [c] Kah [d] * Osarge; [e] 1; [f] —; [g] 300; [h] 1300; [i] The Merchants of St. Louis; [j] at their Village and on the Missouri about the mouth of the Kanzes River; [k] $5000; [l] $8000; [m] (The same as the Osage, with buffaloe grease and robes); [n] Beaver, otter, Deer, Bear &amp; Muskrat Skins; [o] 1 Mile up on the N.

Great robers. The limits of the country they claim is not known. The country in which they reside, and from thence to the Missouri, is a delightful one, and generally well watered and covered with excellent timber: they hunt on the upper part of Kanzas and Arkanzas rivers: their trade may be expected to increase with proper management. At present they are a dissolute, lawless banditti; frequently plunder their traders, and commit depredations on persons ascending and descending the Missouri river: population rather increasing. These people, as well as the Great and Little Osages, are stationary, at their villages, from about the 15th of March to the 15th of May, and again from the 15th of August to the 15th of October : the balance of the year is appropriated to hunting. 4.[a] Ottoes; [b] War-doke-tar-tar; [c] la Zoto; [d] * Missoure, &amp; Some words of osarge; [e] 1 [with the Missouris]; [f ]—; [g] 120; [h] 500; [i] the Merchants of St. Louis; [j] at their Village and at tradeing houses at different Places between the Grand Nemahar and Platt Rivers; [k] $4000 (including the Missouris); [l] $6000 (including the Missouris); [m] Beaver, otter, racoons, Deer &amp; Black Bear Skins; [n] Beaver, otter, Muskat racoon, wolves Deer, bear, skins, bears oil &amp; Buffalow tallow; [o] Council Bluffs 50 miles by water above R.

They have no idea of an exclusive possession of any country, nor do they assign themselves any limits. I do not believe that they would object to the introduction of any well disposed Indians : they treat the traders with respect and hospitality, generally. In their occupations of hunting and cultivation, they are the same with the Kanzas and Osage. They hunt on the Saline, Nimmehaw rivers, and west of them in the plains. The country in which they hunt lies well; it is extremely fertile and well watered; that part of it which borders on the Nimmehaw and Missouri possesses a good portion of timber: population rather increasing. They have always resided near the place their village is situated, and are the descendants of the Missouris. 5.[a] Missouries; [b] New-dar-cha; [c] Missourie; [d] * Missoure, &amp; Some words of osarge; [e] 1 [with the Ottoes]; [f ]—; [g] 80; [h] 300; [i] the Merchants of St Louis; [j] [Same as for No. 4]; [k] included [in the Ottoes]; [l] included [in the Ottoes]; [m] [Same as the Ottoes]; [n] [Same as the Ottoes]; [o] [Same as the Ottoes]; [p] [Same as the Ottoes]; [q] With the Ottoes; [r] With the Ottoes; [s] With the Ottoes and hund[t] also above the Platt near the Missourie near the Corn Des cerf River; they Cultivate Corn Beans &amp;c. This nation formerley lived below the grand River, and was noumerous, they Speake some words of the Osarge (bad. These are the remnant of the most numerous nation inhabiting the Missouri, when first known to the French. Their ancient and principal village was situated in an extensive and fertile plain on the north bank of the Missouri, just below the entrance of the Grand river. Repeated attacks of the small pox, together with their war with the Saukees and Renars, has reduced them to their present state of dependence on the Ottoes, with whom they reside, as well in their village as on their hunting excursions. The Ottoes view them as their inferiors, and sometimes treat them amiss. These people are the real proprietors of an extensive and fertile country lying on the Missouri, above their ancient village for a considerable distance, and as low as the mouth of the Osage river, and thence to the Mississippi. 6.[a] Pania proper; [b] Parnee [c] Grand par; [d] * Pania; [e] 1/2; [f]—; [g] 400; [h] 1600; [i] the Merchants of St Louis; [j] at their Village; [k] $3,200 [l] $5000; [m] Beaver otter &amp; racoons Skins &amp; Buffalow Robes; [n] Beaver, otter, racoon, cabra &amp; a fiew Deer Skins, roabs, Buffalow meat &amp; greas &amp; horses; [o] Council Bluffs; [p] Ossar[ge]s, Kanzes, Pania Pickey, Padonces, Ali-tans &amp; La-plays; [q] republickin Pania Loup &amp; Mahas; [r] 30 Lgs up the Platt; [s] Their Village is 30 Leagues up the river platt on the S. E. Side, they Hunt on the heads of the Kanzes, and its N W waters and high up the Platt; they Cultivate Corn Beans &amp;c. &amp;c. (mild &amp; well disposed) With repect to their idea of the possession of soil, it is similar to that of the Ottoes : they hunt on the south side of the river Platte, higher up and on the head of the Kanzas. A great proportion of this country is open plains, interspersed, however, with groves of timber, which are most generally found in the vicinity of the water courses. It is generally fertile and well watered; lies level, and free of stone. They have resided in the country which they now inhabit, since they were known to the whites. Their trade is a valuable one, from the large proportion of beaver and otter which they furnish, and it may be expected yet to increase, as those animals are still abundant in their country. The periods of their residence at their village and hunting, are similar to the Kanzas and Osages. Their population is increasing. They are friendly and hospitable to all white persons; pay great respect and deference to their traders, with whom they are punctual in the payment of their debts. 7.[a] Pania Loup (or Wolves; [b] Skee-e-ree; [c] La Loup (or Lou) Pania Maher; d * Pania; [e] 1; [f]—; [g] 280; [h] 1000; [i] the Merchants of St Louis; [j] at the Pania Vilage; [k] $2400; [l] $3500; [m] [Same as Pania proper]; [n] [Same as Pania proper]; [o] Council Bluffs; [p] Ottoes &amp; Missouries, and the same as the Panias; [q] The same as the Panias; [r] on the Loup R.

Loup which empties into the Platt 8 Lgs above the Panias, they hunt on the rivers platt &amp; Loup above their Village; they Cultivate Corn Beens &amp;c. &amp;c. (mild &amp; well disposed) These are also a branch of the Panias proper, who Separated themselves from that nation many years since, and established themselves on a north branch of the river Platte, to which their name was also given: these people have likewise no idea of an exclusive right to any portion of country. They hunt on the Wolf river above their village, and on the river Platte above the mouth of that river. This country is very similar to that of of the Panias proper; though there is an extensive body of fertile well timbered land between the Wolf river below their village and the river Corn de Cerf, or Elkhorn river. The particulars related of the other Panias is also applicable to them. They are seldom visited by any trader, and therefore usually bring their furs and peltry to the village of the Panias proper, where thev traffic with the whites. 8.[a] Pania Republicans; [b] Ar-rah-pa-hoo [c] Republick; [d] * Pania; [e] 1/2; [f ]—; [g] 300 [h] 1400 [i] the Merchants of St. Louis; [j] at the Pania Vilage; [k] $3,200 [1] $5000; [m] [Same as Panias proper]; [n] [Same as Panias proper]; [o] Council Bluffs; [p] the Same as the Panias; [q] The same as the Panias; [r] with the Panias; [s] Their village is with the Pania on the River Platt, they hunt on a branch of the Kanzus called the Republican fork, and near the Kanzes river also with the Panias; Cultivate Corn Beens &amp;c. &amp;c. (mild &amp; well disposed). Are a branch of the Pania proper, or, as they are frequently termed, the Big Paunch. About ten years since they withdraw themselves from the mother nation, and established a village on a large northwardly branch of the Kanzas, to which they have given name: they afterwards subdivided and lived in different parts of the country on the waters of Kanzas river; but being harassed by their turbulent neighbors, the Kanzas, they rejoined the Panias proper last spring. What has been said with respect to the Panias proper is applicable to these people, except that they hunt principally on the Republican river, which is better stocked with timber than that hunted by the Panias. 9.[a] Mahar; [b] Oh-Mar-ha; [c] La Mar; [d] * Mahar with some words of the Osarge &amp; Souix; [e]—; [f ] 80; [g] 150; [h] 600; [i] the Merchants at St. Louis; [j] on the Missourie at different places between the old Mahar Village and River Platt; [k] $3000; [l] $5000; [m] Beaver, otter &amp; racoons Skins &amp; Buffalow Robes &amp; B.

About ten years since, they boasted 700 warriors. They have lived in a village, on the west bank of the Missouri, 236 miles above the mouth of the river Platte, where they cultivated corn, beans, and melons : they were warlike, and the terror of their neighbors. In the summer and autumn of 1802, they were visited by the small-pox, which reduced their numbers to something less than 300; they burnt their village, and have become a wandering nation, deserted by the traders, and the consequent deficiency of arms and ammunition has invited frequent aggressions from their neighbors, which have tended to reduce them still further. They rove principally on the waters of the river Quicurre, or Rapid river. The country is generally level, high, and open : it is fertile, and tolerably well watered. They might easily be induced to become stationary : they are well disposed towards the whites, and are good hunters: their country abounds in beaver and otter, and their trade will increase and become valuable, provided they become stationary, and are at peace. The Tetons Bois brûle' killed and took about 60 of them last summer. 10.[a] Poncare; [b] Poong-car; [c] La Pong; [d] * Mahar with some words of the Osarge, &amp; Souix; [e]—; [f ] 20; [g] 50; [h] 200; [i] the Merchants of St Louis; [ j] [Same as the Mahar] [k] [included with the Mahar]; [l] [included with the Mahar]; [m] Same as the Mahar]; [n] [Same as the Mahar]; [o] Council Bluffs; [p] [Same as the Mahar]; [q] the Mahars only; [r] with the Mahas; [s] Their Village was 1 League up a Small river above the quicure called Poncerres River, they being reduced by the Small pox, and their war with the Soues rove in the plains with the Mahars, bad fellows, (a tribe of Mahars) No Corn Beens to Cultivate at present, lost all in the late maladay with the Small pox. The remnant of a nation once respectable in point of numbers. They formerly resided on a branch of the Red river of lake Winnipie: being oppressed by the Sioux, they removed to the west side of the Missouri, on Porcar river, where they built and fortified a village, and remained some years; but being pursued by their ancient enemies the Sioux, and reduced by continual wars, they have joined, and now reside with the Mahas, whose language they speak. 11.[a] Ricaras 8 tribes; [b] Star-rah-he; [c] Ree; [d] Pania Corrupted; [e] 3; [f]—; [g] 500; [h] 2000; [i] a Co. at St. Louis; [j] at their Villages; [k] $2,500; [l] $6,000; [m] Buffalow roabes, Greese &amp; a fiew fox skins, and a little Beaver; [n] Buffalow robes, Tallow Grece de mele, large &amp; small fox skins, wolves; [o] Those four nations [Ricaras, Mandans, Shoe, and Minnetarries] would move to the River Yallowstone at or about that place would be a proper place for the establishment for them; [p] with the Gens des Serpent or Snake Indians; [q] the Tetons in their neighbourhood the Chyennes &amp; nations to the S.

Are the remains of ten large tribes of Panias, who have been reduced, by the small pox and the Sioux, to their present number. They live in fortified villages, and hunt immediately in their neighborhood. The country around them, in every direction, for several hundred miles, is entirely bare of timber, except on the water courses and steep declivities of hills, where it is sheltered from the ravages of fire. The land is tolerably well watered, and lies well for cultivation. The remains of the villages of these people are to be seen on many parts of the Missouri, from the mouth of Tetone river to the Mandans. They claim no land except that on which their villages stand and the fields which they cultivate. The Tetons claim the country around them. Though they are the oldest inhabitants, they may be properly considered the farmers or tenants at will of that lawless, savage and rapacious race the Sioux Teton, who rob them of their horses, plunder their gardens and fields, and sometimes murder them, without opposition. If these people were freed from the oppression of the Tetons, their trade would increase rapidly, and might be extended to a considerable amount. They maintain a partial trade with their oppressors the Tetons, to whom they barter horses, mules, corn, beans, and a species of tobacco which they cultivate; and receive in return guns, ammunition, kettles, axes, and other articles which the Tetons obtain from the Yanktons of N. and Sissatones, who trade with Mr. Cammeron, on the river St. Peters. These horses and mules the Ricaras obtain from their western neighbors, who visit them frequently for the purpose of trafficking. 12.[a] Mandans; [b] Ma-too-tonka 1st vilage; Roop-tar-ha 2nd.

These are the most friendly, well disposed Indians inhabiting the Missouri. They are brave, humane and hospitable. About 25 years since they lived in six villages, about forty miles below their present villages, on both sides of the Missouri. Repeated visitations of the small pox, aided by frequent attacks by the Sioux, has reduced them to their present number. They claim no particular tract of country. They live in fortified villages, hunt immediately in their neighborhood, and cultivate corn, beans, squashes and tobacco, which form articles of traffic with their neighbors the Assinniboin : they also barter horses with the Assinniboins for arms, ammunition, axes, kettles, and other articles of European manufacturer, which these last obtain from the British establishments on the Assinniboin River. The articles which they thus obtain from Assinniboins and the British traders who visit them, they again exchange for horses and leather tents with the Crow Indians, Chyennes, Wetepahatoes, Kiawas, Kanenavich, Staetan and Cataka, who visit them occasionally for the purpose of traffic. Their trade may be much increased. Their country is similar to that of the Ricaras.

They differ but very little, in any particular, from the Mandans, their neighbors, except with the unjust war which they, as well as the Minetares, prosecute against the defenseless Snake Indians, from which, I believe, it will be difficult to induce them to desist. They claim to have been once a part of the Crow Indians, whom they still acknowledge as relations. They have resided on the Missouri as long as their tradition will enable them to inform. 14.[a] Big bellies; [b] 1st Vilg. Me-ne-tar-re Me-ta-har-ta; 2 vilg.

In their customs, manners, and dispositions, they are similar to the Mandans and Ahwahhaways. The scarcity of fuel induces them to reside, during the cold season, in large bands, in camps, on different parts of the Missouri, as high up that river as the mouth of the river Yellow Stone, and west of their villages, about the Turtle mountain. I believe that these people, as well as the Mandans and Ahwahhaways, might be prevailed on to remove to the mouth of the Yellow Stone river, provided an establishment is made at that place. They have as yet furnished scarcely any beaver, although the country they hunt abounds with them; the lodges of these animals are to be seen within a mile of their villages. These people have also suffered considerably by the small-pox; but have successfully resisted the attacks of the Sioux. The N. W. company intend to form an establishment in the course of the next summer, and autumn, on the Missouri, near these people, which, if effected, will most probably prevent their removal to any point which our government may hereafter wish them to reside at. 15.[a] Ayauwais; [b] Ah-e-o-war; [c] dis Iaways or ne persa; [d] Ottoes; [e] 1; [f ]—; [g] 200; [h] 800; [i] Mr Crawford from Michilimacknac; [j] at the Villages; [k] $3,800 [l] $6000; [m] Deer Beaver otter Mink Black Bear, fox racoon Muskrat &amp;c.

W. of them, except the Yankton ahnah. Their boundaries in that quarter are also undefined : their trade would become much more valuable if peace was established between them and the nations west of the Missouri, with whom they are at war: Their population has remained nearly the same for many years : they raise an abundance of corn, beans and melons: These people are extremely friendly to the whites, and seldom injure their traders; but they are the most implacable enemies to the Indian nations with whom they are at war. To them is justly attributable the almost entire destruction of the Missouris, the Illinois, Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and Piorias. 17.[a] Renarz; [b] Ottar-car-me; [c] la Renars; [d] [Same as Saukees]; [e] 1; [f ]—; [g] 300; [h] 1200; [i] [Same as for Saukees]; [j] [Same as for Saukees]; [k] $2500; [1] $4000; [m] Same [as for Saukees] a greater pirpotion of otter skins; [n] [Same as for Saukees]; [o] At Prarie de Chien; [p] [Same as the Saukees]; [q] [Same as the Saukees]; [r] [Same as the Saukees]; [s] [Included with the Saukees]. 18.[a] [All the tribes from 18 to 27 are entered as] Dar-co-tar's proper the Soos or Sioux; [b] Wah-pa-tone tribe; [c] Sioux; [d] * Darcotar or Sioux; [e]—; [f] 80; [g] 200; [h] 700; [i] Mrs Campbell Dickson and other Merchants who trade to Michilimack; [j] on the R.

Their trade is supposed to be at its greatest extent. They treat their traders with respect, and seldom attempt to rob them.

They are friendly to their own traders; but the inveterate enemies to such as supply their enemies, the Chippeways, with merchandise. They also claim the country in which they hunt, commencing at the entrance of the river St. Peters, and extending upwards, on both sides of the Mississippi river, to the mouth of the Crow-wing river.

At present they treat their traders tolerably well. Their trade cannot be expected to increase much. A great proportion of their country is open plains, lies level, and is tolerably fertile. They maintain a partial traffic with the Yanktons and Tetons to the west of them; to these they barter the articles which they obtain from the traders on the river St. Peters, and receive in return horses, some robes and leather lodges. 21.[a] Sioux; [b] Sis-sa-tone tribe; [c]—; [d] * Dar-co-tar (or Sioux); [e]—; [f] 80; [g] 200; [h] 800; [i] Mr. Cammeron who trades to Mackilimack; [j] at the head of the St. Peters river; [k] $17,000; [1] $30,000; [m] the Same [as the Wah-pa-tone] (a greater perpotion of Beaver otter &amp; Bear; [n] The Same [as the Wah-pa-tone]; [o] at the heads of St. Peters and red river (or R Rouch); [p] with the Chipaways &amp; Mandans Knistanoux &amp; assinniboins; [q] [Same as the Wah-pa-tone] &amp; Ricarras; [r] Head of St. Peters; [s] on the heads of St. Peters—not seperate—claim the Countrey on the N.

This country abounds more in the valuable fur animals, the beaver, otter and marten, than any portion of Louisiana yet known. This circumstance furnishes the Sissatones with the means of purchasing more merchandise, in proportion to their number, than any nation in this quarter. A great proportion of this merchandise is reserved by them for their trade with the Tetons, whom they annually meet at some point previously agreed on, upon the waters of James river, in the month of May. This Indian fair is frequently attended by the Yanktons of the North and Ahnah. The Sissatones and Yanktons of the North here supply the others with considerable quantities of arms, ammunition, axes, knives, kettles, cloth, and a variety of other articles; and receive in return principally horses, which the others have stolen or purchased from the nations on the Missouri and west of it. They are devoted to the interests of their traders. 22.[a] Souix; [b] Yanktons of the N. tribe; [c]—[d] * Dar-co-tar (or Sioux); [e]—; [f] 200; [g] 500; [h] 1600; [i] a partial Trade [with] Mr Cammeron no trader of their own; [j] [Same as the Sissatone]; [k] $1800; [1] $3000; [m] Buffalow robes &amp; Wolves only; [n] [The Same as for the Wah-pa-tone]; [o] at the same place [as the Sissatone] or on the Missourie; [p] with the Chipaways &amp; Mandans, Knistanoux &amp; assinniboins; [q] [Same as the Sissatones]; [r] Hds of R Jacque E Side (from the heads of the river St. Peters and Red river to the Missouri, about the great bend); [s] on the heads of Rivers Jacque &amp; Big Sioux on the N.

This band, although they purchase a much smaller quantity of merchandise than the Sissatones, still appropriate a considerable proportion of what they do obtain in a similar manner with that mentioned of the Sissatones. This trade, as small as it may appear, has been sufficient to render the Tetones independent of the trade of the Missouri, in a great measure, and has furnished them with the means, not only of distressing and plundering the traders of the Missouri, but also, of plundering and massacreing the defenceless savages of the Missouri, from the mouth of the river Platte to the Minetares, and west to the Rocky mountains. The country these people inhabit is almost one entire plain, uncovered with timber; it is extremely level; the soil fertile, and generally well watered. 23.[a] Sioux; [b] Yank-tons-Ah-nah tribe or River Demoin; [c]—, [d] * Dar-co-tar (or Sioux) [e]—; [f] 80; [g] 200; [h] 700; [i] with Mr. Crawford on river Demoin; [ j] on the river Demoin 30 Leagues up that R.

These are the best disposed Sioux who rove on the banks of the Missouri, and these even will not suffer any trader to ascend the river, if they can possibly avoid it; they have, heretofore, invariably arrested the progress of all those they have met with, and generally compelled them to trade at the prices, nearly, which they themselves think proper to fix on their merchandise : they seldom commit any further acts of violence on the whites. They sometimes visit the river Demoin, where a partial trade has been carried on with them, for a few years past, by a Mr. Crawford. Their trade, if well regulated, might be rendered extremely valuable. Their country is a very fertile one; it consists of a mixture of wood-lands and prairies. The land bordering on the Missouri is principally plains with but little timber. 24.[a] Sioux; [b] Teton Bous rouley (burnt woods) [c] Bous rouley; [d] * Dar-co-tar (or Sioux) [e]—; [f] 120; [g] 300; [h] 900; [i] with Louisell &amp;c. from St. Louis; [j] at Cedar Island 1235 miles up the Missoure River; [k] $5000; [l] $7000; [m] Buffalow robes, Dressd Buffalow Skins Greece in bladders &amp; meat; [n] Buffalow roabs, Dressed Buffalow Skins, Grees, [o] near the mouth of Chyenne or Dog River [p] with the nations on the West and lower part of the Missourie River; [q] the Saukie &amp; Renards and those East of the R Mississippi below the Chipeways &amp; Ayauways; [r.] 400 Lgs. up M[issouri]; [s] rove on both Sides of the Missourie about the Grand de tour (or big bend &amp; on Teton River above White River, they are but little acquainted with the whites, uncivilised rascals, they attempted to Stop the party for N W &amp;c. 25.[a] Sioux; [b] Teton-O-kan-dan-das tribe; [c]—; [d] * Dar-co-tar (or Sioux); [e]—; [f] 50; [g] 120; [h] 360; [i] with Louisell &amp;c. from St. Louis; [j] above the mouth of Chien or Shar ha R; [k] $1500; [l] $2500; [m] [Same as for No. 24]; [n] Buffalow roabs, Dressed Buffalow Skins, Grees, Beaver, Deer, Cabbra, Skins; Small &amp; large foxes mink otter, Wolves &amp; Hair.

These are the vilest miscreants of the savage race, and must ever remain the pirates of the Missouri, until such measures are pursued, by our government, as will make them feel a dependence on its will for their supply of merchandise. Unless these people are reduced to order, by coercive measures, I am ready to pronounce that the citizens of the United States can never enjoy but partially the advantages which the Missouri presents. Relying on a regular supply of merchandise, through the channel of the river St. Peters, they view with contempt the merchants of the Missouri, whom they never fail to plunder, when in their power. Persuasion or advice, with them, is viewed as supplication, and only tends to inspire them with contempt for those who offer either. The tameness with which the traders of the Missouri have heretofore submitted to their rapacity, has tended not a little to inspire them with contempt for the white persons who visit them, through that channel. A prevalent idea among them, and one which they make the rule of their conduct, is, that the more illy they treat the traders the greater quantity of merchandise they will bring them, and that they will thus obtain the articles they wish on better terms; they have endeavored to inspire the Ricaras with similar sentiments, but, happily, without any considerable effect. The country in which these four bands rove is one continued plain, with scarcely a tree to be seen, except on the water-courses, or the steep declivities of hills, which last are but rare: the land is fertile, and lies extremely well for cultivation; many parts of it are but badly watered. It is from this country that the Missouri derives most of its colouring matter; the earth is strongly impregnated with glauber salts, alum, copperas and sulphur, and when saturated with water, immense bodies of the hills precipitate themselves into the Missouri, and mingle with its waters. The waters of this river have a purgative effect on those unaccustomed to use it. I doubt whether these people can ever be induced to become stationary; their trade might be made valuable if they were reduced to order. They claim jointly with the other bands of the Sioux, all the country lying within the following limits, viz. beginning at the confluence of the river Demoin and Mississippi, thence up the west side of the Mississippi to the mouth of the St. Peters river, thence on both sides of the Mississippi to the mouth of Crow-wing river, and upwards with that stream, including the waters of the upper part of the same; thence to include the waters of the upper portion of Red river, of lake Winnepie, and down the same nearly to Pembenar river, thence a south westerly course to intersect the Missouri at or near the Mandans, and with that stream downwards to the entrance of the Warrecunne creek, thence passing the Missouri it goes to include the lower portion of the river Chyenne, all the waters of White river and river Teton, includes the lower portion of the river Quicurre, and returns to the Missouri, and with that stream downwards to the mouth of Waddipon river, and thence eastwardly to intersect the Mississippi at the beginning.

They are the remnant of a nation once respectable in point of number : formerly resided on a branch of the Red river of Lake Winnipie, which still bears their name. Being oppressed by the Sioux, they removed to the west side of the Missouri, about 15 miles below the mouth of the Warricunne creek, where they built and fortified a village, but being pursued by their ancient enemies the Sioux, they fled to the Black hills, about the head of the Chyenne river, where they wander in quest of the buffaloe, having no fixed residence. They do not cultivate. They are well disposed towards the whites, and might easily be induced to settle on the Missouri, if they could be assured of being protected from the Sioux. Their number annually diminishes. Their trade may be made valuable. 29.[a] Wetapaha to [and] Cay-au-wa (Kiâwâs) nation;1 1 In the printed Statistical View these tribes are given separately, but with no additional matter.—Ed.

From the animals their country produces, their trade would, no doubt, become valuable. These people again barter a considerable proportion of the articles they obtain from the Menetares, Ahwahhaways, Mandans, and Ricaras, to the Dotames and Castapanas. 30.[a] Ca-ne-na-vich [and] Sta-e-tan tribes;1 1 In the printed Statistical View these tribes are given separately: 150 lodges, 400 warriors, and 1,500 people are assigned to the Kanenavish; and 40 lodges, 100 warriors, and 400 people to the Staetan; otherwise there is no additional information. —Ed.

The information I possess, with respect to this nation, is derived from Indian information : they are said to be a wandering nation, inhabiting an open country, and who raise a great number of horses and mules. They are a friendly, well disposed people, and might, from the position of their country, be easily induced to visit an establishment on the Missouri, about the mouth of Chyenne river. They have not, as yet, visited the Missouri. 34.[a] Cas-ta-ha-na N; [b] Cas-ta-ha-na Nation; [c] Gens des Vache; [d] Me na tare (or big belly); [e]—; [f] 500; [g] 1300; [h] 5000; [i] No Traders; [j] Some visit the Mandans &amp; Minataries; [k]—; [l]—; [m]—; [n] [Same as preceding tribes] (and skins if the lynx or louverin; and martens in addition); [p] at the mouth of Rochejoune (or Yellow Stone R); [p] a Defensive War with the Sioux &amp; Assinniboins, at war with no other nation that I know of; [q] Mandans, Big bellies and their wandering neighbours; [r] Yellow rock river &amp; Loup; [s] rove on a S.

These people are divided into four bands, called by themselves Ahâh'-âr-ro'-pir-no-pah, Noo'-ta-, Pa-rees-car, and E-hârt'-sâr. They annually visit the Mandans, Minetares, and Ahwahhaways, to whom they barter horses, mules, leather lodges, and many articles of Indian apparel, for which they receive in return, guns, ammunition, axes, kettles, awls, and other European manufactures. When they return to their country, they are in turn visited by the Paunch and Snake Indians, to whom they barter most of the articles they have obtained from the nations on the Missouri, for horses and mules, of which those nations have a greater abundance than themselves. They also obtain of the Snake Indians, bridle-bits and blankets, and some other articles which those Indians purchase from the Spaniards. The bridle-bits and blankets I have seen in the possession of the Mandans and Minetares. Their country is fertile and well watered, and in most parts well timbered. 36.[a] (Paunch tribe); [b] Kee-hât-sâ (Al-la-kâ'-we-âh); [c] Gens des panse; [d] Menetarre; [e]—; [f ] 300; [g] 800; [h] 2,300; [i] No Traders; [ j] Some visit the Mandans &amp; Minataries; [k]—; [l]—; [m]—; [n] [Same as for the Castahana]; [o] at the mouth of the Rochejoune (or Yellow Stone R; [p] a Defensive War with the Sioux &amp; Assinniboins; [q] Mandans, Big bellies and their wandering neighbours; [r] on the Yellow Rock R. high up; [s] rove on the River Rochejone high up their countrey abounds in animals of Different kinds.

They might be induced to visit the Missouri, at the mouth of the Yellow Stone river; and from the great abundance of valuable fured animals which their country, as well as that of the Crow Indians, produces, their trade must become extremely valuable.

Oseegah. Mahtopanato. Are the descendants of the Sioux, and partake of their turbulent and faithless disposition: they frequently plunder, and sometimes murder, their own traders. The name by which this nation is generally known was borrowed from the Chippeways, who call them Assinniboan, which, literally translated, is Stone Sioux, hence the name of Stone Indians, by which they are sometimes called. The country in which they rove is almost entirely uncovered with timber; lies extremely level, and is but badly watered in many parts; the land; however, is tolerably fertile and unincumbered with stone. They might be induced to trade at the river Yellow Stone; but I do not think that their trade promises much. Their numbers continue about the same. These bands, like the Sioux, act entirely independent of each other, although they claim a national affinity and never make war on each other. The country inhabited by the Mahtopanato possesses rather more timber than the other parts of the country. They do not cultivate. 40.[a] Knistanoes or Cristanoes; [b] Knis-ta-nau 2 bands; [c] Crees; [d] Corupted Chipaway; [e]—; [f] 150; [g] 300; [h] 1000; [i] Hudsons Bay N. W. &amp; X. Y.

The country in which they rove is generally open plains, but in some parts, particularly about the head of the Assinniboin river, it is marshy and tolerably well furnished with timber, as are also the Fort Dauphin mountains, to which they sometimes resort. From the quantity of beaver in their country, they ought to furnish more of that article than they do at present. They are not esteemed good beaver hunters. They might, probably be induced to visit an establishment on the Missouri, at the Yellow Stone river.

These are a very numerous and well disposed people, inhabiting a woody and mountainous country; they are divided into three large tribes, who wander at a considerable distance from each other; and are called by themselves So-so-na, So-so' bu-bar, and I-a-kar; these are again subdivided into smaller tho' independent bands, the names of which I have not yet learnt; they raise a number of horses and mules which they trade with the Crow Indians, or are stolen by the nations on the east of them. They maintain a partial trade with the Spaniards, from whom they obtain many articles of cloathing and ironmongery, but no warlike implements. Of the West. These people also inhabit a mountainous country, and sometimes venture in the plains east of the Rocky mountains, about the head of the Arkansas river. They have more intercourse with the Spaniards of New Mexico, than the Snake Indians. They are said to be very numerous and warlike, but are badly armed. The Spaniards fear these people, and therefore take the precaution not to furnish them with any warlike implements. In their present unarmed state, they frequently commit hostilities on the Spaniards. They raise a great many horses. La Playes. These principally inhabit the rich plains from the head of the Arkansas, embracing the heads of Red river, and extending with the mountains and high lands eastwardly as far as it is known towards the gulph of Mexico. They possess no fire arms, but are warlike and brave. They are, as well as the other Aliatans, a wandering people. Their country abounds in wild horses, besides great numbers which they raise themselves. These people, and the West Aliatans, might be induced to trade with us on the upper part of the Arkansas river. I do not believe that any of the Aliatans claim a country within any particular limits. 45.[a]Padoucas; [b]—; [c] Padoo; [d] * Padoucies; [e] Several v[illages]; [f]—; [g] [h] very noumerous; [i] Some of those Inds. trade with the Spaniards S. of them; [j] New Mexico; [k] [1] [m]—; [n] [Same as Snake Indians] except Moose Marten Picou &amp; carckjou skins; [o] near the head of Platt, or Arkansaw Rivers; [p] act on the Defensive as far as I can lern, the most of the nearer nations make war upon them; [q] with those who wish to be friendly; [r] Heads of Platt &amp; Arkansaws R; [s] This nation live in Villages on the heads of River Platt &amp; Arkansaws noumerous, well disposed, abound in horses, have Some [trade] with New Mexico, I can obtain no certain account of their Situation numbers &amp;c. &amp;c. This once powerful nation has, apparently, entirely disappeared; every inquiry I have made after them has proved ineffectual. In the year 1724, they resided in several villages on the heads of the Kansas river, and could, at that time, bring upwards of two thousand men into the field (see Monsr. Dupratz history of Louisiana, page 71, and the map attached to that work). The information that I have received is, that being oppressed by the nations residing on the Missouri, they removed to the upper part of the river Platte, where they afterwards had but little intercourse with the whites. They seem to have given name to the northern branch of that river, which is still called the Paducas fork. The most probable conjecture is, that being still further reduced, they have divided into small wandering bands, which assumed the names of the subdivisions of the Paducas nation, and are known to us at present under the appellation of Wetepahatoes, Kiawas, Kanenavish, Katteka, Dotame, &amp;c. who still inhabit the country to which the Paducas are said to have removed. The majority of my information led me to believe that those people spoke different languages, but other and subsequent information has induced me to doubt the fact. 46.[a] Chipaways; [b] Oo-chi-pa-wau; [c] Souteau; [d] * Oochepawau; [e] 1; [f]—; [g] 400; [h] 1600; [i] British N.

This country is thickly covered with timber generally; lies level and generally fertile, though a considerable portion of it is intersected and broken up by small lakes, morasses and swamps, particularly about the heads of the Mississippi and river St. Louis. They do not cultivate, but live principally on the wild rice, which they procure in great abundance on the borders of Leach Lake and the banks of the Mississippi. Their number has been considerably reduced by wars and the small pox. Their trade is at its greatest extent. 47.[a] Chipaways about L.

This, as well as the other bands of Chippeways, are esteemed the best hunters in the north west country; but from the long residence of this band in the country they now inhabit, game is becoming scarce; therefore, their trade is supposed to be at its greatest extent. The Chippeways are a well disposed people, but excessively fond of spirituous liquor. 48.[a] Chipaways on River Rouge; [b] Oo-che-pa-wau; [c] Souteau; [d] * Oochepawau; [e]—; [f] ramble; [g] 100; [h] 800; [i] N.

These people formerly resided on the east side of the Mississippi, at Sand lake, but were induced, by the north west company, to remove, about two years since, to the river Pembena. They do not claim the lands on which they hunt. The country is level and the soil good. The west side of the river is principally prairies or open plains; on the east side there is a greater proportion of timber. Their trade at present is a very valuable one, and will probably increase for many years. They do not cultivate, but live by hunting. They are well disposed towards the whites. 49.[a] Algonquin; [b] Oo Chipawau; [c] Souters; [d] * Oochipawau; [e]—; [f] ramble; [g] 200; [h] 600; [i] N. W. &amp; X. Y.

The country they inhabit is but an indifferent one; it has been much hunted, and the game, of course, nearly exhausted. They are well disposed towards the whites. Their number is said to decrease. They are extremely addicted to spirituous liquor, of which large quantities are annually furnished them by the N.W. traders, in return for their bark canoes. They live wretchedly poor. 50.[a] Algonquin; [b] Oo Chipawau; [c] Souteau; [d] * Oochipawau; [e]—; [f] ramble; [g] 100; [h] 500; [i] N.W. &amp; X. Y.

W. traders, in order to hunt the country on the lower parts of the Red river, which then abounded in a variety of animals of the fur kind. They are an orderly, well disposed people, but like their relations on Rainy lake, extremely addicted to spirituous liquors. Their trade is at its greatest extent. 51.[a] Black foot Indians; [b]—; [c] la peain noir; d—; [e] [f] [g] [h] [i] [j] [k] [l]—; [m] Beaver, otter, racoons, fox, mink Deer Black Bear martens &amp; Elk; [n] Beaver, otter, racoon, fox, Mink, Deer, Black Bear, Marten, Lynx, wolverines, wolves, Muskrats Elk &amp; Bighorn; [o] about the falls of Missouri; [p] [q]—; [r] near the Rock M.; [s] Blackfots rove near the Rock mountains on the East Side on the waters of the Missouries. but little known.

The Minetares state, that this nations resides in one village on the west side of a large and rapid river, which runs from south to north, along the foot of the Rocky mountains on their west side; and that this river passes at a small distance from the three forks of the Missouri. That the country between the mountains and the river is broken, but on the opposite side of the river, it is an extensive open plain, with a number of barren, sandy hills, irregularly distributed over its surface as far as the eye can reach. They are a timid, inoffensive, and defenceless people.

ESTIMATE OF THE WESTERN INDIANS [Editorial Note.—During the winter passed at Fort Clatsop, Lewis and Clark drew up an "Estimate of the Western Indians," referring thereby to tribes west of the Rocky Mountains. This was entered in Codex I, pp. 147–155 (though in reverse order).1 1 As evidence in regard to the date of the original draft, the following note of Lewis (Codex I, p. 148) may be considered: "Feb. 8th 1805 [sc. 1806]. Note there are several other nations residing on the Columbia below the grand rappids and on some streams which discharge themselves into the same whose names we have learnt but have not any proper data from which to calculate ther probable number; therefor omitted." See also text of journal for June 13, 1806, (volume v, p. 133), when the original draft as entered in Codex I was doubtless completed.—Ed. The first six pages were written by Clark, and the tribal names seem to have been jotted down without order or system. On pp. 148, 149, Lewis entered his estimate, beginning with the tribes that roamed between the upper waters of the Columbia and those of the Missouri, and following these in the order of their residence down to the tribes of the coast. On p. 147, Clark has added a number of other tribes situated north and south along the coast, compiled from Indian information. The sum total of this population, as here estimated, was 69,040. On the return journey, the explorers came into further contact with the tribes, and learned more of those residing southward on the Multnomah River; this information they added to the original draft. At some later time, Clark revised his enumeration, compiling from this original estimate, and numbering the tribes in the order in which he intended to describe them. He then wrote in red ink across the foot of p. 150, Codex I: "The estimate of the Nations and tribes West of the Rocky Mountains May be seen more Correctly Stated in a Supplement accompanying these Books. W. C. 80,000 Soles." This "supplement" (now in possession of the American Philosophical Society) consists of four sheets of heavy paper, 13 1/2 × 9 1/2 inches, written upon one side, all in Clark's handwriting, and emended by 'himself in red ink. In this supplement, the populations of certain tribes were considerably enlarged. The differences between this final estimate and the original draft in Codex I are, in the following table, indicated by foot-notes.] Names of Indian Nations and their places of General Residence No. of Houses or Lodges Probable No. of Souls 1. SHO-SHO-NE 1 1 In the original draft Lewis begins with the Oatelashschute tribe, and leaves the Shoshones until later.

      <field name="fulltext">III. ZOÖLOGY1 1 At the time of Lewis and Clark' s expedition, practically nothing was known of the zoölogy of the United States west of the Mississippi river, consequently the opportunities for valuable discoveries in this field by members of the party were exceptional. Unfortunately there seems to have been no systematic zoölogist among those who made up the expedition, and consequently no new species of animals were named in the report. The authors did, however, include in their narrative good descriptions of such of the mammals and birds as especially attracted their attention, and subsequent naturalists have established proper technical names upon these descriptions. The eccentric Rafinesque evidently had their description in mind when he named the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus, Raf.); and George Ord, in his zoölogical appendix to Guthrie's Geography, named the whistling swan (Olor columbianus, Ord) entirely from the description of the bird given by Lewis and Clark. Of more interest than their descriptions, however, are the actual specimens brought back by the explorers. These were by no means numerous, and were all deposited in the then famous repository for natural history curiosities, Peale's Museum, in Philadelphia. They were mounted by Peale, and submitted to the famous ornithologist, Alexander Wilson—who was then publishing his great work on North American birds—in order that plates and descriptions of the novelties might appear therein. Wilson found that three species (possibly all that they secured) were new to science, and named them "Louisiana tanager," "Clark's crow" i. e., nutcracker], and "Lewis's woodpecker"—or, as they stand today in our technical lists, Piranga ludoviciana (Wilson); Nucifraga columbians (Wilson), and Melanerpes torquatus (Wilson). The three will be found together on plate 20, vol. iii, of the American Ornithology. With the decline and disintegration of Peale's Museum, the ornithological specimens were scattered; but recently some of them appeared in Boston, and found their way into the possession of Charles J. Maynard. Among them, Mr. Maynard informs me, is a specimen of Lewis's woodpecker, without much doubt the original specimen, and probably the only one of this historic collection that is still extant.—Witmer Stone, conservator of the Ornithological Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

I have frequently observed an aquatic bird [Sterna antillarum— Coues] in the cours of asscending this river but have never been able to procure one before today, this day I was so fortunate as to kill two of them, they are here more plenty than on the river below. they lay their eggs on the sand bars without shelter or nest, and produce their young from the 15.th to the last of June, the young ones of which we caught several are covered with down of a yellowish white colour and on the back some small specks of a dark brown. they bear a great resemblance to the young quale of ten days oald, and apear like them to be able to runabout and peck their food as soon as they are hatched. this bird, lives on small fish, worms and bugs which it takes on the virge of the water it is seldom seen to light on trees an qu[i]te as seldom do they lite in the water and swim tho' the foot would indicate that they did it's being webbed I believe them to be a native of this country and pr[ob]ably a constant resident. the weight of the male bird is one ounce and a half, it[s] [l]ength from b[e]ak to toe 7 1/2 inches. from tip to tip of wing across the back one foot seven inches and a half [the beak.] is one 1/8 inch long, large where it joins the head flated on the sides and tapering to a sharp point, a little declining and curvated, a fine yellow, with a shade of black on the extremity of upper beak; the eye is prominent, black and on a angular scale of 1/2 Inc; occupyse 3?. 3?. in width. the upper part of the head is black from the beak as low as the middle of the eye and a little below the joining of the neck except however some white which joins the upper part of the beak which forks and passing over the sides of the forehead terminate above each eye. the under part of the bird, that is the thr[o]at and cheeks as high as the eye, the neck brest belly and under part of the wings and tail are of a fine white, the upper part of the neck, back, and wings are of a fine, quaker coulour, or bright dove colour with reather more of a bluish tint—except however the three first or larger feathers in the wing which on upper side are of a deep black. the wing has four joints No. Joint Length of joint No. of feathers.

HABITS. They are a bird of clime remain on the coast of Floriday and the borders of the Gulph of mexico &amp; even the lower portion of the Mississippi during the winter and in the Spring (see for date my thermometrical observations at the river Dubois), visit this country and that fa[r]ther north for the purpose of raising their young. this duty seems now to have been accomplished from the appearance of a young Pilacon which was killed by one of our men this morning, and they are now in large flocks on their return to their winter quarters. they lay usually two eggs only and chuise for a nest a couple of logs of drift wood near the water's edge and with out any other preperation but the thraught formed by the proximity of those two logs which form a trought they set and hatch their young which after [wards they] nurture with fish their common food MEASURE.

The beak is a whiteish yellow the under part connected to a bladder like pouch, this pouch is connected to both sides of the lower beak and extends down on the under side of the neck and terminates in the stomach this pouch is uncovered with feathers, and is formed [of] two skins the one on the inner and the other on the outer side a small quantity of flesh and strings of which the anamal has at pleasure the power of moving or drawing in such manner as to contract it at pleasure. in the present subject I measured this pouch and found it's contents 5. gallons of water The feet are webbed large and of a yellow colour, it has four toes the hinder toe is longer than in most aquatic fouls, the nails are black, not sharp and 1/2 an inch in length. The plumage generally is white, the feathers are thin compared with the swan goose or most aquatic fouls and has but little or no down on the body. the upper part of the head. is covered with black f[e]athe[r]s short, as far as the back part of the head, the yellow skin unfeathered extends back from the upper beak and opening of the mouth and comes to a point just behind the eye The large f [e] athers of the wings are of a deep black colour the 1st. &amp; 2.nd joint of [the wings] from the body above the same is covered with a second layer of white feathers which extend quite half the length of those large feathers of the wing the thye is covered with feathers within a quarter of an inch of the knee. 1st.

The green insect known in the U'States by the name of the sawyer or chittediddle, [Katydid—Coues] was first heard to cry on the 27th. of July, we were then in latitude 41. some minutes. The prarie hen or grouse, was seen in the praries betwen the Missouri and the river platte July the 30th. this day Joseph Fields killed a Braro [badger] as it is called by the French engages. this is a singular anamal not common to any part of the United States, it's weight is sixteen pounds. it is a carniverous anamal. on both sides of the uper jaw is fexed one long and sharp canine tooth. it's eye is small black and piercing. [See description in full, under date of Feb. 25, 1806.] August the 25th. on our return from the mound of sperits saw the first bats that we had observed since we began to assend the Missouri. also saw on our return on the Creek that passes this mound about 2 M. distant S. a bird of heron kind as large as the Cormorant short tale long leggs of a colour on the back and wings deep copper brown with a shade of red. we could not kill it therefore I can not discribe it more particularly. Sept 5th. saw some wild goats or antelopes on the hill above the Glauber Salts Springs they ran off we could not discover them sufficiently distinctly to discribe even their colour. their track is as large as a deer reather broader &amp; more Wont at the point. This day one of our hunters brought us a Serpent beautifully variagated with small black spotts of a romboydal form on a light yellow white ground the black p [r] edominates most on the back the whiteis [h] yellow on the sides, and it is nearly white on the belly with a few party couloured scuta on which the black shews but imperfectly and the colouring matter seems to be underneath the Scuta. it is not poisonous it hisses remarkably loud; it has 221 Scuta on the belly and 51 on the tale, the eyes are of a dark black colour the tale terminates in a sharp point like the substance of a cock's spur.

On the Lard. side of the river about 2 miles from the river Sergt. Pryor and Drewyer discovered a bold salt spring of strong water. September 13th. killed a bluewinged teal [Querquedula discors— Coues] and a Porcupine [Erethizon dorsatum]; found it in a Cottonwood tree near the river on the Lard Shore. the leaves of the Cottonwood were much distroyed as were those of the Cottonwood trees in it's neighbourhood. I therefore supposed that it fed on the folage of trees at this season, the flesh of this anamal is a pleasant and whoalsome food. the quills had not yet obtained their usual length. it has four long toes, before on each foot, and the same number behind with the addition of one short one on each hind foot on the inner side. the toes of the feet are armed with long black nails particularly the fore feet. they weigh from 15 to 20 lbs they resemble the slowth very much in the form of their hands, or fore feet. their teeth and eyes are like the bever September 14th. 1804. this day Capt.

F Inches from the tip of the toe to the extremity of the beak 1 . 10 from tip to tip of wing when extended 2 . 5. length of beak – . 3 5/8 length of tale – . 3 1/8 length of leg and toe – . 10. the legs are flat, of a pale skye blue colour and but slightly imbricated. the second joint, as low as the mustle extends is covered with feathers which is about half it's length. it has three toes on a foot connected by a web. there is also a small toe on each foot placed about the eighth of an inch up the leg behi[n]d. the nails are black and short and those of the middle toes ar[e] singular—there being two nails on each the one above the other the upper one the longest and sharpest. the tale contains eleven feathers of the same length of a bluish white colour. the body and under side of the wings except the large feathers of the 1 &amp; 2ed. joints of the wings are white, as are also the feathers of the upper part of the 4th joint of the wing. and some of those of the 3rd. adjoining. the large feathers of the pinion or first &amp; the second joint are black; a part of the larger feathers of the third-joint on the upper side and all the smaller feathers which cover the upper part of these joints ar[e] black; as are also the tuft of long feathers on each side of the body above the joining of the wing, leaving however a stripe of white between them on the back. the head and neck are shaped much like the grey plover, and is a light brick-dust brown. the beak is black and flat, largest where it joins the head and from thence tapering every way gradually to a very sharp point the upper beak being 1/8 of an inch the longest turning down at the point. the nostrils are parallal with the beak and are long narrow and connected. the beak is curvated and inverted; the Curvature being upwards in stead of downwards as those of most birds are the substance of the beak is as flexable as whalebone and at a little distance precisely resembles that substance. their note is like that of the common whistling or grey plover tho' reather louder, and more varied, and their habits are the same with that bird so far as I have been enabled to learn, with this difference however that this bird sometimes lights in the water and swims. it generally feads about the shallow bars of the river; to collect it's food, it immerces it's beak in the water, and th [r] ows it's head and beak from side to side at every step it takes. May 9th 1805. I killed four plover this evening of a different kind [Symphemia semi-palmata —Coues] from any I have yet seen.1 1 This description is extended by Lewis in Codex D, p. 111 (in our volume i, p. 17), with some alterations, and rearrangement.—Ed. it resembles the grey or whistling plover more than any other of this family of birds, tho' it is much larger. it is about the size of the yellow leged plover common to the U'States, and called the jack curloo by some. the legs are of a greenish brown; the toes, three and one high at the heel unconnected with a webb, the breast and belly of a brownish white; the head neck upper part of the body and coverts of the wings are of a dove coloured brown which when the bird is at rest is the predomanent colour. the tale has 12 feathers of the same length of which the two in the center are black with transverse bars of yellowish bron, the others are a brownish white. the large feathers of the wings are white tiped with black. the eyes are black with a small ring of dark yellowish brown the beak is black 2 1/2 inches long, cilindrical, streight, and roundly or blountly pointed. the notes of this bird are louder and more various than of any other species which I have seen. May 26th. 1805. One of the party killed a bighorned [Ovis montana], the head and horns of which weighed 27 lbs. a hare was also killed which weighed 8 1/2 lbs. the hare are now of a pale lead brown colour Discription of the blue Crested corvus bird [Cyanocitta stelleri— Coues] common to the woody and western side of the Rockey mountains, and all the woody country from thence to the Pacific Ocean It's beak is black convex, cultrated, wide at its base where it is beset with hairs, and is 1 1/4 inches from the opening of the chaps to their extremity, and from the joining of the head to the extremity of the upper chap 1 1/8 inches, the upper exceeds the under chap a little; the nostrils are small round unconnected and placed near the base of the beak where they lye concealed by the hairs or hairy feathers which cover the base of the upper chap. the eye reather large and full but not prominent and of a deep blueish black, there being no difference in the colour of the puple and the iris. the crest is very full the feathers from 1 to 1 1\2 Inches long and occupye the whole crown of the head. the head neck, the whole of the body including the coverts of the wings, the upper disk of the tail and wings are of a fine g [1] ossey bright indigo blue Colour the under disk of the tail and wings are of a dark brown nearly black. the leg and first joint of the thye are 4 1/4 In. long, the legs and feet are black and the front covered with 6 scales the hinder part smothe, the toes are also imbrecated, four in number long and armed with long sharp black tallons. the upper disk of the first four or five feathers of the wing next to the boddy, are marked with small transverse stripes of black as are also the upper side of the two center feathers of the tail; the tail is five inches long &amp; is composed of twelve feathers of equal length. the tail 1 &amp; 1/2 as long as the boddy. the whole length from the point of the beak to extremity of the tail 1 Foot 1 Inch; from the tip of one to the tip of the other wing 1 Foot 5 1/2 Inches. the size &amp; the whole Contour of this bird resembles very much the blue jay or jay bird as they are called in the U'States. like them also they seldom rest in one place long but are in constant motion hoping from spra to spray. what has been said is more immediately applicable to the male, the colours of the female are somewhat different in her the head crest neck half the back downwards and the coverts of the wings are of a dark brown, but sometimes there is a little touch of the Indigo on the short feathers on the head at the base of the upper chap. this bird feeds on flesh when they can procure it, also on bugs flies and buries. I do not know whether they distroy little birds but their tallons indicate their capacity to do so if nature, has directed it. their note is loud and frequently repeated châ′-â′ châ′-â′. &amp;c. also twat twat twat, very quick. [The rest of Codex Q, consists of Clark's copies of Lewis's notes.—Ed.] [Note by Clark, in Codex R.—Ed.] Fort Clatsop. December 18th. 1805. This day one of the men shot a bird of the Corvus genus, which was feeding on some fragments of meat near the camp. this bird is about the size of the king bird or bee martin, and not unlike that bird in form. the beak is 3/4 of an inch long, wide at the base, of a convex, and cultrated figure. beset with some small black hairs near it's base. the chaps are of nearly equal lengths tho' the upper exceeds the under one a little, and has a small nich in the upper chap near the extremity perceptable only by close examineation. the colour of the beak is black. the eye is large and prominent, the puple black, and iris of a dark yellowish brown. the legs and feet are black and imbricated, has four toes on each foot armed with long sharp tallons, the hinder toe is nearly as long as the middle toe in front, and longer than the two remaining toes. the tale is composed of twelve feathers the longest of which are five inches, being six in number placed in the center. the remaining six are placed 3 on either side and graduly deminish to four inches which is the shortest and outer feathers. the tail is half the length of the bird, the wh[ol]e length from the extremity of the beak to the extremity of the tale being 10 Inches. the head from it's joining the neck forward as far as the eyes nearly to the base of the beak and on each side as low as the center of the eye is black. arround the base of the beak the throat jaws, neck, brest and belley are of a pale bluish white. the wings back and tale are of a bluish black with a small shade of brown. this bird is common to this piny country are also found in the rockey mountains on the waters of the columbia river or woody side of those mountains, appear to frequent the highest summits of those mountains as far as they are covered with timber. their note is que, quit-it, quit-it, que-hoo; and tâh, tâh, &amp;[c]. there is another bird of reather larger size which I saw on the woddy parts of the rockey mountains on the waters of the Missouri, this bird I could never kill tho' I made several attempts, the predominate colour is a dark blue the tale is long and they are not crested, I believe them to be of the corvus genus also. their note is châr, châr, char-ar, char; the large blue crested corvus bird of the Columbia river is also [See description by Lewis, pp. 134, 135, above.—Ed.] [Note by Lewis, on fly-leaf of Codex R.—Ed.] note of the corvus bird killed at Fort Clatsop. que-quit. it; que hos. repeated, &amp; chat, chat, chat [Note by Clark, on fly-leaf of Codex B.—Ed.] Oake cha ke har the Corvuss bird.

      <field name="fulltext">IV. Botany FROM a small blank-book of Lewis's,1 1 In possession of American Philosophical Society.—Ed which he had also used when an army paymaster in 1800. These notes were apparently written during the winter of 1803–04, at River Dubois. The book also contains meteorological data, which will be given post.—Ed.] The Kickapoo calls a certain water plant with a large Circular floating leaf found in the ponds and marshes in the neighbourhood of Kaskaskias and Cahokia, Po-kish'-a-co-mah', of the root of this plant the Indians prepare an agreeable dish, the root when taken in it's green state is from 8 to 14 inches in circumpherence is dryed by being exposed to the sun and air or at other times with a slow fire or smoke of the chimnies, it shrinks much in drying. The root of this plant grows in a horrizontal direction near the surface of the rich loam or mud which forms the bottoms of their ponds or morasses, generall[y] three, sometimes four or more of these roots are attatced together by a small root or string of a hearder substance of a foot or six inches in length, the root of the plant thus annually progresses shooting out a root from a bud at the extremity of the root of the presceeding years groath, this in the course of the summer p[r]oduces a new root prepared with a bud for the progression of the next season, also one leaf and one seed stalk the stem of the former supporting or reather attatched to a large green circular leaf 18 inches to two feet in diameter which fl[o]ats while green usually on the serface of the water, the sta[l]k is propotioned to the debth of the water, and of a celindrical form, is an inch and a half in circumpherence at or near it's junction of the root thence regularly tapering to the leaf where it is perhaps not more than an inch, the large fibers of the leaf project from the extremity of the stalk in every direction at right angles from it to the circumpherence of the leaf like rays from the center, there are from twelve to eighteen of those fibers. the leaf is nearly a circle smoth on both sides and even and regular on it's edges near the same part of the root from which the leaf stalk project the seed stalk dose also it is about the same size and form of it but usually a foot longer standing erect and bearing it[s] blossum above the surface of the water which I am informed is of a white colour. The seed vessel or matrix is the form of a depressed cone the small extremity of which is attatc[h]ed to the uper end of the stalk; before it has attained it's groath it resembles an inverted cone but when grown the base obtains a preponderancy and inclining downwards rests it's edge against the stalk the base is a perfect circular plain from eighteen to twenty inches in circumpherence in it's succulent state, and from two to three inches in hight. the surface of the cone when dryed by the sun and air after being exposed to the frost is purforated with two circular ranges of globular holes from twenty to 30 in number arond one which forms the center placed at the distance of from an eighth to 1/4 of an inch assunder, each of those cells contains an oval nut of a light brown colour much resembling a small white oak acorn smothe extreemly heard, and containing a white cernal of an agreeable flavor; these the native[s] frequently eat either in this state or roasted; they frequently eat them also in their succulent state the bear feed on the leaves of this plant in the spring and summer in the autumn and winter the Swan, geese, brant, ducks and other acquatic fowls feed on the root, the cone is brown, pithy and extreemly light, and when seperated from the stalk flots on the suface of the water with its base down. the Indians procure it and prepare it for food in the following manner—they enter the ponds where it grows, barefooted in autumn, and feel for it among the mud which being soft and the root large and near the surface they readily find it they easily draw it up it having no fiborus or colateral roots to attatch it firmly to the mud they wash and scrape a thin bleack rind off it and cut it croswise into pieces of an inch in length when it is prepared for the pot it is of a fine white colour boils to a pulp and makes an agreeable soupe in which way it is usually dressed by the natives when they wish to preserve it for any length of time they cut it in pieces in the manner before discribed string it on bark or leather throngs of a convenient length and hang it to dry in the sun, or expose it to the smoke of their chimnies, when thus dryed it will keep for several years, it is esteemed as nutricius as the pumpkin or squash and is not very dissimilar in taste The Chipiways or sateaus call this plant Wab-bis-sa-pin or Swan-root The ferench or Canadians know it by two names the Pois de Shicoriat or Graine de Volais. the roots of this plant are from one foot to eighteen inches in length. The common wild pittatoe also form another article of food in savage life this they boil untill the skin leaves the pulp easily which it will do in the course of a few minutes the outer rind which is of a dark brown coulour is then sc[r]aped off the pulp is of a white coulour, the pettatoe thus prepared is exposed on a scaffold to the sun or a slow fire untill it is thoroughly dryed, or at other times strung upon throngs of leather or bark and hung in the roofs of their lodges where by the influence of the fire and smoke it becomes th[o]roughly dryed, they are then prepared for use, and will keep perfectly sound many years, these they boil with meat or pound and make an agreeable bread of this pittaitoee may be used in it's green or undryed state without danger provided it be well roasted or boiled it produces a vine which runs to a considerable length usually intwining itself about the neighbouring bushes and weeds, the vine is somewhat branched, and in it[s] progress at the distance of 2 1/2 inches it puts forth one leaf stem at right angles with the vine, which is furnished with two par of ovate leaves and turminated by one of a similar shape, these are of a pale green colour not indented on their edges, reather a rough appearance, the vine is small and green except near the ground where it sometime[s] assumes a redish hue. the fruit is connected by a small liggament at both ends extending for many yards in length and attatching together in some instances six eight or more of these pittaitoes. it's root is pereniel the vine annual. There is also another root found in ma[r] shey land or ponds which is much used by the Kickapoos Chipaways and many other nations as an article of food it is called by the Chipeways Moc-cup-pin this in it's unprepared state is not only disagreeable to the taste but even dangerous to be taken even in a small quantity; in this state it acts as a powerfull aemetic. a small quantity will kill a hog yet prepared by the Indians it makes not only an agreeable but a nutricious food. I have not seen the plant and can therefore only discribe it from Information the leaf is said to be broad and to float on the water the root is from 10 to 12 inches in length and about 2/3ds. as much in thickness it has a rough black skin, the pulp is white and of a mealy substance when properly prepared the preparation is this—having collected a parsel of these roots you cut and split a sufficient parsel of wood which is set on end as the coliers commence the base of their coal pitts, the [l]engths of these sticks of wood being as nearly the same as you can conveniently cut them and about 4 feet in length thus forming when put together an even surface at top on this is thrown soft earth of from two to 3 Inches in debth the roots are laid on this and earth thrown over the whole forming the Colliers kiln complete. fire is then communicated to the wood beneath and it is suffered to burn slowly for several days untill the wood is exausted or they concieve their roots are sufficiently cooked they then take them out scrape them &amp; cut them into slices crosswise of half an inch thick and laying them on a scaffold of small sticks build small fires under them and dry them untill they become perfectly firm thus prepared they are fit for uce and will keep for years if not exposed to wet. they are either boiled to a pulp in their soupe or less boiled eat them with bears oil or venison and bears flesh they sometimes pound it and make a bread of it.1 1 "Po-kish-a-co-mah" is unmistakably the native nelumbium, Nelumbo lutea. The "wild pittatoe" is probably Ipomœa pandurata, though the leaf description is very misleading. "Moc-cup-pin" is probably Nymphœea reniformis, also sometimes called Nymphœea tuberosa or Castalia tuberosa.—William Trelease, director of Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis. [Data by Clark, found in Codex N, pp. 154, 155. The italicized words and figures in parentheses are interlineations, also by Clark, in red ink.—Ed.]2 2 Dr. Trelease furnishes us with the following memoranda on the plants and trees named in the following list: "Prickly pear" is an Opuntia—probably 0. Missouriensis, from its geographical position. Several species of oak less than 480 miles from the mouth of the Missouri River would undoubtedly be, besides the red oak noted (Quercus rubra, or more probably Q. Scbneckii),Q. velutina (sometimes called Q. tinctoria), Q. Marylandica (sometimes called Q. nigra), Q. imbricaria, Q. alba, Q. minor (sometimes called Q. stettata), Q. macrocarpa and Q. platanoides (sometimes called Q.bicolor). "Iron wood" may refer to Carpinus Caroliniana or to Ostrya Virginica. "Popaw" is Asimina triloba. "Arrow wood," though this sometimes has been applied to the Osage orange, probably refers to Viburnum dentatum or V. molle. "Green Bryar" is probably Smilax rotundifolia. "Pacan" is Carya olivaeformis, sometimes known as Hicoria pecan. "Grapes of the small kind" are probably Vitis riparia. The "White oak" is Quercus alba, but, from the locality (1370 miles from the mouth of the river), I should think that the Burt oak, Q. macrocarpa, might be referred to here; or, more probably, the common oak of the Rocky Mountain region, Q Garryaria, or some one of the forms segregated from this. "Shoemate" is Rhus, and possibly may be R. typhana, also sometimes called R. hirta. Note. The Lynn commence about the Calumet Bluff's and downwards. (950 Ms. up the Missouri) The Black Walnut is found as high up as White Stone river and from thence down on the high rich lands, (900 Ms.) Mulberry is found as high up as Grand River de Sieoux. (858.) Prickly pear is not Common below the Queequerre (1000 Ms.) Hickory is to be found below the Mahars and black birch in the Same country, also the horn beem (830 Ms.) Hack berry and Hasel bushes are found as high up as the Council bluff (650 Ms.) also red oake and Sycamore several species of oake Iron wood Popaws arrow wood and elder are found as high as the little Nemahaw (480 Mil) also Sugar tree Buckeye is found as high up as the old Kanzas village above Independance Creek (285 Ms.) Green Bryar found as high up as [blank space in MS.] Pacans are found as high up as Osarge River (400.) In decending the Missouri &amp; Rochejhone The Grapes of the Small kind first appear on the River Rochejhone near it's enterance into the Rocky mountain (2700 Mils) but are not abundant on that river, the grape are abundant below cannon ball river, (1500 Msup) and from thence down to the enterance of the river into the Mississippi. no grapes of the large kind Wild plumbs first appear at the cut off or Mandan Isd. (1580 Ms.) below the mandans tho' they are Scerce and Small they becom abundant and fine in the neighbourhood of the enterance of White River. White oaks first appear 60 miles below the Ricaras Vil.g (1370 Ms. Up) and are found in considerable quantity in the river bottoms just above the enterance of Corvus Creek. White Ash at ash rapid on the Missouri (2443 Mls.up). and on the River rochejhone 60 miles above it's enterance. Elm is found something higher up the rivers than the ash (2500) Prickly ash first appears a fiew miles above Bull Island (2800) in the river bottoms. Shoemate commences. Yellow Oker above the upper old Kanzas Village in a bend on the S side Chock Cherry found between the 2 Nemahars Rivers 500 miles up the Missouri also another species of Cherry. Sycamore is found at Ball pated prarie. [Data by Lewis, found in Codex R, pp. 4–53, and not entered elsewhere. The rest of Codex R consists of Clark's copies of Lewis's natural history notes on the Columbia; as these are contained in the journals proper, they are here omitted.—Ed.]1 1 The following identifications of plants and trees named in Lewis's list are furnished by Dr. Trelease : 1."Cress" is a species of Nasturtium, probably N. obtusum, sessiliflorum, or sinuatum, sometimes called Roripa. 3.Probably is the hop tree, Ptelea trifoliata. 4."Cottonwood" is Populus monilifera, sometimes called P. deltoides. The trans-Missouri cottonwood is a variety of this sometimes called var. occidentalis and sometimes var. intermedia. 5."Cress" is probably a species of Nasturtium. 6."Kail," possibly Brassica Sinafistrum. 8."Yellow root "may be Hydrastis Canadensis. 10."Wild ginger" is a species of Asarum, perhaps A. Canadense, or more likely, A. reflexum. 11.Seems to be Astragalus Mexicanus. 12."Purple courant" is probably Ribes floridum. 13."Narrow leaf willow "is Salix longifolia. 14."Wide leaf willow," from the pale under surface of the leaf, is pretty clearly Salix amygdaloides. 15 and 16may possibly be, respectively, Petalostemon violaceus and P. candidus, also known sometimes as Kuhnistera purpurea and K. candida. 17.From the description of the fruit would seem to be a Rhamnus, and it might possibly be R. alnifolia, though the leaves are very small for that. 18.Is Desmanthus brachylobus. 26.Is probably Lonicera Sullivantii. 27.Is probably another wild potato, Ipomœa leptophylla; though I am surprised that, if so, he did not learn from the Indians that its root was used by them. 29.Is probably Cassia Cbamaecrista. 30."Wild sage" may possibly have been Salvia Pitcheri. 31."Sand rush "is Equisetum arvense. 32.Is Gutierrezia Euthamiae. 33.Is Arctostaphylos Uva-ursi. 40.Is Grindelia squarrosa. 104.Is Juniperus sabina procumbens. 105 and 106,"Tobacco," are Nicotiana quadrivalvis. A List of specimines of plants collected by me on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers contain such observations on the vegitable kingdom spread to our view in this rich country as they have occurred to my mind. or as the several subjects have presented themselves to my view. No. 1.a species of Cress taken at St. Louis May 10th. 1804. it is common in the open grown[d]s on the Mississippi bottoms, appears in the uncultivated parts of the lots gardens and orchards, the seed come to maturity by the 10h. of May in most instances. No. 2.was taken on the 22ed. of May 1804 on the bank of the Missouri about 8 miles above St. Charles it is common in the botom lands—rises to the hight of two feet, and rarely puts forth more than two stalks from the same root and most commonly only one it's root is spiral. No. 3.Was taken on the 23rd. of May 1804, near the mouth of the Osage Woman's creek, it is a srub and resembles much in growth the bladder scenna, it rises to [the] hight of eight or ten feet and is an inhabitant of a moist rich coil. usually the verge of the river bank. it is a handsome Shrub No. 4.Was taken at a small Village North side of the Missouri called Sharetton on the 25th. of May 1804. this is the last settlement on the Missouri; and consists of ten or twelve families mostly hunters. this specimine is the seed of the Cottonwood which is so abundant in this country, it has now arrived at maturity and the wind when blowing strong drives it through the air to a great distance being supported by a parrishoot of this cottonlike substance which gives the name to the tree in some seasons it is so abundant as to be troublesome to the traveler. this tree arrives at great sise, grows extreemly quick the wood is of a white colour, soft spungey and light, perogues are most usually made of these trees, the wood is not durable nor do I know any other valuable purpose which it can answer except that just mentioned. this tree forms a great majority of the timber bordering the rivers Missouri and Mississippi; it extends itself throughout the extensive bottom lands of these streams and seases to appear when the land rises into hills when these rivers form new lands on their borders or Islands in their st[r]eams, which they are per[pe]tually doing, the sweet willow is the first tree or shrub which usually makes it's appearance, this continues one two or three years and is then supplanted by the Cottonwood which invariably succeedes it. this tree resembles much in it's air and appearance that beatifull and celibrated tree the Lombardy poplar; and more particularly so when in its young state; the young plants grow very close untill they have attained the age of four or five years, a proportion of them then begin to dye and the forrest opens and gives place to sundry other shrubs and plants which will be noticed in their proper places. No. 5.was taken on the 27th. of May 1804, near the mouth of the Gasconade; it is a species of cress which grows very abundantly alonge the river beach in many places; my men make use of it and find it a very pleasant whol[e] some sallad. No. 6.Was taken on the 27th. of May 1804, near the mouth of the Gasconade; it is a species of rope or kail, it grows on the beach of the river, when young my men used it [as] a boiled green and found [it] healthy and pleasant. No. 7.was found on the 27th. of May 1804, near the water side about 10 miles below the mouth of the Gasconade, it rises to the hight of three feet and puts forth many large suculent branched stalks from the same root, this plant is a stranger to me. No. 8.Was taken the 29th. of May 1804, below the mouth of the Osage Rivr. this plant is known in Kentuckey and many other parts of this western country by the name of the yellow root. it is a sovereighn remidy for a disorder common in this quarter called the soar eyes this complaint is common it is a violent inflamation of the eyes attended with high fevers and headach, and is extreemly distressing, and frequently attended with the loss of sight. this root affords a speady and efficasieus remidy for this disorder prepared &amp; used in the following manner.—let the roots be geathered washed and carefully dryed in the shade; brake them in pieces of half an inch in length and put them in a bottle or viol, taking care to fill the vessel about two thirds full of the dryed root, then fill the vessell with could water, rain water is preferable; let it remain about six hours shaking it occasionally and it will be fit for use; the water must remain with the root and be applyed to the eyes frequently by weting a piece of fine linin [and] touching them gently with it. this root is a fine aromatic bitter, and a strong asstringent; it is probable that it might be applyed in many cases as a medicene with good effect, but I have not learnt that any experiment has been made by an inward application. it makes an excellent mouth water, and a good outward applycation for wounds or inflamations of every kind. native of rich bottom lands on the rivers. No. 9.Was taken on the 30th. of May 1804, below the mouth of the Osage river; it rises from 18 Inches to 2 feet in hight; is a beautifull green plant found most generally on the sides of rich hills in the forrest it's radix is fiberous. No. 10.This plant was taken the 1st. of June at the mouth of the Osage river; it is known in this country by the name of the wild ginger, it resembles that plant somewhat in both taste and effect, it is a strong stomatic stimelent, and freequently used in sperits with bitter herbs. it is common throughout the rich lands in the Western country. No. 11.Was taken the 3rd. of June above the mouth of the Osage river; it is the groath of high dry open praries; rises to the hight of 18 inches or two feet puts forth many stems from the same root; the radix is fiborous; the Indians frequently use the fruit of this plant to alay their thirst as they pass through these extensive dry praries common to many parts of the country bordering on the Missouri; it resembles much the Indigo in the appearance of it's growth. it bears it's fruit much like the indigo, a stem projects about three inches from the main stem at an angle of about 20 degrees, and bears from [two] to four podds, which in their succulent and unripe state as at this season of the year are about the size of a pullet's egg, somewhat flattened on two sides; the matrix is formed in two lobes and the seed are like pees and attatched to the matrix in the same manner, single and adhering to the center the pulp is crisp &amp; clear and tasts very much like the hull of a gardin pee. when ripe the fruit is of a fine red coulour and sweet flavor. it dose not ripen untill the middle of June. No. 12.1st. of august 1804, one of our hunters brought us a bough of the purple courant, which is frequently cultivated in the Atlantic states; the fruit was ripe; I presume it is a native of North America here it grows generally in the praries but is not very abundant. No. 12 is a specimine of it's leaves. No. 13.The narrow leaf willow taken on the 14th. of June. this tree is male and female, the female bearing it[s] seed in a small pod (small ova form) of three lobes, or devisions these pods are attatched to a stem which projects from the small boughs, and are from thirty to fifty in number, about this season they begin to ripen, when the pods burst and a great number of small seeds each furnished with a parrishoot of a cottonlike substance are discharged from those cels. they readily float in the air and are driven by the wind to a great distance, they are so abundant at some times as to be disagreeable to the traveller. the male plant has a sucession of it's flowers, commencing to bloom about the 1st. of June and continuing untill the 1st. of August, they are a small tausel of a half, or 3/4 of an inch in length, round, and tapering to the extremity, puting frort[h] from it's sides an infinite number of small stamens of a brown colour. it's leaves are numerous narrow, slightly indented, of a yellowish green, on the uper side, and whiteish green underneath, pointed, being widest in the middle which rarely exceeds 1/8th of an inch, it is smoth, tho' not glossey. This tree is invariably the first which makes it's appearance on the newly made Lands on the borders of the Mississippi and Missouri, and seems to contribute much towards facilitating the operation of raisin[g] this ground still higher; they grow remarkably close and in some instances so much so that they form a thicket almost impenetrable the points of land which are forming allways become eddies when overflown in high water these willows obstruct the force of the water and makes it more still which causes the mud and sand to be deposited in greater quantities; the willow is not attal imbarrassed or injured by this inundation, but puts forth an innumerable quantity of small fibrous roots from every part of its trunk near the surface of the water which further serve to collect the mud, if there happens not to be a sufficient quantity of mud depossited in the one season to cover the trunk of the willow as high as these capillery roots when the water subsides they fall down and rest on the trunk of the tree and conceal it for 18 or 20 Inches; these capillery roots now perish and the willow puts forth other roots at the surface of the ground which enter it and furnish the tree with it's wanted nutriment this willow never rises to any considerable size, it is seldom seen larger than a mans arm, and scarcely ever rises higher than 25 feet. the wood is white light and tough, and is generally used by the watermen for setting poles in preference to any thing else. as the willow incre[a]ses in size and the land gets higher by the annu[a]l inundations of the river, the weeker plants decline dye and give place to the cottonwood which is it's ordinary successor, and these last in their turn also thin themselves as they become larger in a similar manner and leave the ground open for the admission of other forest trees and under brush. these willow bars form a pleasant beacon to the navigator at that season when the banks of the river are tumbling in, as they [are] seldom high and rearly falling in but on the contrary most usually increasing. No. 14.The wide leaf willow or that species which I believe to be common to most parts of the Atlantic States. it grows in similar situations to that discribed with rispect to the narrow leaf willow, but is never found in such abundance, it arrives to greater size some times to forty feet in hight and eighteen inches in diameter, the leave is smoth ovate, pointed, finely indented, a pale green on the upper side and of a whiteis[h] green or silver colour underneath. like the narrow leaf willow the leaf is widest in the middle where it is from one inch to 3/4 wide. it bears it's seed in the manner discribed of the other and the plants ar[e] likewise male and female. No. 15.Was taken on the 20th. of July, a bieniel plant, an inhabitant of the open praries or plains, high situations, where the grass is low. the flower is a pale purple colour small form a kind of button of a long cone like form which terminate[s] it's branches which are numerous. it grows abo[u]t 2 1/2 or three feet high. it is a stranger to me. the leaves are small and narrow, and divided into three on a stem No. 16.this is much the same as No. 15. with this difference that the blume of the conic tausel are white in stead of purple and it's leaves single fewer and longer. No. 17.Taken on the 27th. of July, the appearance of the bush is much like the privy and about the same hight it grows about the borders of the open praries it's leaf is a deep green, ovate 1 1/2 to 1 1/4 inches long 1/2 inch wide finely indented plan[t] piennial. the buries or fruit a small round bury of a deep perple coulour nearly black, has three seed formed like the third part of a globe split by the meeting of two plains at it's axcis. I do not know whether birds eat them or not. they look handsome but tast insipid, this is a groath with which I am not acquainted. No. 18.was taken 30th. July grows in the praries in high situations, it's radix is pe[r]ennial, it grows about three 1/2 or 4 feet high it has a long top root is but little branced, it's colateral brances are short and furnished with many leaf stems which are garnished by a great number of small leaves which are attatch[ed] by pairs on either side and resemble some of the sensative bryers, tho I could not discover that this plant partook of that quality. it's flower is of a gloubelar form composed of a number of fibers of a yellowish white, and produces as a fruit a bunch of little pees which are all bent edgeways into the form of a semicircle and so closely connected and compressed as to form a globular figure of a curious appearance. No. 19.Taken at the old village of the little Osages; the seed were now ripe; it grew in great abundance in the prarie from five to six feet high; it gave the plain much the appearance of an extensive timothy meadow ready for the sythe, the small birds feed on the seed which are very abundant resembling in size shape and colour those of the flax; when ripe they fall very easily from the stem. the leaf of this grass dose not decline or wither as many others do at the time the seed ripens but still continues succulent and green. it continues throughout the summer to put up a succession of young succors which in turn bear a large quantity of seed: this succession of crops continues throughout the season without the declining or withering of the stalk or leaves of the mother plant. the horses were very fond of this grass and I am disposed to believe that it would make a valuable grass for culture. this grass is common in the praries or bottom lands as high as the river Platte and perhaps further it is a fine sweet grass and I am confident would make good hay. No. 20.A specemine of wild Rye taken on the 27th. of July, this grass is common to all the low praries above the Cancez river. it rises to the hight of six feet and upwards and resembles the rye extreemly in appearance the geese and ducks feed on it when young, as they do also on the grain when ripe in September and October it produces much grain tho of an inferior quality compared with cultivated rye. No. 21.is another species of the wild rye it dose not grow as tall as No. 20. neither does it like that species confine itself so much to the open ground; it is sometimes found in the timbered land. the grain it produces is [n]either so large or so abundant as the former. No's. 22, 23, 24 &amp; 25,Are various species of grasses which appear in the praries, No. 23. is the most common of any other grass, it rises to the hight of from 4 to 8 feet and never bears any flower or seed that I ever observed and suppose therefore that it must propegate by means of the root: common to all praries in this country. No. 26.Taken on the 2ed. of August in the p[r]arie at the Cuncil bluff. it is a species of honeysuccle and the tube of the flour is very small and short they smell precisely like the English Honeysuccle so much admired in our gardens; this is a shrub and dose not run or vine. the vining honesuccle which bears a red flour is also common to the Illinois and is found as high up the Missoury as the mouth of the Kancez river above which I have not observed it. this species of shrub Honesuccle has some of it's leaves much indented; the fruit nearly ripe when the plant is still in blume; it makes a pretty groath and is a pleasant looking pla[n]t rises to three or four feet high and limbs are much branched. No. 27.taken 4th. of August, and furst observed at the bald prarie it is [a] beatifull plant with a variagated leaf these leaves incompass the flowers which are small and in the center of them; at a small distance they resemble somewhat a white rose the leaf near the large stem is green and is edged with white; they grow smaller and more numerous as they approach the flower or the extremity of the limb. the plant is much branched; the leaf is smoth on both sides and edge, of an ovate form and pale green colour, rises to five or six feet, is annual. at every point that it branches it has a pair of opposite leaves and from th[r]ee to four branches. No. 28.taken on the 17th. July at the bald prarie is a large convolvalist [of] a fine white colour; the vines are very extensive and run in every direction intwining themselves about the larger weeds and bending them down is [in] such manner as to make the open grownds or praries where they grow almost impassable; the root is about the size and shape of the vine and enters it so deep that I could not find it's brances tho' I dug as much as 2 feet in surch of it. the leaf is of a tonge like form pale green even on the edges. leaf thus No. 29.Taken on the 18th. of July. an annuel plant puting up many branches from the root has a leaf like the pateridge bea[n], is jointed bears a number of yellow pea-like flowers which grow on the seed stems which project from the main branches and which are unattended with leaves; these flowers grow all arround this stem and give it the appearance of a tausell. the [l]eaf stems ar[e] long and have 24 par of leaves. No. 30.was taken at the bald praries and is common to both low and high praries it usually grows in a single stem and appears to be an annual groath the leaves are white and like the stem appear to be covered with a white down. this is common to all the praries above the Kancez river; from it's resemblence in taste smell &amp;c to the common Sage I have called it the wild Sage. No. 31.Taken on the 10th. of August, a species of sand rush, jointed and so much branched as to form a perfect broom; it is common to every part of this river at least as far as Latitude 42. N. it grows near the water's edge in moist sand; the horses are remarkably fond of it. No. 40Taken at our camp at the Maha vilage August 17th. 1804. it is a handsome plant about 3 feet high much branched bears a yellow circular flower carnished with meany small narrow ovate petals of the same colour, the leaf about an inch and a quarter in length thick smoth indent [ed] finely, incompassing the stalk about 2/3's and of a tongue like form; annual plant is covered with a gumlike substance which adheres to the fingers and yealds a pleasent smell. No. (100)Novb. 17th. the seed of a plant given me by the recara chief who accompanyed us to the mandanes he informed me that a tea of the seed was a strong diaerettic. and that the squaws chewed them and rubed their hair with them as a perfume. No. (101)the root w[h]en pounded in either green or dryed state makes an excellent poltice for swellings or soar throat. information of the same chief. No. 102)by the information of the same chief—is an excellent purge. the root is dryed and pounded in that state as much as you can hold between the finger and thumb thrise is a doze. it is the growth of the open praries has many small stalks 2 feet high radix piennl [biennial]. No. 103.is the growth of the open praries. it seldom grows higher it is said to be good for inflamed eyes the leaves are immerced in water and being bruised with the fingers a little the water is squeezed from it and occasionally droped when could upon the eyes. (104 No.)October the 16th. a dwarf cedar of the open praries seldom ever rises more than six inches high it is said to be a stimilating shrub it is used as a tea by the Indians to produce sweat. they would make a handsome edging to the borders of a gardin if used as the small box sometime is. No. 105.seed of the Larger species of recarre tobacco pre[se]nted us by Lepoy an Indian chief of that nation commanding the middle town. No. 106is the corrollars of the same prepared for smoking. they are plucked and dryed in the shade. No. 107is the seed of the smaller species. The recarres cultivate two species of tobacco for the purpose of smoking in which way they use it altogether as they neither snuff nor chew. The Larger species (see specimine plants No. 108) rises to the hight of three feet it's round green and succulent much branched when suffered to grow singly. in that sittuation it branches near the ground. and continues to branch and rebranch as it rises at the distance of an inch or 2 inches, thus forming an infinite number of boughs at the top which are terminated by the flowers which are tubelar, trunnicated scalluped on the edges and five pointed, white colour, order, pentandria moniginia, the leaf is of a toung-like form the larger of which are attatched to the lower part of the stalk, one inch wide in the broadest part &amp; 2 1/2 inches long. the[y] demin[i]s[h] as they are higher on the stalk, tho' they increas in numbers. The indians cultivate it in the following manner they prepare hills at the distance of about 2 1/2 feet from each other, and leavel the top nearly leaving it somewhat convex. in those hills they sew the seed as early in the spring as the climate will permit them to prepare the earth say latter end of April; they keep the hills clear of weeds and grass by plucking it from among the stalks of tobacco with their fingers and sometimes allso thin the stalks of tobacco by plucking up the weaker stalks tho they leave many stalks to grow on each hill. when the tobacco begins to form it's seed poods it is then ready for the knife when a great portion from each hill is cut and hung on sticks untill it is nearly dry when they form them into carrots of the thickness of a mans arm role them closely with willow bark and hang them in the smoke of their lodges to dry. in forming the carrot they put the butts or lower parts of the stalks together. where the tobacco is cultivated with a view to make carrots the stalks are so thick that they do not attain a thickness at the largest part of the stern greater than that of a small quill. They esteem much more the corroller dryed for the purpose of smoking and for this purpose leave some plant [s] more widely seperated from each other in which situation they produce a greater abundance of flowers &amp; seed they begin to blume in the month of [blank space in MS.] and continue untill the first frost; during the full blume of the flower they pluck the corrollar together with the flower and discarding the latter suffer the former to dry in the shade when perfectly dryed it resembles at first view the green tea and in that state it is smoked by the indians and I found it very pleasent. it dose not affect the nerves in the same manner that the tobacco cultivated in the U'S. dose. The smaller species of this plant differs but little from this just discribed. it is cultivated in the same manner and bears a flower like the other only smaller. the only difference is the form of the leaf, which is larger say 4 times the size and ovate they dry this on sticks and use it in that manner it is reather stronger than the large kind and is seldom made into carrots by the Recares. ?it is worthy of remark that the recares never use sperituous liquors. Mr. Tibeau informed me that on a certain occasion he offered one of their considerate men a dram of sperits, telling him it's virtues the other replyed that he had been informed of it's effects and did not like to make himself a fool unless he was paid to do so that if Mr. T. wished to laugh at him &amp; would give him a knife or breech-coloth or something of that kind he would take a glass but not otherwise. [The following is copied verbatim from the American Philosophical Society's Donation Book of the period—a small volume in limp board covers, 7 5/8 × 12 1/2″ in size. These entries, covering sixteen pages, and apparently in the handwriting of Dr. John Vaughn, doubtless closely followed the original notes by Lewis. The letter "H" is apparently the check-mark of a receiving clerk.—Ed.]1 1 Stewardson Brown, assistant to the curators, in charge of the herbarium of the Botanical Section of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, furnishes us with the following note upon the herbarium of Lewis and Clark : The importance of the results of the Lewis and Clark expedition to American botany may be appreciated when we consider what a large proportion of the plants brought back by these pioneers were of species then unknown to science. The work of identifying the material appears to have been entrusted to Frederick Pursh, a young botanist, who at the time of the return of the expedition, was in Philadelphia, having come there from Dresden several years previous for the purpose of making as thorough a study as possible of the flora of this country; in this he achieved considerable success —largely, it would appear, through the munificence of Dr. Benjamin Smith Barton, then professor of botany at the University of Pennsylvania, under whose patronage much of Pursh's work was made possible. In 1814. Pursh published (in London) the first edition of his Flora America Septentrionalis, two octavo volumes, of 725 pages of text and 24 plates, which contained descriptions of the plants under consideration. Speaking of these in the preface of his work, after a brief reference to his having made the acquaintance of Meriwether Lewis, Pursh says : "A small but highly interesting collection of dried plants was put into my hands by this gentleman in order to describe and figure those thought new, for the purpose of inserting them in the account of his Travels which he was then engaged in preparing for the press. . . . The collection of plants just spoken of was made during the rapid return of the expedition from the Pacific Ocean to the United States. A much more extensive one, made on the slow ascent toward the Rocky Mountains and the chain of the Northern Andes, had unfortunately been lost, by being deposited among other things, at the foot of those mountains. The loss of this collection is the more to be regretted when I consider that the small collection communicated to me, consisting of about one hundred and fifty-five specimens, contained not above a dozen plants known to me to be natives of North America—the rest being either entirely new or little known, and among them at least six distinct and new genera. This may give an idea of the discerning eye of their collector, who had but little practical knowledge of the Flora of North America. . . . The descriptions of these plants so far as the specimens were perfect I have inserted in the present work, in their respective places distinguishing them by the words 'v. s. in Herb. Lewis.'" Here he refers in his descriptions to one hundred and twenty-three (123) species which he ascribes as above, the majority of which he considered to be new to science. For many years the bulk of these plants were entirely lost to the botanical world, it being assumed that Pursh had taken them with him for further study when he went to England in 1811, and had subsequently left them with his friend and benefactor, Mr. A. B. Lambert, vice-president of the Linnean Society, under whose roof the task of completing the work on his Flora was accomplished. Whatever the facts in the case may be, it is certain that a number of plants marked as coming from Lambert's herbarium and representing the type specimens of many of the species described by Pursh in his Flora (among which are seven of the plants received by him from Lewis) now form a part of the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; but in what manner they came into the possession of that institution, the early records fail to show. It is not improbable, however, that they were purchased abroad, and presented to the Academy by some early benefactor. These few specimens were supposed to constitute all that existed of the one hundred and fifty-five specimens referred to by Pursh, until, in making room for improvements at the American Philosophical Society about six years ago, were revealed among other botanical collections in their possession several bundles of plants, the labels of which bore a handwriting which proved to be that of Pursh; and this, together with the data there contained, identified the plants without doubt as the missing specimens of Lewis and Clark. During the more than three-quarters of a century while they had been hidden from the light of day, the beetles had not been altogether idle; and in a few cases the specimens had been entirely reduced to dust, nothing remaining to aid in identification except the labels, while in other cases only fragments were left. Generally, however, they were in fair condition, and now form a part of the herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences, having been placed there on deposit by the Philosophical Society shortly after their discovery. As might be expected, Pursh in his work of identification had fallen into some errors, as a subsequent critical study of the collection by Messrs, Robinson and Greenman of the Gray Herbarium demonstated; but nevertheless fully one-half of the one hundred and twenty-three species referred to by Pursh in the text of his Flora, stand as such to-day. The collection has also been found to contain, in addition to these, a number of species not recognized by Pursh as distinct, but which have proven to be the earliest collections of many of the species of subsequent authors. That some of these, although clearly quite new to Pursh, may have remained undescribed from what he considered a lack of sufficiently perfect material, seems probable, as the following quotation would indicate : "Here I cannot refrain from drawing the attention of future botanists traveling in those regions to two highly interesting plants of which I have only seen imperfect specimens. The first is what Mr. Lewis in his journal calls the 'Osage Apple or Arrow wood of the Missouri.' "This plant is without doubt the osage orange (Toxylon pomiferum, Raf.), a specimen of which, with no label, is contained in the collection. Pursh, in continuation of the paragraph above quoted, describes at considerable length the characteristics of the tree—or, as he terms it, shrub—dwelling on its importance to the Indians in the making of arrows. He further refers to specimens grown at Philadelphia from seed brought back by Lewis, considering it in all respects a most desirable acquisition as an ornamental shrub; and yet, with all this, he fails to give it a name. Three years after the date of the publication of Pursh's Flora, the plant was described by Rafinesque under the name designated above, he possibly drawing his descriptions largely from the specimens which originated from Lewis's seed, planted twelve years before. Whether or not this be true there seems but little doubt that the first information regarding the plant came through Lewis. The collection, as preserved in the Herbarium of the Academy of Natural Sciences to-day, consists of specimens of one hundred and seventy-three recognizable species, mostly in fair condition; these include fifty-five of Pursh's types recognized as species at the present time, with thirty-eight additional ones, now for various reasons not considered tenable. The number lacks but fifteen of the species referred to by Pursh as contained in the Lewis Herbarium; of these, some may be included among the existing specimens but, if so, are not recognizable from their descriptions. In Pursh's Flora he describes but five new genera; of this number four are based upon the plants received by him from Lewis, all of the specimens still existing in fairly good condition. Of these, three still retain the names conferred upon them by Pursh, two in honor of the heads of the expedition—represented each by a single species : Lewisia rediviva (Pursh Fl. 368), and Clarkia pulchella (Pursh Fl. 260, with an excellent figure); and the third Calochortus, the genus of a handsome group of liliaceous plants confined to the Western United States and Mexico. The name selected by Pursh for the fourth new genus represented in the collection had, unfortunately, been proposed as early as 1775 by Aublet for another plant, which necessitated a new name. The discrepancy was noted by De Candolle, who in 1817 in the transactions of the Linnean Society, the original medium of publication of Pursh's new genera, renamed the genus in honor of Pursh, The species collected by Lewis, which is represented by an excellent specimen, now bears the name of Purshia tridentata (Pursh), D.

This plant is known in Kentucky &amp; many other parts of the Western Country by the name of the yellow root. It is said to be a sovereign remedy in a disorder common to the Inhabitants of the Country where found, usually termed sore eyes—frequently attended with high fever &amp; sometimes terminates in the loss of sight, always gives great pain &amp; continues for a length of time in most cases. The preparation &amp; application of the root is as follows—having procured a quantity of the roots, wash them clean &amp; suffer them to dry in the Shade, break them with the fingers as fine as you conveniently can, put them in a glass vessel, taking care to fill it about 2/3 with the Broken root, then add rain or river water until the Vessel is filled, shake it frequently &amp; it will be fit for use in the course of 6 hours. The Water must not be decanted but remaining with the root is to be frequently applied by wetting a piece of fine linnen and touching thee Eyes gently with it. This root has a fine aromatic bitter taste, it is probable that it might be applied internally in many cases with good effect, but I have not learnt. that any experiments have yet been made with it in that way. It makes an excellent mouth water &amp; is an excellent outward application in cases of wounds or local application of any kind. It is the Growth of rich bottom lands. M.

This specimen of a plant [H.] common to the praries in this quarter was presented to me by Mr. Hugh heney a gentleman of rispectability and information who has resided many years among the natives of this country from whom he obtained the knowledge of its virtues. Mr. Haney informed me that he had used the root of this plant frequently with the most happy effect in cases of the bite of the mad wolf or dog and also for the bite of the rattle snake he assured me that he had made a great number of experiments on various subjects of men horses and dogs particularly in the case of madness where the symptoms were in some instances far advanced and had never witnessed it's failing to produce the desired effect. the method of using it is by external application, to half an ounce of the root finely pulverized, add as much water as is necessary to reduce it to the consistency of a common poltice and apply it to the bitten parts, renewing the dressing once in twelve hours. in cases of the bite of the mad dog where the wound has healed before the symptoms of madness appear, the bitten part must be lacerated or sca[r]efyed before the application is made. the application had always better be made as early as possible after the injury has been sustained. I have sent herewith a few pounds of this root, in order that experiments may be made by some skillful person under the direction of the P[h]ilosophical society of Philadelphia. I have the honor to bewith much rispect, Your Ob't Servt.

      <field name="fulltext">V. Mineralogy FROM the Donation Book of the American Philosophical Society, already described under the division of Botany—p. 151, ante. The language of the original entry is apparently that of Lewis and Clark themselves. The italicized comments in brackets are doubtless by some contemporary scientist connected with the Society's museum. The letter H is, apparently, the check mark of a receiving clerk.—Ed.] M. Lewis' Donation continued 16 Nov. 1805. No. 1.Specimen of compact salt formed by concretion &amp; found adhering to the rocks, thro' which a Salt fountain Issues, situated on the South Side of the Southern Branch of the Arcansas River, called by the osage Indians Ne-chu-re-thin-gar.

This mineral was presented me by a Mr Griffith who informed me that it had been procured from an earth, found in a cave of limestone rock on the Mississipi a few miles from the entrance of the Missouri, by the same process observed in extracting saltpêtre from the earth of Caverns. [a mixture of different kinds of Salts.] 17. 18.Aug. 22 On the Upper part of the Bluff. 19. 20.Aug. 22, 1804 Is usually found incrusting or overlaying a black Rock which crowns the Summits of most of the river Hills in this quarter.

[Agatised flint &amp; small quartzose pebbles.] 27.Specimen of lead ore of Bertons mine on the Marimeg River. [Galena or sulphuret of Lead.] 28.Green Earth, Presented by Mr. Charbono, who informed me that the natives procure this earth in the neighborhood of the Rocky mountains, but cannot point out the place. The Indians mix this Earth with glue &amp; paint their arrows with it, when thus boiled with Glue it gives a fine green color to wood, but easily yields to Water the Indians also paint their skins with it. M. L. Feb'y 13, 1805 [Green Clay coloured by Iron.] 29.Specimen of the lead ore of Bertons' mine on the Marrimic River Upper Louisiana.

[Aluminous shistus in a state of decomposition.] 45.Specimen of the Earth which forms the base of the Banks of the Missouri H. [fine grey coloured sand.] 46.Found at the Burning Cliffs 23 Aug. 1804. [Pyrites.] 47.Specimen of the Earth of which the Hills of the Missouri are principally formed from the entrance of the river Sioux to fort mandan &amp; if Indian information may be depended upon, for several hundred miles further up. It is in this tract of country that the Missouri acquires it[s] coloring matter of which it abates but little to its junction to the Mississipi. This earth when saturated by the rains or melting snows becomes so soft for many feet in depth, that being unable to support its own weight, it seperates into large masses from the hills &amp; Slipping down their sides precipitates itself into the Missouri &amp; mingles with its waters— great quantities of this earth are also thrown into the river by its subsidiary Streams &amp; rivulets which pass thro' or originate in this tract of open Country. M. L. [Slate in a decomposed state.] 48.Sep. 10th. found on the side of the Bluffs not very abundant [same as 47—with streaks of green clay.] 49.Aug. 22,1804 found overlaying &amp; intermixed with the Earth which forms the bluffs of the River.

[Argill?] 53.Found at the White Clay Bluffs on S. side Missouri [Pyrites in a state of efflorescence.] (only the label) 54.from 24 Aug. to 10 Sep. 1804 Pyrites found intermixed promiscuously with the earth which form the Bluffs of the Missouri in a great variety of places. [same as 53.] 55.Incrustations of large round masses of rock which appear in a Sand bluff just above the entrance of the Cannonball river. This river derives its name from the appearance of these Stones many of them are as perfectly globular as art could form them. [Carbonate of Lime be caustious that you do not confound this with the globular Pyrites. See No. 58 below.] 56.Found on the side of the River bluffs. 22d. Aug. 1804 Irregularly intermixed with the Earth. [Pyrites.] 57.Pyrites found along the borders of the Missouri from 20 Augt to 10 Sepr, they are very common on the borders of all the little Rivulets in this open Country. [Some of these Pyrites are in a state of efflorescence.] 58.Found 23d Aug. 1804 at the base of the Bluff. [Carbonat of Lime indeterminately crystallized &amp; invested by compact carbonat of Lime.] 59.A Specimen of calcareous rock, a thin Stratum of which is found overlaying a soft Sand rock which makes its appearance in many parts of the bluffs from the entrance of the River Platte to Fort Mandon. [Mass of shells.] 60.Found on the River Bank 1 Aug. 1804 (petrified [blank space in MS.] nest.) 61. 62.Specimen of the pummice Stone found amongst the piles of drift wood on the Missouri, sometimes found as low down as the mouth of the osage river. I can hear of no burning mountain in the neighborhood of the Missouri or its Branches, but the bluffs of the River are now on fire at several places, particularly that part named in our chart of the Missouri The Burning Bluffs. The plains in many places, throughout this great extent of open country, exhibit abundant proofs of having been once on fire. Witness the Specimens of Lava and Pummice-stone found in the Hills near fort mandon. [Pumice.] 63.Specimen of a Substance extremely common &amp; found intermixed with the loose-Earth of all the Cliffs &amp; Hills from the Calumet Bluff to Fort Mandon. [crystallized Gypsum. Sulphated Li[me]] 64.Specimen of Carbonated wood with the loose sand of the sand-Bars of the Missouri &amp; Mississipi, it appears in considerable quantities in many places [carbonated wood.] 65.Specimen of stone commonly met with on the surface of the Earth thro' a great proportion of the plain open country above the River Platte. [Carbonat of Lime.] 66.Found in the Bluffs near Fort Mandan. [Petrefied wood.] 67.A Specimen of Lava &amp; pummice Stone found in great abundance on the sides of the Hills in the Neighborhood of Fort Mandan 1609 miles above the mouth of the Missouri—exposed by the washing of the Hills from the rains &amp; melting Snow. These are merely the river Hills which are the banks only of a Valley formed by the Missouri, passing thro' a level plain—from the tops of these hills the country as far as the eye can reach is a level plain. The tract of Country which furnishes the Pummice Stone seen floating down the Missouri, is rather burning or burnt plains than burning mountains. [Lavas.] 68.Brought us by one of our hunters, John Shields who found it at the Allum Bluff 22 Aug. 1804. [Pyrites on slate.]1 1 Comments by Prof. Edwin H. Barbour, curator of the geological museum, University of Nebraska: I scarcely dare guess just what is meant by some of the specimens referred to in the notes of Lewis and Clark. By "slate," to which frequent reference is made, is doubtless meant Pierre shale. By "tripoli" is probably meant volcanic ash or dust, which is very common throughout the great plains; while tripoli, or diatomaceous earth, is rather rare. No. 21 is doubtless shale of the Benton or Pierre formations. No. 24 probably refers to lignite found in the region mentioned. The white deposits spoken of at times, are probably common salt and lime sulphate, which make a white coating. [The following note is found on the back fly-leaf of Codex R, in Lewis's hand.] Sep. 20th. on the lard. shore at the commencement of the big bend observed a clift of black porus rock which resembled Lava tho' on a closer examination I believe it to be calcarious and an imperfect species of the French burr preserved a specemine, it is a brownish white, or black or yellowish brown.</field>

April 1stbut little ice, put our Boat Perog[ue]s &amp; canoes in the water. A fine refreshing shower of rain fell about 2 P. M. this was the first shower of rain that we had witnessed since the fifteenth of September 1804. tho' it several times has fallen in very small quantities, and was noticed in this diary of the weather. the cloud came from the west, and was attended by hard thunder and Lightning. I have observed that all thunder clouds in the Western part of the continent, proceed from the westerly quarter, as they do in the Atlantic States. the air is remarkably dry and pure in this open country, very little rain or snow e[i] ther winter or summer. the atmosphere is more transparent than I ever obse[r]ved it in any country through which I have passed. 2nd.rained hard and without intermission last night. 3rd.a white frost, Some ice attached to the edges of the water 4th.Observed a flock of brant passing up the river today, the wind blew very ha[r]d as it dose frequently in this quarter; there is scarcely any timber to brake the wind from the river, &amp; the country on both sides being level plains, wholy destitute of timber, the wind blows with astonishing violence. in this open country the winds form a great obstruction to the navigation of this river particularly with small vessels, which can neither ascend or decend should the wind be the least violent. 6th.This day a flock of cherry or cedar birds were seen, one of the men killed several of them which gave me an opportunity of examining them. they are common in the United States; usually ascociate in large flocks and are freequently distructive to the chery orchards, and in winter in the lower parts of the states of Virginia &amp; Maryland feed on the buries of the Cedar. they are a small bluish brown bird, crested with a tuft of dark brown feathers. with a narrow black stripe passing on each side of the head underneath the eye from the base of the upper beak to the back of the head. it is distinguished more particularly by some of the shorter feathers of the wing, which are tiped with a red spots that have much the appearance at a little distance of sealing wax. All the birds that we believe visit this country have now returned. 7th.wind very high. Set out on our voyage at 5 P. M. 8th.the Kildee, and large Hawk have returned. the only birds that I obse[r]ved during the winter at Fort Mandan was the Missouri Magpie, a bird of the Corvus genus, the raven in immence numbers, the small woodpecker or sapsucker as they are sometimes called, the beautifull eagle, or calumet bird, so called from the circumstance of the natives decorating their pipe-stems with it's plumage, and the Prairie Hen or grouse. 9th.the Crow has also returned saw the first today. the Musquitoes revisit us, saw several of them. Capt. Clark brought me a flower in full blo. it is a stranger to me. 10th.The Prarie lark, bald Eagle, &amp; the large plover have returned. the grass begins to spring, and the leaf buds of the willow to appear.

Remarks for January, 1806.2 2 The following remarks are compiled from those found in the column of "Remarks," and the notes following in In Lewis's Codex J, pp. 150–152; and Clark's Codex I, pp. 31–33. Notes on events described in text of journals are here omitted.—Ed. 1st.sun visible for a few minutes about 11 A M. the changes of the weather are exceedingly sudden, sometimes tho' seldom the sun is visible for a few moments the next it hails &amp; rains, then ceases, and remains cloudy the wind blows and it again rains; the wind blows by squalls most generally and is almost invariably from S.W. these visicitudes of the weather happen two three or more times a day. snake seen 25th. December 3d.the sun visible for a few minutes only. The thunder and lightning of the last evening was violent. a singular occurrence for the time of year. the loss of my thermometer I most sincerely regret. I am confident that the climate here is much warmer than in the same parallel of Latitude on the Atlantic Ocean tho' how many degrees is now out of my power to determine. since our arrival in this neighbourhood on the 7th. of November, we have experienced one slight white frost only which happened on the morning of the 16th. of that month. we have yet seen no ice, and the weather so warm that we are obliged to cure our meat with smoke and fire to save it. we lost two parsels by depending on the air to preserve it, tho′ it was cut in very thin slices and sufficiently exposed to the air. 4th.the sun visible about 2 hours 6th.the sun shown about 5 hours this evening &amp; it continued fair during the night. 7th.it clouded up just about sunset, but shortly after became fair. 8th.lost my P. M. obsn. for Equal Altitudes. 9th.began to rain at 10 P. M. and continued all night. 10th.Various flies and insects now alive and in motion. 12th.the wind from any quarter off the land or along the N.W. Coast causes the air to become much cooler. every species of waterfowl common to this country at any season of the year still continue with us. cool this morning but no ice nor frost at miday sand flies and insects in motion. 14th.weather perfectly temperate, I never experienced a winter so warm as the present has been. 15th.saw several insects, weather warm, we could do very well without fire. I am satisfied that the murcury would stand at 55 a. o. 16th.wind hard this morning rained incessently all night. 17th.rained incessantly all night, insects in motion. 18th.rained very hard last night. 19th.rained the greater part of last night. 20th.raind greater part of night wind hard. 21st.wind hard this morning cont[in]ued all day. 22nd.wind violent last night &amp; this morning. 23d.the sun shown about 2 h. in the forenoon. when the sun is said to shine or the weather fair it is to be understood that it barely casts a shaddow, and that the atmosphere is haizy of a milkey white colour. 24th.this morning the Snow covered the ground and was cooler than any weather we have had but no ice. 25ththe ground covered with snow this morning 1/2 inch deep ice on the water in the canoes 1/4 of an inch thick. it is now preceptably coulder than it has been this winter. 26th.the snow this evening is 4 3/4 inches deep, the icesickles of 18 inches in length continued suspended from the eves of the houses during the day. it now appears something like winter for the first time this season. 27th.the sun shone more bright this morning than it has done since our arrival at this place. the snow since 4. P. M. yesterday has increased to the debth of 6 Inches. and this morning is perceptibly the couldest that we have had. I suspect the Murcury would stand at about 20°. above naught; the breath is perceptible in our room by the fire. 28th.last night exposed a vessel of water to the air with a view to discover the debth to which it would freiz in the course of the night, but unfortunately the vessel was only 2 inches deep and it f[r]eized the whole thickness; how much more it might have frozen had the vessel been deeper is therefore out of my power to decide. it is the couldest night that we have had, and I suppose the murcury this morning would have stood as low as 15°. above 0. 29th.not so could, water in a vessel exposed to the [air] during the night freized 3/8ths. of an inch only.1 1 We infer that this note was intended for January 29; but it may have been written for the preceding day.—Ed. 30ththe weather by no means as could as it has been snow fell about an inch deep. 31st.this morning is pleasant, the night was clear and cold. notwithstanding the could weather the Swan white Brant geese &amp; ducks still continue with us; the sandhill crain also continues. the brown or speckled brant are mostly gone some few are still to be seen the Cormorant loon and a variety of other waterfowls still remain. The Winds from the Land brings us could and clear weather while those obliquely along either coast or off the Ocean bring us warm damp cloudy and rainy weather. the hardest winds are always from the S.W. The blue crested Corvus bird has already began to build it's nest. their nests are formed of small sticks; usually in a pine tree. Great numbers of Ravens, and a small black Crow are continually about us. The pale yellow Streiked and dove coloured robin is about, also the little brown ren or fly-catsch which is a little larger than the humming bird.

Remarks for February, 1806.2 2 The following remarks are combined from the column of remarks in the preceding table, and those succeeding in Lewis's Codex J, pp. 148, 149, and the last pages of Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 2.—Ed. 1st.the weather by no means as cold as it was tho' it freized last night. 2nd.the bald Eagle still remains. 3d.the snow fell about half an inch, but the rain which succeded soon melted it at 9 A. M. the sun shone. the rain which fell in the latter part of the night freized and formed a slight incrustation on the snow which fell some days past, and also on the boughs of the trees &amp;c. yesterday it continued fair until 11. A.M. when the wind vered about to S.W. and the horizon was immediately overcast with clouds, which uniformly takes place when the wind is from that point. 4th.the last night clear and cold the Netul frozen over in several places. All the waterfowls before innumerated still continue with us. the bird which resembles the robbin have now visited us in small numbers saw two of them yesterday about the fort; they are gentle. 6th.very cold last night think it reather the coldest night that we have had. cloudy at 9 A. M. 7th.continued cloudy all night a little snow at 10 A. M. 8th.it was principally rain which fell since 4 P. M yesterday and has melted down the snow w[h]ich has continued to cover the ground since the 24th. of January; the feeling of the air and other appearances seem to indicate, that the rigor of the winter is passed; it is so warm that we are apprehensive that our meat will spoil, we therefore cut it in small peices and hang it seperately on sticks. Saw a number of insects flying about. the small brown flycatch continues with us. this is the smallest of all the American birds except the humming bird. 9th.principally rain which has fallen. 10th.snow covered the ground this morning disappeared before evening. sun shown 2 hours. 12thit rained the greater part of last night 13th.Wind very hard last evening and all night. 14th.very small quantity of snow fell last night not enough to cover the ground somewhat colder this morning. the sun shown only a few moments. 15th.fair most of last night hard frost this morning. the ground white with it. The robbin returned and were singing which reminded me of spring. some other small birds passed on their flight from the South, but were so high that we could not distinguish of what kind they were. the robbin had left this place before our arrival in November. 16th.but a small quantity of snow nearly all disolved by morning with the succeeding rain. at 11. A.M. it became fair and the insects were flying about. at 1/2 after 12. O′Ck. it again clouded up and began to rain. 17th.the hail and snow covered the ground this morning. 18th.wind violent greater part of the day and all night. 19th.wind violent all day. 20th.wind violent all night and the greater part of the day. 21st.the wind continues high this morning &amp; untill evening. 22nd.the wind scarcely perceptable 23d.heavy white frost this morning. at eleven A. M. it c[l]ouded up and continued so all day. 24th.much warmer this morning than usual. the aquatic and other birds heretofore enumerated continue with us still. the Sturgeon and a small fish like the Anchovey begin to run. they are taken in the Columbia about 30 or 40 mils. above us. the anchovey is exquisitely fine. the wind became hard this evening. 25th.the wind violent all night and this morning continued untill late in the evening when it c[e]ased. 26th.at 9 A.M. it clouded up again. 28th.it rained constantly during the last night. the sun shown about 9 A. M. partially a few minutes. saw a variety of insects in motion this morning some small bugs as well as flies. a brown fly with long legs about half the size of the common house fly was the most common. this has been the first insect that appeared. it is genrally about the sinks, or filth of any kind. the yellow and brown flycatch has returned. it is a very small bird with a tail as long proportiably as a Sparrow.

Remarks for March 1806.1 1 The following remarks are found in Lewis's Codex J, pp. 145–149, and in Clark-Voorhis note-book No. 2.—Ed. 1st.a great part of this day was so warm that fire was unnecessary, notwithstanding it's being cloudy and raining. The clouds interfered in such manner that no observations could be made this morning. 3d.rained and the wind blew hard all night. air perfectly temperate. 4th.rained constantly most of the night, saw a Snail this morning, they are very large. 5th.the air is considerably colder this morning but nothing like freizing. 6th.altho' it is stated to be fair this morning the sun is so dim that no observations can be made. Saw a spider and an insect resembling a Musquetoe this morning, tho' the air is perceptably colder than it has been since the 1st. inst. at 9 A.M. it clouded up and continued so the ballance of the day. even the Easterly winds which have heretofore given us the only fair weather which we have enjoyed, seem now to have lost their influence in this respect. 7th.Sudden changes &amp; frequent, during the day, scarcly any two hours of the same discription. the Elk now begin to shed their horns. a bird of a scarlet colour as large as a common pheasant with a long tail has returned, one of them was seen today near the fort by Capt. Clark's black man, I could not obtain a view of it myself. 8th.the ground covered with hail and snow this morning, air cool but not freezing. 9th.snow and hail i inch deep this morning air still cold more so than yesterday but not freezing. 10th.snow nearly disappeared by this morning. the air considerably warmer. 11th.snow 1 inch deep this morning air cold, but no ice. some insects seen in the evening in motion. I attem[p]ted to make an observation for Equal Altitudes but the P.M. Obserth. was lost in consequence of clouds. it became cloudy at 10 A.M. and rained attended with some hail at six it P.M. it became fair and the wind changing to N. E. it continued fair during the night. the snow had all disappeared by 4. P.M. this evening. 12th.white frost this morning and ice in the pools of standing water. it being fair in the morning I again attempted Equal Altitudes but it became cloudy at 3. P.M. and continued so during the day, without any rain 13th.slight frost this morning a little rain fell in the latter part of the night. saw a number of insects in motion; among others I saw for the fi[r]st time this spring and winter a downey black fly about the size of the common house fly. the plants begin to appear above the ground, among others the rush of which the natives eat the root. and the plant, the root of which resembles in flavor the sweet potato also eaten by the natives. it is small. 14thyesterday and last night were the most perfectly fair wether we have seen at this place. 15th.the temperature of the air is perfectly pleasant without fire. became fair at 8 A. M. the sorrel with an oval obtuse and ternate leaf has now put forth it's leaves. some of them have nearly obtained their growth already.1 1 Oxaliu oregana Nutt.—C. V. Piper. the birds were singing very agreably this morning particularly the common robin. 16th.wind hard greater part of the day. The Anchovey has ceased to run; the white salmon trout have succeeded them. the weather so warm that the insects of various speceis are every day in motion. 17th.rained all night. air somewhat colder this morning. frequent and sudden changes in the course of the day. 18th.frequent showers through the day. 19th.frequent and sudden changes during the day wind not so hard as usual. 20thrained all day without intermission. 21strained all night at 9 A. M. wind changed to N. E. and the rain ceased. cloudy the ballance of the day. 22nd.rain continued without intermission greater part of the night. air temperate. the leaves and petals of the flowers of the green Huckleburry have appeared. some of the leaves have already obtained 1/4 of their size.2 2 This is probably the huckleberry known as Vaccinium parvifolia.—C. V. Piper. 23d.it became fair at 12 OCk. and continued cloudy and fair by intervales without rain till night. 24th.at 9 A.M. it became fair and continued fair all day and greater part of the night. the brown bryery shrub with a broad pinnate leaf has began to put fourth it's leaves.3 3 Probably this is Fatsia horrida.—C. V. Piper. the polecat Colwort, is in blume. Saw the blue crested fisher. birds are singing this morning. the black Alder is in blume. 25th.cold this morning but no ice nor frost. the Elder, Gooseberry, &amp; Honeysuckle are now putting forth their leaves. the nettle4 4 The nettle is Urtica lyallii Wats.—C. V. Piper. and a variety of other plants are now springing up. the flower of the broad leafed thorn is nearly blown. several small plants in blume. 26th.cold and rainy last night. wind hard this morning fair at 9 A.M. cloudy at 1 P.M. The humming bird has appeared. killed one of them and found it the same with those common to the United States. 27th.blew hard about noon. rained greater part of the day. the small or bank martin appeared today, saw one large flock of them. waterfowl very scarce, a few Comorant, geese, and the redheaded fishing duck are all that are to be seen. the red flowering currant are in blume, this I take to be the same speceis I first saw in the Rocky Mountains; the fruit is a deep purple berry covered with a gummy substance and not agreeably flavored. there is another speceis uncovered with gum which I first found on the waters of the Columbia about the 12th. of August last.1 1 The red-flowering currant is Ribes sanguineum. The Rocky Mountain species referred to is Ribes Viscossissimum, similar in foliage but not in flowers. Lewis brought back types of both.—C. V. Piper. 28thrained by showers greater part of last night frequent showers in the course of the day. this evening we saw many swan passing to the North as if on a long flight. vegitation is not by several days as forward here as at Fort Clatsop when we left that place. the river rising fast, the water is turbid; the tide only swells the water a little, it dose not stop the current. it is now within 2 feet of it's greatest hight, which appears to increase as we assend. 29thfrequent showers through the night. very cold this morning. 30th.at 10 A. M. it became fair and continued so weather moderately warm. Saw a leather winged bat. the grass is about 16 Inches high in the river bottoms. the frogs are now abundant and are crying in the swamps and marshes. 31st.The Summer Duck has returned. I saw several to day in a small pond. This evening the Musqueters were verry troublesom this evening, it is the first time they have been so this spring. The waterfowls are much plentyer about the enterance of quick sand river than they were below. observed a species of small wild onion growing among the moss of the rocks, they resemble the Shives of our gardens and grow remarkably close together forming a perfect tuft, they are quite as agreeably flavoured as the shives.

From the best opinion I could form of the state of the Columbia on the 1st of April it was about 9 feet higher than when we decended it in the begining of November last. the rising and falling of the river as set down in the diary is that only which took place from sunseting to sunrise or thereabouts it being the time that we usually remain at our encampments. 2nd.heavy dew last night. cloudy all night. 3d.a slight rain about day light this morning. 4th.the rains have been very slight. 5th.rain but slight, air colder than usual this morning. 6th.this is the most perfectly fair day that we have seen for a Some time musquetoes trouble some this evening in the bottoms the cottonwood has put forth its leaves and begin[s] to assume a green appearance at a distance. the sweet willow has not yet generally birst its budscales while the leaves of the red and broad leafed willow are of some size; it appears to me to be the most backward in vegetating of all the willows. the narrow leafed willow is not found below tide water on this river. 7th.the air temperate, birds singing, the pizmire, flies, beetles, in motion. 8th.wind commenced at 5 A. M. &amp; continued to blow most violently all day air temperate. the male flowers of the cottonwood are falling. the goosburry has cast the petals of it's flowers, and it's leaves obtained their full size. the Elder which is remarkably large has began to blume. some of it's flowerets have expanded their corollas. the serviceburries, chokecherries, the growth which resembles the beach, the small birch and grey willow have put forth their leaves.1 1 Most of these plants have been identified in the text of journals. The small birch is not the species mentioned April 30, 1806, but Betula glandulosa Mx.—C. V. Piper. 9th.the wind lulled a little before day, and became high at 11 A. M. continued till dark. the vineing honeysuckle, has put forth shoots of several inches the dogtoothed violet is in blume as is also both the speceis of the mountain holley, the strawburry, the bears claw, the cowslip, the violet, common striped; and the wild cress or tongue grass.2 2 The honeysuckle, dogtooth violet, mountain holly, and strawberry have been identified in text of journals. The "bear's claw" is some species of Delphiniums the cowslip, Dadecaltheon sp.; the violet is probably Viola sp.; and the cress or tongue grass, Cardamine sp.—C. V. Piper. 10th.some snow fell on the river hills last night. morning cold, slight showers through the day. 11th.cold raining night the geese are yet in large flocks and do not yet appear to have mated. what I have heretofore termed the broad leafed ash is now in blume. the fringe tree has cast the corolla and it's leaves have nearly obtained their full size.3 3 The "fringe-tree" is probably Nuttallia cerasi formis.—C. V. Piper. the sacacommis is in blume. 12th.cold snowed on the mountains through which the river passes at the rapids. the duckinmallard which bread in this neighbourhood, is now laying it's eggs,—vegetation is rapidly progressing in the bottoms tho' the snow of yesterday and to day reaches within a mile of the base of the mountains at the rapids of the Columbia. 13th.cold rainy night. rained by showers through the day. wind hard. 14th.wind arrose at 8 A.M. and continued hard all day service berries in blume. 15th.wind blew tolerably hard to day after 10 A.M. observed the Curloo and prairie lark. 16th.morning unusually warm. vegitation rapidly progressing. at the rock fort camp saw the prarie lark, a species of the peawee, the blue crested fisher, the partycoloured corvus, and the black pheasant. a species of hiasinth native of this place blumed to day, it was not in blume yesterday. 17th.weather warm; the sweet willow &amp; white oak begin to put forth their leaves. 18th.rain but slight. wind very hard all day. 19th.raind. moderate showers, very cold snow on the tops of the low hills. 20th.weather cold rain slight snow on the hills adjacent wind violent. some frost this morning. 21st.heavy white frost this morning. remarkably cold last night. 22nd.night cold the day warm. 26th.the last evening was cloudy it continued to threaten rain all night but without raining. the wind blew hard all night. the air cold as it is invariably when it sets from the westerly quarter. the sweet willow has put forth its leaves. 27th.had a shower of rain last night. 30th.rain slight.

W. the natives also inform us that the salmon appear many days sooner in Lewis's river above the entrance of the Kooskooseke than they do in that stream. 15th.the Kooskooske rising fast, the water is clear and cold. 16th.last night was uncommonly warm river rising fast. say 9 Inches. 17th.rained hard the greater part of the night wet the Chronometer by accedent. river rise 11 inches the indians caught 3 salmon at their village on the Kooskooske above our camp some miles. they say that these fish are now passing by us in great numbers but that they cannot be caught as yet because those which first ascend the river do not keep near shore; they further inform us that in the course of a few days the fish run near the shore and then they take them with their skimming netts in great numbers.1 1 This information in regard to the salmon is not found in text of journal and seems somewhat inconsistent therewith. See text of journal for May 14, 18, 22, 25, 26, and June 2 and 3.—Ed. rained untill 12 Ock. by intervails. 19th.rained hard last night and untill 8 A. M. 20th.rained violently the greater part of the night. air raw and cold. a nest of the large blue or sand hill crain was found by one of our hunters. the young were in the act of leaving the shell. the young of the partycoloured corvus begin to fly. 22nd.air colder this morning than usual white frost tho' no ice. the air is remarkably dry and pure it has much the feeling and appearance of the air in the plains of the Missouri. since our arrival in this neighbourhood on the 7th. inst. all the rains noted in the diary of the weather were snows on the plain and in some instances it snowed on the plains when only a small mist was perseptable in the bottoms at our camps. (The high plains are about 800 feet higher than the small bottoms on the river and creeks.) 23d.the air is cold in the morning but warm through the day. some dew each morning. 24th.air remarkably pleasant all day. 25th.rained moderately the greater part of last night and to day nearly all day. Thunder. 26th.the sun shone warm today, but the air was kept cool by the N. W. breezes. 27th.the dove is cooing which is the signal as the indians inform us of the approach of the salmon. The snow has disappeared on the high plains and seems to be diminishing fast on the spurs and lower region of the Rocky Mountains. 28th.had several heavy thunder showers in the course of the last evening and night. the river from sunrise yesterday to sun rise this morning raised 1 ft. 10 Incs. d[r]ift wood runing in considerable quantities and current incredibly swift tho' smooth. 29th.frequent and heavy showers attended by distant thunder through the night. the river raised 6 inches in the course of yesterday and 1 foot 5 I. in the course of the last night. it is now as high as there are any marks of it's having been in the spring 1805. at 10 A.M. it arrived at it's greatest hight having raised 1 1/2 inches from sunrise to that time. in the ballance of the day it fell 7 inches. the natives inform us that it will take one more rise before it begins finally to subside for the season and then the passage of the mountains will be practicable. 30th.rain slight last night. the river continued to fall untill 4 A.M. having fallen 3 Inches by that time since sunrise. it now was at a stand untill dark after which it began again to rise. 31st.within 3 Inches of its greatest hight on the 29th. inst. and fell a little after which it rose again.

Remarks far June, l806.1 1 The following remarks are found in Lewis's Codex L, pp. 148, 149; and in Clark's Codex M, pp. 150–152. References to events mentioned in text of journal are here omitted.—Ed. 1st.about dark last evening had a slight rain from a heavy thunder cloud which passed to the E. &amp; N. E. of us. 2nd.have slept comfortably for several nights under one blankett only. The river from sunrise untill 10 A. M. yesterday raised 1 1/2 inches; from that time untill dark fell 4 1/2, and in the course of the last night raised again 8 Inches as stated in the diary. the Indians inform us that the present rise of the river is the greatest which it annually takes, and that when the water now subsides to about the hight it was when we arrived here the mountains will be passable. I have no doubt but that the melting of the mountain snows in the begining of June is what causes the annual inundation of the lower portion of the Missouri from the Ist. to the Middle of July. 3d.The weather has been much warmer for five days past than previously, particularly the mornings and nights. 4th.rained greater part of last night but fell in no great quantity. yesterday the water was at it's greatest hight at noon, between which and dark it fell 15 inches and in the course of the night raised 1 1/2 inches as stated in the diary. from the indian information the river will now subside and may therefore be said to have been at it's greatest annual hight on the 3rd. inst. at noon. 5th.last night was colder than usual but no frost. the river fell 3 1/2 inches in the course of the day and raised 4 I. last night as [s]tated in the diary. this fluctuating state of the river no doubt is caused by the influence of the sun in the course of the day on the snows of the mountains; the accession of water thus caused in the day does not reach us untill night when it produces a rise in the river. The wild rose is in blume.2 2 Rasa nutkana.—C. V. Piper. the river fell 10 Ins. in the course of this day. 6th.in the course of the last night the river raised a little but fell by morning 1 inch lower than what it stood at last evening. the seven bark and the yellow vining honeysuckle are just in blume. a few of the does have produced their young. strawberries ripe near the river. hot sultery day. 7th.rain but slight both last evening and today. but little hail tho' large. The river fell three inches last night and 7 yesterday. The goose berries fully grown also the servis berry. 8th.river fell 8 in. in the course of yesterday. 7 last night [as entered in the diary]. 9th.river fell 9 In. yesterday 10th.river fell 5 1/2 in. in course of yesterday. having left the river today I could not longer keep it's state; it appears to be falling fast and will probably in the course of a few days be as low as when we first arrived there. it is now about 6 feet lower than it has been. 12th.slight sprinkle of rain in the fore part of the night. 13th.The days for several past have been warm, the Musquetoes troublesome. 15th.it began to rain at 7 A. M. and continued by showers untill 5 P. M. 16th.on the tops of the hills the dog tooth violet is just in bloom, grass about 2 inches high, small Huckleberry just putting fourth it's leaves &amp;c.1 1 This species of huckleberry is Vaccinium caespitosum.—C.

Strawberries ripe at the Quawmash flats, they are but small and not abundant. 23d.hard frost this morning ice one eighth of an inch thick on standing water. 25th.rained a little last night; some showers in the evening. 26th.Slight rain in the fore part of last evening in the snowey region. 27th.Thunder shower last evening some rain a little before dark last evening. 28th.nights are cool in these mountains but no frost. 29th.night cold hard frost this morning. the quawmash and Strawberries are just begining to blume at the flatts on the head of the Kooskooske. The sun flower also just beginning to blume, which is 2 months later than those on the Sides of the Western Mountains near the falls of Columbia.2 2 The sunflower is Balsamorrhiza sagittata Nutt., of which Lewis brought back types that were collected, however, at another date and place.—C. V. Piper. 30th.night cold hard frost this morning. We are here Situated on Clarks river in a Vally between two high mountains of Snow.3 3 A long note by Clark following the remarks for June, 1806, in reference to crossing the mountains is transferred to text of the journal, vol. v, p. 175.—Ed.

      <field name="fulltext">VII. Astronomy THE following description of the astronomical instruments employed by Lewis and Clark is found in Codex O, pp. 1–6, in Lewis's handwriting. Codex O was used wholly for Astronomical Observations and Geographical Notes (including Lewis's Summary Statement, pp. 29–55, ante).—Ed.] Camp 10 miles above the mouth of the river Platte. July 22ed. 1804. A summary discription of the apparatus employed in the following observations; containing also some remarks on the manner in which they have been employed, and the method observed in recording the observations made with them. 1st.a brass Sextant of 10 Inches radius, graduated to 15′. which by the assistance of the nonius was devisible to 15″., and half of this sum by means of the micrometer could readily be distinguished, therefore 7″.5 of an angle was perceptible with this instrument: she was also furnished with three eye-pieces, consisting of a hollow tube and two telescopes one of which last reversed the images of observed objects. finding on experiment that the reversing telescope when employed as the eye-piece gave me a more full and perfect image than either of the others, I have most generally imployed it in all the observations made with this instrument; when thus prepared I found from a series of observations that the quantity of her index error was 8′.45—; this sum is therefore to be considered as the standing error of the instrument unless otherwise expressly mentioned. the altitudes of all objects, observed as well with this instrument as with the Octant were by means of a reflecting surface; and those stated to have been taken with the sextant are the degrees, minutes, &amp;c. shewn by the graduated limb of the instrument at the time of observation and are of course the double altitudes of the objects observed. 2ed.A common Octant of 14 Inches radius, graduated to 20′., which by means of the nonius was devisible to one 1′., half of this sum, or 30″. was perceptible by means of a micrometer. this instrument was prepared for both the fore and back observation; her error in the fore observation is 2°.+, &amp;. and in the back observation 2°. 11′. 40″.3.+ at the time of our departure from the River Dubois untill the present moment, the sun's altitude at noon has been too great to be reached with my sextant, for this purpose I have therefore employed the Octant by the back observation. the degrees ′. &amp; ″., recorded for the sun's altitude by the back observation express only the angle given by the graduated limb of the instrument at the time of observation, and are the complyment of the double Altitude of the sun's observed limb; if therefore the angle recorded be taken from 180°. the remainder will be the double altitude of the observed object, or that which would be given by the fore observation with a reflecting surface. 3rd.An Artificial Horizon on the construction recommended and practiced by Mr. Andrw. Ellicott of Lancaster, Pensyla., in which water is used as the reflecting surface; believing this artificial Horizon liable to less error than any other in my possession, I have uniformly used it when the object observed was sufficiently bright to reflect a distinct immage; but as much light is lost by reflection from water I found it inconvenient in most cases to take the altitude of the moon with this horizon, and that of a star impracticable with any degree of accuracy. 4th.An Artificial Horizon constructed in the manner recommended by Mr. Patterson of Philadelphia; glass is here used as the reflecting surface. this horizon consists of a glass plane with a single reflecting surface, cemented to the flat side of the larger segment of a wooden ball; adjusted by means of a sperit-level and a triangular stand with a triangular mortice cut through it's center sufficiently large to admit of the wooden ball partially; the stand rests on three screws inserted near it's angles, which serve as feet for it to rest on while they assist also in the adjustment. this horizon I have employed in taking the altitude of the sun when his image has been reather too dull for a perfect reflection from water; I have used it generally in taking the altitude of the moon, and in some cases of the stars also; it gives the moon's image very perfectly, and when carefully adjusted I consider it as liable to but little error. 5th.An Artificial Horizon formed of the index specula of a Sextant cemented to a flat board; adjusted by means of a sperit level and the triangular stand before discribed. as this glass reflects from both surfaces it gives the images of all objects much more bright than either of the other horizons; I have therefore most generally employed it in observing the altitudes of stars. 6th.A Chronometer; her ballance-wheel and scapement were on the most improved construction. she rested on her back, in a small case prepared for her, suspended by an universal joint, she was carefully wound up every day at twelve oclock. Her rate of going as asscertained by a series of observations made by myself for that purpose was found to be 15. Seconds and 5 tenths of a second too slow in twenty four howers on Mean Solar time. This is nearly the same result as that found by Mr. Andrew Ellicott who was so obliging as to examine her rate of going for the space of fourteen days, in the summer 1803. her rate of going as ascertained by that gentleman was 155.6 too slow M. T. in 24. h. and that she went from 3 to 4. s. slower the last 12 h, than she did the first 12. h. after being wound up. at 12. OCk. on the 14th. day of May 1804. (being the day on which the detatchment left the mouth of the River Dubois) the Chronometer was too fast M. T. 6 m. 32. s. &amp; 2/10 This time piece was regulated on mean time, and the time entered in the following observations is that shewn by her at the place of observation. the day is recconed on Civil time, (i e) commencing at midnight. 7th.A Circumferentor, circle 6 Inches diameter, on the common construction; by means of this instrument adjusted with the sperit level, I have taken the magnetic azimuth of the sun and pole Star. It has also been employed in taking the traverse of the river:—from the courses thus obtained, together with the distances estimated from point to point, the chart of the Missouri has been formed which now accompanys these observations. the several points of observation are marked with a cross of red ink, and numbered in such manner as to correspond with the celestial observations made at those points respectively. RECORDS OF OBSERVATIONS [The following records of observations from the beginning of the expedition to the close of the winter of 1804–05 were entered by Lewis in Codex O, pp. 6–52. Many of them were copied into the text of the journals proper; where thus entered, the entry here is omitted, reference being made to the given date. Occasionally, in the text of the journals, results are given which are not presented here; they have, in such cases, been transferred, and are marked [*]. An occasional difference in copying a series of figures has not been editorially noted.—Ed.] The mouth of the River Dubois opposite to the mouth of the Missouri River is situated in Longitude West from Grenwh. 89°. 57′. 45″ Latitude N. . . . . . . 38°. 55′. 19″. 6 Note—The Longitude of the mouth of the River Dubois was calculated from four sets of observations of the ? &amp; D, in which the ? was twice West, and twice East; two sets with Aldebaran, * East in one, and W. in the other; and one set with Spica, R., * East, the Longtd. above stated is the mean result of those observations, and I think may with safety be depended on to two or three minutes of a degree. The Chronometer's error on M. T. was found at the mouth of the Ohio by 3 sets of Equal Altitudes, and the Longtd. of the mouth of the River Dubois as given by this instrument from Equal altitudes of the ? on the 17th of December 1803, was 90°. 00′. 20″. West from Grenwh. making a difference from the Longitude calculated from observation of 2′.35″. The Latitude is deduced from a number of Meridian altitudes of the ? taken with the sextant and artificial horizon, the results of which observations seldom differed more than from 15 to 20″.; I therefore believe that the Latitude above stated may be depended on as true to 100 hundred paces. The mouth of the River Dubois is to be considered as the point of departure. St. Charles. May 18th. 1804 (Point of Observation No. 1.)

Latitude deduced from this observatn. 40°. 8′. 31″. 8— This evening I discovered that my Chronometer had stoped, nor can I assign any cause for this accedent; she had been wound up the preceding noon as usual. This is the third instance in which this instrument has stopt in a similar manner since she has been in my possession, tho' the fi [r] st only since our departure from the River Dubois. in the two preceding cases when she was again set in motion, and her rate of going determined by a series of equal altitudes of the ? taken for that purpose, it was found to be the same precisely as that mentioned in the preliminary remarks to these observations, or 15. s. &amp; 5 tenths too slow in 24.h.—as her rate of going after stoping, and being again set in motion has in two instances proved to be the same, I have concluded, that whatever this impediment may proceed from, it is not caused by any material injury which her works have sustained, and that when she is in motion, her error on mean time above stated, may be depended on as accurate. In consequence of the chronometer's having thus accedentally stoped, I determined to come too at the first convenient place and make such observations as were necessary to ascertain her error, establish the Latitude &amp; Longitude, and determine the variation of the nedle, in order to fix a second point of departure. accordingly on Monday 16th. we set out at an early hour; the morning was cloudy; could find no convenient situation for observation; proceeded untill a little before noon when we came too Point of observation No. 21.

The river being very low and the season so far advanced that it frequently shuts up with ice in this climate we determined to spend the Winter in this neighbourhood, accordingly Capt.

Thursday November 1st. 1804. The wind blew so violently during the greater part of this day that we were unable to quit our encampment; in the evening it abated; we droped down about seven miles and land on N.

I had no other glass to assist me in this observation but a small refracting telescope belonging to my sextant, which however was of considerable service, as it enabled me to define the edge of the moon's immage with much more precision than I could have done with the natural eye. The commencement of the eclips was obscured by clouds, which continued to interrupt me throughout the whole observation; to this cause is also attributable the inacuracy of the observation of the commencement of total darkness. I do not put much confidence in the observation of the middle of the Eclips, as it is the wo[r]st point of the eclips to distinguish with accuracy. The two last observations (i.e.) the end of total darkness and the end of the eclips, were more satisfactory; they are as accurate as the circumstances under which I laboured would permit me to make them.— h m s Commencement of total darkness 12. 28. 5.

Misselanious Notes Given by a Trader. This Saline he visited last Winter, when he observed its Situation Particularly as also eve[r]y Circumstance in relation to its Peculiarities. It is Situated on the east Side of the first of what are usually called the three forks of the Arcansas river1 1 East of the Neosho River, which with the Verdigris fells into the Arkansas near Fort Gibson, Indian Territory.—Ed. within a quarter of a league of that Stream. This Junction called the three forks of the Arcansas is estimated is at two hundred and forty leagues from its Junction of the Mississippi. At the mouth of the small stream which discharges itself from this saline their is a thick Wood which Continues on both Sides of the Same Within a small distance of the Saline Near this place are several remarkable Salines One of Which in Particular contains about 4 acres it contains a Variety of Springs which boil from the ground and hence they have obtained amoung the Indians [the name of] the Pots so strong is the water that the Salt concretes as it comes from the ground and forms a kind of rim around the edges Great Saline to the westward of the main branch of the Arkansaw.

This post was established by la Vérendrye in October, 1738, at the place now known as Portage la Prairie; in 1796 the Hudson Bay Co. built a fort near its site. At the mouth of Souris (Mouse) River was Assiniboin House, erected by the Northwest Company in 1795; and not far from it was Brandon House, built by the Hudson's Bay Company in the preceding year, about 17 miles below the present city of Brandon, Man. "Catapie" is probably a blunder for Qu'Appelle River. Farther up the Assiniboin River, not far from a bend in Swan River, was the noted Fort Pelly, a post of the Hudson's Bay Co. It is impossible to identify all the localities here named, or Clark's distances.—Ed. (La prairie) 20 from red river 2. Mouse River fort 58 d° 38 3. Hump Mountain fort 83 d° 25 4.

The muddyness of the Missoury is caused by the washing in of its banks—within the rocky mountains the water is Clear.

The Country from the Mississippi to the River platt—630 miles furnishes a sufficient qty of wood for Settlements—above that River the Country becomes more open, and wood principally confined to river &amp; Creek bottoms. the uplands furtile and open, with some exceptions on the Rockejhone R. Capt. Clark saw some Pine Country. and the ranges of low Black Mountains are covered with wood. most of the large Rivers fall in on the south side of the Missouri.
