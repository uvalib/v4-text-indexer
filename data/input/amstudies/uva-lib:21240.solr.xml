      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION THE remarkable series of charts given in this volume illustrate in detail almost the entire route of the Lewis and Clark expedition, both on the outward and the return journeys, with sites of camping-places and Indian villages, and further enriched with much interesting comment on the country and the natives. An account of their discovery will be found in the Introduction to Vol. I of the present series, pp. l–liii. Save for Nos. 1–3, which are copies of contemporary French and Spanish manuscript maps, and doubtless were carried upon the expedition, several traced from rude Indian drawings, and No. 37, which bears Lewis's chirography, all appear to have been the work of Clark, who was the recognized draughtsman of the party. When we consider the conditions under which these charts were drawn,—in the field, with crude astronomical instruments, and information derivable chiefly from daily observation and Indian reports,—their relative accuracy and topographical comprehension are worthy of our highest praise; they are eloquent witnesses of Clark's undoubted engineering skill. The charts fall readily into certain groups: I.A preliminary series (Nos. 1–3) being tracings of contemporary French and Spanish manuscripts. In this series we may also include No. 4, showing the neighborhood of the first winter's camp in Illinois, at River Dubois, opposite the mouth of the Missouri. II.But one map (No. 5) appears to be extant, of the lower Missouri—that for the stretch above St. Charles, across a large portion of the present State of Missouri. Others are missing either by accident or because this portion of the river was well known to French and Spanish fur-traders, who even thus early made annual voyages as far as the present site of Omaha. III.When the expedition entered the comparatively unknown region peopled by the fierce Sioux and Arikara tribes, a careful record of the river's course is shown in a series of small but exceedingly accurate maps (Nos. 6–11). These lay down the river channel continuously from a point near the southern boundary of South Dakota as far up as the site of Fort Mandan, some thirty-five miles above the present city of Bismarck—thus giving almost the entire stretch of the Missouri's course across the two Dakotas, with the islands, bends, and Indian villages upon the banks as they were found by the expedition a hundred years ago. IV.This group consists of Nos. 11–13, prepared at Fort Mandan on information received from French and British traders, as well as from native reports. No. 11 shows the trail from the Assiniboin region, over which the Northwest Company's factors had come—to find, to their chagrin, that the Americans had established themselves among the Mandans, who were accounted the former's especial customers. Nos. 12 and 13 are conjectural maps of the country to the west, indicating the overland trail to the Yellowstone and the chief topographical features of the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. V.No. 14 is one of the principal maps of the series. It represents the course of the Missouri from Fort Mandan as far as the Falls, and embraces the route of the summer's travel in 1805—from the time the Mandans were left behind (April 7) to the date when the portage was completed and the river approached through the Gates of the Mountains (July 15). This map was prepared by Clark with skilful care; it embodies the results of a series of preliminary field sketches (Nos. 15–25), draughted from day to day on rough sheets on which the "Courses and Distances" for each day's travel were also indicated. Using these eleven maps as a basis, Clark gives us in No. 14 the natural features, the affluents, the character of the banks, and the camping-places both going and returning; all this data being presented upon a Mercator's projection of squares of latitude and longitude. It is interesting to note that not possessing sheets of paper of sufficient size to produce so large a map, he pasted together those of ordinary dimensions. This was done at such angles that the sinuous course of the river is graphically represented. Nos. 26 and 26a are sketches of the topography of the Falls of the Missouri, and supplement those already published in volume three of this work, which were found in the codices of the journals proper. Four additional maps were needed to complete the water route to the head-springs of Jefferson River, where the canoes were finally abandoned. These (Nos. 27–29a) portray in like careful manner: the Missouri through the Rocky Mountains, the Three Forks of that river, and the course of the Jefferson from its junction with Madison and Gallatin rivers through Beaver Head Valley to its upper forks. This was the course over which the expedition painfully struggled (July 16–Aug. 20, 1805) from the Great Falls, until it was no longer possible to drag or pole the canoes through the shallowing stream. VI.We now come to three large maps, of which the first (No. 30) is probably the most important of the entire series: for herein is portrayed the much-discussed and little-understood route over the range of mountains lying between the head-springs of the Missouri and the plains of the Kooskooskee (Clearwater), where the friendly Flatheads (Chopunnish) preserved the expedition from starvation. On sheets of paper pasted together in the same ingenious fashion as before, Clark has laid down the entire horseback tour from Shoshoni Cove to the banks of the Lemhi; the crossing to the Bitterroot Valley—not perfectly elucidated up to the present publication; the passage down the Bitterroot; the rendezvous at Traveller's Rest; and the mountainous trail to the west, along the ridge north of the middle fork of the Kooskooskee, including the courses of Hungry and Collins creeks (so difficult to identify); and finally, the emergence upon Weippe Prairie, the habitat of the hospitable Flatheads. No. 31 shows the entire course of the Kooskooskee, its junction with Lewis (Snake) River, and the latter's bed as far as the Columbia, which is also given to the Umatilla, as well as some portion of its course above the junction of the Lewis. The point where the canoes were built is indicated, and the descent of the three rivers from October 17–19 is charted in much detail. The third of the three large maps (No. 32) portrays all the lower stretch of the Columbia, from about the point where it becomes the boundary between the present States of Oregon and Washington, to its discharge into the Pacific, together with a part of the coast line of the latter. This is interesting not only for the detail and accuracy with which the river's course is traced, but as being probably our first chart of that great waterway above the tidal region. There follow several small sketch maps (Nos. 33–36), showing details of the Columbia, evidently prepared only as preliminary to the making of No. 32. They have, however, an interest of their own, in marking certain camping-places and giving some other particulars not reproduced on the larger chart. VII.Nos. 37–39 were those made at Fort Clatsop. No. 38 shows Clark's exploration of the coast when on his journey (Jan. 6–10, 1806) in search of the spoils of the stranded whale. VIII.The next group of maps (Nos. 40–44) are all of Indian origin, and represent the information obtained on the return journey from the natives of the Western slope, in relation to tribal location, natural objects, and various mountain trails. It was upon the data thus gathered that the explorers based the bold conception of dividing the party, each section seeking not only increased geographical knowledge, but a more practicable passage than they had found on the outward journey, between Missouri and Columbia waters. No. 43 is especially interesting in this connection. It maps several native trails over the great divide, and three available routes from Traveller's Rest to the Missouri—the most northerly of which was followed by Lewis, and the most southerly by Clark. IX.The last group is devoted to Clark's return route. Of these, Nos. 45 and 46 refer to his crossing (July 4–9, 1806) from the Bitterroot Valley to the Forks of the Jefferson, and are somewhat contradictory and confused. A careful local study, however, may elucidate the main features of the trail, as well as throw light upon the outward journey between these two points. Nos. 47 and 48 likewise indicate the journey from the Three Forks to the Yellowstone, over what is now the famous Bozeman Pass, and approximating the present route of the Northern Pacific Railway. The remainder of the maps (Nos. 49–53) portray the basin of the Yellowstone. Here is the only gap in the continuity of the series. The first four maps are contiguous, and bring us to the neighborhood of old Fort Sarpy, near the eastern boundary of the present Crow Indian Reservation. One small map (No. 53) of the Yellowstone, near its junction with the Missouri, closes this series of original charts. X.No. 54 has been prepared especially for this volume, on the basis of the maps above enumerated, and represents, on a condensed scale, the route of the entire journey in relation to modern conditions, from the mouth of the Missouri to the Pacific and return. Necessarily compressed in order to present a bird's-eye view of the whole, the details must be sought through a close study of Clark's originals, in connection with the text of the journals themselves. The points of the compass are roughly indicated by the placing of the captions at the south side of the maps. R. G. T.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIST OF MAPS [All of them facsimiles of charts carried or made upon the expedition, chiefly by Clark; save that No. 54 was draughted especially for the present publication.] 1.The Upper Mississippi, Lower Ohio, and Lower Missouri rivers. Evidently copied from a contemporary French manuscript map. 2."A Topogr[aphical] Sketch of the Missouri and Upper Mississippi, exhibiting the various Nations and Tribes of Indians who inhabit the Country.
