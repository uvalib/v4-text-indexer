      <field name="fulltext">THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY (1916) To the Memory of William Edward Butler COLLECTED POEMS FLAMMONDE The man Flammonde, from God knows where, With firm address and foreign air, With news of nations in his talk And something royal in his walk, With glint of iron in his eyes, But never doubt, nor yet surprise, Appeared, and stayed, and held his head As one by kings accredited. Erect, with his alert repose About him, and about his clothes, He pictured all tradition hears Of what we owe to fifty years. His cleansing heritage of taste Paraded neither want nor waste; And what he needed for his fee To live, he borrowed graciously. He never told us what he was, Or what mischance, or other cause, Had banished him from better days To play the Prince of Castaways. Meanwhile he played surpassing well COLLECTED POEMS A part, for most, unplayable; In fine, one pauses, half afraid To say for certain that he played. For that, one may as well forego Conviction as to yes or no; Nor can I say just how intense Would then have been the difference To several, who, having striven In vain to get what he was given, Would see the stranger taken on By friends not easy to be won. Moreover, many a malcontent He soothed and found munificent; His courtesy beguiled and foiled Suspicion that his years were soiled; His mien distinguished any crowd, His credit strengthened when he bowed; And women, young and old, were fond Of looking at the man Flammonde. There was a woman in our town On whom the fashion was to frown; But while our talk renewed the tinge Of a long-faded scarlet fringe, The man Flammonde saw none of that, And what he saw we wondered at— That none of us, in her distress, Could hide or find our littleness. There was a boy that all agreed Had shut within him the rare seed Of learning. We could understand, FLAMMONDE But none of us could lift a hand. The man Flammonde appraised the youth, And told a few of us the truth; And thereby, for a little gold, A flowered future was unrolled. There were two citizens who fought For years and years, and over nought; They made life awkward for their friends, And shortened their own dividends. The man Flammonde said what was wrong Should be made right; nor was it long Before they were again in line, And had each other in to dine. And these I mention are but four Of many out of many more. So much for them. But what of him— So firm in every look and limb? What small satanic sort of kink Was in his brain? What broken link Withheld him from the destinies That came so near to being his? What was he, when we came to sift His meaning, and to note the drift Of incommunicable ways That make us ponder while we praise? Why was it that his charm revealed Somehow the surface of a shield? What was it that we never caught? What was he, and what was he not? How much it was of him we met We cannot ever know; nor yet COLLECTED POEMS Shall all he gave us quite atone For what was his, and his alone; Nor need we now, since he knew best, Nourish an ethical unrest: Rarely at once will nature give The power to be Flammonde and live. We cannot know how much we learn From those who never will return, Until a flash of unforeseen Remembrance falls on what has been. We've each a darkening hill to climb; And this is why, from time to time In Tilbury Town, we look beyond Horizons for the man Flammonde. THE GIFT OF GOD Blessed with a joy that only she Of all alive shall ever know, She wears a proud humility For what it was that willed it so,— That her degree should be so great Among the favored of the Lord That she may scarcely bear the weight Of her bewildering reward. As one apart, immune, alone, Or featured for the shining ones, And like to none that she has known Of other women's other sons,— The firm fruition of her need, He shines anointed; and he blurs THE GIFT OF GOD Her vision, till it seems indeed A sacrilege to call him hers. She fears a little for so much Of what is best, and hardly dares To think of him as one to touch With aches, indignities, and cares; She sees him rather at the goal, Still shining; and her dream foretells The proper shining of a soul Where nothing ordinary dwells. Perchance a canvass of the town Would find him far from flags and shouts, And leave him only the renown Of many smiles and many doubts; Perchance the crude and common tongue Would havoc strangely with his worth; But she, with innocence unwrung, Would read his name around the earth. And others, knowing how this youth Would shine, if love could make him great, When caught and tortured for the truth Would only writhe and hesitate; While she, arranging for his days What centuries could not fulfill, Transmutes him with her faith and praise, And has him shining where she will. She crowns him with her gratefulness, And says again that life is good; And should the gift of God be less In him than in her motherhood, His fame, though vague, will not be small, COLLECTED POEMS As upward through her dream he fares, Half clouded with a crimson fall Of roses thrown on marble stairs. THE CLINGING VINE "Be calm? And was I frantic? You'll have me laughing soon. I'm calm as this Atlantic, And quiet as the moon; I may have spoken faster Than once, in other days; For I've no more a master, And now—`Be calm,' he says. "Fear not, fear no commotion,— I'll be as rocks and sand; The moon and stars and ocean Will envy my command; No creature could be stiller In any kind of place Than I . . . No, I'll not kill her; Her death is in her face. "Be happy while she has it, For she'll not have it long; A year, and then you'll pass it, Preparing a new song. And I'm a fool for prating Of what a year may bring, When more like her are waiting For more like you to sing. "You mock me with denial, You mean to call me hard? THE CLINGING VINE You see no room for trial When all my doors are barred? You say, and you'd say dying, That I dream what I know; And sighing, and denying, You'd hold my hand and go. "You scowl—and I don't wonder; I spoke too fast again; But you'll forgive one blunder, For you are like most men: You are,—or so you've told me, So many mortal times, That heaven ought not to hold me Accountable for crimes. "Be calm? Was I unpleasant? Then I'll be more discreet, And grant you, for the present, The balm of my defeat: What she, with all her striving, Could not have brought about, You've done. Your own contriving Has put the last light out. "If she were the whole story, If worse were not behind, I'd creep with you to glory, Believing I was blind; I'd creep, and go on seeming To be what I despise. You laugh, and say I'm dreaming, And all your laughs are lies. "Are women mad? A few are, And if it's true you say— COLLECTED POEMS If most men are as you are— We'll all be mad some day. Be calm—and let me finish; There's more for you to know. I'll talk while you diminish, And listen while you grow. "There was a man who married Because he couldn't see; And all his days he carried The mark of his degree. But you—you came clear-sighted, And found truth in my eyes; And all my wrongs you've righted With lies, and lies, and lies. "You've killed the last assurance That once would have me strive To rouse an old endurance That is no more alive. It makes two people chilly To say what we have said, But you—you'll not be silly And wrangle for the dead. "You don't? You never wrangle? Why scold then,—or complain? More words will only mangle What you've already slain. Your pride you can't surrender? My name—for that you fear? Since when were men so tender, And honor so severe? "No more—I'll never bear it. I'm going. I'm like ice. CASSANDRA My burden? You would share it? Forbid the sacrifice! Forget so quaint a notion, And let no more be told; For moon and stars and ocean And you and I are cold." CASSANDRA I heard one who said: "Verily, What word have I for children here? Your Dollar is your only Word, The wrath of it your only fear. "You build it altars tall enough To make you see, but you are blind; You cannot leave it long enough To look before you or behind. "When Reason beckons you to pause, You laugh and say that you know best; But what it is you know, you keep As dark as ingots in a chest. "You laugh and answer, `We are young; O leave us now, and let us grow.'— Not asking how much more of this Will Time endure or Fate bestow. "Because a few complacent years Have made your peril of your pride, Think you that you are to go on Forever pampered and untried? COLLECTED POEMS "What lost eclipse of history, What bivouac of the marching stars, Has given the sign for you to see Millenniums and last great wars? "What unrecorded overthrow Of all the world has ever known, Or ever been, has made itself So plain to you, and you alone? "Your Dollar, Dove and Eagle make A Trinity that even you Rate higher than you rate yourselves; It pays, it flatters, and it's new. "And though your very flesh and blood Be what your Eagle eats and drinks, You'll praise him for the best of birds, Not knowing what the Eagle thinks. "The power is yours, but not the sight; You see not upon what you tread; You have the ages for your guide, But not the wisdom to be led. "Think you to tread forever down The merciless old verities? And are you never to have eyes To see the world for what it is? "Are you to pay for what you have With all you are?"—No other word We caught, but with a laughing crowd Moved on. None heeded, and few heard. JOHN GORHAM JOHN GORHAM "Tell me what you're doing over here, John Gorham, Sighing hard and seeming to be sorry when you're not; Make me laugh or let me go now, for long faces in the moonlight Are a sign for me to say again a word that you forgot."— "I'm over here to tell you what the moon already May have said or maybe shouted ever since a year ago; I'm over here to tell you what you are, Jane Wayland, And to make you rather sorry, I should say, for being so."— "Tell me what you're saying to me now, John Gorham, Or you'll never see as much of me as ribbons any more; I'll vanish in as many ways as I have toes and fingers, And you'll not follow far for one where flocks have been before."— "I'm sorry now you never saw the flocks, Jane Wayland, But you're the one to make of them as many as you need. And then about the vanishing. It's I who mean to vanish; And when I'm here no longer you'll be done with me indeed."— "That's a way to tell me what I am, John Gorham! How am I to know myself until I make you smile? Try to look as if the moon were making faces at you, And a little more as if you meant to stay a little while."— "You are what it is that over rose-blown gardens Make a pretty flutter for a season in the sun; You are what it is that with a mouse, Jane Wayland, Catches him and lets him go and eats him up for fun."— COLLECTED POEMS "Sure I never took you for a mouse, John Gorham; All you say is easy, but so far from being true That I wish you wouldn't ever be again the one to think so; For it isn't cats and butterflies that I would be to you."— "All your little animals are in one picture— One I've had before me since a year ago to-night; And the picture where they live will be of you, Jane Wayland, Till you find a way to kill them or to keep them out of sight."— "Won't you ever see me as I am, John Gorham, Leaving out the foolishness and all I never meant? Somewhere in me there's a woman, if you know the way to find her. Will you like me any better if I prove it and repent?"— "I doubt if I shall ever have the time, Jane Wayland; And I dare say all this moonlight lying round us might as well Fall for nothing on the shards of broken urns that are forgotten, As on two that have no longer much of anything to tell." STAFFORD'S CABIN Once there was a cabin here, and once there was a man; And something happened here before my memory began. Time has made the two of them the fuel of one flame And all we have of them is now a legend and a name. All I have to say is what an old man said to me, And that would seem to be as much as there will ever be. "Fifty years ago it was we found it where it sat."— And forty years ago it was old Archibald said that. HILLCREST "An apple tree that's yet alive saw something, I suppose, Of what it was that happened there, and what no mortal knows Some one on the mountain heard far off a master shriek, And then there was a light that showed the way for men to seek. "We found it in the morning with an iron bar behind, And there were chains around it; but no search could ever find, Either in the ashes that were left, or anywhere, A sign to tell of who or what had been with Stafford there. "Stafford was a likely man with ideas of his own— Though I could never like the kind that likes to live alone; And when you met, you found his eyes were always on your shoes, As if they did the talking when he asked you for the news. "That's all, my son. Were I to talk for half a hundred years I'd never clear away from there the cloud that never clears. We buried what was left of it,—the bar, too, and the chains; And only for the apple tree there's nothing that remains." Forty years ago it was I heard the old man say, "That's all, my son."—And here again I find the place to-day, Deserted and told only by the tree that knows the most, And overgrown with golden-rod as if there were no ghost. HILLCREST (To Mrs. Edward MacDowell) No sound of any storm that shakes Old island walls with older seas Comes here where now September makes An island in a sea of trees. COLLECTED POEMS Between the sunlight and the shade A man may learn till he forgets The roaring of a world remade, And all his ruins and regrets; And if he still remembers here Poor fights he may have won or lost,— If he be ridden with the fear Of what some other fight may cost,— If, eager to confuse too soon, What he has known with what may be, He reads a planet out of tune For cause of his jarred harmony,— If here he venture to unroll His index of adagios, And he be given to console Humanity with what he knows,— He may by contemplation learn A little more than what he knew, And even see great oaks return To acorns out of which they grew. He may, if he but listen well, Through twilight and the silence here, Be told what there are none may tell To vanity's impatient ear; And he may never dare again Say what awaits him, or be sure What sunlit labyrinth of pain He may not enter and endure. OLD KING COLE Who knows to-day from yesterday May learn to count no thing too strange: Love builds of what Time takes away, Till Death itself is less than Change. Who sees enough in his duress May go as far as dreams have gone; Who sees a little may do less Than many who are blind have done; Who sees unchastened here the soul Triumphant has no other sight Than has a child who sees the whole World radiant with his own delight. Far journeys and hard wandering Await him in whose crude surmise Peace, like a mask, hides everything That is and has been from his eyes; And all his wisdom is unfound, Or like a web that error weaves On airy looms that have a sound No louder now than falling leaves. OLD KING COLE In Tilbury Town did Old King Cole A wise old age anticipate, Desiring, with his pipe and bowl, No Khan's extravagant estate. No crown annoyed his honest head, No fiddlers three were called or needed; For two disastrous heirs instead Made music more than ever three did. COLLECTED POEMS Bereft of her with whom his life Was harmony without a flaw, He took no other for a wife, Nor sighed for any that he saw; And if he doubted his two sons, And heirs, Alexis and Evander, He might have been as doubtful once Of Robert Burns and Alexander. Alexis, in his early youth, Began to steal—from old and young. Likewise Evander, and the truth Was like a bad taste on his tongue. Born thieves and liars, their affair Seemed only to be tarred with evil— The most insufferable pair Of scamps that ever cheered the devil. The world went on, their fame went on, And they went on—from bad to worse; Till, goaded hot with nothing done, And each accountred with a curse, The friends of Old King Cole, by twos, And fours, and sevens, and elevens, Pronounced unalterable views Of doings that were not of heaven's. And having learned again whereby Their baleful zeal had come about, King Cole met many a wrathful eye So kindly that its wrath went out— Or partly out. Say what they would, He seemed the more to court their candor; But never told what kind of good Was in Alexis and Evander. OLD KING COLE And Old King Cole, with many a puff That haloed his urbanity, Would smoke till he had smoked enough, And listen most attentively. He beamed as with an inward light That had the Lord's assurance in it; And once a man was there all night, Expecting something every minute. But whether from too little thought, Or too much fealty to the bowl, A dim reward was all he got For sitting up with Old King Cole. "Though mine," the father mused aloud, "Are not the sons I would have chosen, Shall I, less evilly endowed, By their infirmity be frozen? "They'll have a bad end, I'll agree, But I was never born to groan; For I can see what I can see, And I'm accordingly alone. With open heart and open door, I love my friends, I like my neighbors; But if I try to tell you more, Your doubts will overmatch my labors. "This pipe would never make me calm, This bowl my grief would never drown. For grief like mine there is no balm In Gilead, or in Tilbury Town. And if I see what I can see, I know not any way to blind it; Nor more if any way may be For you to grope or fly to find it. COLLECTED POEMS "There may be room for ruin yet, And ashes for a wasted love; Or, like One whom you may forget, I may have meat you know not of. And if I'd rather live than weep Meanwhile, do you find that surprising? Why, bless my soul, the man's asleep! That's good. The sun will soon be rising." BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD You are a friend then, as I make it out, Of our man Shakespeare, who alone of us Will put an ass's head in Fairyland As he would add a shilling to more shillings, All most harmonious,—and out of his Miraculous inviolable increase Fills Ilion, Rome, or any town you like Of olden time with timeless Englishmen; And I must wonder what you think of him— All you down there where your small Avon flows By Stratford, and where you're an Alderman. Some, for a guess, would have him riding back To be a farrier there, or say a dyer; Or maybe one of your adept surveyors; Or like enough the wizard of all tanners. Not you—no fear of that; for I discern In you a kindling of the flame that saves— The nimble element, the true caloric; I see it, and was told of it, moreover, By our discriminate friend himself, no other. Had you been one of the sad average, As he would have it,—meaning, as I take it, BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD The sinew and the solvent of our Island, You'd not be buying beer for this Terpander's Approved and estimated friend Ben Jonson; He'd never foist it as a part of his Contingent entertainment of a townsman While he goes off rehearsing, as he must, If he shall ever be the Duke of Stratford. And my words are no shadow on your town— Far from it; for one town's as like another As all are unlike London. Oh, he knows it,— And there's the Stratford in him; he denies it, And there's the Shakespeare in him. So, God help him! I tell him he needs Greek; but neither God Nor Greek will help him. Nothing will help that man. You see the fates have given him so much, He must have all or perish,—or look out Of London, where he sees too many lords. They're part of half what ails him: I suppose There's nothing fouler down among the demons Than what it is he feels when he remembers The dust and sweat and ointment of his calling With his lords looking on and laughing at him. King as he is, he can't be king de facto, And that's as well, because he wouldn't like it; He'd frame a lower rating of men then Than he has now; and after that would come An abdication or an apoplexy. He can't be king, not even king of Stratford,— Though half the world, if not the whole of it, May crown him with a crown that fits no king Save Lord Apollo's homesick emissary: Not there on Avon, or on any stream Where Naiads and their white arms are no more, Shall he find home again. It's all too bad. But there's a comfort, for he'll have that House— COLLECTED POEMS The best you ever saw; and he'll be there Anon, as you're an Alderman. Good God! He makes me lie awake o'nights and laugh. And you have known him from his origin, You tell me; and a most uncommon urchin He must have been to the few seeing ones— A trifle terrifying, I dare say, Discovering a world with his man's eyes, Quite as another lad might see some finches, If he looked hard and had an eye for nature. But this one had his eyes and their foretelling, And he had you to fare with, and what else? He must have had a father and a mother— In fact I've heard him say so—and a dog, As a boy should, I venture; and the dog, Most likely, was the only man who knew him. A dog, for all I know, is what he needs As much as anything right here to-day, To counsel him about his disillusions, Old aches, and parturitions of what's coming,— A dog of orders, an emeritus, To wag his tail at him when he comes home, And then to put his paws up on his knees And say, "For God's sake, what's it all about?" I don't know whether he needs a dog or not— Or what he needs. I tell him he needs Greek; I'll talk of rules and Aristotle with him, And if his tongue's at home he'll say to that, "I have your word that Aristotle knows, And you mine that I don't know Aristotle." He's all at odds with all the unities, And what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to matter; He treads along through Time's old wilderness As if the tramp of all the centuries BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD Had left no roads—and there are none, for him; He doesn't see them, even with those eyes,— And that's a pity, or I say it is. Accordingly we have him as we have him— Going his way, the way that he goes best, A pleasant animal with no great noise Or nonsense anywhere to set him off— Save only divers and inclement devils Have made of late his heart their dwelling place. A flame half ready to fly out sometimes At some annoyance may be fanned up in him, But soon it falls, and when it falls goes out; He knows how little room there is in there For crude and futile animosities, And how much for the joy of being whole, And how much for long sorrow and old pain. On our side there are some who may be given To grow old wondering what he thinks of us And some above us, who are, in his eyes, Above himself,—and that's quite right and English. Yet here we smile, or disappoint the gods Who made it so: the gods have always eyes To see men scratch; and they see one down here Who itches, manor-bitten to the bone, Albeit he knows himself—yes, yes, he knows— The lord of more than England and of more Than all the seas of England in all time Shall ever wash. D'ye wonder that I laugh? He sees me, and he doesn't seem to care; And why the devil should he? I can't tell you. I'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday, Trim, rather spruce, and quite the gentleman. "What ho, my lord!" say I. He doesn't hear me; Wherefore I have to pause and look at him. He's not enormous, but one looks at him. COLLECTED POEMS A little on the round if you insist, For now, God save the mark, he's growing old; He's five and forty, and to hear him talk These days you'd call him eighty; then you'd add More years to that. He's old enough to be The father of a world, and so he is. "Ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of day?" Says he; and there shines out of him again An aged light that has no age or station— The mystery that's his—a mischievous Half-mad serenity that laughs at fame For being won so easy, and at friends Who laugh at him for what he wants the most, And for his dukedom down in Warwickshire;— By which you see we're all a little jealous. . . . Poor Greene! I fear the color of his name Was even as that of his ascending soul; And he was one where there are many others,— Some scrivening to the end against their fate, Their puppets all in ink and all to die there; And some with hands that once would shade an eye That scanned Euripides and Æschylus Will reach by this time for a pot-house mop To slush their first and last of royalties. Poor devils! and they all play to his hand; For so it was in Athens and old Rome. But that's not here or there; I've wandered off. Greene does it, or I'm careful. Where's that boy? Yes, he'll go back to Stratford. And we'll miss him? Dear sir, there'll be no London here without him. We'll all be riding, one of these fine days, Down there to see him—and his wife won't like us; And then we'll think of what he never said Of women—which, if taken all in all BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD With what he did say, would buy many horses. Though nowadays he's not so much for women: "So few of them," he says, "are worth the guessing." But there's a worm at work when he says that, And while he says it one feels in the air A deal of circumambient hocus-pocus. They've had him dancing till his toes were tender, And he can feel 'em now, come chilly rains. There's no long cry for going into it, However, and we don't know much about it. But you in Stratford, like most here in London, Have more now in the Sonnets than you paid for; He's put one there with all her poison on, To make a singing fiction of a shadow That's in his life a fact, and always will be. But she's no care of ours, though Time, I fear, Will have a more reverberant ado About her than about another one Who seems to have decoyed him, married him, And sent him scuttling on his way to London,— With much already learned, and more to learn, And more to follow. Lord! how I see him now, Pretending, maybe trying, to be like us. Whatever he may have meant, we never had him; He failed us, or escaped, or what you will,— And there was that about him (God knows what,— We'd flayed another had he tried it on us) That made as many of us as had wits More fond of all his easy distances Than one another's noise and clap-your-shoulder. But think you not, my friend, he'd never talk! Talk? He was eldritch at it; and we listened— Thereby acquiring much we knew before About ourselves, and hitherto had held Irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose. COLLECTED POEMS And there were some, of course, and there be now, Disordered and reduced amazedly To resignation by the mystic seal Of young finality the gods had laid On everything that made him a young demon; And one or two shot looks at him already As he had been their executioner; And once or twice he was, not knowing it,— Or knowing, being sorry for poor clay And saying nothing. . . . Yet, for all his engines, You'll meet a thousand of an afternoon Who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em A world made out of more that has a reason Than his, I swear, that he sees here to-day; Though he may scarcely give a Fool an exit But we mark how he sees in everything A law that, given we flout it once too often, Brings fire and iron down on our naked heads. To me it looks as if the power that made him, For fear of giving all things to one creature, Left out the first,—faith, innocence, illusion, Whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' Bedlam,— And thereby, for his too consuming vision, Empowered him out of nature; though to see him, You'd never guess what's going on inside him. He'll break out some day like a keg of ale With too much independent frenzy in it; And all for cellaring what he knows won't keep, And what he'd best forget—but that he can't. You'll have it, and have more than I'm foretelling; And there'll be such a roaring at the Globe As never stunned the bleeding gladiators. He'll have to change the color of its hair A bit, for now he calls it Cleopatra. Black hair would never do for Cleopatra. BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD But you and I are not yet two old women, And you're a man of office. What he does Is more to you than how it is he does it,— And that's what the Lord God has never told him. They work together, and the Devil helps 'em; They do it of a morning, or if not, They do it of a night; in which event He's peevish of a morning. He seems old; He's not the proper stomach or the sleep— And they're two sovran agents to conserve him Against the fiery art that has no mercy But what's in that prodigious grand new House. I gather something happening in his boyhood Fulfilled him with a boy's determination To make all Stratford 'ware of him. Well, well, I hope at last he'll have his joy of it, And all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves, And frogs and owls and unicorns, moreover, Be less than hell to his attendant ears. Oh, past a doubt we'll all go down to see him. He may be wise. With London two days off, Down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him; But there's no quickening breath from anywhere Small make of him again the poised young faun From Warwickshire, who'd made, it seems, already A legend of himself before I came To blink before the last of his first lightning. Whatever there be, there'll be no more of that; The coming on of his old monster Time Has made him a still man; and he has dreams Were fair to think on once, and all found hollow. He knows how much of what men paint themselves Would blister in the light of what they are; He sees how much of what was great now shares COLLECTED POEMS An eminence transformed and ordinary; He knows too much of what the world has hushed In others, to be loud now for himself; He knows now at what height low enemies May reach his heart, and high friends let him fall; But what not even such as he may know Bedevils him the worst: his lark may sing At heaven's gate how he will, and for as long As joy may listen, but he sees no gate, Save one whereat the spent clay waits a little Before the churchyard has it, and the worm. Not long ago, late in an afternoon, I came on him unseen down Lambeth way, And on my life I was afear'd of him: He gloomed and mumbled like a soul from Tophet, His hands behind him and his head bent solemn. "What is it now," said I,—"another woman?" That made him sorry for me, and he smiled. "No, Ben," he mused; "it's Nothing. It's all Nothing. We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done." Spiders and flies—we're mostly one or t'other— We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done; "By God, you sing that song as if you knew it!" Said I, by way of cheering him; "what ails ye?" "I think I must have come down here to think," Says he to that, and pulls his little beard; "Your fly will serve as well as anybody, And what's his hour? He flies, and flies, and flies, And in his fly's mind has a brave appearance; And then your spider gets him in her net, And eats him out, and hangs him up to dry. That's Nature, the kind mother of us all. And then your slattern housemaid swings her broom, And where's your spider? And that's Nature, also. It's Nature, and it's Nothing. It's all Nothing. BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD It's all a world where bugs and emperors Go singularly back to the same dust, Each in his time; and the old, ordered stars That sang together, Ben, will sing the same Old stave to-morrow." When he talks like that, There's nothing for a human man to do But lead him to some grateful nook like this Where we be now, and there to make him drink. He'll drink, for love of me, and then be sick; A sad sign always in a man of parts, And always very ominous. The great Should be as large in liquor as in love,— And our great friend is not so large in either: One disaffects him, and the other fails him; Whatso he drinks that has an antic in it, He's wondering what's to pay in his insides; And while his eyes are on the Cyprian He's fribbling all the time with that damned House. We laugh here at his thrift, but after all It may be thrift that saves him from the devil; God gave it, anyhow,—and we'll suppose He knew the compound of his handiwork. To-day the clouds are with him, but anon He'll out of 'em enough to shake the tree Of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of,— And, throwing in the bruised and whole together, Prepare a wine to make us drunk with wonder; And if he live, there'll be a sunset spell Thrown over him as over a glassed lake That yesterday was all a black wild water. God send he live to give us, if no more, What now's a-rampage in him, and exhibit, COLLECTED POEMS With a decent half-allegiance to the ages An earnest of at least a casual eye Turned once on what he owes to Gutenberg, And to the fealty of more centuries Than are as yet a picture in our vision. "There's time enough,—I'll do it when I'm old, And we're immortal men," he says to that; And then he says to me, "Ben, what's `immortal'? Think you by any force of ordination It may be nothing of a sort more noisy Than a small oblivion of component ashes That of a dream-addicted world was once A moving atomy much like your friend here?" Nothing will help that man. To make him laugh, I said then he was a mad mountebank,— And by the Lord I nearer made him cry. I could have eat an eft then, on my knees, Tail, claws, and all of him; for I had stung The king of men, who had no sting for me, And I had hurt him in his memories; And I say now, as I shall say again, I love the man this side idolatry. He'll do it when he's old, he says. I wonder. He may not be so ancient as all that. For such as he, the thing that is to do Will do itself,—but there's a reckoning; The sessions that are now too much his own, The roiling inward of a stilled outside, The churning out of all those blood-fed lines, The nights of many schemes and little sleep, The full brain hammered hot with too much thinking, The vexed heart over-worn with too much aching,— This weary jangling of conjoined affairs Made out of elements that have no end, BEN JONSON ENTERTAINS A MAN FROM STRATFORD And all confused at once, I understand, Is not what makes a man to live forever. O no, not now! He'll not be going now: There'll be time yet for God knows what explosions Before he goes. He'll stay awhile. Just wait: Just wait a year or two for Cleopatra, For she's to be a balsam and a comfort; And that's not all a jape of mine now, either. For granted once the old way of Apollo Sings in a man, he may then, if he's able, Strike unafraid whatever strings he will Upon the last and wildest of new lyres; Nor out of his new magic, though it hymn The shrieks of dungeoned hell, shall he create A madness or a gloom to shut quite out A cleaving daylight, and a last great calm Triumphant over shipwreck and all storms. He might have given Aristotle creeps, But surely would have given him his katharsis. He'll not be going yet. There's too much yet Unsung within the man. But when he goes, I'd stake ye coin o' the realm his only care For a phantom world he sounded and found wanting Will be a portion here, a portion there, Of this or that thing or some other thing That has a patent and intrinsical Equivalence in those egregious shillings. And yet he knows, God help him! Tell me, now, If ever there was anything let loose On earth by gods or devils heretofore Like this mad, careful, proud, indifferent Shakespeare! Where was it, if it ever was? By heaven, 'Twas never yet in Rhodes or Pergamon— In Thebes or Nineveh, a thing like this! COLLECTED POEMS No thing like this was ever out of England; And that he knows. I wonder if he cares. Perhaps he does. . . . O Lord, that House in Stratford! EROS TURANNOS She fears him, and will always ask What fated her to choose him; She meets in his engaging mask All reasons to refuse him; But what she meets and what she fears Are less than are the downward years, Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs Of age, were she to lose him. Between a blurred sagacity That once had power to sound him, And Love, that will not let him be The Judas that she found him, Her pride assuages her almost, As if it were alone the cost.— He sees that he will not be lost, And waits and looks around him. A sense of ocean and old trees Envelops and allures him; Tradition, touching all he sees, Beguiles and reassures him; And all her doubts of what he says Are dimmed with what she knows of days— Till even prejudice delays And fades, and she secures him. The falling leaf inaugurates The reign of her confusion; OLD TRAILS The pounding wave reverberates The dirge of her illusion; And home, where passion lived and died, Becomes a place where she can hide, While all the town and harbor side Vibrate with her seclusion. We tell you, tapping on our brows, The story as it should be,— As if the story of a house Were told, or ever could be; We'll have no kindly veil between Her visions and those we have seen,— As if we guessed what hers have been, Or what they are or would be. Meanwhile we do no harm; for they That with a god have striven, Not hearing much of what we say, Take what the god has given; Though like waves breaking it may be, Or like a changed familiar tree, Or like a stairway to the sea Where down the blind are driven. OLD TRAILS (Washington Square) I met him, as one meets a ghost or two, Between the gray Arch and the old Hotel. "King Solomon was right, there's nothing new," Said he. "Behold a ruin who meant well." COLLECTED POEMS He led me down familiar steps again, Appealingly, and set me in a chair. "My dreams have all come true to other men," Said he; "God lives, however, and why care? "An hour among the ghosts will do no harm." He laughed, and something glad within me sank. I may have eyed him with a faint alarm, For now his laugh was lost in what he drank. "They chill things here with ice from hell," he said; "I might have known it." And he made a face That showed again how much of him was dead, And how much was alive and out of place, And out of reach. He knew as well as I That all the words of wise men who are skilled In using them are not much to defy What comes when memory meets the unfulfilled. What evil and infirm perversity Had been at work with him to bring him back? Never among the ghosts, assuredly, Would he originate a new attack; Never among the ghosts, or anywhere, Till what was dead of him was put away, Would he attain to his offended share Of honor among others of his day. "You ponder like an owl," he said at last; "You always did, and here you have a cause. For I'm a confirmation of the past, A vengeance, and a flowering of what was. OLD TRAILS "Sorry? Of course you are, though you compress, With even your most impenetrable fears, A placid and a proper consciousness Of anxious angels over my arrears. "I see them there against me in a book As large as hope, in ink that shines by night Surely I see; but now I'd rather look At you, and you are not a pleasant sight. "Forbear, forgive. Ten years are on my soul, And on my conscience. I've an incubus: My one distinction, and a parlous toll To glory; but hope lives on clamorous. " 'Twas hope, though heaven I grant you knows of what— The kind that blinks and rises when it falls, Whether it sees a reason why or not— That heard Broadway's hard-throated siren-calls; " 'Twas hope that brought me through December storms, To shores again where I'll not have to be A lonely man with only foreign worms To cheer him in his last obscurity. "But what it was that hurried me down here To be among the ghosts, I leave to you. My thanks are yours, no less, for one thing clear: Though you are silent, what you say is true. "There may have been the devil in my feet, For down I blundered, like a fugitive, To find the old room in Eleventh Street. God save us!—I came here again to live." COLLECTED POEMS We rose at that, and all the ghosts rose then, And followed us unseen to his old room. No longer a good place for living men We found it, and we shivered in the gloom. The goods he took away from there were few, And soon we found ourselves outside once more, Where now the lamps along the Avenue Bloomed white for miles above an iron floor. "Now lead me to the newest of hotels," He said, "and let your spleen be undeceived: This ruin is not myself, but some one else; I haven't failed; I've merely not achieved." Whether he knew or not, he laughed and dined With more of an immune regardlessness Of pits before him and of sands behind Than many a child at forty would confess; And after, when the bells in Boris rang Their tumult at the Metropolitan, He rocked himself, and I believe he sang. "God lives," he crooned aloud, "and I'm the man!" He was. And even though the creature spoiled All prophecies, I cherish his acclaim. Three weeks he fattened; and five years he toiled In Yonkers,—and then sauntered into fame. And he may go now to what streets he will— Eleventh, or the last, and little care; But he would find the old room very still Of evenings, and the ghosts would all be there. THE UNFORGIVEN I doubt if he goes after them; I doubt If many of them ever come to him. His memories are like lamps, and they go out, Or if they burn, they flicker and are dim. A light of other gleams he has to-day And adulations of applauding hosts; A famous danger, but a safer way Than growing old alone among the ghosts. But we may still be glad that we were wrong: He fooled us, and we'd shrivel to deny it; Though sometimes when old echoes ring too long, I wish the bells in Boris would be quiet. THE UNFORGIVEN When he, who is the unforgiven, Beheld her first, he found her fair: No promise ever dreamt in heaven Could then have lured him anywhere That would have been away from there; And all his wits had lightly striven, Foiled with her voice, and eyes, and hair. There's nothing in the saints and sages To meet the shafts her glances had, Or such as hers have had for ages To blind a man till he be glad, And humble him till he be mad. The story would have many pages, And would be neither good nor bad. And, having followed, you would find him Where properly the play begins; COLLECTED POEMS But look for no red light behind him— No fumes of many-colored sins, Fanned high by screaming violins. God knows what good it was to blind him, Or whether man or woman wins. And by the same eternal token, Who knows just how it will all end?— This drama of hard words unspoken, This fireside farce, without a friend Or enemy to comprehend What augurs when two lives are broken, And fear finds nothing left to mend. He stares in vain for what awaits him, And sees in Love a coin to toss; He smiles, and her cold hush berates him Beneath his hard half of the cross; They wonder why it ever was; And she, the unforgiving, hates him More for her lack than for her loss. He feeds with pride his indecision, And shrinks from what will not occur, Bequeathing with infirm derision His ashes to the days that were, Before she made him prisoner; And labors to retrieve the vision That he must once have had of her. He waits, and there awaits an ending, And he knows neither what nor when; But no magicians are attending To make him see as he saw then, And he will never find again THEOPHILUS The face that once had been the rending Of all his purpose among men. He blames her not, nor does he chide her, And she has nothing new to say; If he were Bluebeard he could hide her, But that's not written in the play, And there will be no change to-day; Although, to the serene outsider, There still would seem to be a way. THEOPHILUS By what serene malevolence of names Had you the gift of yours, Theophilus? Not even a smeared young Cyclops at his games Would have you long,—and you are one of us. Told of your deeds I shudder for your dream And they, no doubt, are few and innocent. Meanwhile, I marvel; for in you, it seems, Heredity outshines environment. What lingering bit of Belial, unforeseen, Survives and amplifies itself in you? What manner of devilry has ever been That your obliquity may never do? Humility befits a father's eyes, But not a friend of us would have him weep. Admiring everything that lives and dies, Theophilus, we like you best asleep. COLLECTED POEMS Sleep—sleep; and let us find another man To lend another name less hazardous: Caligula, maybe, or Caliban, Or Cain,—but surely not Theophilus. VETERAN SIRENS The ghost of Ninon would be sorry now To laugh at them, were she to see them here, So brave and so alert for learning how To fence with reason for another year. Age offers a far comelier diadem Than theirs; but anguish has no eye for grace, When time's malicious mercy cautions them To think a while of number and of space. The burning hope, the worn expectancy, The martyred humor, and the maimed allure, Cry out for time to end his levity, And age to soften its investiture; But they, though others fade and are still fair, Defy their fairness and are unsubdued; Although they suffer, they may not forswear The patient ardor of the unpursued. Poor flesh, to fight the calendar so long; Poor vanity, so quaint and yet so brave; Poor folly, so deceived and yet so strong, So far from Ninon and so near the grave. ANOTHER DARK LADY SIEGE PERILOUS Long warned of many terrors more severe To scorch him than hell's engines could awaken, He scanned again, too far to be so near, The fearful seat no man had ever taken. So many other men with older eyes Than his to see with older sight behind them Had known so long their one way to be wise,— Was any other thing to do than mind them? So many a blasting parallel had seared Confusion on his faith,—could he but wonder If he were mad and right, or if he feared God's fury told in shafted flame and thunder? There fell one day upon his eyes a light Ethereal, and he heard no more men speaking; He saw their shaken heads, but no long sight Was his but for the end that he went seeking. The end he sought was not the end; the crown He won shall unto many still be given. Moreover, there was reason here to frown: No fury thundered, no flame fell from heaven. ANOTHER DARK LADY Think not, because I wonder where you fled, That I would lift a pin to see you there; You may, for me, be prowling anywhere, So long as you show not your little head: COLLECTED POEMS No dark and evil story of the dead Would leave you less pernicious or less fair— Not even Lilith, with her famous hair; And Lilith was the devil, I have read. I cannot hate you, for I loved you then. The woods were golden then. There was a road Through beeches; and I said their smooth feet showed Like yours. Truth must have heard me from afar, For I shall never have to learn again That yours are cloven as no beech's are. THE VOICE OF AGE She'd look upon us, if she could, As hard as Rhadamanthus would; Yet one may see,—who sees her face, Her crown of silver and of lace, Her mystical serene address Of age alloyed with loveliness,— That she would not annihilate The frailest of things animate. She has opinions of our ways, And if we're not all mad, she says,— If our ways are not wholly worse Than others, for not being hers,— There might somehow be found a few Less insane things for us to do, And we might have a little heed Of what Belshazzar couldn't read. She feels, with all our furniture, Room yet for something more secure THE DARK HOUSE Than our self-kindled aureoles To guide our poor forgotten souls; But when we have explained that grace Dwells now in doing for the race, She nods—as if she were relieved; Almost as if she were deceived. She frowns at much of what she hears, And shakes her head, and has her fears; Though none may know, by any chance, What rose-leaf ashes of romance Are faintly stirred by later days That would be well enough, she says, If only people were more wise, And grown-up children used their eyes. THE DARK HOUSE Where a faint light shines alone, Dwells a Demon I have known. Most of you had better say "The Dark House," and go your way. Do not wonder if I stay. For I know the Demon's eyes, And their lure that never dies. Banish all your fond alarms, For I know the foiling charms Of her eyes and of her arms, And I know that in one room Burns a lamp as in a tomb; And I see the shadow glide, Back and forth, of one denied Power to find himself outside. COLLECTED POEMS There he is who is my friend, Damned, he fancies, to the end— Vanquished, ever since a door Closed, he thought, for evermore On the life that was before. And the friend who knows him best Sees him as he sees the rest Who are striving to be wise While a Demon's arms and eyes Hold them as a web would flies. All the words of all the world, Aimed together and then hurled, Would be stiller in his ears Than a closing of still shears On a thread made out of years. But there lives another sound, More compelling, more profound; There's a music, so it seems, That assuages and redeems, More than reason, more than dreams. There's a music yet unheard By the creature of the word, Though it matters little more Than a wave-wash on a shore— Till a Demon shuts a door. So, if he be very still With his Demon, and one will, Murmurs of it may be blown To my friend who is alone In a room that I have known. THE POOR RELATION After that from everywhere Singing life will find him there; Then the door will open wide, And my friend, again outside, Will be living, having died. THE POOR RELATION No longer torn by what she knows And sees within the eyes of others, Her doubts are when the daylight goes, Her fears are for the few she bothers. She tells them it is wholly wrong Of her to stay alive so long; And when she smiles her forehead shows A crinkle that had been her mother's. Beneath her beauty, blanched with pain, And wistful yet for being cheated, A child would seem to ask again A question many times repeated; But no rebellion has betrayed Her wonder at what she has paid For memories that have no stain, For triumph born to be defeated. To those who come for what she was— The few left who know where to find her— She clings, for they are all she has; And she may smile when they remind her, As heretofore, of what they know Of roses that are still to blow By ways where not so much as grass Remains of what she sees behind her. COLLECTED POEMS They stay a while, and having done What penance or the past requires, They go, and leave her there alone To count her chimneys and her spires. Her lip shakes when they go away, And yet she would not have them stay; She knows as well as anyone That Pity, having played, soon tires. But one friend always reappears, A good ghost, not to be forsaken; Whereat she laughs and has no fears Of what a ghost may reawaken, But welcomes, while she wears and mends The poor relation's odds and ends, Her truant from a tomb of years— Her power of youth so early taken. Poor laugh, more slender than her song It seems; and there are none to hear it With even the stopped ears of the strong For breaking heart or broken spirit. The friends who clamored for her place, And would have scratched her for her face, Have lost her laughter for so long That none would care enough to fear it. None live who need fear anything From her, whose losses are their pleasure; The plover with a wounded wing Stays not the flight that others measure; So there she waits, and while she lives, And death forgets, and faith forgives, Her memories go foraging For bits of childhood song they treasure. THE BURNING BOOK And like a giant harp that hums On always, and is always blending The coming of what never comes With what has past and had an ending, The City trembles, throbs, and pounds Outside, and through a thousand sounds The small intolerable drums Of Time are like slow drops descending. Bereft enough to shame a sage And given little to long sighing, With no illusion to assuage The lonely changelessness of dying,— Unsought, unthought-of, and unheard, She sings and watches like a bird, Safe in a comfortable cage From which there will be no more flying. THE BURNING BOOK Or the Contented Metaphysician To the lore of no manner of men Would his vision have yielded When he found what will never again From his vision be shielded,— Though he paid with as much of his life As a nun could have given, And to-night would have been as a knife, Devil-drawn, devil-driven. For to-night, with his flame-weary eyes On the work he is doing, He considers the tinder that flies And the quick flame pursuing. COLLECTED POEMS In the leaves that are crinkled and curled Are his ashes of glory, And what once were an end of the world Is an end of a story. But he smiles, for no more shall his days Be a toil and a calling For a way to make others to gaze On God's face without falling. He has come to the end of his words, And alone he rejoices In the choiring that silence affords Of ineffable voices. To a realm that his words may not reach He may lead none to find him; An adept, and with nothing to teach, He leaves nothing behind him. For the rest, he will have his release, And his embers, attended By the large and unclamoring peace Of a dream that is ended. FRAGMENT Faint white pillars that seem to fade As you look from here are the first one sees Of his house where it hides and dies in a shade Of beeches and oaks and hickory trees. Now many a man, given woods like these, And a house like that, and the Briony gold, Would have said, "There are still some gods to please, And houses are built without hands, we're told." LISETTE AND EILEEN There are the pillars, and all gone gray. Briony's hair went white. You may see Where the garden was if you come this way. That sun-dial scared him, he said to me; "Sooner or later they strike," said he, And he never got that from the books he read. Others are flourishing, worse than he, But he knew too much for the life he led. And who knows all knows everything That a patient ghost at last retrieves; There's more to be known of his harvesting When Time the thresher unbinds the sheaves; And there's more to be heard than a wind that grieves For Briony now in this ageless oak, Driving the first of its withered leaves Over the stones where the fountain broke. LISETTE AND EILEEN "When he was here alive, Eileen, There was a word you might have said; So never mind what I have been, Or anything,—for you are dead. "And after this when I am there Where he is, you'll be dying still. Your eyes are dead, and your black hair,— The rest of you be what it will. "'Twas all to save him? Never mind, Eileen. You saved him. You are strong. I'd hardly wonder if your kind Paid everything, for you live long. COLLECTED POEMS "You last, I mean. That's what I mean. I mean you last as long as lies. You might have said that word, Eileen,— And you might have your hair and eyes. "And what you see might be Lisette, Instead of this that has no name. Your silence—I can feel it yet, Alive and in me, like a flame. "Where might I be with him to-day, Could be have known before he heard? But no—your silence had its way, Without a weapon or a word. "Because a word was never told, I'm going as a worn toy goes. And you are dead; and you'll be old; And I forgive you, I suppose. "I'll soon be changing as all do, To something we have always been; And you'll be old. . . . He liked you, too, I might have killed you then, Eileen. "I think he liked as much of you As had a reason to be seen,— As much as God made black and blue. He liked your hair and eyes, Eileen." LLEWELLYN AND THE TREE Could he have made Priscilla share The paradise that he had planned, Llewellyn would have loved his wife As well as any in the land. LLEWELLYN AND THE TREE Could he have made Priscilla cease To goad him for what God left out, Llewellyn would have been as mild As any we have read about. Could all have been as all was not, Llewellyn would have had no story; He would have stayed a quiet man And gone his quiet way to glory. But howsoever mild he was Priscilla was implacable; And whatsoever timid hopes He built—she found them, and they fell. And this went on, with intervals Of labored harmony between Resounding discords, till at last Llewellyn turned—as will be seen. Priscilla, warmer than her name, And shriller than the sound of saws, Pursued Llewellyn once too far, Not knowing quite the man he was. The more she said, the fiercer clung The stinging garment of his wrath; And this was all before the day When Time tossed roses in his path. Before the roses ever came Llewellyn had already risen. The roses may have ruined him, They may have kept him out of prison. COLLECTED POEMS And she who brought them, being Fate, Made roses do the work of spears,— Though many made no more of her Than civet, coral, rouge, and years. You ask us what Llewellyn saw, But why ask what may not be given? To some will come a time when change Itself is beauty, if not heaven. One afternoon Priscilla spoke, And her shrill history was done; At any rate, she never spoke Like that again to anyone. One gold October afternoon Great fury smote the silent air; And then Llewellyn leapt and fled Like one with hornets in his hair. Llewellyn left us, and he said Forever, leaving few to doubt him; And so, through frost and clicking leaves, The Tilbury way went on without him. And slowly, through the Tilbury mist, The stillness of October gold Went out like beauty from a face. Priscilla watched it, and grew old. He fled, still clutching in his flight The roses that had been his fall; The Scarlet One, as you surmise, Fled with him, coral, rouge, and all. LLEWELLYN AND THE TREE Priscilla, waiting, saw the change Of twenty slow October moons; And then she vanished, in her turn To be forgotten, like old tunes. So they were gone—all three of them, I should have said, and said no more, Had not a face once on Broadway Been one that I had seen before. The face and hands and hair were old, But neither time nor penury Could quench within Llewellyn's eyes The shine of his one victory. The roses, faded and gone by, Left ruin where they once had reigned; But on the wreck, as on old shells, The color of the rose remained. His fictive merchandise I bought For him to keep and show again, Then led him slowly from the crush Of his cold-shouldered fellow men. "And so, Llewellyn," I began— "Not so," he said; "not so at all: I've tried the world, and found it good, For more than twenty years this fall. "And what the world has left of me Will go now in a little while." And what the world had left of him Was partly an unholy guile. COLLECTED POEMS "That I have paid for being calm Is what you see, if you have eyes; For let a man be calm too long, He pays for much before he dies. "Be calm when you are growing old And you have nothing else to do; Pour not the wine of life too thin If water means the death of you. "You say I might have learned at home The truth in season to be strong? Not so; I took the wine of life Too thin, and I was calm too long. "Like others who are strong too late, For me there was no going back; For I had found another speed, And I was on the other track. "God knows how far I might have gone Or what there might have been to see; But my speed had a sudden end, And here you have the end of me." The end or not, it may be now But little farther from the truth To say those worn satiric eyes Had something of immortal youth. He may among the millions here Be one; or he may, quite as well, Be gone to find again the Tree Of Knowledge, out of which he fell. BEWICK FINZER He may be near us, dreaming yet Of unrepented rouge and coral; Or in a grave without a name May be as far off as a moral. BEWICK FINZER Time was when his half million drew The breath of six per cent; But soon the worm of what-was-not Fed hard on his content; And something crumbled in his brain When his half million went. Time passed, and filled along with his The place of many more; Time came, and hardly one of us Had credence to restore, From what appeared one day, the man Whom we had known before. The broken voice, the withered neck, The coat worn out with care, The cleanliness of indigence, The brilliance of despair, The fond imponderable dreams Of affluence,—all were there. Poor Finzer, with his dreams and schemes, Fares hard now in the race, With heart and eye that have a task When he looks in the face Of one who might so easily Have been in Finzer's place. COLLECTED POEMS He comes unfailing for the loan We give and then forget; He comes, and probably for years Will he be coming yet,— Familiar as an old mistake, And futile as regret. BOKARDO Well, Bokardo, here we are; Make yourself at home. Look around—you haven't far To look—and why be dumb? Not the place that used to be, Not so many things to see; But there's room for you and me. And you—you've come. Talk a little; or, if not, Show me with a sign Why it was that you forgot What was yours and mine. Friends, I gather, are small things In an age when coins are kings; Even at that, one hardly flings Friends before swine. Rather strong? I knew as much, For it made you speak. No offense to swine, as such, But why this hide-and-seek? You have something on your side, And you wish you might have died, So you tell me. And you tried One night last week? BOKARDO You tried hard? And even then Found a time to pause? When you try as hard again, You'll have another cause. When you find yourself at odds With all dreamers of all gods, You may smite yourself with rods— But not the laws. Though they seem to show a spite Rather devilish, They move on as with a might Stronger than your wish. Still, however strong they be, They bide man's authority: Xerxes, when he flogged the sea, May've scared a fish. It's a comfort, if you like, To keep honor warm, But as often as you strike The laws, you do no harm. To the laws, I mean. To you— That's another point of view, One you may as well indue With some alarm. Not the most heroic face To present, I grant; Nor will you insure disgrace By fearing what you want Freedom has a world of sides, And if reason once derides Courage, then your courage hides A deal of cant. COLLECTED POEMS Learn a little to forget Life was once a feast; You aren't fit for dying yet, So don't be a beast. Few men with a mind will say, Thinking twice, that they can pay Half their debts of yesterday, Or be released. There's a debt now on your mind More than any gold? And there's nothing you can find Out there in the cold? Only—what's his name?—Remorse? And Death riding on his horse? Well, be glad there's nothing worse Than you have told. Leave Remorse to warm his hands Outside in the rain. As for Death, he understands, And he will come again. Therefore, till your wits are clear, Flourish and be quiet—here. But a devil at each ear Will be a strain? Past a doubt they will indeed, More than you have earned. I say that because you need Ablution, being burned? Well, if you must have it so, Your last flight went rather low. Better say you had to know What you have learned. BOKARDO And that's over. Here you are, Battered by the past. Time will have his little scar, But the wound won't last. Nor shall harrowing surprise Find a world without its eyes If a star fades when the skies Are overcast. God knows there are lives enough, Crushed, and too far gone Longer to make sermons of, And those we leave alone. Others, if they will, may rend The worn patience of a friend Who, though smiling, sees the end, With nothing done. But you fervor to be free Fled the faith it scorned; Death demands a decency Of you, and you are warned. But for all we give we get Mostly blows? Don't be upset; You, Bokardo, are not yet Consumed or mourned. There'll be falling into view Much to rearrange; And there'll be a time for you To marvel at the change. They that have the least to fear Question hardest what is here; When long-hidden skies are clear, The stars look strange THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY Between me and the sunset, like a dome Against the glory of a world on fire, Now burned a sudden hill, Bleak, round, and high, by flame-lit height made higher, With nothing on it for the flame to kill Save one who moved and was alone up there To loom before the chaos and the glare As if he were the last god going home Unto his last desire. Dark, marvelous, and inscrutable he moved on Till down the fiery distance he was gone, Like one of those eternal, remote things That range across a man's imaginings When a sure music fills him and he knows What he may say thereafter to few men,— The touch of ages having wrought An echo and a glimpse of what he thought A phantom or a legend until then; For whether lighted over ways that save, Or lured from all repose, If he go on too far to find a grave, Mostly alone he goes. Even he, who stood where I had found him, On high with fire all round him, Who moved along the molten west, And over the round hill's crest That seemed half ready with him to go down, Flame-bitten and flame-cleft, As if there were to be no last thing left Of a nameless unimaginable town,— THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY Even he who climbed and vanished may have taken Down to the perils of a depth not known, From death defended though by men forsaken, The bread that every man must eat alone; He may have walked while others hardly dared Look on to see him stand where many fell; And upward out of that, as out of hell, He may have sung and striven To mount where more of him shall yet be given, Bereft of all retreat, To sevenfold heat,— As on a day when three in Dura shared The furnace, and were spared For glory by that king of Babylon Who made himself so great that God, who heard, Covered him with long feathers, like a bird. Again, he may have gone down easily, By comfortable altitudes, and found, As always, underneath him solid ground Whereon to be sufficient and to stand Possessed already of the promised land, Far stretched and fair to see: A good sight, verily, And one to make the eyes of her who bore him Shine glad with hidden tears. Why question of his ease of who before him, In one place or another where they left Their names as far behind them as their bones, And yet by dint of slaughter toil and theft, And shrewdly sharpened stones, Carved hard the way for his ascendency Through deserts of lost years? Why trouble him now who sees and hears No more than what his innocence requires, COLLECTED POEMS And therefore to no other height aspires Than one at which he neither quails nor tires? He may do more by seeing what he sees Than others eager for iniquities; He may, by seeing all things for the best, Incite futurity to do the rest. Or with an even likelihood, He may have met with atrabilious eyes The fires of time on equal terms and passed Indifferently down, until at last His only kind of grandeur would have been, Apparently, in being seen. He may have had for evil or for good No argument; he may have had no care For what without himself went anywhere To failure or to glory, and least of all For such a stale, flamboyant miracle; He may have been the prophet of an art Immovable to old idolatries; He may have been a player without a part, Annoyed that even the sun should have the skies For such a flaming way to advertise; He may have been a painter sick at heart With Nature's toiling for a new surprise; He may have been a cynic, who now, for all Of anything divine that his effete Negation may have tasted, Saw truth in his own image, rather small, Forbore to fever the ephemeral, Found any barren height a good retreat From any swarming street, And in the sun saw power superbly wasted; And when the primitive old-fashioned stars Came out again to shine on joys and wars THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY More primitive, and all arrayed for doom, He may have proved a world a sorry thing In his imagining, And life a lighted highway to the tomb. Or, mounting with infirm unsearching tread, His hopes to chaos led, He may have stumbled up there from the past, And with an aching strangeness viewed the last Abysmal conflagration of his dreams,— A flame where nothing seems To burn but flame itself, by nothing fed; And while it all went out, Not even the faint anodyne of doubt May then have eased a painful going down From pictured heights of power and lost renown, Revealed at length to his outlived endeavor Remote and unapproachable forever; And at his heart there may have gnawed Sick memories of a dead faith foiled and flawed And long dishonored by the living death Assigned alike by chance To brutes and hierophants; And anguish fallen on those he loved around him May once have dealt the last blow to confound him, And so have left him as death leaves a child, Who sees it all too near; And he who knows no young way to forget May struggle to the tomb unreconciled. Whatever suns may rise or set There may be nothing kinder for him here Than shafts and agonies; And under these He may cry out and stay on horribly; Or, seeing in death too small a thing to fear, COLLECTED POEMS He may go forward like a stoic Roman Where pangs and terrors in his pathway lie,— Or, seizing the swift logic of a woman, Curse God and die. Or maybe there, like many another one Who might have stood aloft and looked ahead, Black-drawn against wild red, He may have built, unawed by fiery gules That in him no commotion stirred, A living reason out of molecules Why molecules occurred, And one for smiling when he might have sighed Had he seen far enough, And in the same inevitable stuff Discovered an odd reason too for pride In being what he must have been by laws Infrangible and for no kind of cause. Deterred by no confusion or surprise He may have seen with his mechanic eyes A world without a meaning, and had room, Alone amid magnificence and doom, To build himself an airy monument That should, or fail him in his vague intent, Outlast an accidental universe— To call it nothing worse— Or, by the burrowing guile Of Time disintegrated and effaced, Like once-remembered mighty trees go down To ruin, of which by man may now be traced No part sufficient even to be rotten, And in the book of things that are forgotten Is entered as a thing not quite worth while. He may have been so great That satraps would have shivered at his frown, THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY And all he prized alive may rule a state No larger than a grave that holds a clown; He may have been a master of his fate, And of his atoms,—ready as another In his emergence to exonerate His father and his mother; He may have been a captain of a host, Self-eloquent and ripe for prodigies, Doomed here to swell by dangerous degrees, And then give up the ghost. Nahum's great grasshoppers were such as these, Sun-scattered and soon lost. Whatever the dark road he may have taken, This man who stood on high And faced alone the sky, Whatever drove or lured or guided him,— A vision answering a faith unshaken, An easy trust assumed of easy trials, A sick negation born of weak denials, A crazed abhorrence of an old condition. A blind attendance on a brief ambition, Whatever stayed him or derided him, His way was even as ours; And we, with all our wounds and all our powers, Must each await alone at his own height Another darkness or another light; And there, of our poor self dominion reft, If inference and reason shun Hell, Heaven, and Oblivion, May thwarted will (perforce precarious, But for our conservation better thus) Have no misgiving left Of doing yet what here we leave undone Or if unto the last of these we cleave, COLLECTED POEMS Believing or protesting we believe In such an idle and ephemeral Florescence of the diabolical,— If, robbed of two fond old enormities, Our being had no onward auguries, What then were this great love of ours to say For launching other lives to voyage again A little farther into time and pain, A little faster in a futile chase For a kingdom and a power and a Race That would have still in sight A manifest end of ashes and eternal night? Is this the music of the toys we shake So loud,—as if there might be no mistake Somewhere in our indomitable will? Are we no greater than the noise we make Along one blind atomic pilgrimage Whereon by crass chance billeted we go Because our brains and bones and cartilage Will have it so? If this we say, then let us all be still About our share in it, and live and die More quietly thereby. Where was he going, this man against the sky? You know not, nor do I. But this we know, if we know anything: That we may laugh and fight and sing And of our transience here make offering To an orient Word that will not be erased, Or, save in incommunicable gleams Too permanent for dreams, Be found or known. No tonic and ambitious irritant Of increase or of want THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY Has made an otherwise insensate waste Of ages overthrown A ruthless, veiled, implacable foretaste Of other ages that are still to be Depleted and rewarded variously Because a few, by fate's economy, Shall seem to move the world the way it goes; No soft evangel of equality, Safe-cradled in a communal repose That huddles into death and may at last Be covered well with equatorial snows— And all for what, the devil only knows— Will aggregate an inkling to confirm The credit of a sage or of a worm, Or tell us why one man in five Should have a care to stay alive While in his heart he feels no violence Laid on his humor and intelligence When infant Science makes a pleasant face And waves again that hollow toy, the Race; No planetary trap where souls are wrought For nothing but the sake of being caught And sent again to nothing will attune Itself to any key of any reason Why man should hunger through another season To find out why 'twere better late than soon To go away and let the sun and moon And all the silly stars illuminate A place for creeping things, And those that root and trumpet and have wings, And herd and ruminate, Or dive and flash and poise in rivers and seas, Or by their loyal tails in lofty trees Hang screeching lewd victorious derision Of man's immortal vision. COLLECTED POEMS Shall we, because Eternity records Too vast an answer for the time-born words We spell, whereof so many are dead that once In our capricious lexicons Were so alive and final, hear no more The Word itself, the living word That none alive has ever heard Or ever spelt, And few have ever felt Without the fears and old surrenderings And terrors that began When Death let fall a feather from his wings And humbled the first man? Because the weight of our humility, Wherefrom we gain A little wisdom and much pain, Falls here too sore and there too tedious, Are we in anguish or complacency, Not looking far enough ahead To see by what mad couriers we are led Along the roads of the ridiculous, To pity ourselves and laugh at faith And while we curse life bear it? And if we see the soul's dead end in death, Are we to fear it? What folly is here that has not yet a name Unless we say outright that we are liars? What have we seen beyond our sunset fires That lights again the way by which we came? Why pay we such a price, and one we give So clamoringly, for each racked empty day That leads one more last human hope away, As quiet fiends would lead past our crazed eyes Our children to an unseen sacrifice? If after all that we have lived and thought, THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY All comes to Nought,— If there be nothing after Now, And we be nothing anyhow, And we know that,—why live? 'Twere sure but weaklings' vain distress To suffer dungeons where so many doors Will open on the cold eternal shores That look sheer down To the dark tideless floods of Nothingness Where all who know may drown.</field>

There's never the sign of a star in sight, Nor a lamp that's nearer than Tilbury Town. Why do you stare as a dead man might? Where are you pointing away from the light? And where are you going to-night, to-night,— Where are you going, John Evereldown?" "Right through the forest, where none can see, There's where I'm going, to Tilbury Town. The men are asleep,—or awake, may be,— But the women are calling John Evereldown. Ever and ever they call for me, And while they call can a man be free? So right through the forest, where none can see, There's where I'm going, to Tilbury Town." "But why are you going so late, so late,— Why are you going, John Evereldown? Though the road be smooth and the way be straight, There are two long leagues to Tilbury Town. Come in by the fire, old man, and wait! Why do you chatter out there by the gate? And why are you going so late, so late,— Why are you going, John Evereldown?" COLLECTED POEMS "I follow the women wherever they call,— That's why I'm going to Tilbury Town. God knows if I pray to be done with it all, But God is no friend to John Evereldown. So the clouds may come and the rain may fall, The shadows may creep and the dead men crawl,— But I follow the women wherever they call, And that's why I'm going to Tilbury Town." LUKE HAVERGAL Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal, There where the vines cling crimson on the wall, And in the twilight wait for what will come. The leaves will whisper there of her, and some, Like flying words, will strike you as they fall; But go, and if you listen she will call. Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal— Luke Havergal. No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies To rift the fiery night that's in your eyes; But there, where western glooms are gathering, The dark will end the dark, if anything: God slays Himself with every leaf that flies, And hell is more than half of paradise. No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies— In eastern skies. Out of a grave I come to tell you this, Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss That flames upon your forehead with a glow That blinds you to the way that you must go. THREE QUATRAINS Yes, there is yet one way to where she is, Bitter, but one that faith may never miss. Out of a grave I come to tell you this— To tell you this. There is the western gate, Luke Havergal, There are the crimson leaves upon the wall. Go, for the winds are tearing them away,— Nor think to riddle the dead words they say, Nor any more to feel them as they fall; But go, and if you trust her she will call. There is the western gate, Luke Havergal— Luke Havergal. THREE QUATRAINS I As long as Fame's imperious music rings Will poets mock it with crowned words august; And haggard men will clamber to be kings As long as Glory weighs itself in dust. II Drink to the splendor of the unfulfilled, Nor shudder for the revels that are done: The wines that flushed Lucullus are all spilled, The strings that Nero fingered are all gone. III We cannot crown ourselves with everything, Nor can we coax the Fates for us to quarrel: COLLECTED POEMS No matter what we are, or what we sing, Time finds a withered leaf in every laurel. AN OLD STORY Strange that I did not know him then, That friend of mine! I did not even show him then One friendly sign; But cursed him for the ways he had To make me see My envy of the praise he had For praising me. I would have rid the earth of him Once, in my pride. . . . I never knew the worth of him Until he died. BALLADE BY THE FIRE Slowly I smoke and hug my knee, The while a witless masquerade Of things that only children see Floats in a mist of light and shade: They pass, a flimsy cavalcade, And with a weak, remindful glow, The falling embers break and fade, As one by one the phantoms go. BALLADE OF BROKEN FLUTES Then, with a melancholy glee To think where once my fancy strayed, I muse on what the years may be Whose coming tales are all unsaid, Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid Within their shadowed niches, grow By grim degrees to pick and spade, As one by one the phantoms go. But then, what though the mystic Three Around me ply their merry trade?— And Charon soon may carry me Across the gloomy Stygian glade?— Be up, my soul; nor be afraid Of what some unborn year may show; But mind your human debts are paid, As one by one the phantoms go. ENVOY Life is the game that must be played: This truth at least, good friends, we know; So live and laugh, nor be dismayed As one by one the phantoms go. BALLADE OF BROKEN FLUTES (To A. T. Schumann) In dreams I crossed a barren land, A land of ruin, far away; Around me hung on every hand A deathful stillness of decay; And silent, as in bleak dismay COLLECTED POEMS That song should thus forsaken be, On that forgotten ground there lay The broken flutes of Arcady. The forest that was all so grand When pipes and tabors had their sway Stood leafless now, a ghostly band Of skeletons in cold array. A lonely surge of ancient spray Told of an unforgetful sea, But iron blows had hushed for aye The broken flutes of Arcady. No more by summer breezes fanned, The place was desolate and gray; But still my dream was to command New life into that shrunken clay. I tried it. And you scan to-day, With uncommiserating glee, The songs of one who strove to play The broken flutes of Arcady. ENVOY So, Rock, I join the common fray, To fight where Mammon may decree; And leave, to crumble as they may, The broken flutes of Arcady. HER EYES Up from the street and the crowds that went, Morning and midnight, to and fro, Still was the room where his days he spent, And the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow. HER EYES Year after year, with his dream shut fast, He suffered and strove till his eyes were dim, For the love that his brushes had earned at last, And the whole world rang with the praise of him. But he cloaked his triumph, and searched, instead, Till his cheeks were sere and his hairs were gray. "There are women enough, God knows," he said . . . "There are stars enough—when the sun's away." Then he went back to the same still room That had held his dream in the long ago, When he buried his days in a nameless tomb, And the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow. And a passionate humor seized him there— Seized him and held him until there grew Like life on his canvas, glowing and fair, A perilous face—and an angel's too. Angel and maiden, and all in one,— All but the eyes. They were there, but yet They seemed somehow like a soul half done. What was the matter? Did God forget? . . . But he wrought them at last with a skill so sure That her eyes were the eyes of a deathless woman,— With a gleam of heaven to make them pure, And a glimmer of hell to make them human. God never forgets.—And he worships her There in that same still room of his, For his wife, and his constant arbiter Of the world that was and the world that is. COLLECTED POEMS And he wonders yet what her love could be To punish him after that strife so grim; But the longer he lives with her eyes to see, The plainer it all comes back to him. TWO MEN There be two men of all mankind That I should like to know about; But search and question where I will, I cannot ever find them out. Melchizedek, he praised the Lord, And gave some wine to Abraham; But who can tell what else he did Must be more learned than I am. Ucalegon, he lost his house When Agamemnon came to Troy; But who can tell me who he was— I'll pray the gods to give him joy. There be two men of all mankind That I'm forever thinking on: They chase me everywhere I go,— Melchizedek, Ucalegon. VILLANELLE OF CHANGE Since Persia fell at Marathon, The yellow years have gathered fast: Long centuries have come and gone. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL And yet (they say) the place will don A phantom fury of the past, Since Persia fell at Marathon; And as of old, when Helicon Trembled and swayed with rapture vast (Long centuries have come and gone), This ancient plain, when night comes on, Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast, Since Persia fell at Marathon. But into soundless Acheron The glory of Greek shame was cast: Long centuries have come and gone, The suns of Hellas have all shone, The first has fallen to the last:— Since Persia fell at Marathon, Long centuries have come and gone. THE HOUSE ON THE HILL They are all gone away, The House is shut and still, There is nothing more to say. Through broken walls and gray The winds blow bleak and shrill: They are all gone away. Nor is there one to-day To speak them good or ill: There is nothing more to say. COLLECTED POEMS Why is it then we stray Around the sunken sill? They are all gone away, And our poor fancy-play For them is wasted skill: There is nothing more to say. There is ruin and decay In the House on the Hill: They are all gone away, There is nothing more to say. RICHARD CORY Whenever Richard Cory went down town, We people on the pavement looked at him: He was a gentleman from sole to crown, Clean favored, and imperially slim. And he was always quietly arrayed, And he was always human when he talked; But still he fluttered pulses when he said, "Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked. And he was rich—yes, richer than a king— And admirably schooled in every grace: In fine, we thought that he was everything To make us wish that we were in his place. So on we worked, and waited for the light, And went without the meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one calm summer night, Went home and put a bullet through his head. DEAR FRIENDS BOSTON My northern pines are good enough for me, But there's a town my memory uprears— A town that always like a friend appears, And always in the sunrise by the sea. And over it, somehow, there seems to be A downward flash of something new and fierce, That ever strives to clear, but never clears The dimness of a charmed antiquity. CALVARY Friendless and faint, with martyred steps and slow, Faint for the flesh, but for the spirit free, Stung by the mob that came to see the show, The Master toiled along to Calvary; We gibed him, as he went, with houndish glee, Till his dimned eyes for us did overflow; We cursed his vengeless hands thrice wretchedly,— And this was nineteen hundred years ago. But after nineteen hundred years the shame Still clings, and we have not made good the loss That outraged faith has entered in his name. Ah, when shall come love's courage to be strong! Tell me, O Lord—tell me, O Lord, how long Are we to keep Christ writhing on the cross! DEAR FRIENDS Dear friends, reproach me not for what I do, Nor counsel me, nor pity me; nor say That I am wearing half my life away For bubble-work that only fools pursue. COLLECTED POEMS And if my bubbles be too small for you, Blow bigger then your own: the games we play To fill the frittered minutes of a day, Good glasses are to read the spirit through. And whoso reads may get him some shrewd skill; And some unprofitable scorn resign, To praise the very thing that he deplores; So, friends (dear friends), remember, if you will, The shame I win for singing is all mine, The gold I miss for dreaming is all yours. THE STORY OF THE ASHES AND THE FLAME No matter why, nor whence, nor when she came, There was her place. No matter what men said, No matter what she was; living or dead, Faithful or not, he loved her all the same. The story was as old as human shame, But ever since that lonely night she fled, With books to blind him, he had only read The story of the ashes and the flame. There she was always coming pretty soon To fool him back, with penitent scared eyes That had in them the laughter of the moon For baffled lovers, and to make him think— Before she gave him time enough to wink— Her kisses were the keys to Paradise. AMARYLLIS Once, when I wandered in the woods alone, An old man tottered up to me and said, "Come, friend, and see the grave that I have made For Amaryllis." There was in the tone THE PITY OF THE LEAVES Of his complaint such quaver and such moan That I took pity on him and obeyed, And long stood looking where his hands had laid An ancient woman, shrunk to skin and bone. Far out beyond the forest I could hear The calling of loud progress, and the bold Incessant scream of commerce ringing clear; But though the trumpets of the world were glad, It made me lonely and it made me sad To think that Amaryllis had grown old. ZOLA Because he puts the compromising chart Of hell before your eyes, you are afraid; Because he counts the price that you have paid For innocence, and counts it from the start, You loathe him. But he sees the human heart Of God meanwhile, and in His hand was weighed Your squeamish and emasculate crusade Against the grim dominion of his art. Never until we conquer the uncouth Connivings of our shamed indifference (We call it Christian faith) are we to scan The racked and shrieking hideousness of Truth To find, in hate's polluted self-defence Throbbing, the pulse, the divine heart of man. THE PITY OF THE LEAVES Vengeful across the cold November moors, Loud with ancestral shame there came the bleak Sad wind that shrieked, and answered with a shriek, Reverberant through lonely corridors. COLLECTED POEMS The old man heard it; and he heard, perforce, Words out of lips that were no more to speak— Words of the past that shook the old man's cheek Like dead, remembered footsteps on old floors. And then there were the leaves that plagued him so! The brown, thin leaves that on the stones outside Skipped with a freezing whisper. Now and then They stopped, and stayed there—just to let him know How dead they were; but if the old man cried, They fluttered off like withered souls of men. AARON STARK Withal a meagre man was Aaron Stark, Cursed and unkempt, shrewd, shrivelled, and morose. A miser was he, with a miser's nose, And eyes like little dollars in the dark. His thin, pinched mouth was nothing but a mark; And when he spoke there came like sullen blows Through scattered fangs a few snarled words and close, As if a cur were chary of its bark. Glad for the murmur of his hard renown, Year after year he shambled through the town, A loveless exile moving with a staff; And oftentimes there crept into his ears A sound of alien pity, touched with tears,— And then (and only then) did Aaron laugh. THE GARDEN There is a fenceless garden overgrown With buds and blossoms and all sorts of leaves; And once, among the roses and the sheaves, The Gardener and I were there alone. CHARLES CARVILLE'S EYES He led me to the plot where I had thrown The fennel of my days on wasted ground, And in that riot of sad weeds I found The fruitage of a life that was my own. My life! Ah, yes, there was my life, indeed! And there were all the lives of humankind; And they were like a book that I could read, Whose every leaf, miraculously signed, Outrolled itself from Thought's eternal seed. Love-rooted in God's garden of the mind. CLIFF KLINGENHAGEN Cliff Klingenhagen had me in to dine With him one day; and after soup and meat, And all the other things there were to eat, Cliff took two glasses and filled one with wine And one with wormwood. Then, without a sign For me to choose at all, he took the draught Of bitterness himself, and lightly quaffed It off, and said the other one was mine. And when I asked him what the deuce he meant By doing that, he only looked at me And smiled, and said it was a way of his. And though I know the fellow, I have spent Long time a-wondering when I shall be As happy as Cliff Klingenhagen is. CHARLES CARVILLE'S EYES A melancholy face Charles Carville had, But not so melancholy as it seemed, When once you knew him, for his mouth redeemed His insufficient eyes, forever sad: COLLECTED POEMS In them there was no life-glimpse, good or bad, Nor joy nor passion in them ever gleamed; His mouth was all of him that ever beamed, His eyes were sorry, but his mouth was glad. He never was a fellow that said much, And half of what he did say was not heard By many of us: we were out of touch With all his whims and all his theories Till he was dead, so those blank eyes of his Might speak them. Then we heard them, every word. THE DEAD VILLAGE Here there is death. But even here, they say, Here where the dull sun shines this afternoon As desolate as ever the dead moon Did glimmer on dead Sardis, men were gay; And there were little children here to play, With small soft hands that once did keep in tune The strings that stretch from heaven, till too soon The change came, and the music passed away. Now there is nothing but the ghosts of things,— No life, no love, no children, and no men; And over the forgotten place there clings The strange and unrememberable light That is in dreams. The music failed, and then God frowned, and shut the village from His sight. TWO SONNETS TWO SONNETS I Just as I wonder at the twofold screen Of twisted innocence that you would plait For eyes that uncourageously await The coming of a kingdom that has been, So do I wonder what God's love can mean To you that all so strangely estimate The purpose and the consequent estate Of one short shuddering step to the Unseen. No, I have not your backward faith to shrink Lone-faring from the doorway of God's home To find Him in the names of buried men; Nor your ingenious recreance to think We cherish, in the life that is to come, The scattered features of dead friends again. II Never until our souls are strong enough To plunge into the crater of the Scheme— Triumphant in the flash there to redeem Love's handsel and forevermore to slough, Like cerements at a played-out masque, the rough And reptile skins of us whereon we set The stigma of scared years—are we to get Where atoms and the ages are one stuff. Nor ever shall we know the cursed waste Of life in the beneficence divine Of starlight and of sunlight and soul-shine That we have squandered in sin's frail distress, Till we have drunk, and trembled at the taste, The mead of Thought's prophetic endlessness. COLLECTED POEMS THE CLERKS I did not think that I should find them there When I came back again; but there they stood, As in the days they dreamed of when young blood Was in their cheeks and women called them fair. Be sure, they met me with an ancient air,— And yes, there was a shop-worn brotherhood About them; but the men were just as good, And just as human as they ever were. And you that ache so much to be sublime, And you that feed yourselves with your descent, What comes of all your visions and your fears? Poets and kings are but the clerks of Time, Tiering the same dull webs of discontent, Clipping the same sad alnage of the years. FLEMING HELPHENSTINE At first I thought there was a superfine Persuasion in his face; but the free glow That filled it when he stopped and cried, "Hollo!" Shone joyously, and so I let it shine. He said his name was Fleming Helphenstine, But be that as it may;—I only know He talked of this and that and So-and-So, And laughed and chaffed like any friend of mine. But soon, with a queer, quick frown, he looked at me, And I looked hard at him; and there we gazed In a strained way that made us cringe and wince: Then, with a wordless clogged apology That sounded half confused and half amazed, He dodged,—and I have never seen him since. HORACE TO LEUCONOË THOMAS HOOD The man who cloaked his bitterness within This winding-sheet of puns and pleasantries, God never gave to look with common eyes Upon a world of anguish and of sin: His brother was the branded man of Lynn; And there are woven with his jollities The nameless and eternal tragedies That render hope and hopelessness akin. We laugh, and crown him; but anon we feel A still chord sorrow-swept,—a weird unrest; And thin dim shadows home to midnight steal, As if the very ghost of mirth were dead— As if the joys of time to dreams had fled, Or sailed away with Ines to the West. HORACE TO LEUCONOË I pray you not, Leuconoë, to pore With unpermitted eyes on what may be Appointed by the gods for you and me, Nor on Chaldean figures any more. 'T were infinitely better to implore The present only:—whether Jove decree More winters yet to come, or whether he Make even this, whose hard, wave-eaten shore Shatters the Tuscan seas to-day, the last— Be wise withal, and rack your wine, nor fill Your bosom with large hopes; for while I sing, The envious close of time is narrowing;— So seize the day, or ever it be past, And let the morrow come for what it will. COLLECTED POEMS REUBEN BRIGHT Because he was a butcher and thereby Did earn an honest living (and did right), I would not have you think that Reuben Bright Was any more a brute than you or I; For when they told him that his wife must die, He stared at them, and shook with grief and fright, And cried like a great baby half that night, And made the women cry to see him cry. And after she was dead, and he had paid The singers and the sexton and the rest, He packed a lot of things that she had made Most mournfully away in an old chest Of hers, and put some chopped-up cedar boughs In with them, and tore down the slaughter-house. THE ALTAR Alone, remote, nor witting where I went, I found an altar builded in a dream— A fiery place, whereof there was a gleam So swift, so searching, and so eloquent Of upward promise, that love's murmur, blent With sorrow's warning, gave but a supreme Unending impulse to that human stream Whose flood was all for the flame's fury bent. Alas! I said,—the world is in the wrong. But the same quenchless fever of unrest That thrilled the foremost of that martyred throng Thrilled me, and I awoke . . . and was the same Bewildered insect plunging for the flame That burns, and must burn somehow for the best. SONNET THE TAVERN Whenever I go by there nowadays And look at the rank weeds and the strange grass, The torn blue curtains and the broken glass, I seem to be afraid of the old place; And something stiffens up and down my face, For all the world as if I saw the ghost Of old Ham Amory, the murdered host, With his dead eyes turned on me all aglaze. The Tavern has a story, but no man Can tell us what it is. We only know That once long after midnight, years ago, A stranger galloped up from Tilbury Town, Who brushed, and scared, and all but overran That skirt-crazed reprobate, John Evereldown. SONNET Oh for a poet—for a beacon bright To rift this changless glimmer of dead gray; To spirit back the Muses, long astray, And flush Parnassus with a newer light; To put these little sonnet-men to flight Who fashion, in a shrewd mechanic way, Songs without souls, that flicker for a day, To vanish in irrevocable night. What does it mean, this barren age of ours? Here are the men, the women, and the flowers, The seasons, and the sunset, as before. What does it mean? Shall there not one arise To wrench one banner from the western skies, And mark it with his name forevermore? COLLECTED POEMS GEORGE CRABBE Give him the darkest inch your shelf allows, Hide him in lonely garrets, if you will,— But his hard, human pulse is throbbing still With the sure strength that fearless truth endows. In spite of all fine science disavows, Of his plain excellence and stubborn skill There yet remains what fashion cannot kill, Though years have thinned the laurel from his brows. Whether or not we read him, we can feel From time to time the vigor of his name Against us like a finger for the shame And emptiness of what our souls reveal In books that are as altars where we kneel To consecrate the flicker, not the flame. CREDO I cannot find my way: there is no star In all the shrouded heavens anywhere; And there is not a whisper in the air Of any living voice but one so far That I can hear it only as a bar Of lost, imperial music, played when fair And angel fingers wove, and unaware, Dead leaves to garlands where no roses are. No, there is not a glimmer, nor a call, For one that welcomes, welcomes when he fears, The black and awful chaos of the night; For through it all—above, beyond it all— I know the far-sent message of the years, I feel the coming glory of the Light. SONNET ON THE NIGHT OF A FRIEND'S WEDDING If ever I am old, and all alone, I shall have killed one grief, at any rate; For then, thank God, I shall not have to wait Much longer for the sheaves that I have sown. The devil only knows what I have done, But here I am, and here are six or eight Good friends, who most ingenuously prate About my songs to such and such a one. But everything is all askew to-night,— As if the time were come, or almost come, For their untenanted mirage of me To lose itself and crumble out of sight, Like a tall ship that floats above the foam A little while, and then breaks utterly. SONNET The master and the slave go hand in hand, Though touch be lost. The poet is a slave, And there be kings do sorrowfully crave The joyance that a scullion may command. But, ah, the sonnet-slave must understand The mission of his bondage, or the grave May clasp his bones, or ever he shall save The perfect word that is the poet's wand. The sonnet is a crown, whereof the rhymes Are for Thought's purest gold the jewel-stones; But shapes and echoes that are never done Will haunt the workshop, as regret sometimes Will bring with human yearning to sad thrones The crash of battles that are never won. COLLECTED POEMS VERLAINE Why do you dig like long-clawed scavengers To touch the covered corpse of him that fled The uplands for the fens, and rioted Like a sick satyr with doom's worshippers? Come! let the grass grow there; and leave his verse To tell the story of the life he led. Let the man go: let the dead flesh be dead, And let the worms be its biographers. Song sloughs away the sin to find redress In art's complete remembrance: nothing clings For long but laurel to the stricken brow That felt the Muse's finger; nothing less Than hell's fulfilment of the end of things Can blot the star that shines on Paris now. SONNET When we can all so excellently give The measure of love's wisdom with a blow,— Why can we not in turn receive it so, And end this murmur for the life we live? And when we do so frantically strive To win strange faith, why do we shun to know That in love's elemental over-glow God's wholeness gleams with light superlative? Oh, brother men, if you have eyes at all, Look at a branch, a bird, a child, a rose, Or anything God ever made that grows,— Nor let the smallest vision of it slip, Till you may read, as on Belshazzar's wall, The glory of eternal partnership. THE CHORUS OF OLD MEN IN "ÆGEUS" SUPREMACY There is a drear and lonely tract of hell From all the common gloom removed afar: A flat, sad land it is, where shadows are, Whose lorn estate my verse may never tell. I walked among them and I knew them well: Men I had slandered on life's little star For churls and sluggards; and I knew the scar Upon their brows of woe ineffable. But as I went majestic on my way, Into the dark they vanished, one by one, Till, with a shaft of God's eternal day, The dream of all my glory was undone,— And, with a fool's importunate dismay, I heard the dead men singing in the sun. THE CHORUS OF OLD MEN IN "ÆGEUS" Ye gods that have a home beyond the world, Ye that have eyes for all man's agony, Ye that have seen this woe that we have seen,— Look with a just regard, And with an even grace, Here on the shattered corpse of a shattered king, Here on a suffering world where men grow old And wander like sad shadows till, at last, Out of the flare of life, Out of the whirl of years, Into the mist they go, Into the mist of death. COLLECTED POEMS O shades of you that loved him long before The cruel threads of that black sail were spun, May loyal arms and ancient welcomings Receive him once again Who now no longer moves Here in this flickering dance of changing days, Where a battle is lost and won for a withered wreath, And the black master Death is over all To chill with his approach, To level with his touch, The reigning strength of youth, The fluttered heart of age. Woe for the fateful day when Delphi's word was lost— Woe for the loveless prince of Æthra's line! Woe for a father's tears and the curse of a king's release— Woe for the wings of pride and the shafts of doom! And thou, the saddest wind That ever blew from Crete, Sing the fell tidings back to that thrice unhappy ship!— Sing to the western flame, Sing to the dying foam. A dirge for the sundered years and a dirge for the years to be! Better his end had been as the end of a cloudless day, Bright, by the word of Zeus, with a golden star, Wrought of a golden fame, and flung to the central sky, To gleam on a stormless tomb for evermore:— Whether or not there fell To the touch of an alien hand The sheen of his purple robe and the shine of his diadem, Better his end had been To die as an old man dies,— But the fates are ever the fates, and a crown is ever a crown. THE WILDERNESS THE WILDERNESS Come away! come away! there's a frost along the marshes, And a frozen wind that skims the shoal where it shakes the dead black water; There's a moan across the lowland and a wailing through the woodland Of a dirge that sings to send us back to the arms of those that love us. There is nothing left but ashes now where the crimson chills of autumn Put off the summer's languor with a touch that made us glad For the glory that is gone from us, with a flight we cannot follow, To the slopes of other valleys and the sounds of other shores. Come away! come away! you can hear them calling, calling, Calling us to come to them, and roam no more. Over there beyond the ridges and the land that lies between us, There's an old song calling us to come! Come away! come away!—for the scenes we leave behind us Are barren for the lights of home and a flame that's young forever; And the lonely trees around us creak the warning of the night-wind, That love and all the dreams of love are away beyond the mountains. The songs that call for us to-night, they have called for men before us, And the winds that blow the message, they have blown ten thousand years; But this will end our wander-time, for we know the joy that waits us In the strangeness of home-coming, and a woman's waiting eyes. COLLECTED POEMS Come away! come away! there is nothing now to cheer us— Nothing now to comfort us, but love's road home:— Over there beyond the darkness there's a window gleams to greet us, And a warm hearth waits for us within. Come away! come away!—or the roving-fiend will hold us, And make us all to dwell with him to the end of human faring: There are no men yet may leave him when his hands are clutched upon them, There are none will own his enmity, there are none will call him brother. So we'll be up and on the way, and the less we boast the better For the freedom that God gave us and the dread we do not know:— The frost that skips the willow-leaf will again be back to blight it, And the doom we cannot fly from is the doom we do not see. Come away! come away! there are dead men all around us— Frozen men that mock us with a wild, hard laugh That shrieks and sinks and whimpers in the shrill November rushes, And the long fall wind on the lake. OCTAVES I We thrill too strangely at the master's touch; We shrink too sadly from the larger self Which for its own completeness agitates And undetermines us; we do not feel— We dare not feel it yet—the splendid shame Of uncreated failure; we forget, OCTAVES The while we groan, that God's accomplishment Is always and unfailingly at hand. II Tumultuously void of a clean scheme Whereon to build, whereof to formulate, The legion life that riots in mankind Goes ever plunging upward, up and down, Most like some crazy regiment at arms, Undisciplined of aught but Ignorance, And ever led resourcelessly along To brainless carnage by drunk trumpeters. III To me the groaning of world-worshippers Rings like a lonely music played in hell By one with art enough to cleave the walls Of heaven with his cadence, but without The wisdom or the will to comprehend The strangeness of his own perversity, And all without the courage to deny The profit and the pride of his defeat. IV While we are drilled in error, we are lost Alike to truth and usefulness. We think We are great warriors now, and we can brag Like Titans; but the world is growing young, And we, the fools of time, are growing with it:— We do not fight to-day, we only die; We are too proud of death, and too ashamed Of God, to know enough to be alive. COLLECTED POEMS V There is one battle-field whereon we fall Triumphant and unconquered; but, alas! We are too fleshly fearful of ourselves To fight there till our days are whirled and blurred By sorrow, and the ministering wheels Of anguish take us eastward, where the clouds Of human gloom are lost against the gleam That shines on Thought's impenetrable mail. VI When we shall hear no more the cradle-songs Of ages—when the timeless hymns of Love Defeat them and outsound them—we shall know The rapture of that large release which all Right science comprehends; and we shall read, With unoppressed and unoffended eyes, That record of All-Soul whereon God writes In everlasting runes the truth of Him. VII The guerdon of new childhood is repose:— Once he has read the primer of right thought, A man may claim between two smithy strokes Beatitude enough to realize God's parallel completeness in the vague And incommensurable excellence That equitably uncreates itself And makes a whirlwind of the Universe. VIII There is no loneliness:—no matter where We go, nor whence we come, nor what good friends OCTAVES Forsake us in the seeming, we are all At one with a complete companionship; And though forlornly joyless be the ways We travel, the compensate spirit-gleams Of Wisdom shaft the darkness here and there, Like scattered lamps in unfrequented streets. IX When one that you and I had all but sworn To be the purest thing God ever made Bewilders us until at last it seems An angel has come back restigmatized,— Faith wavers, and we wonder what there is On earth to make us faithful any more, But never are quite wise enough to know The wisdom that is in that wonderment. X Where does a dead man go?—The dead man dies; But the free life that would no longer feed On fagots of outburned and shattered flesh Wakes to a thrilled invisible advance, Unchained (or fettered else) of memory; And when the dead man goes it seems to me 'T were better for us all to do away With weeping, and be glad that he is gone. XI Still through the dusk of dead, blank-legended, And unremunerative years we search To get where life begins, and still we groan Because we do not find the living spark COLLECTED POEMS Where no spark ever was; and thus we die, Still searching, like poor old astronomers Who totter off to bed and go to sleep, To dream of untriangulated stars. XII With conscious eyes not yet sincere enough To pierce the glimmered cloud that fluctuates Between me and the glorifying light That screens itself with knowledge, I discern The searching rays of wisdom that reach through The mist of shame's infirm credulity, And infinitely wonder if hard words Like mine have any message for the dead. XIII I grant you friendship is a royal thing, But none shall ever know that royalty For what it is till he has realized His best friend in himself. 'T is then, perforce, That man's unfettered faith indemnifies Of its own conscious freedom the old shame, And love's revealed infinitude supplants Of its own wealth and wisdom the old scorn. XIV Though the sick beast infect us, we are fraught Forever with indissoluble Truth, Wherein redress reveals itself divine, Transitional, transcendent. Grief and loss, Disease and desolation, are the dreams Of wasted excellence; and every dream OCTAVES Has in it something of an ageless fact That flouts deformity and laughs at years. XV We lack the courage to be where we are:— We love too much to travel on old roads, To triumph on old fields; we love too much To consecrate the magic of dead things, And yieldingly to linger by long walls Of ruin, where the ruinous moonlight That sheds a lying glory on old stones Befriends us with a wizard's enmity. XVI Something as one with eyes that look below The battle-smoke to glimpse the foeman's charge, We through the dust of downward years may scan The onslaught that awaits this idiot world Where blood pays blood for nothing, and where life Pays life to madness, till at last the ports Of gilded helplessness be battered through By the still crash of salvatory steel. XVII To you that sit with Sorrow like chained slaves, And wonder if the night will ever come, I would say this: The night will never come, And sorrow is not always. But my words Are not enough; your eyes are not enough; The soul itself must insulate the Real. Or ever you do cherish in this life— In this life or in any life—repose. COLLECTED POEMS XVIII Like a white wall whereon forever breaks Unsatisfied the tumult of green seas, Man's unconjectured godliness rebukes With its imperial silence the lost waves Of insufficient grief. This mortal surge That beats against us now is nothing else Than plangent ignorance. Truth neither shakes Nor wavers; but the world shakes, and we shriek. XIX Nor jewelled phrase nor mere mellifluous rhyme Reverberates aright, or ever shall, One cadence of that infinite plain-song Which is itself all music. Stronger notes Than any that have ever touched the world Must ring to tell it—ring like hammer-blows, Right-echoed of a chime primordial, On anvils, in the gleaming of God's forge. XX The prophet of dead words defeats himself: Whoever would acknowledge and include The foregleam and the glory of the real, Must work with something else than pen and ink And painful preparation: he must work With unseen implements that have no names, And he must win withal, to do that work, Good fortitude, clean wisdom, and strong skill. XXI To curse the chilled insistence of the dawn Because the free gleam lingers; to defraud TWO QUATRAINS The constant opportunity that lives Unchallenged in all sorrow; to forget For this large prodigality of gold That larger generosity of thought,— These are the fleshly clogs of human greed, The fundamental blunders of mankind. XXII Forebodings are the fiends of Recreance; The master of the moment, the clean seer Of ages, too securely scans what is, Ever to be appalled at what is not; He sees beyond the groaning borough lines Of Hell, God's highways gleaming, and he knows That Love's complete communion is the end Of anguish to the liberated man. XXIII Here by the windy docks I stand alone, But yet companioned. There the vessel goes, And there my friend goes with it; but the wake That melts and ebbs between that friend and me Love's earnest is of Life's all-purposeful And all-triumphant sailing, when the ships Of Wisdom loose their fretful chains and swing Forever from the crumbled wharves of Time. TWO QUATRAINS I As eons of incalculable strife Are in the vision of one moment caught, So are the common, concrete things of life Divinely shadowed on the walls of Thought. COLLECTED POEMS II We shriek to live, but no man ever lives Till he has rid the ghost of human breath; We dream to die, but no man ever dies Till he has quit the road that runs to death. THE TORRENT I found a torrent falling in a glen Where the sun's light shone silvered and leaf-split; The boom, the foam, and the mad flash of it All made a magic symphony; but when I thought upon the coming of hard men To cut those patriarchal trees away, And turn to gold the silver of that spray, I shuddered. Yet a gladness now and then Did wake me to myself till I was glad In earnest, and was welcoming the time For screaming saws to sound above the chime Of idle waters, and for me to know The jealous visionings that I had had Were steps to the great place where trees and torrents go. L'ENVOI Now in a thought, now in a shadowed word, Now in a voice that thrills eternity, Ever there comes an onward phrase to me Of some transcendent music I have heard; No piteous thing by soft hands dulcimered, No trumpet crash of blood-sick victory, But a glad strain of some vast harmony That no brief mortal touch has ever stirred. L'ENVOI There is no music in the world like this, No character wherewith to set it down, No kind of instrument to make it sing. No kind of instrument? Ah, yes, there is; And after time and place are overthrown, God's touch will keep its one chord quivering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CAPTAIN CRAIG, ETC. (1902) To the Memory of John Hays Gardiner CAPTAIN CRAIG I I doubt if ten men in all Tilbury Town Had ever shaken hands with Captain Craig, Or called him by his name, or looked at him So curiously, or so concernedly, As they had looked at ashes; but a few— Say five or six of us—had found somehow The spark in him, and we had fanned it there, Choked under, like a jest in Holy Writ, By Tilbury prudence. He had lived his life And in his way had shared, with all mankind, Inveterate leave to fashion of himself, By some resplendent metamorphosis, Whatever he was not. And after time, When it had come sufficiently to pass That he was going patch-clad through the streets, Weak, dizzy, chilled, and half starved, he had laid Some nerveless fingers on a prudent sleeve, And told the sleeve, in furtive confidence, Just how it was: "My name is Captain Craig," He said, "and I must eat." The sleeve moved on, And after it moved others—one or two; For Captain Craig, before the day was done, Got back to the scant refuge of his bed And shivered into it without a curse— Without a murmur even. He was cold, COLLECTED POEMS And old, and hungry; but the worst of it Was a forlorn familiar consciousness That he had failed again. There was a time When he had fancied, if worst came to worst, And he could do no more, that he might ask Of whom he would. But once had been enough, And soon there would be nothing more to ask. He was himself, and he had lost the speed He started with, and he was left behind. There was no mystery, no tragedy; And if they found him lying on his back Stone dead there some sharp morning, as they might,— Well, once upon a time there was a man— Es war einmal ein Konig, if it pleased him. And he was right: there were no men to blame: There was just a false note in the Tilbury tune— A note that able-bodied men might sound Hosannas on while Captain Craig lay quiet. They might have made him sing by feeding him Till he should march again, but probably Such yielding would have jeopardized the rhythm; They found it more melodious to shout Right on, with unmolested adoration, To keep the tune as it had always been, To trust in God, and let the Captain starve. He must have understood that afterwards— When we had laid some fuel to the spark Of him, and oxidized it—for he laughed Out loud and long at us to feel it burn, And then, for gratitude, made game of us: "You are the resurrection and the life," He said, "and I the hymn the Brahmin sings; O Fuscus! and we'll go no more a-roving." CAPTAIN CRAIG We were not quite accoutred for a blast Of any lettered nonchalance like that, And some of us—the five or six of us Who found him out—were singularly struck. But soon there came assurance of his lips, Like phrases out of some sweet instrument Man's hand had never fitted, that he felt "No penitential shame for what had come, No virtuous regret for what had been,— But rather a joy to find it in his life To be an outcast usher of the soul For such as had good courage of the Sun To pattern Love." The Captain had one chair; And on the bottom of it, like a king, For longer time than I dare chronicle, Sat with an ancient ease and eulogized His opportunity. My friends got out, Like brokers out of Arcady; but I— May be for fascination of the thing, Or may be for the larger humor of it— Stayed listening, unwearied and unstung. When they were gone the Captain's tuneful ooze Of rhetoric took on a change; he smiled At me and then continued, earnestly: "Your friends have had enough of it; but you, For a motive hardly vindicated yet By prudence or by conscience, have remained; And that is very good, for I have things To tell you: things that are not words alone— Which are the ghosts of things—but something firmer. "First, would I have you know, for every gift Or sacrifice, there are—or there may be— Two kinds of gratitude: the sudden kind We feel for what we take, the larger kind We feel for what we give. Once we have learned COLLECTED POEMS As much as this, we know the truth has been Told over to the world a thousand times;— But we have had no ears to listen yet For more than fragments of it: we have heard A murmur now and then, an echo here And there, and we have made great music of it; And we have made innumerable books To please the Unknown God. Time throws away Dead thousands of them, but the God that knows No death denies not one: the books all count, The songs all count; and yet God's music has No modes, his language has no adjectives." "You may be right, you may be wrong," said I; "But what has this that you are saying now— This nineteenth-century Nirvana-talk— To do with you and me?" The Captain raised His hand and held it westward, where a patched And unwashed attic-window filtered in What barren light could reach us, and then said, With a suave, complacent resonance: "There shines The sun. Behold it. We go round and round, And wisdom comes to us with every whirl We count throughout the circuit. We may say The child is born, the boy becomes a man, The man does this and that, and the man goes,— But having said it we have not said much, Not very much. Do I fancy, or you think, That it will be the end of anything When I am gone? There was a soldier once Who fought one fight and in that fight fell dead. Sad friends went after, and they brought him home And had a brass band at his funeral, As you should have at mine; and after that A few remembered him. But he was dead, CAPTAIN CRAIG They said, and they should have their friend no more.— However, there was once a starveling child— A ragged-vested little incubus, Born to be cuffed and frighted out of all Capacity for childhood's happiness— Who started out one day, quite suddenly, To drown himself. He ran away from home, Across the clover-fields and through the woods, And waited on a rock above a stream, Just like a kingfisher. He might have dived, Or jumped, or he might not; but anyhow, There came along a man who looked at him With such an unexpected friendliness, And talked with him in such a common way, That life grew marvelously different: What he had lately known for sullen trunks And branches, and a world of tedious leaves, Was all transmuted; a faint forest wind That once had made the loneliest of all Sad sounds on earth, made now the rarest music; And water that had called him once to death Now seemed a flowing glory. And that man, Born to go down a soldier, did this thing. Not much to do? Not very much, I grant you: Good occupation for a sonneteer, Or for a clown, or for a clergyman, But small work for a soldier. By the way, When you are weary sometimes of your own Utility, I wonder if you find Occasional great comfort pondering What power a man has in him to put forth? `Of all the many marvelous things that are, Nothing is there more marvelous than man,' Said Sophocles; and he lived long ago; `And earth, unending ancient of the gods COLLECTED POEMS He furrows; and the ploughs go back and forth, Turning the broken mould, year after year.' . . . "I turned a little furrow of my own Once on a time, and everybody laughed— As I laughed afterwards; and I doubt not The First Intelligence, which we have drawn In our competitive humility As if it went forever on two legs, Had some diversion of it: I believe God's humor is the music of the spheres— But even as we draft omnipotence Itself to our own image, we pervert The courage of an infinite ideal To finite resignation. You have made The cement of your churches out of tears And ashes, and the fabric will not stand: The shifted walls that you have coaxed and shored So long with unavailing compromise Will crumble down to dust and blow away, And younger dust will follow after them; Though not the faintest or the farthest whirled First atom of the least that ever flew Shall be by man defrauded of the touch God thrilled it with to make a dream for man When Science was unborn. And after time, When we have earned our spiritual ears, And art's commiseration of the truth No longer glorifies the singing beast, Or venerates the clinquant charlatan,— Then shall at last come ringing through the sun, Through time, through flesh, a music that is true. For wisdom is that music, and all joy That wisdom:—you may counterfeit, you think, The burden of it in a thousand ways; CAPTAIN CRAIG But as the bitterness that loads your tears Makes Dead Sea swimming easy, so the gloom, The penance, and the woeful pride you keep, Make bitterness your buoyance of the world. And at the fairest and the frenziedest Alike of your God-fearing festivals, You so compound the truth to pamper fear That in the doubtful surfeit of your faith You clamor for the food that shadows eat. You call it rapture or deliverance,— Passion or exaltation, or what most The moment needs, but your faint-heartedness Lives in it yet: you quiver and you clutch For something larger, something unfulfilled, Some wiser kind of joy that you shall have Never, until you learn to laugh with God." And with a calm Socratic patronage, At once half sombre and half humorous, The Captain reverently twirled his thumbs And fixed his eyes on something far away; Then, with a gradual gaze, conclusive, shrewd, And at the moment unendurable For sheer beneficence, he looked at me. "But the brass band?" I said, not quite at ease With altruism yet.—He made a sort Of reminiscent little inward noise, Midway between a chuckle and a laugh, And that was all his answer: not a word Of explanation or suggestion came From those tight-smiling lips. And when I left, I wondered, as I trod the creaking snow And had the world-wide air to breathe again,— Though I had seen the tremor of his mouth And honored the endurance of his hand— COLLECTED POEMS Whether or not, securely closeted Up there in the stived haven of his den, The man sat laughing at me; and I felt My teeth grind hard together with a quaint Revulsion—as I recognize it now— Not only for my Captain, but as well For every smug-faced failure on God's earth; Albeit I could swear, at the same time, That there were tears in the old fellow's eyes. I question if in tremors or in tears There be more guidance to man's worthiness Than—well, say in his prayers. But oftentimes It humors us to think that we possess By some divine adjustment of our own Particular shrewd cells, or something else, What others, for untutored sympathy, Go spirit-fishing more than half their lives To catch—like cheerful sinners to catch faith; And I have not a doubt but I assumed Some egotistic attribute like this When, cautiously, next morning I reduced The fretful qualms of my novitiate, For most part, to an undigested pride. Only, I live convinced that I regret This enterprise no more than I regret My life; and I am glad that I was born. That evening, at "The Chrysalis," I found The faces of my comrades all suffused With what I chose then to denominate Superfluous good feeling. In return, They loaded me with titles of odd form And unexemplified significance, Like "Bellows-mender to Prince Æolus," CAPTAIN CRAIG "Pipe-filler to the Hoboscholiast," "Bread-fruit for the Non-Doing," with one more That I remember, and a dozen more That I forget. I may have been disturbed, I do not say that I was not annoyed, But something of the same serenity That fortified me later made me feel For their skin-pricking arrows not so much Of pain as of a vigorous defect In this world's archery. I might have tried, With a flat facetiousness, to demonstrate What they had only snapped at and thereby Made out of my best evidence no more Than comfortable food for their conceit; But patient wisdom frowned on argument, With a side nod for silence, and I smoked A series of incurable dry pipes While Morgan fiddled, with obnoxious care, Things that I wished he wouldn't. Killigrew, Drowsed with a fond abstraction, like an ass, Lay blinking at me while he grinned and made Remarks. The learned Plunket made remarks. It may have been for smoke that I cursed cats That night, but I have rather to believe As I lay turning, twisting, listening, And wondering, between great sleepless yawns, What possible satisfaction those dead leaves Could find in sending shadows to my room And swinging them like black rags on a line, That I, with a forlorn clear-headedness Was ekeing out probation. I had sinned In fearing to believe what I believed, And I was paying for it.—Whimsical, You think,—factitious; but "there is no luck, COLLECTED POEMS No fate, no fortune for us, but the old Unswerving and inviolable price Gets paid: God sells himself eternally, But never gives a crust," my friend had said; And while I watched those leaves, and heard those cats, And with half mad minuteness analyzed The Captain's attitude and then my own, I felt at length as one who throws himself Down restless on a couch when clouds are dark, And shuts his eyes to find, when he wakes up And opens them again, what seems at first An unfamiliar sunlight in his room And in his life—as if the child in him Had laughed and let him see; and then I knew Some prowling superfluity of child In me had found the child in Captain Craig And let the sunlight reach him. While I slept, My thought reshaped itself to friendly dreams, And in the morning it was with me still. Through March and shifting April to the time When winter first becomes a memory My friend the Captain—to my other friend's Incredulous regret that such as he Should ever get the talons of his talk So fixed in my unfledged credulity— Kept up the peroration of his life, Not yielding at a threshold, nor, I think, Too often on the stairs. He made me laugh Sometimes, and then again he made me weep Almost; for I had insufficiency Enough in me to make me know the truth Within the jest, and I could feel it there As well as if it were the folded note I felt between my fingers. I had said CAPTAIN CRAIG Before that I should have to go away And leave him for the season; and his eyes Had shone with well-becoming interest At that intelligence. There was no mist In them that I remember; but I marked An unmistakable self-questioning And a reticence of unassumed regret. The two together made anxiety— Not selfishness, I ventured. I should see No more of him for six or seven months, And I was there to tell him as I might What humorous provision we had made For keeping him locked up in Tilbury Town. That finished—with a few more commonplace Prosaics on the certified event Of my return to find him young again— I left him neither vexed, I thought, with us, Nor over much at odds with destiny. At any rate, save always for a look That I had seen too often to mistake Or to forget, he gave no other sign. That train began to move; and as it moved, I felt a comfortable sudden change All over and inside. Partly it seemed As if the strings of me had all at once Gone down a tone or two; and even though It made me scowl to think so trivial A touch had owned the strength to tighten them, It made me laugh to think that I was free. But free from what—when I began to turn The question round—was more than I could say: I was no longer vexed with Killigrew, Nor more was I possessed with Captain Craig; But I was eased of some restraint, I thought, COLLECTED POEMS Not qualified by those amenities, And I should have to search the matter down; For I was young, and I was very keen. So I began to smoke a bad cigar That Plunket, in his love, had given me The night before; and as I smoked I watched The flying mirrors for a mile or so, Till to the changing glimpse, now sharp, now faint, They gave me of the woodland over west, A gleam of long-forgotten strenuous years Came back, when we were Red Men on the trail, With Morgan for the big chief Wocky-Bocky; And yawning out of that I set myself To face again the loud monotonous ride That lay before me like a vista drawn Of bag-racks to the fabled end of things. II Yet that ride had an end, as all rides have; And the days coming after took the road That all days take,—though never one of them Went by but I got some good thought of it For Captain Craig. Not that I pitied him, Or nursed a mordant hunger for his presence; But what I thought (what Killigrew still thinks) An irremediable cheerfulness Was in him and about the name of him, And I fancy that it may be most of all For cheer in them that I have saved his letters. I like to think of him, and how he looked— Or should have looked—in his renewed estate, Composing them. They may be dreariness Unspeakable to you that never saw The Captain; but to five or six of us CAPTAIN CRAIG Who knew him they are not so bad as that. It may be we have smiled not always where The text itself would seem to indicate Responsive titillation on our part,— Yet having smiled at all we have done well, Knowing that we have touched the ghost of him. He tells me that he thinks of nothing now That he would rather do than be himself, Wisely alive. So let us heed this man:— "The world that has been old is young again, The touch that faltered clings; and this is May. So think of your decrepit pensioner As one who cherishes the living light, Forgetful of dead shadows. He may gloat, And he may not have power in his arms To make the young world move; but he has eyes And ears, and he can read the sun. Therefore Think first of him as one who vegetates In tune with all the children who laugh best And longest through the sunshine, though far off Their laughter, and unheard; for 't is the child, O friend, that with his laugh redeems the man. Time steals the infant, but the child he leaves; And we, we fighters over of old wars— We men, we shearers of the Golden Fleece— Were brutes without him,—brutes to tear the scars Of one another's wounds and weep in them, And then cry out on God that he should flaunt For life such anguish and flesh-wretchedness. But let the brute go roaring his own way: We do not need him, and he loves us not. "I cannot think of anything to-day That I would rather do than be myself, COLLECTED POEMS Primevally alive, and have the sun Shine into me; for on a day like this, When chaff-parts of a man's adversities Are blown by quick spring breezes out of him— When even a flicker of wind that wakes no more Than a tuft of grass, or a few young yellow leaves, Comes like the falling of a prophet's breath On altar-flames rekindled of crushed embers,— Then do I feel, now do I feel, within me No dreariness, no grief, no discontent, No twinge of human envy. But I beg That you forego credentials of the past For these illuminations of the present, Or better still, to give the shadow justice, You let me tell you something: I have yearned In many another season for these days, And having them with God's own pageantry To make me glad for them,—yes, I have cursed The sunlight and the breezes and the leaves To think of men on stretchers or on beds, Or on foul floors, things without shapes or names, Made human with paralysis and rags; Or some poor devil on a battle-field, Left undiscovered and without the strength To drag a maggot from his clotted mouth; Or women working where a man would fall— Flat-breasted miracles of cheerfulness Made neuter by the work that no man counts Until it waits undone; children thrown out To feed their veins and souls on offal . . . Yes, I have had half a mind to blow my brains out Sometimes; and I have gone from door to door, Ragged myself, trying to do something— Crazy, I hope.—But what has this to do With Spring? Because one half of humankind CAPTAIN CRAIG Lives here in hell, shall not the other half Do any more than just for conscience' sake Be miserable? Is this the way for us To lead these creatures up to find the light,— Or to be drawn down surely to the dark Again? Which is it? What does the child say? "But let us not make riot for the child Untaught, nor let us hold that we may read The sun but through the shadows; nor, again, Be we forgetful ever that we keep The shadows on their side. For evidence, I might go back a little to the days When I had hounds and credit, and grave friends To borrow my books and set wet glasses on them, And other friends of all sorts, grave and gay, Of whom one woman and one man stand out From all the rest, this morning. The man said One day, as we were riding, `Now, you see, There goes a woman cursed with happiness: Beauty and wealth, health, horses,—everything That she could ask, or we could ask, is hers, Except an inward eye for the dim fact Of what this dark world is. The cleverness God gave her—or the devil—cautions her That she must keep the china cup of life Filled somehow, and she fills it—runs it over— Claps her white hands while some one does the sopping With fingers made, she thinks, for just that purpose, Giggles and eats and reads and goes to church, Makes pretty little penitential prayers, And has an eighteen-carat crucifix Wrapped up in chamois-skin. She gives enough, You say; but what is giving like hers worth? COLLECTED POEMS What is a gift without the soul to guide it? "Poor dears, and they have cancers?—Oh!" she says; And away she works at that new altar-cloth For the Reverend Hieronymus Mackintosh— Third person, Jerry. "Jerry," she says, "can say Such lovely things, and make life seem so sweet!" Jerry can drink, also.—And there she goes, Like a whirlwind through an orchard in the springtime— Throwing herself away as if she thought The world and the whole planetary circus Were a flourish of apple-blossoms. Look at her! And here is this infernal world of ours— And hers, if only she might find it out— Starving and shrieking, sickening, suppurating, Whirling to God knows where . . . But look at her!' "And after that it came about somehow, Almost as if the Fates were killing time, That she, the spendthrift of a thousand joys, Rode in her turn with me, and in her turn Made observations: `Now there goes a man,' She said, `who feeds his very soul on poison: No matter what he does, or where he looks, He finds unhappiness; or, if he fails To find it, he creates it, and then hugs it: Pygmalion again for all the world— Pygmalion gone wrong. You know I think If when that precious animal was young, His mother, or some watchful aunt of his, Had spanked him with Pendennis and Don Juan, And given him the Lady of the Lake, Or Cord and Creese, or almost anything, There might have been a tonic for him? Listen: When he was possibly nineteen years old CAPTAIN CRAIG He came to me and said, "I understand You are in love"—yes, that is what he said,— "But never mind, it won't last very long; It never does; we all get over it. We have this clinging nature, for you see The Great Bear shook himself once on a time And the world is one of many that let go." And yet the creature lives, and there you see him And he would have this life no fairer thing Than a certain time for numerous marionettes To do the Dance of Death. Give him a rose, And he will tell you it is very sweet, But only for a day. Most wonderful! Show him a child, or anything that laughs, And he begins at once to crunch his wormwood And then runs on with his "realities." What does he know about realities, Who sees the truth of things almost as well As Nero saw the Northern Lights? Good gracious! Can't you do something with him? Call him something— Call him a type, and that will make him cry: One of those not at all unusual, Prophetic, would-be-Delphic manger-snappers That always get replaced when they are gone; Or one of those impenetrable men, Who seem to carry branded on their foreheads, "We are abstruse, but not quite so abstruse As possibly the good Lord may have wished;" One of those men who never quite confess That Washington was great;—the kind of man That everybody knows and always will,— Shrewd, critical, facetious, insincere, And for the most part harmless, I'm afraid. But even then, you might be doing well To tell him something.'—And I said I would. COLLECTED POEMS "So in one afternoon you see we have The child in absence—or, to say the least, In ominous defect,—and in excess Commensurate, likewise. Now the question is, Not which was right and which was wrong, for each, By virtue of one-sidedness, was both; But rather—to my mind, as heretofore— Is it better to be blinded by the lights, Or by the shadows? By the lights, you say? The shadows are all devils, and the lights Gleam guiding and eternal? Very good; But while you say so do not quite forget That sunshine has a devil of its own, And one that we, for the great craft of him, But vaguely recognize. The marvel is That this persuasive and especial devil, By grace of his extreme transparency, Precludes all common vision of him; yet There is one way to glimpse him and a way, As I believe, to test him,—granted once That we have ousted prejudice, which means That we have made magnanimous advance Through self-acquaintance. Not an easy thing For some of us; impossible, may be, For most of us: the woman and the man I cited, for example, would have wrought The most intractable conglomerate Of everything, if they had set themselves To analyze themselves and not each other; If only for the sake of self-respect, They would have come to no place but the same Wherefrom they started; one would have lived awhile In paradise without defending it, And one in hell without enjoying it; And each had been dissuaded neither more CAPTAIN CRAIG Nor less thereafter. There are such on earth As might have been composed primarily For mortal warning: he was one of them, And she—the devil makes us hesitate. 'T is easy to read words writ well with ink That makes a good black mark on smooth white paper; But words are done sometimes with other ink Whereof the smooth white paper gives no sign Till science brings it out; and here we come To knowledge, and the way to test a devil. "To most of us, you say, and you say well, This demon of the sunlight is a stranger; But if you break the sunlight of yourself, Project it, and observe the quaint shades of it, I have a shrewd suspicion you may find That even as a name lives unrevealed In ink that waits an agent, so it is The devil—or this devil—hides himself To all the diagnoses we have made Save one. The quest of him is hard enough— As hard as truth; but once we seem to know That his compound obsequiousness prevails Unferreted within us, we may find That sympathy, which aureoles itself To superfluity from you and me, May stand against the soul for five or six Persistent and indubitable streaks Of irritating brilliance, out of which A man may read, if he have knowledge in him, Proportionate attest of ignorance, Hypocrisy, good-heartedness, conceit, Indifference,—by which a man may learn That even courage may not make him glad For laughter when that laughter is itself COLLECTED POEMS The tribute of recriminating groans. Nor are the shapes of obsolescent creeds Much longer to flit near enough to make Men glad for living in a world like this; For wisdom, courage, knowledge, and the faith Which has the soul and is the soul of reason— These are the world's achievers. And the child— The child that is the saviour of all ages, The prophet and the poet, the crown-bearer, Must yet with Love's unhonored fortitude, Survive to cherish and attain for us The candor and the generosity, By leave of which we smile if we bring back The first revealing flash that wakened us When wisdom like a shaft of dungeon-light Came searching down to find us. "Halfway back I made a mild allusion to the Fates, Not knowing then that ever I should have Dream-visions of them, painted on the air,— Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos. Faint-hued They seem, but with a faintness never fading, Unblurred by gloom, unshattered by the sun, Still with eternal color, colorless, They move and they remain. The while I write These very words I see them,—Atropos, Lachesis, Clotho; and the last is laughing. When Clotho laughs, Atropos rattles her shears; But Clotho keeps on laughing just the same. Some time when I have dreamed that Atropos Has laughed, I'll tell you how the colors change— The colors that are changeless, colorless." CAPTAIN CRAIG I fear I may have answered Captain Craig's Epistle Number One with what he chose, Good-humoredly but anxiously, to take For something that was not all reverence; From Number Two it would have seemed almost As if the flanges of the old man's faith Had slipped the treacherous rails of my allegiance, Leaving him by the roadside, humorously Upset, with nothing more convivial To do than be facetious and austere:— "If you decry Don César de Bazan, There is an imperfection in your vitals. Flamboyant and old-fashioned? Overdone? Romantico-robustious?—Dear young man, There are fifteen thousand ways to be one-sided, And I have indicated two of them Already. Now you bait me with a third— As if it were a spider with nine legs; But what it is that you would have me do, What fatherly wrath you most anticipate, I lack the needed impulse to discern; Though I who shape no songs of any sort, I who have made no music, thrilled no canvas,— I who have added nothing to the world The world would reckon save long-squandered wit— Might with half-pardonable reverence Beguile my faith, maybe, to the forlorn Extent of some sequestered murmuring Anent the vanities. No doubt I should, If mine were the one life that I have lived; But with a few good glimpses I have had Of heaven through the little holes in hell, I can half understand what price it is The poet pays, at one time and another, COLLECTED POEMS For those indemnifying interludes That are to be the kernel in what lives To shrine him when the new-born men come singing. "So do I comprehend what I have read From even the squeezed items of account Which I have to my credit in that book Whereof the leaves are ages and the text Eternity. What do I care to-day For pages that have nothing? I have lived, And I have died, and I have lived again; And I am very comfortable. Yes, Though I look back through barren years enough To make me seem—as I transmute myself In downward retrospect from what I am— As unproductive and as unconvinced Of living bread and the soul's eternal draught As a frog on a Passover-cake in a streamless desert,— Still do I trust the light that I have earned, And having earned, received. You shake your head, But do not say that you will shake it off. "Meanwhile I have the flowers and the grass, My brothers here the trees, and all July To make me joyous. Why do you shake your head? Why do you laugh?—because you are so young? Do you think if you laugh hard enough the truth Will go to sleep? Do you think of any couch Made soft enough to put the truth to sleep? Do you think there are no proper comedies But yours that have the fashion? For example, Do you think that I forget, or shall forget, One friendless, fat, fantastic nondescript Who knew the ways of laughter on low roads,— A vagabond, a drunkard, and a sponge, CAPTAIN CRAIG But always a free creature with a soul? I bring him back, though not without misgivings, And caution you to damn him sparingly. "Count Pretzel von Würzburger, the Obscene (The beggar may have had another name, But no man to my knowledge ever knew it) Was a poet and a skeptic and a critic, And in his own mad manner a musician: He found an old piano in a bar-room, And it was his career—three nights a week, From ten o'clock till twelve—to make it rattle; And then, when I was just far down enough To sit and watch him with his long straight hair, And pity him, and think he looked like Liszt, I might have glorified a musical Steam-engine, or a xylophone. The Count Played half of everything and `improvised' The rest: he told me once that he was born With a genius in him that `prohibited Complete fidelity,' and that his art `Confessed vagaries,' therefore. But I made Kind reckoning of his vagaries then: I had the whole great pathos of the man To purify me, and all sorts of music To give me spiritual nourishment And cerebral athletics; for the Count Played indiscriminately—with an f, And with incurable presto—cradle-songs And carnivals, spring-songs and funeral marches, The Marseillaise and Schubert's Serenade— And always in a way to make me think Procrustes had the germ of music in him. And when this interesting reprobate Began to talk—then there were more vagaries: COLLECTED POEMS He made a reeking fetich of all filth, Apparently; but there was yet revealed About him, through his words and on his flesh, That ostracizing nimbus of a soul's Abject, apologetic purity— That phosphorescence of sincerity— Which indicates the curse and the salvation Of a life wherein starved art may never perish. "One evening I remember clearliest Of all that I passed with him. Having wrought, With his nerve-ploughing ingenuity, The Traumerei into a Titan's nightmare, The man sat down across the table from me And all at once was ominously decent. ` "The more we measure what is ours to use," ' He said then, wiping his froth-plastered mouth With the inside of his hand, ` "the less we groan For what the gods refuse." I've had that sleeved A decade for you. Now but one more stein, And I shall be prevailed upon to read The only sonnet I have ever made; And after that, if you propitiate Gambrinus, I shall play you that Andante As the world has never heard it played before.' So saying, he produced a piece of paper, Unfolded it, and read, `Sonnet Unique De Pretzel von Wurzburger, dit L'Obscéne:— " `Carmichael had a kind of joke-disease, And he had queer things fastened on his wall. There are three green china frogs that I recall More potently than anything, for these Three frogs have demonstrated, by degrees, What curse was on the man to make him fall: CAPTAIN CRAIG "They are not ordinary frogs at all, They are the Frogs of Aristophanes." " `God! how he laughed whenever he said that; And how we caught from one another's eyes The flash of what a tongue could never tell! We always laughed at him, no matter what The joke was worth. But when a man's brain dies, We are not always glad . . . Poor Carmichael!' " `I am a sowbug and a necrophile,' Said Pretzel, `and the gods are growing old; The stars are singing Golden hair to gray, Green leaf to yellow leaf,—or chlorophyl To xanthophyl, to be more scientific,— So speed me one more stein. You may believe That I'm a mendicant, but I am not: For though it look to you that I go begging, The truth is I go giving—giving all My strength and all my personality, My wisdom and experience—all myself, To make it final—for your preservation; Though I be not the one thing or the other, Though I strike between the sunset and the dawn, Though I be cliff-rubbed wreckage on the shoals Of Circumstance,—doubt not that I comprise, Far more than my appearance. Here he comes; Now drink to good old Pretzel! Drink down Pretzel! Q'uousque tandem, Pretzel, and O Lord, How long! But let regret go hang: the good Die first, and of the poor did many cease To be. Beethoven after Wordsworth. Prosit! There were geniuses among the trilobites, And I suspect that I was one of them.' COLLECTED POEMS "How much of him was earnest and how much Fantastic, I know not; nor do I need Profounder knowledge to exonerate The squalor or the folly of a man Than consciousness—though even the crude laugh Of indigent Priapus follow it— That I get good of him. And if you like him, Then some time in the future, past a doubt, You'll have him in a book, make metres of him,— To the great delight of Mr. Killigrew, And the grief of all your kinsmen. Christian shame And self-confuted Orientalism For the more sagacious of them; vulture-tracks Of my Promethean bile for the rest of them; And that will be a joke. There's nothing quite So funny as a joke that's lost on earth And laughed at by the gods. Your devil knows it. "I come to like your Mr. Killigrew, And I rejoice that you speak well of him. The sprouts of human blossoming are in him, And useful eyes—if he will open them; But one thing ails the man. He smiles too much. He comes to see me once or twice a week, And I must tell him that he smiles too much. If I were Socrates, it would be simple." Epistle Number Three was longer coming. I waited for it, even worried for it— Though Killigrew, and of his own free will, Had written reassuring little scraps From time to time, and I had valued them The more for being his. "The Sage," he said, CAPTAIN CRAIG "From all that I can see, is doing well— I should say very well. Three meals a day, Siestas, and innumerable pipes— Not to the tune of water on the stones, But rather to the tune of his own Ego, Which seems to be about the same as God. But I was always weak in metaphysics, And pray therefore that you be lenient. I'm going to be married in December, And I have made a poem that will scan— So Plunket says. You said the other wouldn't: "Augustus Plunket, Ph.D., And oh, the Bishop's daughter; A very learned man was he And in twelve weeks he got her; And oh, she was as fair to see As pippins on the pippin tree . . . Tu, tui, tibi, te,—chubs in the mill water. "Connotative, succinct, and erudite; Three dots to boot. Now goodman Killigrew May wind an epic one of these glad years, And after that who knoweth but the Lord— The Lord of Hosts who is the King of Glory?" Still, when the Captain's own words were before me, I seemed to read from them, or into them, The protest of a mortuary joy Not all substantiating Killigrew's Off-hand assurance. The man's face came back The while I read them, and that look again, Which I had seen so often, came back with it. COLLECTED POEMS I do not know that I can say just why, But I felt the feathery touch of something wrong:— "Since last I wrote—and I fear weeks have gone Too far for me to leave my gratitude Unuttered for its own acknowledgment— I have won, without the magic of Amphion Without the songs of Orpheus or Apollo, The frank regard—and with it, if you like, The fledged respect—of three quick-footed friends. (`Nothing is there more marvelous than man,' Said Sophocles; and I say after him: `He traps and captures, all-inventive one, The light birds and the creatures of the wold, And in his nets the fishes of the sea.') Once they were pictures, painted on the air, Faint with eternal color, colorless,— But now they are not pictures, they are fowls. "At first they stood aloof and cocked their small, Smooth, prudent heads at me and made as if, With a cryptic idiotic melancholy, To look authoritative and sagacious; But when I tossed a piece of apple to them, They scattered back with a discord of short squawks And then came forward with a craftiness That made me think of Eden. Atropos Came first, and having grabbed the morsel up, Ran flapping far away and out of sight, With Clotho and Lachesis hard after her; But finally the three fared all alike, And next day I persuaded them with corn. In a week they came and had it from my fingers And looked up at me while I pinched their bills And made them sneeze. Count Pretzel's Carmichael CAPTAIN CRAIG Had said they were not ordinary birds At all,—and they are not: they are the Fates, Foredoomed of their own insufficiency To be assimilated.—Do not think, Because in my contented isolation It suits me at this time to be jocose, That I am nailing reason to the cross, Or that I set the bauble and the bells Above the crucible; for I do nought, Say nought, but with an ancient levity That is the forbear of all earnestness. "The cross, I said.—I had a dream last night: A dream not like to any other dream That I remember. I was all alone, Sitting as I do now beneath a tree, But looking not, as I am looking now, Against the sunlight. There was neither sun Nor moon, nor do I think of any stars; Yet there was light, and there were cedar trees, And there were sycamores. I lay at rest, Or should have seemed at rest, within a trough Between two giant roots. A weariness Was on me, and I would have gone to sleep, But I had not the courage. If I slept, I feared that I should never wake again; And if I did not sleep I should go mad, And with my own dull tools, which I had used With wretched skill so long, hack out my life. And while I lay there, tortured out of death, Faint waves of cold, as if the dead were breathing, Came over me and through me; and I felt Quick fearful tears of anguish on my face And in my throat. But soon, and in the distance, Concealed, importunate, there was a sound COLLECTED POEMS Of coming steps,—and I was not afraid; No, I was not afraid then, I was glad; For I could feel, with every thought, the Man, The Mystery, the Child, a footfall nearer. Then, when he stood before me, there was no Surprise, there was no questioning: I knew him, As I had known him always; and he smiled. `Why are you here?' he asked; and reaching down, He took up my dull blades and rubbed his thumb Across the edges of them and then smiled Once more.—`I was a carpenter,' I said, `But there was nothing in the world to do.'— `Nothing?' said he.—`No, nothing,' I replied.— `But are you sure,' he asked, `that you have skill? And are you sure that you have learned your trade? No, you are not.'—He looked at me and laughed As he said that; but I did not laugh then, Although I might have laughed.—`They are dull,' said he; `They were not very sharp if they were ground; But they are what you have, and they will earn What you have not. So take them as they are, Grind them and clean them, put new handles to them, And then go learn your trade in Nazareth. Only be sure that you find Nazareth.'— `But if I starve—what then?' said I.—He smiled. "Now I call that as curious a dream As ever Meleager's mother had,— Æneas, Alcibiades, or Jacob. I'll not except the scientist who dreamed That he was Adam and that he was Eve At the same time; or yet that other man Who dreamed that he was Æschylus, reborn To clutch, combine, compensate, and adjust The plunging and unfathomable chorus CAPTAIN CRAIG Wherein we catch, like a bacchanale through thunder, The chanting of the new Eumenides, Implacable, renascent, farcical, Triumphant, and American. He did it, But did it in a dream. When he awoke One phrase of it remained; one verse of it Went singing through the remnant of his life Like a bag-pipe through a mad-house.—He died young, And if I ponder the small history That I have gleaned of him by scattered roads, The more do I rejoice that he died young. That measure would have chased him all his days, Defeated him, deposed him, wasted him, And shrewdly ruined him—though in that ruin There would have lived, as always it has lived, In ruin as in failure, the supreme Fulfilment unexpressed, the rhythm of God That beats unheard through songs of shattered men Who dream but cannot sound it.—He declined, From all that I have ever learned of him, With absolute good-humor. No complaint, No groaning at the burden which is light, No brain-waste of impatience—`Never mind,' He whispered, `for I might have written Odes.' "Speaking of odes now makes me think of ballads. Your admirable Mr. Killigrew Has latterly committed what he calls A Ballad of London—London `Town,' of course— And he has wished that I pass judgment on He says there is a `generosity' About it, and a `sympathetic insight;' And there are strong lines in it, so he says. But who am I that he should make of me A judge? You are his friend, and you know best COLLECTED POEMS The measure of his jingle. I am old, And you are young. Be sure, I may go back To squeak for you the tunes of yesterday On my old fiddle—or what's left of it— And give you as I'm able a young sound; But all the while I do it I remain One of Apollo's pensioners (and yours), An usher in the Palace of the Sun, A candidate for mattocks and trombones (The brass-band will be indispensable), A patron of high science, but no critic. So I shall have to tell him, I suppose, That I read nothing now but Wordsworth, Pope, Lucretius, Robert Burns, and William Shakespeare. Now this is Mr. Killigrew's performance: " `Say, do you go to London Town, You with the golden feather?'— `And if I go to London Town With my golden feather?'— `These autumn roads are bright and brown, The season wears a russet crown; And if you go to London Town, We'll go down together.' "I cannot say for certain, but I think The brown bright nightingale was half assuaged Before your Mr. Killigrew was born. If I have erred in my chronology, No matter,—for the feathered man sings now: " `Yes, I go to London Town' (Merrily waved the feather), `And if you go to London Town, Yes, we'll go together.' CAPTAIN CRAIG So in the autumn bright and brown, Just as the year began to frown, All the way to London Town Rode the two together. " `I go to marry a fair maid' (Lightly swung the feather)— `Pardie, a true and loyal maid' (Oh, the swinging feather!)— `For us the wedding gold is weighed, For us the feast will soon be laid; We'll make a gallant show,' he said,— `She and I together.' "The feathered man may do a thousand things, And all go smiling; but the feathered man May do too much. Now mark how he continues: " `And you—you go to London Town?' (Breezes waved the feather)— `Yes, I go to London Town.' (Ah, the stinging feather!)— `Why do you go, my merry blade? Like me, to marry a fair maid?'— `Why do I go? . . . God knows,' he said; And on they rode together. "Now you have read it through, and you know best What worth it has. We fellows with gray hair Who march with sticks to music that is gray Judge not your vanguard fifing. You are one To judge; and you will tell me what you think. Barring the Town, the Fair Maid, and the Feather, The dialogue and those parentheses, COLLECTED POEMS You cherish it, undoubtedly. `Pardie!' You call it, with a few conservative Allowances, an excellent small thing For patient inexperience to do: Derivative, you say,—still rather pretty. But what is wrong with Mr. Killigrew? Is he in love, or has he read Rossetti?— Forgive me! I am old and garrulous . . . When are you coming back to Tilbury Town?" III I found the old man sitting in his bed, Propped up and uncomplaining. On a chair Beside him was a dreary bowl of broth, A magazine, some glasses, and a pipe. "I do not light it nowadays," he said, "But keep it for an antique influence That it exerts, an aura that it sheds— Like hautboys, or Provence. You understand: The charred memorial defeats us yet, But think you not for always. We are young, And we are friends of time. Time that made smoke Will drive away the smoke, and we shall know The work that we are doing. We shall build With embers of all shrines one pyramid, And we shall have the most resplendent flame From earth to heaven, as the old words go, And we shall need no smoke . . . Why don't you laugh!" I gazed into those calm, half-lighted eyes And smiled at them with grim obedience. He told me that I did it very well, But added that I should undoubtedly Do better in the future: "There is nothing," CAPTAIN CRAIG He said, "so beneficial in a sick-room As a well-bred spontaneity of manner. Your sympathetic scowl obtrudes itself, And is indeed surprising. After death, Were you to take it with you to your coffin An unimaginative man might think That you had lost your life in worrying To find out what it was that worried you. The ways of unimaginative men Are singularly fierce . . . Why do you stand? Sit here and watch me while I take this soup. The doctor likes it, therefore it is good. "The man who wrote the decalogue," pursued The Captain, having swallowed four or five Heroic spoonfuls of his lukewarm broth, "Forgot the doctors. And I think sometimes The man of Galilee (or, if you choose, The men who made the sayings of the man) Like Buddha, and the others who have seen, Was to men's loss the Poet—though it be The Poet only of him we revere, The Poet we remember. We have put The prose of him so far away from us, The fear of him so crudely over us, That I have wondered—wondered."—Cautiously, But yet as one were cautious in a dream, He set the bowl down on the chair again, Crossed his thin fingers, looked me in the face, And looking smiled a little. "Go away," He said at last, "and let me go to sleep. I told you I should eat, but I shall not. To-morrow I shall eat; and I shall read Some clauses of a jocund instrument That I have been preparing here of late COLLECTED POEMS For you and for the rest, assuredly. `Attend the testament of Captain Craig: Good citizens, good fathers and your sons, Good mothers and your daughters.' I should say so. Now go away and let me go to sleep." I stood before him and held out my hand, He took it, pressed it; and I felt again The sick soft closing on it. He would not Let go, but lay there, looking up to me With eyes that had a sheen of water on them And a faint wet spark within them. So he clung, Tenaciously, with fingers icy warm, And eyes too full to keep the sheen unbroken. I looked at him. The fingers closed hard once, And then fell down.—I should have left him then. But when we found him the next afternoon, My first thought was that he had made his eyes Miraculously smaller. They were sharp And hard and dry, and the spark in them was dry. For a glance it all but seemed as if the man Had artfully forsworn the brimming gaze Of yesterday, and with a wizard strength Inveigled in, reduced, and vitalized The straw-shine of October; and had that Been truth, we should have humored him no less, Albeit he had fooled us,—for he said That we had made him glad by coming to him. And he was glad: the manner of his words Revealed the source of them; and the gray smile Which lingered like a twilight on his face Told of its own slow fading that it held The promise of the sun. Cadaverous, God knows it was; and we knew it was honest. CAPTAIN CRAIG "So you have come to hear the old man read To you from his last will and testament: Well, it will not be long—not very long— So listen." He brought out from underneath His pillow a new manuscript, and said, "You have done well to come and hear me read My testament. There are men in the world Who say of me, if they remember me, That I am poor;—and I believe the ways Of certain men who never find things out Are stranger than the way Lord Bacon wrote Leviticus, and Faust." He fixed his eyes Abstractedly on something far from us, And with a look that I remembered well Gazed hard the while we waited. But at length He found himself and soon began to chant, With a fitful shift at thin sonorousness The jocund instrument; and had he been Definitively parceling to us All Kimberley and half of Ballarat, The lordly quaver of his poor old words Could not have been the more magniloquent. No promise of dead carbon or of gold, However, flashed in ambush to corrupt us: "I, Captain Craig, abhorred iconoclast, Sage-errant, favored of the Mysteries, And self-reputed humorist at large, Do now, confessed of my world-worshiping, Time-questioning, sun-fearing, and heart-yielding, Approve and unreservedly devise To you and your assigns for evermore, God's universe and yours. If I had won What first I sought, I might have made you beam By giving less; but now I make you laugh COLLECTED POEMS By giving more than what had made you beam, And it is well. No man has ever done The deed of humor that God promises, But now and then we know tragedians Reform, and in denial too divine For sacrifice, too firm for ecstasy, Record in letters, or in books they write, What fragment of God's humor they have caught, What earnest of its rhythm; and I believe That I, in having somewhat recognized The formal measure of it, have endured The discord of infirmity no less Through fortune than by failure. What men lose, Man gains; and what man gains reports itself In losses we but vaguely deprecate, So they be not for us;—and this is right, Except that when the devil in the sun Misguides us we go darkly where the shine Misleads us, and we know not what we see: We know not if we climb or if we fall; And if we fly, we know not where we fly. "And here do I insert an urging clause For climbers and up-fliers of all sorts, Cliff-climbers and high-fliers: Phaethon, Bellerophon, and Icarus did each Go gloriously up, and each in turn Did famously come down—as you have read In poems and elsewhere; but other men Have mounted where no fame has followed them, And we have had no sight, no news of them, And we have heard no crash. The crash may count, Undoubtedly, and earth be fairer for it; Yet none save creatures out of harmony Have ever, in their fealty to the flesh, CAPTAIN CRAIG Made crashing an ideal. It is the flesh That ails us, for the spirit knows no qualm, No failure, no down-falling: so climb high, And having set your steps regard not much The downward laughter clinging at your feet, Nor overmuch the warning; only know, As well as you know dawn from lantern-light, That far above you, for you, and within you, There burns and shines and lives, unwavering And always yours, the truth. Take on yourself But your sincerity, and you take on Good promise for all climbing: fly for truth, And hell shall have no storm to crush your flight, No laughter to vex down your loyalty. "I think you may be smiling at me now— And if I make you smile, so much the better; For I would have you know that I rejoice Always to see the thing that I would see— The righteous thing, the wise thing. I rejoice Always to think that any thought of mine, Or any word or any deed of mine, May grant sufficient of what fortifies Good feeling and the courage of calm joy To make the joke worth while. Contrariwise, When I review some faces I have known— Sad faces, hungry faces—and reflect On thoughts I might have moulded, human words I might have said, straightway it saddens me To feel perforce that had I not been mute And actionless, I might have made them bright Somehow, though only for the moment. Yes, Howbeit I may confess the vanities, It saddens me; and sadness, of all things Miscounted wisdom, and the most of all COLLECTED POEMS When warmed with old illusions and regrets, I mark the selfishest, and on like lines The shrewdest. For your sadness makes you climb With dragging footsteps, and it makes you groan; It hinders you when most you would be free, And there are many days it wearies you Beyond the toil itself. And if the load It lays on you may not be shaken off Till you have known what now you do not know— Meanwhile you climb; and he climbs best who sees Above him truth burn faithfulest, and feels Within him truth burn purest. Climb or fall, One road remains and one firm guidance always; One way that shall be taken, climb or fall. "But `falling, falling, falling.' There's your song, The cradle-song that sings you to the grave. What is it your bewildered poet says?— " `The toiling ocean thunders of unrest And aching desolation; the still sea Paints but an outward calm that mocks itself To the final and irrefragable sleep That owns no shifting fury; and the shoals Of ages are but records of regret Where Time, the sun's arch-phantom, writes on sand The prelude of his ancient nothingness.' "'T is easy to compound a dirge like that, And it is easy to be deceived And alienated by the fleshless note Of half-world yearning in it; but the truth To which we all are tending,—charlatans And architects alike, artificers In tinsel as in gold, evangelists CAPTAIN CRAIG Of ruin and redemption, all alike,— The truth we seek and equally the truth We do not seek, but yet may not escape, Was never found alone through flesh contempt Or through flesh reverence. Look east and west And we may read the story: where the light Shone first the shade now darkens; where the shade Clung first, the light fights westward—though the shade Still feeds, and there is yet the Orient. "But there is this to be remembered always: Whatever be the altitude you reach, You do not rise alone; nor do you fall But you drag others down to more or less Than your preferred abasement. God forbid That ever I should preach, and in my zeal Forget that I was born an humorist; But now, for once, before I go away, I beg of you to be magnanimous A moment, while I speak to please myself: "Though I have heard it variously sung That even in the fury and the clash Of battles, and the closer fights of men When silence gives the knowing world no sign, One flower there is, though crushed and cursed it be, Keeps rooted through all tumult and all scorn,— Still do I find, when I look sharply down, There's yet another flower that grows well And has the most unconscionable roots Of any weed on earth. Perennial It grows, and has the name of Selfishness; No doubt you call it Love. In either case, You propagate it with a diligence That hardly were outmeasured had its leaf COLLECTED POEMS The very juice in it of that famed herb Which gave back breath to Glaucus; and I know That in the twilight, after the day's work, You take your little children in your arms, Or lead them by their credulous frail hands Benignly out and through the garden-gate And show them there the things that you have raised; Not everything, perchance, but always one Miraculously rooted flower plot Which is your pride, their pattern. Socrates, Could he be with you there at such a time, Would have some unsolicited shrewd words To say that you might hearken to; but I Say nothing, for I am not Socrates.— So much, good friends, for flowers; and I thank you. "There was a poet once who would have roared Away the world and had an end of stars. Where was he when I quoted him?—oh, yes: 'T is easy for a man to link loud words With woeful pomp and unschooled emphasis And add one thundered contribution more To the dirges of all-hollowness, I said; But here again I find the question set Before me, after turning books on books And looking soulward through man after man, If there indeed be more determining Play-service in remotely sounding down The world's one-sidedness. If I judge right, Your pounding protestations, echoing Their burden of unfraught futility, Surge back to mute forgetfulness at last And have a kind of sunny, sullen end, Like any cold north storm.—But there are few Still seas that have no life to profit them, CAPTAIN CRAIG And even in such currents of the mind As have no tide-rush in them, but are drowsed, Crude thoughts may dart in armor and upspring With waking sound, when all is dim with peace, Like sturgeons in the twilight out of Lethe; And though they be discordant, hard, grotesque, And all unwelcome to the lethargy That you think means repose, you know as well As if your names were shouted when they leap, And when they leap you listen.—Ah! friends, friends, There are these things we do not like to know: They trouble us, they make us hesitate, They touch us, and we try to put them off. We banish one another and then say That we are left alone: the midnight leaf That rattles where it hangs above the snow— Gaunt, fluttering, forlorn—scarcely may seem So cold in all its palsied loneliness As we, we frozen brothers, who have yet Profoundly and severely to find out That there is more of unpermitted love In most men's reticence than most men think. "Once, when I made it out fond-headedness To say that we should ever be apprised Of our deserts and their emolument At all but in the specious way of words, The wisdom of a warm thought woke within me And I could read the sun. Then did I turn My long-defeated face full to the world, And through the clouded warfare of it all Discern the light. Through dusk that hindered it, I found the truth, and for the first whole time Knew then that we were climbing. Not as one Who mounts along with his experience COLLECTED POEMS Bound on him like an Old Man of the Sea— Not as a moral pedant who drags chains Of his unearned ideals after him And always to the lead-like thud they make Attunes a cold inhospitable chant Of All Things Easy to the Non-Attached,— But as a man, a scarred man among men, I knew it, and I felt the strings of thought Between us to pull tight the while I strove; And if a curse came ringing now and then To my defended ears, how could I know The light that burned above me and within me, And at the same time put on cap-and-bells For such as yet were groping?" Killigrew Made there as if to stifle a small cough. I might have kicked him, but regret forbade The subtle admonition; and indeed When afterwards I reprimanded him, The fellow never knew quite what I meant. I may have been unjust.—The Captain read Right on, without a chuckle or a pause, As if he had heard nothing: "How, forsooth, Shall any man, by curses or by groans, Or by the laugh-jarred stillness of all hell, Be so drawn down to servitude again That on some backward level of lost laws And undivined relations, he may know No longer Love's imperative resource, Firm once and his, well treasured then, but now Too fondly thrown away? And if there come But once on all his journey, singing down CAPTAIN CRAIG To find him, the gold-throated forward call, What way but one, what but the forward way, Shall after that call guide him? When his ears Have earned an inward skill to methodize The clash of all crossed voices and all noises, How shall he grope to be confused again, As he has been, by discord? When his eyes Have read the book of wisdom in the sun, And after dark deciphered it on earth, How shall he turn them back to scan some huge Blood-lettered protest of bewildered men That hunger while he feeds where they would starve And all absurdly perish?" Killigrew Looked hard for a subtile object on the wall, And, having found it, sighed. The Captain paused: If he grew tedious, most assuredly Did he crave pardon of us; he had feared Beforehand that he might be wearisome, But there was not much more of it, he said,— No more than just enough. And we rejoiced That he should look so kindly on us then. ("Commend me to a dying man's grimace For absolute humor, always," Killigrew Maintains; but I know better.) "Work for them, You tell me? Work the folly out of them? Go back to them and teach them how to climb, While you teach caterpillars how to fly? You tell me that Alnaschar is a fool Because he dreams? And what is this you ask? I make him wise? I teach him to be still? While you go polishing the Pyramids, COLLECTED POEMS I hold Alnaschar's feet? And while you have The ghost of Memnon's image all day singing, I sit with aching arms and hardly catch A few spilled echoes of the song of songs— The song that I should have as utterly For mine as other men should once have had The sweetest a glad shepherd ever trilled In Sharon, long ago? Is this the way For me to do good climbing any more Than Phaethon's? Do you think the golden tone Of that far-singing call you all have heard Means any more for you than you should be Wise-heartedly, glad-heartedly yourselves? Do this, there is no more for you to do; And you have no dread left, no shame, no scorn. And while you have your wisdom and your gold, Songs calling, and the Princess in your arms, Remember, if you like, from time to time, Down yonder where the clouded millions go, Your bloody-knuckled scullions are not slaves, Your children of Alnaschar are not fools. "Nor are they quite so foreign or far down As you may think to see them. What you take To be the cursedest mean thing that crawls On earth is nearer to you than you know: You may not ever crush him but you lose, You may not ever shield him but you gain— As he, with all his crookedness, gains with you. Your preaching and your teaching, your achieving, Your lifting up and your discovering, Are more than often—more than you have dreamed— The world-refracted evidence of what Your dream denies. You cannot hide yourselves In any multitude or solitude, CAPTAIN CRAIG Or mask yourselves in any studied guise Of hardness or of old humility, But soon by some discriminating man— Some humorist at large, like Socrates— You get yourselves found out.—Now I should be Found out without an effort. For example: When I go riding, trimmed and shaved again, Consistent, adequate, respectable,— Some citizen, for curiosity, Will ask of a good neighbor, `What is this?'— `It is the funeral of Captain Craig,' Will be the neighbor's word.—`And who, good man, Was Captain Craig?'—`He was an humorist; And we are told that there is nothing more For any man alive to say of him.'— `There is nothing very strange in that,' says A; `But the brass band? What has he done to be Blown through like this by cornets and trombones? And here you have this incompatible dirge— Where are the jokes in that?'—Then B should say: `Maintained his humor: nothing more or less. The story goes that on the day before He died—some say a week, but that's a trifle— He said, with a subdued facetiousness, "Play Handel, not Chopin; assuredly not Chopin." '—He was indeed an humorist." He made the paper fall down at arm's length; And with a tension of half-quizzical Benignity that made it hard for us, He looked up—first at Morgan, then at me— Almost, I thought, as if his eyes would ask If we were satisfied; and as he looked, The tremor of an old heart's weariness Was on his mouth. He gazed at each of us, COLLECTED POEMS But spoke no further word that afternoon. He put away the paper, closed his eyes, And went to sleep with his lips flickering; And after that we left him.—At midnight Plunket and I looked in; but he still slept, And everything was going as it should. The watchman yawned, rattled his newspaper, And wondered what it was that ailed his lamp. Next day we found the Captain wide awake, Propped up, and searching dimly with a spoon Through another dreary dish of chicken-broth, Which he raised up to me, at my approach, So fervently and so unconsciously, That one could only laugh. He looked again At each of us, and as he looked he frowned; And there was something in that frown of his That none of us had ever seen before. "Kind friends," he said, "be sure that I rejoice To know that you have come to visit me; Be sure I speak with undisguised words And earnest, when I say that I rejoice."— "But what the devil!" whispered Killigrew. I kicked him, for I thought I understood. The old man's eyes had glimmered wearily At first, but now they glittered like to those Of a glad fish. "Beyond a doubt," said he, "My dream this morning was more singular Than any other I have ever known. Give me that I might live ten thousand years, And all those years do nothing but have dreams, I doubt me much if any one of them Could be so quaint or so fantastical, So pregnant, as a dream of mine this morning. You may not think it any more than odd; CAPTAIN CRAIG You may not feel—you cannot wholly feel— How droll it was:—I dreamed that I found Hamlet— Found him at work, drenched with an angry sweat, Predestined, he declared with emphasis, To root out a large weed on Lethe wharf; And after I had watched him for some time, I laughed at him and told him that no root Would ever come the while he talked like that: The power was not in him, I explained, For such compound accomplishment. He glared At me, of course,—next moment laughed at me, And finally laughed with me. I was right, And we had eisel on the strength of it:— `They tell me that this water is not good,' Said Hamlet, and you should have seen him smile. Conceited? Pelion and Ossa?—pah . . . "But anon comes in a crocodile. We stepped Adroitly down upon the back of him, And away we went to an undiscovered country— A fertile place, but in more ways than one So like the region we had started from, That Hamlet straightway found another weed And there began to tug. I laughed again, Till he cried out on me and on my mirth, Protesting all he knew: `The Fates,' he said, `Have ordered it that I shall have these roots.' But all at once a dreadful hunger seized him, And it was then we killed the crocodile— Killed him and ate him. Washed with eisel down That luckless reptile was, to the last morsel; And there we were with flag-fens all around us,— And there was Hamlet, at his task again, Ridiculous. And while I watched his work, The drollest of all changes came to pass. COLLECTED POEMS The weed had snapped off just above the root, Not warning him, and I was left alone. The bubbles rose, and I laughed heartily To think of him; I laughed when I woke up; And when my soup came in I laughed again; I think I may have laughed a little—no?— Not when you came? . . . Why do you look like that? You don't believe me? Crocodiles—why not? Who knows what he has eaten in his life? Who knows but I have eaten Atropos? . . . `Briar and oak for a soldier's crown,' you say? Provence? Oh, no . . . Had I been Socrates, Count Pretzel would have been the King of Spain." Now of all casual things we might have said To make the matter smooth at such a time, There may have been a few that we had found Sufficient. Recollection fails, however, To say that we said anything. We looked. Had he been Carmichael, we might have stood Like faithful hypocrites and laughed at him; But the Captain was not Carmichael at all, For the Captain had no frogs: he had the sun. So there we waited, hungry for the word,— Tormented, unsophisticated, stretched— Till, with a drawl, to save us, Killigrew Good-humoredly spoke out. The Captain fixed His eyes on him with some severity. "That was a funny dream, beyond a doubt," Said Killigrew;—"too funny to be laughed at; Too humorous, we mean."—"Too humorous?" The Captain answered; "I approve of that. Proceed."—We were not glad for Killigrew. "Well," he went on, "'t was only this. You see CAPTAIN CRAIG My dream this morning was a droll one too: I dreamed that a sad man was in my room, Sitting, as I do now, beside the bed. I questioned him, but he made no reply,— Said not a word, but sang."—"Said not a word, But sang," the Captain echoed. "Very good. Now tell me what it was the sad man sang." "Now that," said Killigrew, constrainedly, And with a laugh that might have been left out, "Is why I know it must have been a dream. But there he was, and I lay in the bed Like you; and I could see him just as well As you see my right hand. And for the songs He sang to me—there's where the dream part comes." "You don't remember them?" the Captain said, With a weary little chuckle; "very well, I might have guessed it. Never mind your dream, But let me go to sleep."—For a moment then There was a frown on Killigrew's good face, And then there was a smile. "Not quite," said he; "The songs that he sang first were sorrowful, And they were stranger than the man himself— And he was very strange; but I found out, Through all the gloom of him and of his music, That a—say, well, say mystic cheerfulness, Pervaded him; for slowly, as he sang, There came a change, and I began to know The method of it all. Song after song Was ended; and when I had listened there For hours—I mean for dream-hours—hearing him, And always glad that I was hearing him, There came another change—a great one. Tears Rolled out at last like bullets from his eyes, And I could hear them fall down on the floor COLLECTED POEMS Like shoes; and they were always marking time For the song that he was singing. I have lost The greater number of his verses now, But there are some, like these, that I remember: " `Ten men from Zanzibar, Black as iron hammers are, Riding on a cable-car Down to Crowley's theatre.' . . . "Ten men?" the Captain interrupted there— "Ten men, my Euthyphron? That is beautiful. But never mind, I wish to go to sleep: Tell Cebes that I wish to go to sleep. . . . O ye of little faith, your golden plumes Are like to drag . . . par-dee!"—We may have smiled In after days to think how Killigrew Had sacrificed himself to fight that silence, But we were grateful to him, none the less; And if we smiled, that may have been the reason. But the good Captain for a long time then Said nothing: he lay quiet—fast asleep, For all that we could see. We waited there Till each of us, I fancy, must have made The paper on the wall begin to squirm, And then got up to leave. My friends went out, And I was going, when the old man cried: "You leave me now—now it has come to this? What have I done to make you go? Come back! Come back!" There was a quaver in his cry That we shall not forget—reproachful, kind, Indignant, piteous. It seemed as one Marooned on treacherous tide-feeding sand CAPTAIN CRAIG Were darkly calling over the still straits Between him and irrevocable shores Where now there was no lamp to fade for him, No call to give him answer. We were there Before him, but his eyes were not much turned On us; nor was it very much to us That he began to speak the broken words, The scattered words, that he had left in him. "So it has come to this? And what is this? Death, do you call it? Death? And what is death? Why do you look like that at me again? Why do you shrink your brows and shut your lips? If it be fear, then I can do no more Than hope for all of you that you may find Your promise of the sun; if it be grief You feel, to think that this old face of mine May never look at you and laugh again, Then tell me why it is that you have gone So long with me, and followed me so far, And had me to believe you took my words For more than ever misers did their gold?" He listened, but his eyes were far from us— Too far to make us turn to Killigrew, Or search the futile shelves of our own thoughts For golden-labeled insincerities To make placebos of. The marrowy sense Of slow November rain that splashed against The shingles and the glass reminded us That we had brought umbrellas. He continued: "Oh, can it be that I, too credulous, Have made myself believe that you believe Yourselves to be the men that you are not? I prove and I prize well your friendliness, COLLECTED POEMS But I would have that your last look at me Be not like this; for I would scan to-day Strong thoughts on all your faces—no regret, No still commiseration—oh, not that!— No doubt, no fear. A man may be as brave As Ajax in the fury of his arms, And in the midmost warfare of his thoughts Be frail as Paris . . . For the love, therefore, That brothered us when we stood back that day From Delium—the love that holds us now More than it held us at Amphipolis— Forget you not that he who in his work Would mount from these low roads of measured shame To tread the leagueless highway must fling first And fling forevermore beyond his reach The shackles of a slave who doubts the sun. There is no servitude so fraudulent As of a sun-shut mind; for 't is the mind That makes you craven or invincible, Diseased or puissant. The mind will pay Ten thousand fold and be the richer then To grant new service; but the world pays hard, And accurately sickens till in years The dole has eked its end and there is left What all of you are noting on all days In these Athenian streets, where squandered men Drag ruins of half-warriors to the grave— Or to Hippocrates." His head fell back, And he lay still with wearied eyes half-closed. We waited, but a few faint words yet stayed: "Kind friends," he said, "friends I have known so long, Though I have jested with you in time past, Though I have stung your pride with epithets CAPTAIN CRAIG Not all forbearing,—still, when I am gone, Say Socrates wrought always for the best And for the wisest end . . . Give me the cup! The truth is yours, God's universe is yours . . . Good-by . . . good citizens . . . give me the cup" . . . Again we waited; and this time we knew Those lips of his that would not flicker down Had yet some fettered message for us there. We waited, and we watched him. All at once, With a faint flash, the clouded eyes grew clear, And then we knew the man was coming back. We watched him, and I listened. The man smiled And looked about him—not regretfully, Not anxiously; and when at last he spoke, Before the long drowse came to give him peace, One word was all he said. "Trombones," he said. That evening, at "The Chrysalis" again, We smoked and looked at one another's eyes, And we were glad. The world had scattered ways For us to take, we knew; but for the time That one snug room where big beech logs roared smooth Defiance to the cold rough rain outside Sufficed. There were no scattered ways for us That we could see just then, and we were glad: We were glad to be on earth, and we rejoiced No less for Captain Craig that he was gone. We might, for his dead benefit, have run The gamut of all human weaknesses And uttered after-platitudes enough— Wrecked on his own abstractions, and all such— To drive away Gambrinus and the bead From Bernard's ale; and I suppose we might Have praised, accordingly, the Lord of Hosts COLLECTED POEMS For letting us believe that we were not The least and idlest of His handiwork. So Plunket, who had knowledge of all sorts, Yet hardly ever spoke, began to plink O tu, Palermo!—quaintly, with his nails,— On Morgan's fiddle, and at once got seized, As if he were some small thing, by the neck. Then the consummate Morgan, having told Explicitly what hardship might accrue To Plunket if he did that any more, Made roaring chords and acrobatic runs— And then, with his kind eyes on Killigrew, Struck up the schoolgirls' march in Lohengrin, So Killigrew might smile and stretch himself And have to light his pipe. When that was done We knew that Morgan, by the looks of him, Was in the mood for almost anything From Bach to Offenbach; and of all times That he has ever played, that one somehow— That evening of the day the Captain died— Stands out like one great verse of a good song, One strain that sings itself beyond the rest For magic and a glamour that it has. The ways have scattered for us, and all things Have changed; and we have wisdom, I doubt not, More fit for the world's work than we had then; But neither parted roads nor cent per cent May starve quite out the child that lives in us— The Child that is the Man, the Mystery, The Phœnix of the World. So, now and then, That evening of the day the Captain died Returns to us; and there comes always with it The storm, the warm restraint, the fellowship, ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD The friendship and the firelight, and the fiddle. So too there comes a day that followed it— A windy, dreary day with a cold white shine, Which only gummed the tumbled frozen ruts That made us ache. The road was hard and long, But we had what we knew to comfort us, And we had the large humor of the thing To make it advantageous; for men stopped And eyed us on that road from time to time, And on that road the children followed us; And all along that road the Tilbury Band Blared indiscreetly the Dead March in Saul. ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD (To Mrs. Henry Richards) Isaac and Archibald were two old men. I knew them, and I may have laughed at them A little; but I must have honored them For they were old, and they were good to me. I do not think of either of them now, Without remembering, infallibly, A journey that I made one afternoon With Isaac to find out what Archibald Was doing with his oats. It was high time Those oats were cut, said Isaac; and he feared That Archibald—well, he could never feel Quite sure of Archibald. Accordingly The good old man invited me—that is, Permitted me—to go along with him; And I, with a small boy's adhesiveness To competent old age, got up and went. COLLECTED POEMS I do not know that I cared overmuch For Archibald's or anybody's oats, But Archibald was quite another thing, And Isaac yet another; and the world Was wide, and there was gladness everywhere. We walked together down the River Road With all the warmth and wonder of the land Around us, and the wayside flash of leaves,— And Isaac said the day was glorious; But somewhere at the end of the first mile I found that I was figuring to find How long those ancient legs of his would keep The pace that he had set for them. The sun Was hot, and I was ready to sweat blood; But Isaac, for aught I could make of him, Was cool to his hat-band. So I said then With a dry gasp of affable despair, Something about the scorching days we have In August without knowing it sometimes; But Isaac said the day was like a dream, And praised the Lord, and talked about the breeze. I made a fair confession of the breeze, And crowded casually on his thought The nearness of a profitable nook That I could see. First I was half inclined To caution him that he was growing old, But something that was not compassion soon Made plain the folly of all subterfuge. Isaac was old, but not so old as that. So I proposed, without an overture, That we be seated in the shade a while, And Isaac made no murmur. Soon the talk Was turned on Archibald, and I began To feel some premonitions of a kind ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD That only childhood knows; for the old man Had looked at me and clutched me with his eye, And asked if I had ever noticed things. I told him that I could not think of them, And I knew then, by the frown that left his face Unsatisfied, that I had injured him. "My good young friend," he said, "you cannot feel What I have seen so long. You have the eyes— Oh, yes—but you have not the other things: The sight within that never will deceive, You do not know—you have no right to know; The twilight warning of experience, The singular idea of loneliness,— These are not yours. But they have long been mine, And they have shown me now for seven years That Archibald is changing. It is not So much that he should come to his last hand, And leave the game, and go the old way down; But I have known him in and out so long, And I have seen so much of good in him That other men have shared and have not seen, And I have gone so far through thick and thin, Through cold and fire with him, that now it brings To this old heart of mine an ache that you Have not yet lived enough to know about. But even unto you, and your boy's faith, Your freedom, and your untried confidence, A time will come to find out what it means To know that you are losing what was yours, To know that you are being left behind; And then the long contempt of innocence— God bless you, boy!—don't think the worse of it Because an old man chatters in the shade— Will all be like a story you have read In childhood and remembered for the pictures. COLLECTED POEMS And when the best friend of your life goes down, When first you know in him the slackening That comes, and coming always tells the end,— Now in a common word that would have passed Uncaught from any other lips than his, Now in some trivial act of every day, Done as he might have done it all along But for a twinging little difference That nips you like a squirrel's teeth—oh, yes, Then you will understand it well enough. But oftener it comes in other ways; It comes without your knowing when it comes; You know that he is changing, and you know That he is going—just as I know now That Archibald is going, and that I Am staying. . . . Look at me, my boy, And when the time shall come for you to see That I must follow after him, try then To think of me, to bring me back again, Just as I was to-day. Think of the place Where we are sitting now, and think of me— Think of old Isaac as you knew him then, When you set out with him in August once To see old Archibald."—The words come back Almost as Isaac must have uttered them, And there comes with them a dry memory Of something in my throat that would not move. If you had asked me then to tell just why I made so much of Isaac and the things He said, I should have gone far for an answer; For I knew it was not sorrow that I felt, Whatever I may have wished it, or tried then To make myself believe. My mouth was full Of words, and they would have been comforting ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD To Isaac, spite of my twelve years, I think; But there was not in me the willingness To speak them out. Therefore I watched the ground; And I was wondering what made the Lord Create a thing so nervous as an ant, When Isaac, with commendable unrest, Ordained that we should take the road again— For it was yet three miles to Archibald's, And one to the first pump. I felt relieved All over when the old man told me that; I felt that he had stilled a fear of mine That those extremities of heat and cold Which he had long gone through with Archibald Had made the man imprevious to both; But Isaac had a desert somewhere in him, And at the pump he thanked God for all things That He had put on earth for men to drink, And he drank well,—so well that I proposed That we go slowly lest I learn too soon The bitterness of being left behind, And all those other things. That was a joke To Isaac, and it pleased him very much; And that pleased me—for I was twelve years old. At the end of an hour's walking after that The cottage of old Archibald appeared. Little and white and high on a smooth round hill It stood, with hackmatacks and apple-trees Before it, and a big barn-roof beyond; And over the place—trees, house, fields and all— Hovered an air of still simplicity And a fragrance of old summers—the old style That lives the while it passes. I dare say That I was lightly conscious of all this When Isaac, of a sudden, stopped himself, COLLECTED POEMS And for the long first quarter of a minute Gazed with incredulous eyes, forgetful quite Of breezes and of me and of all else Under the scorching sun but a smooth-cut field, Faint yellow in the distance. I was young, But there were a few things that I could see, And this was one of them—"Well, well!" said he; And "Archibald will be surprised, I think," Said I. But all my childhood subtlety Was lost on Isaac, for he strode along Like something out of Homer—powerful And awful on the wayside, so I thought. Also I thought how good it was to be So near the end of my short-legged endeavor To keep the pace with Isaac for five miles. Hardly had we turned in from the main road When Archibald, with one hand on his back And the other clutching his huge-headed cane, Came limping down to meet us.—"Well! well! well!" Said he; and then he looked at my red face, All streaked with dust and sweat, and shook my hand, And said it must have been a right smart walk That we had had that day from Tilbury Town.— "Magnificent," said Isaac; and he told About the beautiful west wind there was Which cooled and clarified the atmosphere. "You must have made it with your legs, I guess," Said Archibald; and Isaac humored him With one of those infrequent smiles of his Which he kept in reserve, apparently, For Archibald alone. "But why," said he, "Should Providence have cider in the world If not for such an afternoon as this?" And Archibald, with a soft light in his eyes, ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD Replied that if he chose to go down cellar, There he would find eight barrels—one of which Was newly tapped, he said, and to his taste An honor to the fruit. Isaac approved Most heartily of that, and guided us Forthwith, as if his venerable feet Were measuring the turf in his own door-yard, Straight to the open rollway. Down we went, Out of the fiery sunshine to the gloom, Grateful and half sepulchral, where we found The barrels, like eight potent sentinels, Close ranged along the wall. From one of them A bright pine spile stuck out alluringly, And on the black flat stone, just under it, Glimmered a late-spilled proof that Archibald Had spoken from unfeigned experience. There was a fluted antique water-glass Close by, and in it, prisoned, or at rest, There was a cricket, of the brown soft sort That feeds on darkness. Isaac turned him out, And touched him with his thumb to make him jump, And then composedly pulled out the plug With such a practised hand that scarce a drop Did even touch his fingers. Then he drank And smacked his lips with a slow patronage And looked along the line of barrels there With a pride that may have been forgetfulness That they were Archibald's and not his own. "I never twist a spigot nowadays," He said, and raised the glass up to the light, "But I thank God for orchards." And that glass Was filled repeatedly for the same hand Before I thought it worth while to discern Again that I was young, and that old age, With all his woes, had some advantages. COLLECTED POEMS "Now, Archibald," said Isaac, when we stood Outside again, "I have it in my mind That I shall take a sort of little walk— To stretch my legs and see what you are doing. You stay and rest your back and tell the boy A story: Tell him all about the time In Stafford's cabin forty years ago, When four of us were snowed up for ten days With only one dried haddock. Tell him all About it, and be wary of your back. Now I will go along."—I looked up then At Archibald, and as I looked I saw Just how his nostrils widened once or twice And then grew narrow. I can hear to-day The way the old man chuckled to himself— Not wholesomely, not wholly to convince Another of his mirth,—as I can hear The lonely sigh that followed.—But at length He said: "The orchard now's the place for us; We may find something like an apple there, And we shall have the shade, at any rate." So there we went and there we laid ourselves Where the sun could not reach us; and I champed A dozen of worm-blighted astrakhans While Archibald said nothing—merely told The tale of Stafford's cabin, which was good, Though "master chilly"—after his own phrase— Even for a day like that. But other thoughts Were moving in his mind, imperative, And writhing to be spoken: I could see The glimmer of them in a glance or two, Cautious, or else unconscious, that he gave Over his shoulder: . . . "Stafford and the rest— But that's an old song now, and Archibald And Isaac are old men. Remember, boy, ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD That we are old. Whatever we have gained, Or lost, or thrown away, we are old men. You look before you and we look behind, And we are playing life out in the shadow— But that's not all of it. The sunshine lights A good road yet before us if we look, And we are doing that when least we know it; For both of us are children of the sun, Like you, and like the weed there at your feet. The shadow calls us, and it frightens us— We think; but there's a light behind the stars And we old fellows who have dared to live, We see it—and we see the other things, The other things . . . Yes, I have seen it come These eight years, and these ten years, and I know Now that it cannot be for very long That Isaac will be Isaac. You have seen— Young as you are, you must have seen the strange Uncomfortable habit of the man? He'll take my nerves and tie them in a knot Sometimes, and that's not Isaac. I know that— And I know what it is: I get it here A little, in my knees, and Isaac—here." The old man shook his head regretfully And laid his knuckles three times on his forehead. "That's what it is: Isaac is not quite right. You see it, but you don't know what it means: The thousand little differences—no, You do not know them, and it's well you don't; You'll know them soon enough—God bless you, boy!— You'll know them, but not all of them—not all. So think of them as little as you can: There's nothing in them for you, or for me— But I am old and I must think of them; I'm in the shadow, but I don't forget COLLECTED POEMS The light, my boy,—the light behind the stars. Remember that: remember that I said it; And when the time that you think far away Shall come for you to say it—say it, boy; Let there be no confusion or distrust In you, no snarling of a life half lived, Nor any cursing over broken things That your complaint has been the ruin of. Live to see clearly and the light will come To you, and as you need it.—But there, there, I'm going it again, as Isaac says, And I'll stop now before you go to sleep.— Only be sure that you growl cautiously, And always where the shadow may not reach you." Never shall I forget, long as I live, The quaint thin crack in Archibald's voice, The lonely twinkle in his little eyes, Or the way it made me feel to be with him. I know I lay and looked for a long time Down through the orchard and across the road, Across the river and the sun-scorched hills That ceased in a blue forest, where the world Ceased with it. Now and then my fancy caught A flying glimpse of a good life beyond— Something of ships and sunlight, streets and singing, Troy falling, and the ages coming back, And ages coming forward: Archibald And Isaac were good fellows in old clothes, And Agamemnon was a friend of mine; Ulysses coming home again to shoot With bows and feathered arrows made another, And all was as it should be. I was young. So I lay dreaming of what things I would, Calm and incorrigibly satisfied ISAAC AND ARCHIBALD With apples and romance and ignorance, And the still smoke from Archibald's clay pipe. There was a stillness over everything, As if the spirit of heat had laid its hand Upon the world and hushed it; and I felt Within the mightiness of the white sun That smote the land around us and wrought out A fragrance from the trees, a vital warmth And fullness for the time that was to come, And a glory for the world beyond the forest. The present and the future and the past, Isaac and Archibald, the burning bush, The Trojans and the walls of Jericho, Were beautifully fused; and all went well Till Archibald began to fret for Isaac And said it was a master day for sunstroke. That was enough to make a mummy smile, I thought; and I remained hilarious, In face of all precedence and respect, Till Isaac (who had come to us unheard) Found he had no tobacco, looked at me Peculiarly, and asked of Archibald What ailed the boy to make him chirrup so. From that he told us what a blessed world The Lord had given us.—"But, Archibald," He added, with a sweet severity That made me think of peach-skins and goose-flesh, "I'm half afraid you cut those oats of yours A day or two before they were well set." "They were set well enough," said Archibald,— And I remarked the process of his nose Before the words came out. "But never mind Your neighbor's oats: you stay here in the shade And rest yourself while I go find the cards. We'll have a little game of seven-up COLLECTED POEMS And let the boy keep count."—"We'll have the game, Assuredly," said Isaac; "and I think That I will have a drop of cider, also." They marched away together towards the house And left me to my childish ruminations Upon the ways of men. I followed them Down cellar with my fancy, and then left them For a fairer vision of all things at once That was anon to be destroyed again By the sound of voices and of heavy feet— One of the sounds of life that I remember, Though I forget so many that rang first As if they were thrown down to me from Sinai. So I remember, even to this day, Just how they sounded, how they placed themselves, And how the game went on while I made marks And crossed them out, and meanwhile made some Trojans Likewise I made Ulysses, after Isaac, And a little after Flaxman. Archibald Was injured when he found himself left out, But he had no heroics, and I said so: I told him that his white beard was too long And too straight down to be like things in Homer. "Quite so," said Isaac.—"Low," said Archibald; And he threw down a deuce with a deep grin That showed his yellow teeth and made me happy. So they played on till a bell rang from the door, And Archibald said, "Supper."—After that The old men smoked while I sat watching them And wondered with all comfort what might come To me, and what might never come to me; And when the time came for the long walk home With Isaac in the twilight, I could see THE RETURN OF MORGAN AND FINGAL The forest and the sunset and the sky-line, No matter where it was that I was looking: The flame beyond the boundary, the music, The foam and the white ships, and two old men Were things that would not leave me.—And that night There came to me a dream—a shining one, With two old angels in it. They had wings, And they were sitting where a silver light Suffused them, face to face. The wings of one Began to palpitate as I approached, But I was yet unseen when a dry voice Cried thinly, with unpatronizing triumph, "I've got you, Isaac; high, low, jack, and the game." Isaac and Archibald have gone their way To the silence of the loved and well-forgotten. I knew them, and I may have laughed at them; But there's a laughing that has honor in it, And I have no regret for light words now. Rather I think sometimes they may have made Their sport of me;—but they would not do that, They were too old for that. They were old men, And I may laugh at them because I knew them. THE RETURN OF MORGAN AND FINGAL And there we were together again— Together again, we three: Morgan, Fingal, fiddle, and all, They had come for the night with me. The spirit of joy was in Morgan's wrist, There were songs in Fingal's throat; And secure outside, for the spray to drench, Was a tossed and empty boat. COLLECTED POEMS And there were the pipes, and there was the punch, And somewhere were twelve years; So it came, in the manner of things unsought, That a quick knock vexed our ears. The night wind hovered and shrieked and snarled, And I heard Fingal swear; Then I opened the door—but I found no more Than a chalk-skinned woman there. I looked, and at last, "What is it?" I said— "What is it that we can do?" But never a word could I get from her But "You—you three—it is you!" Now the sense of a crazy speech like that Was more than a man could make; So I said, "But we—we are what, we three?" And I saw the creature shake. "Be quick!" she cried, "for I left her dead— And I was afraid to come; But you, you three—God made it be— Will ferry the dead girl home. "Be quick! be quick!—but listen to that Who is that makes it?—hark!" But I heard no more than a knocking splash And a wind that shook the dark. "It is only the wind that blows," I said, "And the boat that rocks outside." And I watched her there, and I pitied her there— "Be quick! be quick!" she cried. THE RETURN OF MORGAN AND FINGAL She cried so loud that her voice went in To find where my two friends were; So Morgan came, and Fingal came, And out we went with her. 'T was a lonely way for a man to take And a fearsome way for three; And over the water, and all day long, They had come for the night with me. But the girl was dead, as the woman had said, And the best we could see to do Was to lay her aboard. The north wind roared, And into the night we flew. Four of us living and one for a ghost, Furrowing crest and swell, Through the surge and the dark, for that faint far spark, We ploughed with Azrael. Three of us ruffled and one gone mad, Crashing to south we went; And three of us there were too spattered to care What this late sailing meant. So down we steered and along we tore Through the flash of the midnight foam: Silent enough to be ghosts on guard We ferried the dead girl home. We ferried her down to the voiceless wharf, And we carried her up to the light; And we left the two to the father there, Who counted the coals that night. COLLECTED POEMS Then back we steered through the foam again, But our thoughts were fast and few; And all we did was to crowd the surge And to measure the life we knew;— Till at last we came where a dancing gleam Skipped out to us, we three,— And the dark wet mooring pointed home Like a finger from the sea. Then out we pushed the teetering skiff And in we drew to the stairs; And up we went, each man content With a life that fed no cares. Fingers were cold and feet were cold, And the tide was cold and rough; But the light was warm, and the room was warm, And the world was good enough. And there were the pipes, and there was the punch, More shrewd than Satan's tears: Fingal had fashioned it, all by himself, With a craft that comes of years. And there we were together again— Together again, we three: Morgan, Fingal, fiddle, and all, They were there for the night with me. AUNT IMOGEN Aunt Imogen was coming, and therefore The children—Jane, Sylvester, and Young George— Were eyes and ears; for there was only one Aunt Imogen to them in the whole world, AUNT IMOGEN And she was in it only for four weeks In fifty-two. But those great bites of time Made all September a Queen's Festival; And they would strive, informally, to make The most of them.—The mother understood, And wisely stepped away. Aunt Imogen Was there for only one month in the year, While she, the mother,—she was always there; And that was what made all the difference. She knew it must be so, for Jane had once Expounded it to her so learnedly That she had looked away from the child's eyes And thought; and she had thought of many things. There was a demonstration every time Aunt Imogen appeared, and there was more Than one this time. And she was at a loss Just how to name the meaning of it all: It puzzled her to think that she could be So much to any crazy thing alive— Even to her sister's little savages Who knew no better than to be themselves; But in the midst of her glad wonderment She found herself besieged and overcome By two tight arms and one tumultuous head, And therewith half bewildered and half pained By the joy she felt and by the sudden love That proved itself in childhood's honest noise. Jane, by the wings of sex, had reached her first; And while she strangled her, approvingly, Sylvester thumped his drum and Young George howled. But finally, when all was rectified, And she had stilled the clamor of Young George By giving him a long ride on her shoulders, They went together into the old room COLLECTED POEMS That looked across the fields; and Imogen Gazed out with a girl's gladness in her eyes, Happy to know that she was back once more Where there were those who knew her, and at last Had gloriously got away again From cabs and clattered asphalt for a while; And there she sat and talked and looked and laughed And made the mother and the children laugh. Aunt Imogen made everybody laugh. There was the feminine paradox—that she Who had so little sunshine for herself Should have so much for others. How it was That she could make, and feel for making it, So much of joy for them, and all along Be covering, like a scar, and while she smiled, That hungering incompleteness and regret— That passionate ache for something of her own, For something of herself—she never knew. She knew that she could seem to make them all Believe there was no other part of her Than her persistent happiness; but the why And how she did not know. Still none of them Could have a thought that she was living down— Almost as if regret were criminal, So proud it was and yet so profitless— The penance of a dream, and that was good. Her sister Jane—the mother of little Jane, Sylvester, and Young George—might make herself Believe she knew, for she—well, she was Jane. Young George, however, did not yield himself To nourish the false hunger of a ghost That made no good return. He saw too much: The accumulated wisdom of his years AUNT IMOGEN Had so conclusively made plain to him The permanent profusion of a world Where everybody might have everything To do, and almost everything to eat, That he was jubilantly satisfied And all unthwarted by adversity. Young George knew things. The world, he had found out, Was a good place, and life was a good game— Particularly when Aunt Imogen Was in it. And one day it came to pass— One rainy day when she was holding him And rocking him—that he, in his own right, Took it upon himself to tell her so; And something in his way of telling it— The language, or the tone, or something else— Gripped like insidious fingers on her throat, And then went foraging as if to make A plaything of her heart. Such undeserved And unsophisticated confidence Went mercilessly home; and had she sat Before a looking glass, the deeps of it Could not have shown more clearly to her then Than one thought-mirrored little glimpse had shown, The pang that wrenched her face and filled her eyes With anguish and intolerable mist. The blow that she had vaguely thrust aside Like fright so many times had found her now: Clean-thrust and final it had come to her From a child's lips at last, as it had come Never before, and as it might be felt Never again. Some grief, like some delight, Stings hard but once: to custom after that The rapture or the pain submits itself, And we are wiser than we were before. And Imogen was wiser; though at first COLLECTED POEMS Her dream-defeating wisdom was indeed A thankless heritage: there was no sweet, No bitter now; nor was there anything To make a daily meaning for her life— Till truth, like Harlequin, leapt out somehow From ambush and threw sudden savor to it— But the blank taste of time. There were no dreams, No phantoms in her future any more: One clinching revelation of what was One by-flash of irrevocable chance, Had acridly but honestly foretold The mystical fulfilment of a life That might have once . . . But that was all gone by: There was no need of reaching back for that: The triumph was not hers: there was no love Save borrowed love: there was no might have been. But there was yet Young George—and he had gone Conveniently to sleep, like a good boy; And there was yet Sylvester with his drum, And there was frowzle-headed little Jane; And there was Jane the sister, and the mother,— Her sister, and the mother of them all. They were not hers, not even one of them: She was not born to be so much as that, For she was born to be Aunt Imogen. Now she could see the truth and look at it; Now she could make stars out where once had palled A future's emptiness; now she could share With others—ah, the others!—to the end The largess of a woman who could smile; Now it was hers to dance the folly down, And all the murmuring; now it was hers To be Aunt Imogen.—So, when Young George Woke up and blinked at her with his big eyes, THE KLONDIKE And smiled to see the way she blinked at him, 'T was only in old concord with the stars That she took hold of him and held him close, Close to herself, and crushed him till he laughed. THE KLONDIKE Never mind the day we left, or the day the women clung to us; All we need now is the last way they looked at us. Never mind the twelve men there amid the cheering— Twelve men or one man, 't will soon be all the same; For this is what we know: we are five men together, Five left o' twelve men to find the golden river. Far we came to find it out, but the place was here for all of us; Far, far we came, and here we have the last of us. We that were the front men, we that would be early, We that had the faith, and the triumph in our eyes: We that had the wrong road, twelve men together,— Singing when the devil sang to find the golden river. Say the gleam was not for us, but never say we doubted it; Say the wrong road was right before we followed it. We that were the front men, fit for all forage,— Say that while we dwindle we are front men still; For this is what we know to-night: we're starving here together— Starving on the wrong road to find the golden river. Wrong, we say, but wait a little: hear him in the corner there; He knows more than we, and he'll tell us if we listen there— He that fought the snow-sleep less than all the others Stays awhile yet, and he knows where he stays: Foot and hand a frozen clout, brain a freezing feather, Still he's here to talk with us and to the golden river. COLLECTED POEMS "Flow," he says, "and flow along, but you cannot flow away from us; All the world's ice will never keep you far from us; Every man that heeds your call takes the way that leads him— The one way that's his way, and lives his own life: Starve or laugh, the game goes on, and on goes the river; Gold or no, they go their way—twelve men together. "Twelve," he says, "who sold their shame for a lure you call too fair for them— You that laugh and flow to the same word that urges them: Twelve who left the old town shining in the sunset, Left the weary street and the small safe days: Twelve who knew but one way out, wide the way or narrow: Twelve who took the frozen chance and laid their lives on yellow. "Flow by night and flow by day, nor ever once be seen by them; Flow, freeze, and flow, till time shall hide the bones of them; Laugh and wash their names away, leave them all forgotten, Leave the old town to crumble where it sleeps; Leave it there as they have left it, shining in the valley,— Leave the town to crumble down and let the women marry. "Twelve of us or five," he says, "we know the night is on us now: Five while we last, and we may as well be thinking now: Thinking each his own thought, knowing, when the light comes, Five left or none left, the game will not be lost. Crouch or sleep, we go the way, the last way together: Five or none, the game goes on, and on goes the river. "For after all that we have done and all that we have failed to do, Life will be life and a world will have its work to do: Every man who follows us will heed in his own fashion The calling and the warning and the friends who do not know: THE GROWTH OF "LORRAINE" Each will hold an icy knife to punish his heart's lover, And each will go the frozen way to find the golden river." There you hear him, all he says, and the last we'll ever get from him. Now he wants to sleep, and that will be the best for him. Let him have his own way—no, you needn't shake him— Your own turn will come, so let the man sleep. For this is what we know: we are stalled here together— Hands and feet and hearts of us, to find the golden river. And there's a quicker way than sleep? . . . Never mind the looks of him: All he needs now is a finger on the eyes of him. You there on the left hand, reach a little over— Shut the stars away, or he'll see them all night: He'll see them all night and he'll see them all to-morrow, Crawling down the frozen sky, cold and hard and yellow. Won't you move an inch or two—to keep the stars away from him? —No, he won't move, and there's no need of asking him. Never mind the twelve men, never mind the women; Three while we last, we'll let them all go; And we'll hold our thoughts north while we starve here together, Looking each his own way to find the golden river. THE GROWTH OF "LORRAINE" I While I stood listening, discreetly dumb, Lorraine was having the last word with me: "I know," she said, "I know it, but you see Some creatures are born fortunate, and some COLLECTED POEMS Are born to be found out and overcome,— Born to be slaves, to let the rest go free; And if I'm one of them (and I must be) You may as well forget me and go home. "You tell me not to say these things, I know, But I should never try to be content: I've gone too far; the life would be too slow. Some could have done it—some girls have the stuff; But I can't do it: I don't know enough. I'm going to the devil."—And she went. II I did not half believe her when she said That I should never hear from her again; Nor when I found a letter from Lorraine, Was I surprised or grieved at what I read: "Dear friend, when you find this, I shall be dead. You are too far away to make me stop. They say that one drop—think of it, one drop!— Will be enough,—but I'll take five instead. "You do not frown because I call you friend, For I would have you glad that I still keep Your memory, and even at the end— Impenitent, sick, shattered—cannot curse The love that flings, for better or for worse, This worn-out, cast-out flesh of mine to sleep." THE SAGE Foreguarded and unfevered and serene, Back to the perilous gates of Truth he went— Back to fierce wisdom and the Orient, To the Dawn that is, that shall be, and has been: ERASMUS Previsioned of the madness and the mean, He stood where Asia, crowned with ravishment, The curtain of Love's inner shrine had rent, And after had gone scarred by the Unseen. There at his touch there was a treasure chest, And in it was a gleam, but not of gold; And on it, like a flame, these words were scrolled: "I keep the mintage of Eternity. Who comes to take one coin may take the rest, And all may come—but not without the key." ERASMUS When he protested, not too solemnly, That for a world's achieving maintenance The crust of overdone divinity Lacked aliment, they called it recreance; And when he chose through his own glass to scan Sick Europe, and reduced, unyieldingly, The monk within the cassock to the man Within the monk, they called it heresy. And when he made so perilously bold As to be scattered forth in black and white, Good fathers looked askance at him and rolled Their inward eyes in anguish and affright; There were some of them did shake at what was told, And they shook best who knew that he was right. COLLECTED POEMS THE WOMAN AND THE WIFE I—The Explanation "You thought we knew," she said, "but we were wrong. This we can say, the rest we do not say; Nor do I let you throw yourself away Because you love me. Let us both be strong, And we shall find in sorrow, before long, Only the price Love ruled that we should pay: The dark is at the end of every day, And silence is the end of every song. "You ask me for one proof that I speak right, But I can answer only what I know; You look for just one lie to make black white, But I can tell you only what is true— God never made me for the wife of you. This we can say,—believe me! . . . Tell me so!" II—The Anniversary "Give me the truth, whatever it may be. You thought we knew, now tell me what you miss: You are the one to tell me what it is— You are a man, and you have married me. What is it worth to-night that you can see More marriage in the dream of one dead kiss Than in a thousand years of life like this? Passion has turned the lock, Pride keeps the key. "Whatever I have said or left unsaid, Whatever I have done or left undone,— Tell me. Tell me the truth. . . . Are you afraid? Do you think that Love was ever fed with lies But hunger lived thereafter in his eyes? Do you ask me to take moonlight for the sun?" THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE I Partly to think, more to be left alone, George Annandale said something to his friends— A word or two, brusque, but yet smoothed enough To suit their funeral gaze—and went upstairs; And there, in the one room that he could call His own, he found a sort of meaningless Annoyance in the mute familiar things That filled it; for the grate's monotonous gleam Was not the gleam that he had known before, The books were not the books that used to be, The place was not the place. There was a lack Of something; and the certitude of death Itself, as with a furtive questioning, Hovered, and he could not yet understand. He knew that she was gone—there was no need Of any argued proof to tell him that, For they had buried her that afternoon, Under the leaves and snow; and still there was A doubt, a pitiless doubt, a plunging doubt, That struck him, and upstartled when it struck, The vision, the old thought in him. There was A lack, and one that wrenched him; but it was Not that—not that. There was a present sense Of something indeterminably near— The soul-clutch of a prescient emptiness That would not be foreboding. And if not, What then?—or was it anything at all? Yes, it was something—it was everything— But what was everything? or anything? COLLECTED POEMS Tired of time, bewildered, he sat down; But in his chair he kept on wondering That he should feel so desolately strange And yet—for all he knew that he had lost More of the world than most men ever win— So curiously calm. And he was left Unanswered and unsatisfied: there came No clearer meaning to him than had come Before; the old abstraction was the best That he could find, the farthest he could go; To that was no beginning and no end— No end that he could reach. So he must learn To live the surest and the largest life Attainable in him, would he divine The meaning of the dream and of the words That he had written, without knowing why, On sheets that he had bound up like a book And covered with red leather. There it was— There in his desk, the record he had made, The spiritual plaything of his life: There were the words no eyes had ever seen Save his; there were the words that were not made For glory or for gold. The pretty wife Whom he had loved and lost had not so much As heard of them. They were not made for her. His love had been so much the life of her, And hers had been so much the life of him, That any wayward phrasing on his part Would have had no moment. Neither had lived enough To know the book, albeit one of them Had grown enough to write it. There it was, However, though he knew not why it was: There was the book, but it was not for her, For she was dead. And yet, there was the book. THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE Thus would his fancy circle out and out, And out and in again, till he would make As if with a large freedom to crush down Those under-thoughts. He covered with his hands His tired eyes, and waited: he could hear— Or partly feel and hear, mechanically— The sound of talk, with now and then the steps And skirts of some one scudding on the stairs, Forgetful of the nerveless funeral feet That she had brought with her; and more than once There came to him a call as of a voice— A voice of love returning—but not hers. Whose he knew not, nor dreamed; nor did he know, Nor did he dream, in his blurred loneliness Of thought, what all the rest might think of him. For it had come at last, and she was gone With all the vanished women of old time,— And she was never coming back again. Yes, they had buried her that afternoon, Under the frozen leaves and the cold earth, Under the leaves and snow. The flickering week, The sharp and certain day, and the long drowse Were over, and the man was left alone. He knew the loss—therefore it puzzled him That he should sit so long there as he did, And bring the whole thing back—the love, the trust, The pallor, the poor face, and the faint way She last had looked at him—and yet not weep, Or even choose to look about the room To see how sad it was; and once or twice He winked and pinched his eyes against the flame And hoped there might be tears. But hope was all, And all to him was nothing: he was lost. And yet he was not lost: he was astray— COLLECTED POEMS Out of his life and in another life; And in the stillness of this other life He wondered and he drowsed. He wondered when It was, and wondered if it ever was On earth that he had known the other face— The searching face, the eloquent, strange face— That with a sightless beauty looked at him And with a speechless promise uttered words That were not the world's words, or any kind That he had known before. What was it, then? What was it held him—fascinated him? Why should he not be human? He could sigh, And he could even groan,—but what of that? There was no grief left in him. Was he glad? Yet how could he be glad, or reconciled, Or anything but wretched and undone? How could he be so frigid and inert— So like a man with water in his veins Where blood had been a little while before? How could he sit shut in there like a snail? What ailed him? What was on him? Was he glad? Over and over again the question came, Unanswered and unchanged,—and there he was. But what in heaven's name did it all mean? If he had lived as other men had lived, If home had ever shown itself to be The counterfeit that others had called home, Then to this undivined resource of his There were some key; but now . . . Philosophy? Yes, he could reason in a kind of way That he was glad for Miriam's release— Much as he might be glad to see his friends Laid out around him with their grave-clothes on, And this life done for them; but something else THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE There was that foundered reason, overwhelmed it, And with a chilled, intuitive rebuff Beat back the self-cajoling sophistries That his half-tutored thought would half-project. What was it, then? Had he become transformed And hardened through long watches and long grief Into a loveless, feelingless dead thing That brooded like a man, breathed like a man,— Did everything but ache? And was a day To come some time when feeling should return Forever to drive off that other face— The lineless, indistinguishable face— That once had thrilled itself between his own And hers there on the pillow,—and again Between him and the coffin-lid had flashed Like fate before it closed,—and at the last Had come, as it should seem, to stay with him, Bidden or not? He were a stranger then, Foredrowsed awhile by some deceiving draught Of poppied anguish, to the covert grief And the stark loneliness that waited him, And for the time were cursedly endowed With a dull trust that shammed indifference To knowing there would be no touch again Of her small hand on his, no silencing Of her quick lips on his, no feminine Completeness and love-fragrance in the house, No sound of some one singing any more, No smoothing of slow fingers on his hair, No shimmer of pink slippers on brown tiles. But there was nothing, nothing, in all that: He had not fooled himself so much as that; He might be dreaming or he might be sick, COLLECTED POEMS But not like that. There was no place for fear, No reason for remorse. There was the book That he had made, though. . . . It might be the book; Perhaps he might find something in the book; But no, there could be nothing there at all— He knew it word for word; but what it meant— He was not sure that he had written it For what it meant; and he was not quite sure That he had written it;—more likely it Was all a paper ghost. . . . But the dead wife Was real: he knew all that, for he had been To see them bury her; and he had seen The flowers and the snow and the stripped limbs Of trees; and he had heard the preacher pray; And he was back again, and he was glad. Was he a brute? No, he was not a brute: He was a man—like any other man: He had loved and married his wife Miriam, They had lived a little while in paradise And she was gone; and that was all of it. But no, not all of it—not all of it: There was the book again; something in that Pursued him, overpowered him, put out The futile strength of all his whys and wheres, And left him unintelligibly numb— Too numb to care for anything but rest. It must have been a curious kind of book That he had made it: it was a drowsy book At any rate. The very thought of it Was like the taste of some impossible drink— A taste that had no taste, but for all that Had mixed with it a strange thought-cordial, So potent that it somehow killed in him The ultimate need of doubting any more— THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE Of asking any more. Did he but live The life that he must live, there were no more To seek.—The rest of it was on the way. Still there was nothing, nothing, in all this— Nothing that he cared now to reconcile With reason or with sorrow. All he knew For certain was that he was tired out: His flesh was heavy and his blood beat small; Something supreme had been wrenched out of him As if to make vague room for something else. He had been through too much. Yes, he would stay There where he was and rest.—And there he stayed; The daylight became twilight, and he stayed; The flame and the face faded, and he slept. And they had buried her that afternoon, Under the tight-screwed lid of a long box, Under the earth, under the leaves and snow. II Look where she would, feed conscience how she might, There was but one way now for Damaris— One straight way that was hers, hers to defend, At hand, imperious. But the nearness of it, The flesh-bewildering simplicity, And the plain strangeness of it, thrilled again That wretched little quivering single string Which yielded not, but held her to the place Where now for five triumphant years had slept The flameless dust of Argan.—He was gone, The good man she had married long ago; And she had lived, and living she had learned, And surely there was nothing to regret: Much happiness had been for each of them, COLLECTED POEMS And they had been like lovers to the last: And after that, and long, long after that, Her tears had washed out more of widowed grief Than smiles had ever told of other joy.— But could she, looking back, find anything That should return to her in the new time, And with relentless magic uncreate This temple of new love where she had thrown Dead sorrow on the altar of new life? Only one thing, only one thread was left; When she broke that, when reason snapped it off, And once for all, baffled, the grave let go The trivial hideous hold it had on her,— Then she were free, free to be what she would, Free to be what she was.—And yet she stayed, Leashed, as it were, and with a cobweb strand, Close to a tombstone—maybe to starve there. But why to starve? And why stay there at all? Why not make one good leap and then be done Forever and at once with Argan's ghost And all such outworn churchyard servitude? For it was Argan's ghost that held the string, And her sick fancy that held Argan's ghost— Held it and pitied it. She laughed, almost, There for the moment; but her strained eyes filled With tears, and she was angry for those tears— Angry at first, then proud, then sorry for them. So she grew calm; and after a vain chase For thoughts more vain, she questioned of herself What measure of primeval doubts and fears Were still to be gone through that she might win Persuasion of her strength and of herself To be what she could see that she must be, No matter where the ghost was—And the more THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE She lived, the more she came to recognize That something out of her thrilled ignorance Was luminously, proudly being born, And thereby proving, thought by forward thought, The prowess of its image; and she learned At length to look right on to the long days Before her without fearing. She could watch The coming course of them as if they were No more than birds, that slowly, silently, And irretrievably should wing themselves Uncounted out of sight. And when he came Again, she might be free—she would be free. Else, when he looked at her she must look down, Defeated, and malignly dispossessed Of what was hers to prove and in the proving Wisely to consecrate. And if the plague Of that perverse defeat should come to be— If at that sickening end she were to find Herself to be the same poor prisoner That he had found at first—then she must lose All sight and sound of him, she must abjure All possible thought of him; for he would go So far and for so long from her that love— Yes, even a love like his, exiled enough, Might for another's touch be born again— Born to be lost and starved for and not found; Or, at the next, the second wretchedest, It might go mutely flickering down and out, And on some incomplete and piteous day, Some perilous day to come, she might at last Learn, with a noxious freedom, what it is To be at peace with ghosts. Then were the blow Thrice deadlier than any kind of death Could ever be: to know that she had won The truth too late—there were the dregs indeed COLLECTED POEMS Of wisdom, and of love the final thrust Unmerciful; and there where now did lie So plain before her the straight radiance Of what was her appointed way to take, Were only the bleak ruts of an old road That stretched ahead and faded and lay far Through deserts of unconscionable years. But vampire thoughts like these confessed the doubt That love denied; and once, if never again, They should be turned away. They might come back— More craftily, perchance, they might come back— And with a spirit-thirst insatiable Finish the strength of her; but now, to-day She would have none of them. She knew that love Was true, that he was true, that she was true; And should a death-bed snare that she had made So long ago be stretched inexorably Through all her life, only to be unspun With her last breathing? And were bats and threads, Accursedly devised with watered gules, To be Love's heraldry? What were it worth To live and to find out that life were life But for an unrequited incubus Of outlawed shame that would not be thrown down Till she had thrown down fear and overcome The woman that was yet so much of her That she might yet go mad? What were it worth To live, to linger, and to be condemned In her submission to a common thought That clogged itself and made of its first faith Its last impediment? What augured it, Now in this quick beginning of new life, To clutch the sunlight and be feeling back, Back with a scared fantastic fearfulness, THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE To touch, not knowing why, the vexed-up ghost Of what was gone? Yes, there was Argan's face, Pallid and pinched and rumously marked With big pathetic bones; there were his eyes, Quiet and large, fixed wistfully on hers; And there, close-pressed again within her own, Quivered his cold thin fingers. And, ah! yes, There were the words, those dying words again, And hers that answered when she promised him. Promised him? . . . yes. And had she known the truth Of what she felt that he should ask her that, And had she known the love that was to be, God knew that she could not have told him then. But then she knew it not, nor thought of it; There was no need of it; nor was there need Of any problematical support Whereto to cling while she convinced herself That love's intuitive utility, Inexorably merciful, had proved That what was human was unpermanent And what was flesh was ashes. She had told Him then that she would love no other man, That there was not another man on earth Whom she could ever love, or who could make So much as a love thought go through her brain; And he had smiled. And just before he died His lips had made as if to say something— Something that passed unwhispered with his breath, Out of her reach, out of all quest of it. And then, could she have known enough to know The meaning of her grief, the folly of it, The faithlessness and the proud anguish of it, There might be now no threads to punish her, COLLECTED POEMS No vampire thoughts to suck the coward blood, The life, the very soul of her. Yes, Yes, They might come back. . . . But why should they come back? Why was it she had suffered? Why had she Struggled and grown these years to demonstrate That close without those hovering clouds of gloom And through them here and there forever gleamed The Light itself, the life, the love, the glory, Which was of its own radiance good proof That all the rest was darkness and blind sight? And who was she? The woman she had known— The woman she had petted and called "I"— The woman she had pitied, and at last Commiserated for the most abject And persecuted of all womankind,— Could it be she that had sought out the way To measure and thereby to quench in her The woman's fear—the fear of her not fearing? A nervous little laugh that lost itself, Like logic in a dream, fluttered her thoughts An instant there that ever she should ask What she might then have told so easily— So easily that Annandale had frowned, Had he been given wholly to be told The truth of what had never been before So passionately, so inevitably Confessed. For she could see from where she sat The sheets that he had bound up like a book And covered with red leather; and her eyes Could see between the pages of the book, Though her eyes, like them, were closed. And she could read THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE As well as if she had them in her hand, What he had written on them long ago,— Six years ago, when he was waiting for her. She might as well have said that she could see The man himself, as once he would have looked Had she been there to watch him while he wrote Those words, and all for her. . . . For her whose face Had flashed itself, prophetic and unseen, But not unspirited, between the life That would have been without her and the life That he had gathered up like frozen roots Out of a grave-clod lying at his feet, Unconsciously, and as unconsciously Transplanted and revived. He did not know The kind of life that he had found, nor did He doubt, not knowing it; but well he knew That it was life—new life, and that the old Might then with unimprisoned wings go free, Onward and all along to its own light, Through the appointed shadow. While she gazed Upon it there she felt within herself The growing of a newer consciousness— The pride of something fairer than her first Outclamoring of interdicted thought Had ever quite foretold; and all at once There quivered and requivered through her flesh, Like music, like the sound of an old song, Triumphant, love-remembered murmurings Of what for passion's innocence had been Too mightily, too perilously hers, Ever to be reclaimed and realized Until to-day. To-day she could throw off The burden that had held her down so long, COLLECTED POEMS And she could stand upright, and she could see The way to take, with eyes that had in them No gleam but of the spirit. Day or night, No matter; she could see what was to see— All that had been till now shut out from her, The service, the fulfillment, and the truth, And thus the cruel wiseness of it all. So Damaris, more like than anything To one long prisoned in a twilight cave With hovering bats for all companionship, And after time set free to fight the sun, Laughed out, so glad she was to recognize The test of what had been, through all her folly, The courage of her conscience; for she knew, Now on a late-flushed autumn afternoon That else had been too bodeful of dead things To be endured with aught but the same old Inert, self-contradicted martyrdom Which she had known so long, that she could look Right forward through the years, nor any more Shrink with a cringing prescience to behold The glitter of dead summer on the grass, Or the brown-glimmered crimson of still trees Across the intervale where flashed along, Black-silvered, the cold river. She had found, As if by some transcendent freakishness Of reason, the glad life that she had sought Where naught but obvious clouds could ever be— Clouds to put out the sunlight from her eyes, And to put out the love-light from her soul. But they were gone—now they were all gone; And with a whimsied pathos, like the mist Of grief that clings to new-found happiness Hard wrought, she might have pity for the small THE BOOK OF ANNANDALE Defeated quest of them that brushed her sight Like flying lint—lint that had once been thread. . . . Yes, like an anodyne, the voice of him, There were the words that he had made for her, For her alone. The more she thought of them The more she lived them, and the more she knew The life-grip and the pulse of warm strength in them. They were the first and last of words to her, And there was in them a far questioning That had for long been variously at work, Divinely and elusively at work, With her, and with the grave that had been hers; They were eternal words, and they diffused A flame of meaning that men's lexicons Had never kindled; they were choral words That harmonized with love's enduring chords Like wisdom with release; triumphant words That rang like elemental orisons Through ages out of ages; words that fed Love's hunger in the spirit; words that smote; Thrilled words that echoed, and barbed words that clung;— And every one of them was like a friend Whose obstinate fidelity, well tried, Had found at last and irresistibly The way to her close conscience, and thereby Revealed the unsubstantial Nemesis That she had clutched and shuddered at so long; And every one of them was like a real And ringing voice, clear toned and absolute, But of a love-subdued authority That uttered thrice the plain significance Of what had else been generously vague And indolently true. It may have been The triumph and the magic of the soul, COLLECTED POEMS Unspeakably revealed, that finally Had reconciled the grim probationing Of wisdom with unalterable faith, But she could feel—not knowing what it was, For the sheer freedom of it—a new joy That humanized the latent wizardry Of his prophetic voice and put for it The man within the music. So it came To pass, like many a long-compelled emprise That with its first accomplishment almost Annihilates its own severity, That she could find, whenever she might look, The certified achievement of a love That had endured, self-guarded and supreme, To the glad end of all that wavering; And she could see that now the flickering world Of autumn was awake with sudden bloom, New-born, perforce, of a slow bourgeoning. And she had found what more than half had been The grave-deluded, flesh-bewildered fear Which men and women struggle to call faith, To be the paid progression to an end Whereat she knew the foresight and the strength To glorify the gift of what was hers, To vindicate the truth of what she was. And had it come to her so suddenly? There was a pity and a weariness In asking that, and a great needlessness; For now there were no wretched quivering strings That held her to the churchyard any more: There were no thoughts that flapped themselves like bats Around her any more. The shield of love Was clean, and she had paid enough to learn SAINTE-NITOUCHE How it had always been so. And the truth, Like silence after some far victory, Had come to her, and she had found it out As if it were a vision, a thing born So suddenly!—just as a flower is born, Or as a world is born—so suddenly. SAINTE-NITOUCHE Though not for common praise of him, Nor yet for pride or charity, Still would I make to Vanderberg One tribute for his memory: One honest warrant of a friend Who found with him that flesh was grass— Who neither blamed him in defect Nor marveled how it came to pass; Or why it ever was that he— That Vanderberg, of all good men, Should lose himself to find himself, Straightway to lose himself again. For we had buried Sainte-Nitouche, And he had said to me that night: "Yes, we have laid her in the earth, But what of that?" And he was right. And he had said: "We have a wife, We have a child, we have a church; 'T would be a scurrilous way out If we should leave them in the lurch. COLLECTED POEMS "That's why I have you here with me To-night: you know a talk may take The place of bromide, cyanide, Et cetera. For heaven's sake, "Why do you look at me like that? What have I done to freeze you so? Dear man, you see where friendship means A few things yet that you don't know; "And you see partly why it is That I am glad for what is gone: For Sainte-Nitouche and for the world In me that followed. What lives on— "Well, here you have it: here at home— For even home will yet return. You know the truth is on my side, And that will make the embers burn. "I see them brighten while I speak, I see them flash,—and they are mine! You do not know them, but I do: I know the way they used to shine. "And I know more than I have told Of other life that is to be: I shall have earned it when it comes, And when it comes I shall be free. "Not as I was before she came, But farther on for having been The servitor, the slave of her— The fool, you think. But there's your sin— SAINTE-NITOUCHE "Forgive me!—and your ignorance: Could you but have the vision here That I have, you would understand As I do that all ways are clear "For those who dare to follow them With earnest eyes and honest feet. But Sainte-Nitouche has made the way For me, and I shall find it sweet. "Sweet with a bitter sting left?—Yes, Bitter enough, God knows, at first; But there are more steep ways than one To make the best look like the worst; "And here is mine—the dark and hard, For me to follow, trust, and hold: And worship, so that I may leave No broken story to be told. "Therefore I welcome what may come, Glad for the days, the nights, the years."— An upward flash of ember-flame Revealed the gladness in his tears. "You see them, but you know," said he, "Too much to be incredulous: You know the day that makes us wise, The moment that makes fools of us. "So I shall follow from now on The road that she has found for me: The dark and starry way that leads Right upward, and eternally. COLLECTED POEMS "Stumble at first? I may do that; And I may grope, and hate the night; But there's a guidance for the man Who stumbles upward for the light, "And I shall have it all from her, The foam-born child of innocence. I feel you smiling while I speak, But that's of little consequence; "For when we learn that we may find The truth where others miss the mark, What is it worth for us to know That friends are smiling in the dark? "Could we but share the lonely pride Of knowing, all would then be well; But knowledge often writes itself In flaming words we cannot spell. "And I, who have my work to do, Look forward; and I dare to see, Far stretching and all mountainous, God's pathway through the gloom for me." I found so little to say then That I said nothing.—"Say good-night," Said Vanderberg; "and when we meet To-morrow, tell me I was right. "Forget the dozen other things That you have not the faith to say; For now I know as well as you That you are glad to go away." SAINTE-NITOUCHE I could have blessed the man for that, And he could read me with a smile: "You doubt," said he, "but if we live You'll know me in a little while." He lived; and all as he foretold, I knew him—better than he thought: My fancy did not wholly dig The pit where I believed him caught. But yet he lived and laughed, and preached, And worked—as only players can: He scoured the shrine that once was home And kept himself a clergyman. The clockwork of his cold routine Put friends far off that once were near; The five staccatos in his laugh Were too defensive and too clear; The glacial sermons that he preached Were longer than they should have been; And, like the man who fashioned them, The best were too divinely thin. But still he lived, and moved, and had The sort of being that was his, Till on a day the shrine of home For him was in the Mysteries:— "My friend, there's one thing yet," said he, "And one that I have never shared With any man that I have met; But you—you know me." And he stared COLLECTED POEMS For a slow moment at me then With conscious eyes that had the gleam, The shine, before the stroke:—"You know The ways of us, the way we dream: "You know the glory we have won, You know the glamour we have lost; You see me now, you look at me,— And yes, you pity me, almost; "But never mind the pity—no, Confess the faith you can't conceal; And if you frown, be not like one Of those who frown before they feel. "For there is truth, and half truth,—yes, And there's a quarter truth, no doubt; But mine was more than half. . . . You smile? You understand? You bear me out? "You always knew that I was right— You are my friend—and I have tried Your faith—your love."—The gleam grew small, The stroke was easy, and he died. I saw the dim look change itself To one that never will be dim; I saw the dead flesh to the grave, But that was not the last of him. For what was his to live lives yet: Truth, quarter truth, death cannot reach; Nor is it always what we know That we are fittest here to teach. SAINTE-NITOUCHE The fight goes on when fields are still, The triumph clings when arms are down; The jewels of all coronets Are pebbles of the unseen crown; The specious weight of loud reproof Sinks where a still conviction floats; And on God's ocean after storm Time's wreckage is half pilot-boats; And what wet faces wash to sight Thereafter feed the common moan:— But Vanderberg no pilot had, Nor could have: he was all alone. Unchallenged by the larger light The starry quest was his to make; And of all ways that are for men, The starry way was his to take. We grant him idle names enough To-day, but even while we frown The fight goes on, the triumph clings, And there is yet the unseen crown But was it his? Did Vanderberg Find half truth to be passion's thrall, Or as we met him day by day, Was love triumphant, after all? I do not know so much as that; I only know that he died right: Saint Anthony nor Sainte-Nitouche Had ever smiled as he did—quite. COLLECTED POEMS AS A WORLD WOULD HAVE IT Alcestis Shall I never make him look at me again? I look at him, I look my life at him, I tell him all I know the way to tell, But there he stays the same. Shall I never make him speak one word to me? Shall I never make him say enough to show My heart if he be glad? Be glad? . . . ah! God, Why did they bring me back? I wonder, if I go to him again, If I take him by those two cold hands again, Shall I get one look of him at last, or feel One sign—or anything? Or will he still sit there in the same way, Without an answer for me from his lips, Or from his eyes,—or even with a touch Of his hand on my hand? . . . "Will you look down this once—look down at me? Speak once—and if you never speak again, Tell me enough—tell me enough to make Me know that you are glad! "You are my King, and once my King would speak: You were Admetus once, you loved me once: Life was a dream of heaven for us once— And has the dream gone by? AS A WORLD WOULD HAVE IT "Do I cling to shadows when I call you Life? Do you love me still, or are the shadows all? Or is it I that love you in the grave, And you that mourn for me? "If it be that, then do not mourn for me; Be glad that I have loved you, and be King. But if it be not that—if it be true . . . Tell me if it be true!" Then with a choking answer the King spoke; But never touched his hand on hers, or fixed His eyes on hers, or on the face of her: "Yes, it is true," he said. "You are alive, and you are with me now; And you are reaching up to me that I— That I may take you—I that am a King— I that was once a man." So then she knew. She might have known before; Truly, she thought, she must have known it long Before: she must have known it when she came From that great sleep of hers. She knew the truth, but not yet all of it: He loved her, but he would not let his eyes Prove that he loved her; and he would not hold His wife there in his arms. So, like a slave, she waited at his knees, And waited. She was not unhappy now. She quivered, but she knew that he would speak Again—and he did speak. COLLECTED POEMS And while she felt the tremor of his words, He told her all there was for him to tell; And then he turned his face to meet her face, That she might look at him. She looked; and all her trust was in that look, And all her faith was in it, and her love; And when his answer to that look came back, It flashed back through his tears. So then she put her arms around his neck, And kissed him on his forehead and his lips; And there she clung, fast in his arms again, Triumphant, with closed eyes. At last, half whispering, she spoke once more: "Why was it that you suffered for so long? Why could you not believe me—trust in me? Was I so strange as that? "We suffer when we do not understand; And you have suffered—you that love me now— Because you are a man. . . . There is one thing No man can understand. "I would have given everything?—gone down To Tartarus—to silence? Was it that? I would have died? I would have let you live?— And was it very strange?" THE CORRIDOR It may have been the pride in me for aught I know, or just a patronizing whim; But call it freak or fancy, or what not, I cannot hide that hungry face of him. CORTEGE I keep a scant half-dozen words he said, And every now and then I lose his name; He may be living or he may be dead, But I must have him with me all the same. I knew it, and I knew it all along,— And felt it once or twice, or thought I did; But only as a glad man feels a song That sounds around a stranger's coffin lid. I knew it, and he knew it, I believe, But silence held us alien to the end; And I have now no magic to retrieve That year, to stop that hunger for a friend. CORTÈGE Four o'clock this afternoon, Fifteen hundred miles away: So it goes, the crazy tune, So it pounds and hums all day Four o'clock this afternoon, Earth will hide them far away: Best they go to go so soon, Best for them the grave to-day. Had she gone but half so soon, Half the world had passed away. Four o'clock this afternoon, Best for them they go to-day. Four o'clock this afternoon Love will hide them deep, they say; Love that made the grave so soon, Fifteen hundred miles away. COLLECTED POEMS Four o'clock this afternoon— Ah, but they go slow to-day: Slow to suit my crazy tune, Past the need of all we say. Best it came to come so soon, Best for them they go to-day: Four o'clock this afternoon, Fifteen hundred miles away. PARTNERSHIP Yes, you have it; I can see. Beautiful? . . . Dear, look at me! Look and let my shame confess Triumph after weariness. Beautiful? Ah, yes. Lift it where the beams are bright; Hold it where the western light, Shining in above my bed, Throws a glory on your head. Now it is all said. All there was for me to say From the first until to-day. Long denied and long deferred, Now I say it in one word— Now; and you have heard. Life would have its way with us, And I've called it glorious: For I know the glory now And I read it on your brow. You have shown me how. TWILIGHT SONG I can feel your cheeks all wet, But your eyes will not forget: In the frown you cannot hide I can read where faith and pride Are not satisfied. But the word was, two should live: Two should suffer—and forgive: By the steep and weary way, For the glory of the clay, Two should have their day. We have toiled and we have wept For the gift the gods have kept: Clashing and unreconciled When we might as well have smiled, We have played the child. But the clashing is all past, And the gift is yours at last. Lift it—hold it high again! . . . Did I doubt you now and then? Well, we are not men. Never mind; we know the way,— And I do not need to stay. Let us have it well confessed: You to triumph, I to rest. That will be the best. TWILIGHT SONG Through the shine, through the rain We have shared the day's load; To the old march again We have tramped the long road; COLLECTED POEMS We have laughed, we have cried, And we've tossed the King's crown; We have fought, we have died, And we've trod the day down. So it's lift the old song Ere the night flies again, Where the road leads along Through the shine, through the rain. Long ago, far away, Came a sign from the skies; And we feared then to pray For the new sun to rise: With the King there at hand, Not a child stepped or stirred— Where the light filled the land And the light brought the word; For we knew then the gleam Though we feared then the day, And the dawn smote the dream Long ago, far away. But the road leads us all, For the King now is dead; And we know, stand or fall, We have shared the day's bread. We may laugh down the dream, For the dream breaks and flies; And we trust now the gleam, For the gleam never dies;— So it's off now the load, For we know the night's call, And we know now the road And the road leads us all. VARIATIONS OF GREEK THEMES Through the shine, through the rain, We have wrought the day's quest; To the old march again We have earned the day's rest; We have laughed, we have cried, And we've heard the King's groans; We have fought, we have died, And we've burned the King's bones, And we lift the old song Ere the night flies again, Where the road leads along Through the shine, through the rain. VARIATIONS OF GREEK THEMES I A Happy Man (Carphyllides) When these graven lines you see, Traveler, do not pity me; Though I be among the dead, Let no mournful word be said. Children that I leave behind, And their children, all were kind; Near to them and to my wife, I was happy all my life. My three sons I married right, And their sons I rocked at night; Death nor sorrow ever brought Cause for one unhappy thought. COLLECTED POEMS Now, and with no need of tears, Here they leave me, full of years,— Leave me to my quiet rest In the region of the blest. II A Mighty Runner (Nicarchus) The day when Charmus ran with five In Arcady, as I'm alive, He came in seventh.—"Five and one Make seven, you say? It can't be done."— Well, if you think it needs a note, A friend in a fur overcoat Ran with him, crying all the while, "You'll beat 'em, Charmus, by a mile!" And so he came in seventh. Therefore, good Zoilus, you see The thing is plain as plain can be; And with four more for company, He would have been eleventh. III The Raven (Nicarchus) The gloom of death is on the raven's wing, The song of death is in the raven's cries: But when Demophilus begins to sing, The raven dies. VARIATIONS OF GREEK THEMES IV Eutychides (Lucilius) Eutychides, who wrote the songs, Is going down where he belongs. O you unhappy ones, beware: Eutychides will soon be there! For he is coming with twelve lyres, And with more than twice twelve quires Of the stuff that he has done In the world from which he's gone. Ah, now must you know death indeed, For he is coming with all speed; And with Eutychides in Hell, Where's a poor tortured soul to dwell? V Doricha (Posidippus) So now the very bones of you are gone Where they were dust and ashes long ago; And there was the last ribbon you tied on To bind your hair, and that is dust also; And somewhere there is dust that was of old A soft and scented garment that you wore— The same that once till dawn did closely fold You in with fair Charaxus, fair no more. But Sappho, and the white leaves of her song, Will make your name a word for all to learn, And all to love thereafter, even while COLLECTED POEMS It's but a name; and this will be as long As there are distant ships that will return Again to your Naucratis and the Nile. VI The Dust of Timas (Sappho) This dust was Timas; and they say That almost on her wedding day She found her bridal home to be The dark house of Persephone. And many maidens, knowing then That she would not come back again, Unbound their curls; and all in tears, They cut them off with sharpened shears. VII Aretemias (Antipater of Sidon) I'm sure I see it all now as it was, When first you set your foot upon the shore Where dim Cocytus flows for evermore, And how it came to pass That all those Dorian women who are there In Hades, and still fair, Came up to you, so young, and wept and smiled When they beheld you and your little child. And then, I'm sure, with tears upon your face To be in that sad place, VARIATIONS OF GREEK THEMES You told of the two children you had borne, And then of Euphron, whom you leave to mourn. "One stays with him," you said, "And this one I bring with me to the dead." VIII The Old Story (Marcus Argentarius) Like many a one, when you had gold Love met you smiling, we are told; But now that all your gold is gone, Love leaves you hungry and alone. And women, who have called you more Sweet names than ever were before, Will ask another now to tell What man you are and where you dwell. Was ever anyone but you So long in learning what is true? Must you find only at the end That who has nothing has no friend? IX To-morrow (Macedonius) To-morrow? Then your one word left is always now the same: And that's a word that names a day that has no more a name. To-morrow, I have learned at last, is all you have to give: COLLECTED POEMS The rest will be another's now, as long as I may live. You will see me in the evening?—And what evening has there been, Since time began with women, but old age and wrinkled skin? X Lais to Aphrodite (Plato) When I, poor Lais, with my crown Of beauty could laugh Hellas down, Young lovers crowded at my door, Where now my lovers come no more. So, Goddess, you will not refuse A mirror that has now no use; For what I was I cannot be, And what I am I will not see. XI An Inscription by the Sea (Glaucus) No dust have I to cover me, My grave no man may show; My tomb is this unending sea, And I lie far below. My fate, O stranger, was to drown; And where it was the ship went down Is what the sea-birds know. THE FIELD OF GLORY THE FIELD OF GLORY War shook the land where Levi dwelt, And fired the dismal wrath he felt, That such a doom was ever wrought As his, to toil while others fought; To toil, to dream—and still to dream, With one day barren as another; To consummate, as it would seem, The dry despair of his old mother. Far off one afternoon began The sound of man destroying man; And Levi, sick with nameless rage, Condemned again his heritage, And sighed for scars that might have come, And would, if once he could have sundered Those harsh, inhering claims of home That held him while he cursed and wondered. Another day, and then there came, Rough, bloody, ribald, hungry, lame, But yet themselves, to Levi's door, Two remnants of the day before. They laughed at him and what he sought; They jeered him, and his painful acre; But Levi knew that they had fought, And left their manners to their Maker. That night, for the grim widow's ears, With hopes that hid themselves in fears, He told of arms, and fiery deeds, Whereat one leaps the while he reads, COLLECTED POEMS And said he'd be no more a clown, While others drew the breath of battle.— The mother looked him up and down, And laughed—a scant laugh with a rattle. She told him what she found to tell, And Levi listened, and heard well Some admonitions of a voice That left him no cause to rejoice.— He sought a friend, and found the stars, And prayed aloud that they should aid him; But they said not a word of wars, Or of a reason why God made him. And who's of this or that estate We do not wholly calculate, When baffling shades that shift and cling Are not without their glimmering; When even Levi, tired of faith, Beloved of none, forgot by many, Dismissed as an inferior wraith, Reborn may be as great as any.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MERLIN (1917) To George Burnham MERLIN I "Gawaine, Gawaine, what look ye for to see, So far beyond the faint edge of the world? D'ye look to see the lady Vivian, Pursued by divers ominous vile demons That have another king more fierce than ours? Or think ye that if ye look far enough And hard enough into the feathery west Ye'll have a glimmer of the Grail itself? And if ye look for neither Grail nor lady, What look ye for to see, Gawaine, Gawaine?" So Dagonet, whom Arthur made a knight Because he loved him as he laughed at him, Intoned his idle presence on a day To Gawaine, who had thought himself alone, Had there been in him thought of anything Save what was murmured now in Camelot Of Merlin's hushed and all but unconfirmed Appearance out of Brittany. It was heard At first there was a ghost in Arthur's palace, But soon among the scullions and anon Among the knights a firmer credit held All tongues from uttering what all glances told— Though not for long. Gawaine, this afternoon, Fearing he might say more to Lancelot COLLECTED POEMS Of Merlin's rumor-laden resurrection Than Lancelot would have an ear to cherish, Had sauntered off with his imagination To Merlin's Rock, where now there was no Merlin To meditate upon a whispering town Below him in the silence.—Once he said To Gawaine: "You are young; and that being so, Behold the shining city of our dreams And of our King."—"Long live the King," said Gawaine.— "Long live the King," said Merlin after him; "Better for me that I shall not be King; Wherefore I say again, Long live the King, And add, God save him, also, and all kings— All kings and queens. I speak in general. Kings have I known that were but weary men With no stout appetite for more than peace That was not made for them."—"Nor were they made For kings," Gawaine said, laughing.—"You are young, Gawaine, and you may one day hold the world Between your fingers, knowing not what it is That you are holding. Better for you and me, I think, that we shall not be kings." Gawaine, Remembering Merlin's words of long ago, Frowned as he thought, and having frowned again, He smiled and threw an acorn at a lizard: "There's more afoot and in the air to-day Than what is good for Camelot. Merlin May or may not know all, but he said well To say to me that he would not be King. Nor more would I be King." Far down he gazed On Camelot, until he made of it A phantom town of many stillnesses, MERLIN Not reared for men to dwell in, or for kings To reign in, without omens and obscure Familiars to bring terror to their days; For though a knight, and one as hard at arms As any, save the fate-begotten few That all acknowledged or in envy loathed, He felt a foreign sort of creeping up And down him, as of moist things in the dark,— When Dagonet, coming on him unawares, Presuming on his title of Sir Fool, Addressed him and crooned on till he was done: "What look ye for to see, Gawaine, Gawaine?" "Sir Dagonet, you best and wariest Of all dishonest men, I look through Time, For sight of what it is that is to be. I look to see it, though I see it not. I see a town down there that holds a king, And over it I see a few small clouds— Like feathers in the west, as you observe; And I shall see no more this afternoon Than what there is around us every day, Unless you have a skill that I have not To ferret the invisible for rats." "If you see what's around us every day, You need no other showing to go mad. Remember that and take it home with you; And say tonight, `I had it of a fool— With no immediate obliquity For this one or for that one, or for me.' " Gawaine, having risen, eyed the fool curiously: "I'll not forget I had it of a knight, Whose only folly is to fool himself; And as for making other men to laugh, COLLECTED POEMS And so forget their sins and selves a little, There's no great folly there. So keep it up, As long as you've a legend or a song, And have whatever sport of us you like Till havoc is the word and we fall howling. For I've a guess there may not be so loud A sound of laughing here in Camelot When Merlin goes again to his gay grave In Brittany. To mention lesser terrors, Men say his beard is gone." "Do men say that?" A twitch of an impatient weariness Played for a moment over the lean face Of Dagonet, who reasoned inwardly: "The friendly zeal of this inquiring knight Will overtake his tact and leave it squealing, One of these days."—Gawaine looked hard at him: "If I be too familiar with a fool, I'm on the way to be another fool," He mused, and owned a rueful qualm within him: "Yes, Dagonet," he ventured, with a laugh, "Men tell me that his beard has vanished wholly, And that he shines now as the Lord's anointed, And wears the valiance of an ageless youth Crowned with a glory of eternal peace." Dagonet, smiling strangely, shook his head: "I grant your valiance of a kind of youth To Merlin, but your crown of peace I question; For, though I know no more than any churl Who pinches any chambermaid soever In the King's palace, I look not to Merlin For peace, when out of his peculiar tomb He comes again to Camelot. Time swings MERLIN A mighty scythe, and some day all your peace Goes down before its edge like so much clover. No, it is not for peace that Merlin comes, Without a trumpet—and without a beard, If what you say men say of him be true— Nor yet for sudden war." Gawaine, for a moment, Met then the ambiguous gaze of Dagonet, And, making nothing of it, looked abroad As if at something cheerful on all sides, And back again to the fool's unasking eyes: "Well, Dagonet, if Merlin would have peace, Let Merlin stay away from Brittany," Said he, with admiration for the man Whom Folly called a fool: "And we have known him; We knew him once when he knew everything." "He knew as much as God would let him know Until he met the lady Vivian. I tell you that, for the world knows all that; Also it knows he told the King one day That he was to be buried, and alive, In Brittany; and that the King should see The face of him no more. Then Merlin sailed Away to Vivian in Broceliande, Where now she crowns him and herself with flowers And feeds him fruits and wines and many foods Of many savors, and sweet ortolans. Wise books of every lore of every land Are there to fill his days, if he require them, And there are players of all instruments— Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols; and she sings To Merlin, till he trembles in her arms COLLECTED POEMS And there forgets that any town alive Had ever such a name as Camelot. So Vivian holds him with her love, they say, And he, who has no age, has not grown old. I swear to nothing, but that's what they say. That's being buried in Broceliande For too much wisdom and clairvoyancy. But you and all who live, Gawaine, have heard This tale, or many like it, more than once; And you must know that Love, when Love invites Philosophy to play, plays high and wins, Or low and loses. And you say to me, `If Merlin would have peace, let Merlin stay Away from Brittany.' Gawaine, you are young, And Merlin's in his grave." "Merlin said once That I was young, and it's a joy for me That I am here to listen while you say it. Young or not young, if that be burial, May I be buried long before I die. I might be worse than young; I might be old."— Dagonet answered, and without a smile: "Somehow I fancy Merlin saying that; A fancy—a mere fancy." Then he smiled: "And such a doom as his may be for you, Gawaine, should your untiring divination Delve in the veiled eternal mysteries Too far to be a pleasure for the Lord. And when you stake your wisdom for a woman, Compute the woman to be worth a grave, As Merlin did, and say no more about it. But Vivian, she played high. Oh, very high! Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols,—and her love. Gawaine, farewell." MERLIN "Farewell, Sir Dagonet, And may the devil take you presently." He followed with a vexed and envious eye, And with an arid laugh, Sir Dagonet's Departure, till his gaunt obscurity Was cloaked and lost amid the glimmering trees. "Poor fool!" he murmured. "Or am I the fool? With all my fast ascendency in arms, That ominous clown is nearer to the King Than I am—yet; and God knows what he knows, And what his wits infer from what he sees And feels and hears. I wonder what he knows Of Lancelot, or what I might know now, Could I have sunk myself to sound a fool To springe a friend. . . . No, I like not this day. There's a cloud coming over Camelot Larger than any that is in the sky,— Or Merlin would be still in Brittany, With Vivian and the viols. It's all too strange." And later, when descending to the city, Through unavailing casements he could hear The roaring of a mighty voice within, Confirming fervidly his own conviction: "It's all too strange, and half the world's half crazy!"— He scowled: "Well, I agree with Lamorak." He frowned, and passed: "And I like not this day." II Sir Lamorak, the man of oak and iron, Had with him now, as a care-laden guest, Sir Bedivere, a man whom Arthur loved As he had loved no man save Lancelot. COLLECTED POEMS Like one whose late-flown shaft of argument Had glanced and fallen afield innocuously, He turned upon his host a sudden eye That met from Lamorak's an even shaft Of native and unused authority; And each man held the other till at length Each turned away, shutting his heavy jaws Again together, prisoning thus two tongues That might forget and might not be forgiven. Then Bedivere, to find a plain way out, Said, "Lamorak, let us drink to some one here, And end this dryness. Who shall it be—the King, The Queen, or Lancelot?"—"Merlin," Lamorak growled; And then there were more wrinkles round his eyes Than Bedivere had said were possible. "There's no refusal in me now for that," The guest replied; "so, `Merlin' let it be. We've not yet seen him, but if he be here, And even if he should not be here, say `Merlin.' " They drank to the unseen from two new tankards, And fell straightway to sighing for the past, And what was yet before them. Silence laid A cogent finger on the lips of each Impatient veteran, whose hard hands lay clenched And restless on his midriff, until words Were stronger than strong Lamorak: "Bedivere," Began the solid host, "you may as well Say now as at another time hereafter That all your certainties have bruises on 'em, And all your pestilent asseverations Will never make a man a salamander— Who's born, as we are told, so fire won't bite him,— Or a slippery queen a nun who counts and burns MERLIN Herself to nothing with her beads and candles. There's nature, and what's in us, to be sifted Before we know ourselves, or any man Or woman that God suffers to be born. That's how I speak; and while you strain your mazard, Like Father Jove, big with a new Minerva, We'll say, to pass the time, that I speak well. God's fish! The King had eyes; and Lancelot Won't ride home to his mother, for she's dead. The story is that Merlin warned the King Of what's come now to pass; and I believe it And Arthur, he being Arthur and a king, Has made a more pernicious mess than one, We're told, for being so great and amorous: It's that unwholesome and inclement cub Young Modred I'd see first in hell before I'd hang too high the Queen or Lancelot; The King, if one may say it, set the pace, And we've two strapping bastards here to prove it. Young Borre, he's well enough; but as for Modred, I squirm as often as I look at him. And there again did Merlin warn the King, The story goes abroad; and I believe it." Sir Bedievere, as one who caught no more Than what he would of Lamorak's outpouring, Inclined his grizzled head and closed his eyes Before he sighed and rubbed his beard and spoke: "For all I know to make it otherwise, The Queen may be a nun some day or other; I'd pray to God for such a thing to be, If prayer for that were not a mockery. We're late now for much praying, Lamorak, When you and I can feel upon our faces A wind that has been blowing over ruins COLLECTED POEMS That we had said were castles and high towers— Till Merlin, or the spirit of him, came As the dead come in dreams. I saw the King This morning, and I saw his face. Therefore, I tell you, if a state shall have a king, The king must have the state, and be the state; Or then shall we have neither king nor state, But bones and ashes, and high towers all fallen: And we shall have, where late there was a kingdom, A dusty wreck of what was once a glory— A wilderness whereon to crouch and mourn And moralize, or else to build once more For something better or for something worse. Therefore again, I say that Lancelot Has wrought a potent wrong upon the King, And all who serve and recognize the King, And all who follow him and all who love him. Whatever the stormy faults he may have had, To look on him today is to forget them; And if it be too late for sorrow now To save him—for it was a broken man I saw this morning, and a broken king— The God who sets a day for desolation Will not forsake him in Avilion, Or whatsoever shadowy land there be Where peace awaits him on its healing shores." Sir Lamorak, shifting in his oaken chair, Growled like a dog and shook himself like one: "For the stone-chested, helmet-cracking knight That you are known to be from Lyonnesse To northward, Bedivere, you fol-de-rol When days are rancid, and you fiddle-faddle More like a woman than a man with hands Fit for the smiting of a crazy giant MERLIN With armor an inch thick, as we all know You are, when you're not sermonizing at us. As for the King, I say the King, no doubt, Is angry, sorry, and all sorts of things, For Lancelot, and for his easy Queen, Whom he took knowing she'd thrown sparks already On that same piece of tinder, Lancelot, Who fetched her with him from Leodogran Because the King—God save poor human reason!— Would prove to Merlin, who knew everything Worth knowing in those days, that he was wrong. I'll drink now and be quiet,—but, by God, I'll have to tell you, Brother Bedivere, Once more, to make you listen properly, That crowns and orders, and high palaces, And all the manifold ingredients Of this good solid kingdom, where we sit And spit now at each other with our eyes, Will not go rolling down to hell just yet Because a pretty woman is a fool. And here's Kay coming with his fiddle face As long now as two fiddles. Sit ye down, Sir Man, and tell us everything you know Of Merlin—or his ghost without a beard. What mostly is it?" Sir Kay, the seneschal, Sat wearily while he gazed upon the two: "To you it mostly is, if I err not, That what you hear of Merlin's coming back Is nothing more or less than heavy truth. But ask me nothing of the Queen, I say, For I know nothing. All I know of her Is what her eyes have told the silences That now attend her; and that her estate COLLECTED POEMS Is one for less complacent execration Than quips and innuendoes of the city Would augur for her sin—if there be sin— Or for her name—if now she have a name. And where, I say, is this to lead the King, And after him, the kingdom and ourselves? Here be we, three men of a certain strength And some confessed intelligence, who know That Merlin has come out of Brittany— Out of his grave, as he would say it for us— Because the King has now a desperation More strong upon him than a woman's net Was over Merlin—for now Merlin's here, And two of us who knew him know how well His wisdom, if he have it any longer, Will by this hour have sounded and appraised The grief and wrath and anguish of the King, Requiring mercy and inspiring fear Lest he forego the vigil now most urgent, And leave unwatched a cranny where some worm Or serpent may come in to speculate." "I know your worm, and his worm's name is Modred— Albeit the streets are not yet saying so," Said Lamorak, as he lowered his wrath and laughed A sort of poisonous apology To Kay: "And in the meantime, I'll be gyved! Here's Bedivere a-wailing for the King, And you, Kay, with a moist eye for the Queen. I think I'll blow a horn for Lancelot; For by my soul a man's in sorry case When Guineveres are out with eyes to scorch him: I'm not so ancient or so frozen certain That I'd ride horses down to skeletons MERLIN If she were after me. Has Merlin seen him— This Lancelot, this Queen-fed friend of ours?" Kay answered sighing, with a lonely scowl: "The picture that I conjure leaves him out; The King and Merlin are this hour together, And I can say no more; for I know nothing. But how the King persuaded or beguiled The stricken wizard from across the water Outriddles my poor wits. It's all too strange." "It's all too strange, and half the world's half crazy!" Roared Lamorak, forgetting once again The devastating carriage of his voice. "Is the King sick?" he said, more quietly; "Is he to let one damned scratch be enough To paralyze the force that heretofore Would operate a way through hell and iron, And iron already slimy with his blood? Is the King blind—with Modred watching him? Does he forget the crown for Lancelot? Does he forget that every woman mewing Shall some day be a handful of small ashes?" "You speak as one for whom the god of Love Has yet a mighty trap in preparation. We know you, Lamorak," said Bedivere: "We know you for a short man, Lamorak,— In deeds, if not in inches or in words; But there are fens and heights and distances That your capricious ranging has not yet Essayed in this weird region of man's love. Forgive me, Lamorak, but your words are words. Your deeds are what they are; and ages hence Will men remember your illustriousness, COLLECTED POEMS If there be gratitude in history. For me, I see the shadow of the end, Wherein to serve King Arthur to the end, And, if God have it so, to see the Grail Before I die." But Lamorak shook his head: "See what you will, or what you may. For me, I see no other than a stinking mess— With Modred stirring it, and Agravaine Spattering Camelot with as much of it As he can throw. The Devil got somehow Into God's workshop once upon a time, And out of the red clay that he found there He made a shape like Modred, and another As like as eyes are to this Agravaine. `I never made 'em,' said the good Lord God, `But let 'em go, and see what comes of 'em.' And that's what we're to do. As for the Grail, I've never worried it, and so the Grail Has never worried me." Kay sighed. "I see With Bedivere the coming of the end," He murmured; "for the King I saw today Was not, nor shall he ever be again, The King we knew. I say the King is dead; The man is living, but the King is dead. The wheel is broken." "Faugh!" said Lamorak; "There are no dead kings yet in Camelot; But there is Modred who is hatching ruin,— And when it hatches I may not be here. There's Gawaine too, and he does not forget MERLIN My father, who killed his. King Arthur's house Has more divisions in it than I like In houses; and if Modred's aim be good For backs like mine, I'm not long for the scene." III King Arthur, as he paced a lonely floor That rolled a muffled echo, as he fancied, All through the palace and out through the world, Might now have wondered hard, could he have heard Sir Lamorak's apathetic disregard Of what Fate's knocking made so manifest And ominous to others near the King— If any, indeed, were near him at this hour Save Merlin, once the wisest of all men, And weary Dagonet, whom he had made A knight for love of him and his abused Integrity. He might have wondered hard And wondered much; and after wondering, He might have summoned, with as little heart As he had now for crowns, the fond, lost Merlin, Whose Nemesis had made of him a slave, A man of dalliance, and a sybarite. "Men change in Brittany, Merlin," said the King; And even his grief had strife to freeze again A dreary smile for the transmuted seer Now robed in heavy wealth of purple silk, With frogs and foreign tassels. On his face, Too smooth now for a wizard or a sage, Lay written, for the King's remembering eyes, A pathos of a lost authority Long faded, and unconscionably gone; And on the King's heart lay a sudden cold: COLLECTED POEMS "I might as well have left him in his grave, As he would say it, saying what was true,— As death is true. This Merlin is not mine, But Vivian's. My crown is less than hers, And I am less than woman to this man." Then Merlin, as one reading Arthur's words On viewless tablets in the air before him: "Now, Arthur, since you are a child of mine— A foster-child, and that's a kind of child— Be not from hearsay or despair too eager To dash your meat with bitter seasoning, So none that are more famished than yourself Shall have what you refuse. For you are King, And if you starve yourself, you starve the state; And then by sundry looks and silences Of those you loved, and by the lax regard Of those you knew for fawning enemies, You may learn soon that you are King no more, But a slack, blasted, and sad-fronted man, Made sadder with a crown. No other friend Than I could say this to you, and say more; And if you bid me say no more, so be it." The King, who sat with folded arms, now bowed His head and felt, unfought and all aflame Like immanent hell-fire, the wretchedness That only those who are to lead may feel— And only they when they are maimed and worn Too sore to covet without shuddering The fixed impending eminence where death Itself were victory, could they but lead Unbitten by the serpents they had fed. Turning, he spoke: "Merlin, you say the truth: There is no man who could say more to me MERLIN Today, or say so much to me, and live. But you are Merlin still, or part of him; I did you wrong when I thought otherwise, And I am sorry now. Say what you will. We are alone, and I shall be alone As long as Time shall hide a reason here For me to stay in this infested world Where I have sinned and erred and heeded not Your counsel; and where you yourself—God save us!— Have gone down smiling to the smaller life That you and your incongruous laughter called Your living grave. God save us all, Merlin, When you, the seer, the founder, and the prophet, May throw the gold of your immortal treasure Back to the God that gave it, and then laugh Because a woman has you in her arms . . . Why do you sting me now with a small hive Of words that are all poison? I do not ask Much honey; but why poison me for nothing, And with a venom that I know already As I know crowns and wars? Why tell a king— A poor, foiled, flouted, miserable king— That if he lets rats eat his fingers off He'll have no fingers to fight battles with? I know as much as that, for I am still A king—who thought himself a little less Than God; a king who built him palaces On sand and mud, and hears them crumbling now, And sees them tottering, as he knew they must. You are the man who made me to be King— Therefore, say anything." Merlin, stricken deep With pity that was old, being born of old Foreshadowings, made answer to the King: COLLECTED POEMS "This coil of Lancelot and Guinevere Is not for any mortal to undo, Or to deny, or to make otherwise; But your most violent years are on their way To days, and to a sounding of loud hours That are to strike for war. Let not the time Between this hour and then be lost in fears, Or told in obscurations and vain faith In what has been your long security; For should your force be slower then than hate, And your regret be sharper than your sight, And your remorse fall heavier than your sword,— Then say farewell to Camelot, and the crown. But say not you have lost, or failed in aught Your golden horoscope of imperfection Has held in starry words that I have read. I see no farther now than I saw then, For no man shall be given of everything Together in one life; yet I may say The time is imminent when he shall come For whom I founded the Siege Perilous; And he shall be too much a living part Of what he brings, and what he burns away in, To be for long a vexed inhabitant Of this mad realm of stains and lower trials. And here the ways of God again are mixed: For this new knight who is to find the Grail For you, and for the least who pray for you In such lost coombs and hollows of the world As you have never entered, is to be The son of him you trusted—Lancelot, Of all who ever jeopardized a throne Sure the most evil-fated, saving one, Your son, begotten, though you knew not then Your leman was your sister, of Morgause; MERLIN For it is Modred now, not Lancelot, Whose native hate plans your annihilation— Though he may smile till he be sick, and swear Allegiance to an unforgiven father Until at last he shake an empty tongue Talked out with too much lying—though his lies Will have a truth to steer them. Trust him not, For unto you the father, he the son Is like enough to be the last of terrors— If in a field of time that looms to you Far larger than it is you fail to plant And harvest the old seeds of what I say, And so be nourished and adept again For what may come to be. But Lancelot Will have you first; and you need starve no more For the Queen's love, the love that never was. Your Queen is now your Kingdom, and hereafter Let no man take it from you, or you die. Let no man take it from you for a day; For days are long when we are far from what We love, and mischief's other name is distance. Let that be all, for I can say no more; Not even to Blaise the Hermit, were he living, Could I say more than I have given you now To hear; and he alone was my confessor." The King arose and paced the floor again. "I get gray comfort of dark words," he said; "But tell me not that you can say no more: You can, for I can hear you saying it. Yet I'll not ask for more. I have enough— Until my new knight comes to prove and find The promise and the glory of the Grail, Though I shall see no Grail. For I have built On sand and mud, and I shall see no Grail."— COLLECTED POEMS "Nor I," said Merlin. "Once I dreamed of it, But I was buried. I shall see no Grail, Nor would I have it otherwise. I saw Too much, and that was never good for man. The man who goes alone too far goes mad— In one way or another. God knew best, And he knows what is coming yet for me. I do not ask. Like you, I have enough." That night King Arthur's apprehension found In Merlin an obscure and restive guest, Whose only thought was on the hour of dawn, When he should see the last of Camelot And ride again for Brittany; and what words Were said before the King was left alone Were only darker for reiteration. They parted, all provision made secure For Merlin's early convoy to the coast, And Arthur tramped the past. The loneliness Of kings, around him like the unseen dead, Lay everywhere; and he was loath to move, As if in fear to meet with his cold hand The touch of something colder. Then a whim, Begotten of intolerable doubt, Seized him and stung him until he was asking If any longer lived among his knights A man to trust as once he trusted all, And Lancelot more than all. "And it is he Who is to have me first," so Merlin says,— "As if he had me not in hell already. Lancelot! Lancelot!" He cursed the tears That cooled his misery, and then he asked Himself again if he had one to trust Among his knights, till even Bedivere, Tor, Bors, and Percival, rough Lamorak, MERLIN Griflet, and Gareth, and gay Gawaine, all Were dubious knaves,—or they were like to be, For cause to make them so; and he had made Himself to be the cause. "God set me right, Before this folly carry me on farther," He murmured; and he smiled unhappily, Though fondly, as he thought: "Yes, there is one Whom I may trust with even my soul's last shred; And Dagonet will sing for me tonight An old song, not too merry or too sad." When Dagonet, having entered, stood before The King as one affrighted, the King smiled: "You think because I call for you so late That I am angry, Dagonet? Why so? Have you been saying what I say to you, And telling men that you brought Merlin here? No? So I fancied; and if you report No syllable of anything I speak, You will have no regrets, and I no anger. What word of Merlin was abroad today?" "Today have I heard no man save Gawaine, And to him I said only what all men Are saying to their neighbors. They believe That you have Merlin here, and that his coming Denotes no good. Gawaine was curious, But ever mindful of your majesty. He pressed me not, and we made light of it." "Gawaine, I fear, makes light of everything," The King said, looking down. "Sometimes I wish I had a full Round Table of Gawaines. But that's a freak of midnight,—never mind it. Sing me a song—one of those endless things COLLECTED POEMS That Merlin liked of old, when men were younger And there were more stars twinkling in the sky. I see no stars that are alive tonight, And I am not the king of sleep. So then, Sing me an old song." Dagonet's quick eye Caught sorrow in the King's; and he knew more, In a fool's way, than even the King himself Of what was hovering over Camelot. "O King," he said, "I cannot sing tonight. If you command me I shall try to sing, But I shall fail; for there are no songs now In my old throat, or even in these poor strings That I can hardly follow with my fingers. Forgive me—kill me—but I cannot sing." Dagonet fell down then on both his knees And shook there while he clutched the King's cold hand And wept for what he knew. "There, Dagonet; I shall not kill my knight, or make him sing. No more; get up, and get you off to bed. There'll be another time for you to sing, So get you to your covers and sleep well." Alone again, the King said, bitterly: "Yes, I have one friend left, and they who know As much of him as of themselves believe That he's a fool. Poor Dagonet's a fool. And if he be a fool, what else am I Than one fool more to make the world complete? `The love that never was!' . . . Fool, fool, fool, fool!" The King was long awake. No covenant With peace was his tonight; and he knew sleep MERLIN As he knew the cold eyes of Guinevere That yesterday had stabbed him, having first On Lancelot's name struck fire, and left him then As now they left him—with a wounded heart, A wounded pride, and a sickening pang worse yet Of lost possession. He thought wearily Of watchers by the dead, late wayfarers, Rough-handed mariners on ships at sea, Lone-yawning sentries, wastrels, and all others Who might be saying somewhere to themselves, "The King is now asleep in Camelot; God save the King."—"God save the King, indeed, If there be now a king to save," he said. Then he saw giants rising in the dark, Born horribly of memories and new fears That in the gray-lit irony of dawn Were partly to fade out and be forgotten; And then there might be sleep, and for a time There might again be peace. His head was hot And throbbing; but the rest of him was cold, As he lay staring hard where nothing stood, And hearing what was not, even while he saw And heard, like dust and thunder far away, The coming confirmation of the words Of him who saw so much and feared so little Of all that was to be. No spoken doom That ever chilled the last night of a felon Prepared a dragging anguish more profound And absolute than Arthur, in these hours, Made out of darkness and of Merlin's words; No tide that ever crashed on Lyonnesse Drove echoes inland that were lonelier For widowed ears among the fisher-folk, Than for the King were memories tonight Of old illusions that were dead for ever. Collected Poems IV The tortured King—seeing Merlin wholly meshed In his defection, even to indifference, And all the while attended and exalted By some unfathomable obscurity Of divination, where the Grail, unseen, Broke yet the darkness where a king saw nothing— Feared now the lady Vivian more than Fate; For now he knew that Modred, Lancelot, The Queen, the King, the Kingdom, and the World, Were less to Merlin, who had made him King, Than one small woman in Broceliande. Whereas the lady Vivian, seeing Merlin Acclaimed and tempted and allured again To service in his old magnificence, Feared now King Arthur more than storms and robbers; For Merlin, though he knew himself immune To no least whispered little wish of hers That might afflict his ear with ecstasy, Had yet sufficient of his old command Of all around him to invest an eye With quiet lightning, and a spoken word With easy thunder, so accomplishing A profit and a pastime for himself— And for the lady Vivian, when her guile Outlived at intervals her graciousness; And this equipment of uncertainty, Which now had gone away with him to Britain With Dagonet, so plagued her memory That soon a phantom brood of goblin doubts Inhabited his absence, which had else Been empty waiting and a few brave fears, And a few more, she knew, that were not brave, Or long to be disowned, or manageable. MERLIN She thought of him as he had looked at her When first he had acquainted her alarm At sight of the King's letter with its import; And she remembered now his very words: "The King believes today as in his boyhood That I am Fate," he said; and when they parted She had not even asked him not to go; She might as well, she thought, have bid the wind Throw no more clouds across a lonely sky Between her and the moon,—so great he seemed In his oppressed solemnity, and she, In her excess of wrong imagining, So trivial in an hour, and, after all A creature of a smaller consequence Than kings to Merlin, who made kings and kingdoms And had them as a father; and so she feared King Arthur more than robbers while she waited For Merlin's promise to fulfil itself, And for the rest that was to follow after: "He said he would come back, and so he will. He will because he must, and he is Merlin, The master of the world—or so he was; And he is coming back again to me Because he must and I am Vivian. It's all as easy as two added numbers: Some day I'll hear him ringing at the gate, As he rang on that morning in the spring, Ten years ago; and I shall have him then For ever. He shall never go away Though kings come walking on their hands and knees To take him on their backs." When Merlin came, She told him that, and laughed; and he said strangely: "Be glad or sorry, but no kings are coming. Not Arthur, surely; for now Arthur knows That I am less than Fate." COLLECTED POEMS Ten years ago The King had heard, with unbelieving ears At first, what Merlin said would be the last Reiteration of his going down To find a living grave in Brittany: "Buried alive I told you I should be, By love made little and by woman shorn, Like Samson, of my glory; and the time Is now at hand. I follow in the morning Where I am led. I see behind me now The last of crossways, and I see before me A straight and final highway to the end Of all my divination. You are King, And in your kingdom I am what I was. Wherever I have warned you, see as far As I have seen; for I have shown the worst There is to see. Require no more of me, For I can be no more than what I was." So, on the morrow, the King said farewell; And he was never more to Merlin's eye The King than at that hour; for Merlin knew How much was going out of Arthur's life With him, as he went southward to the sea. Over the waves and into Brittany Went Merlin, to Broceliande. Gay birds Were singing high to greet him all along A broad and sanded woodland avenue That led him on forever, so he thought, Until at last there was an end of it; And at the end there was a gate of iron, Wrought heavily and invidiously barred. He pulled a cord that rang somewhere a bell Of many echoes, and sat down to rest, Outside the keeper's house, upon a bench MERLIN Of carven stone that might for centuries Have waited there in silence to receive him. The birds were singing still; leaves flashed and swung Before him in the sunlight; a soft breeze Made intermittent whisperings around him Of love and fate and danger, and faint waves Of many sweetly-stinging fragile odors Broke lightly as they touched him; cherry-boughs Above him snowed white petals down upon him, And under their slow falling Merlin smiled Contentedly, as one who contemplates No longer fear, confusion, or regret, May smile at ruin or at revelation. A stately fellow with a forest air Now hailed him from within, with searching words And curious looks, till Merlin's glowing eye Transfixed him and he flinched: "My compliments And homage to the lady Vivian. Say Merlin from King Arthur's Court is here, A pilgrim and a stranger in appearance, Though in effect her friend and humble servant. Convey to her my speech as I have said it, Without abbreviation or delay, And so deserve my gratitude forever." "But Merlin?" the man stammered; "Merlin? Merlin?"— "One Merlin is enough. I know no other. Now go you to the lady Vivian And bring to me her word, for I am weary." Still smiling at the cherry-blossoms falling Down on him and around him in the sunlight, He waited, never moving, never glancing This way or that, until his messenger Came jingling into vision, weighed with keys, And inly shaken with much wondering COLLECTED POEMS At this great wizard's coming unannounced And unattended. When the way was open The stately messenger, now bowing low In reverence and awe, bade Merlin enter; And Merlin, having entered, heard the gate Clang back behind him; and he swore no gate Like that had ever clanged in Camelot, Or any other place if not in hell. "I may be dead; and this good fellow here, With all his keys," he thought, "may be the Devil,— Though I were loath to say so, for the keys Would make him rather more akin to Peter; And that's fair reasoning for this fair weather." "The lady Vivian says you are most welcome," Said now the stately-favored servitor, "And are to follow me. She said, `Say Merlin— A pilgrim and a stranger in appearance, Though in effect my friend and humble servant— Is welcome for himself, and for the sound Of his great name that echoes everywhere.' "— "I like you and I like your memory," Said Merlin, curiously, "but not your gate. Why forge for this elysian wilderness A thing so vicious with unholy noise?"— "There's a way out of every wilderness For those who dare or care enough to find it," The guide said: and they moved along together, Down shaded ways, through open ways with hedgerows. And into shade again more deep than ever, But edged anon with rays of broken sunshine In which a fountain, raining crystal music, Made faery magic of it through green leafage, Till Merlin's eyes were dim with preparation For sight now of the lady Vivian. MERLIN He saw at first a bit of living green That might have been a part of all the green Around the tinkling fountain where she gazed Upon the circling pool as if her thoughts Were not so much on Merlin—whose advance Betrayed through his enormity of hair The cheeks and eyes of youth—as on the fishes. But soon she turned and found him, now alone, And held him while her beauty and her grace Made passing trash of empires, and his eyes Told hers of what a splendid emptiness Her tedious world had been without him in it Whose love and service were to be her school, Her triumph, and her history: "This is Merlin," She thought; "and I shall dream of him no more. And he has come, he thinks, to frighten me With beards and robes and his immortal fame; Or is it I who think so? I know not. I'm frightened, sure enough, but if I show it, I'll be no more the Vivian for whose love He tossed away his glory, or the Vivian Who saw no man alive to make her love him Till she saw Merlin once in Camelot, And seeing him, saw no other. In an age That has no plan for me that I can read Without him, shall he tell me what I am, And why I am, I wonder?" While she thought, And feared the man whom her perverse negation Must overcome somehow to soothe her fancy, She smiled and welcomed him; and so they stood, Each finding in the other's eyes a gleam Of what eternity had hidden there. "Are you always all in green, as you are now?" Said Merlin, more employed with her complexion, COLLECTED POEMS Where blood and olive made wild harmony With eyes and wayward hair that were too dark For peace if they were not subordinated; "If so you are, then so you make yourself A danger in a world of many dangers. If I were young, God knows if I were safe Concerning you in green, like a slim cedar, As you are now, to say my life was mine: Were you to say to me that I should end it, Longevity for me were jeopardized. Have you your green on always and all over?" "Come here, and I will tell you about that," Said Vivian, leading Merlin with a laugh To an arbored seat where they made opposites: "If you are Merlin—and I know you are, For I remember you in Camelot,— You know that I am Vivian, as I am; And if I go in green, why, let me go so, And say at once why you have come to me Cloaked over like a monk, and with a beard As long as Jeremiah's. I don't like it. I'll never like a man with hair like that While I can feed a carp with little frogs. I'm rather sure to hate you if you keep it, And when I hate a man I poison him." "You've never fed a carp with little frogs," Said Merlin; "I can see it in your eyes."— "I might then, if I haven't," said the lady; "For I'm a savage, and I love no man As I have seen him yet. I'm here alone, With some three hundred others, all of whom Are ready, I dare say, to die for me; I'm cruel and I'm cold, and I like snakes; MERLIN And some have said my mother was a fairy, Though I believe it not." "Why not believe it?" Said Merlin; "I believe it. I believe Also that you divine, as I had wished, In my surviving ornament of office A needless imposition on your wits, If not yet on the scope of your regard. Even so, you cannot say how old I am, Or yet how young. I'm willing cheerfully To fight, left-handed, Hell's three headed hound If you but whistle him up from where he lives; I'm cheerful and I'm fierce, and I've made kings; And some have said my father was the Devil, Though I believe it not. Whatever I am, I have not lived in Time until to-day." A moment's worth of wisdom there escaped him, But Vivian seized it, and it was not lost. Embroidering doom with many levities, Till now the fountain's crystal silver, fading, Became a splash and a mere chilliness, They mocked their fate with easy pleasantries That were too false and small to be forgotten, And with ingenious insincerities That had no repetition or revival. At last the lady Vivian arose, And with a crying of how late it was Took Merlin's hand and led him like a child Along a dusky way between tall cones Of tight green cedars: "Am I like one of these? You said I was, though I deny it wholly."— "Very," said Merlin, to his bearded lips Uplifting her small fingers.—"O, that hair!" COLLECTED POEMS She moaned, as if in sorrow: "Must it be? Must every prophet and important wizard Be clouded so that nothing but his nose And eyes, and intimations of his ears, Are there to make us know him when we see him? Praise heaven I'm not a prophet! Are you glad?"— He did not say that he was glad or sorry; For suddenly came flashing into vision A thing that was a manor and a castle, With walls and roofs that had a flaming sky Behind them, like a sky that he remembered, And one that had from his rock-sheltered haunt Above the roofs of his forsaken city Made flame as if all Camelot were on fire. The glow brought with it a brief memory Of Arthur as he left him, and the pain That fought in Arthur's eyes for losing him, And must have overflowed when he had vanished. But now the eyes that looked hard into his Were Vivian's, not the King's; and he could see, Or so he thought, a shade of sorrow in them. She took his two hands: "You are sad," she said.— He smiled: "Your western lights bring memories Of Camelot. We all have memories— Prophets, and women who are like slim cedars; But you are wrong to say that I am sad."— "Would you go back to Camelot?" she asked, Her fingers tightening. Merlin shook his head. "Then listen while I tell you that I'm glad," She purred, as if assured that he would listen: "At your first warning, much too long ago, Of this quaint pilgrimage of yours to see `The fairest and most orgulous of ladies'— No language for a prophet, I am sure— MERLIN Said I, `When this great Merlin comes to me, My task and avocation for some time Will be to make him willing, if I can, To teach and feed me with an ounce of wisdom.' For I have eaten to an empty shell, After a weary feast of observation Among the glories of a tinsel world That had for me no glory till you came, A life that is no life. Would you go back To Camelot?"—Merlin shook his head again, And the two smiled together in the sunset. They moved along in silence to the door, Where Merlin said: "Of your three hundred here There is but one I know, and him I favor; I mean the stately one who shakes the keys Of that most evil sounding gate of yours, Which has a clang as if it shut forever."— "If there be need, I'll shut the gate myself," She said. "And you like Blaise? Then you shall have him. He was not born to serve, but serve he must, It seems, and be enamoured of my shadow. He cherishes the taint of some high folly That haunts him with a name he cannot know, And I could fear his wits are paying for it. Forgive his tongue, and humor it a little."— "I knew another one whose name was Blaise," He said; and she said lightly, "Well, what of it?"— "And he was nigh the learnedest of hermits; His home was far away from everywhere, And he was all alone there when he died."— "Now be a pleasant Merlin," Vivian said, Patting his arm, "and have no more of that; For I'll not hear of dead men far away, Or dead men anywhere this afternoon. COLLECTED POEMS There'll be a trifle in the way of supper This evening, but the dead shall not have any. Blaise and this man will tell you all there is For you to know. Then you'll know everything." She laughed, and vanished like a humming-bird. V The sun went down, and the dark after it Starred Merlin's new abode with many a sconced And many a moving candle, in whose light The prisoned wizard, mirrored in amazement, Saw fronting him a stranger, falcon-eyed, Firm-featured, of a negligible age, And fair enough to look upon, he fancied, Though not a warrior born, nor more a courtier. A native humor resting in his long And solemn jaws now stirred, and Merlin smiled To see himself in purple, touched with gold, And fledged with snowy lace.—The careful Blaise, Having drawn some time before from Merlin's wallet The sable raiment of a royal scholar, Had eyed it with a long mistrust and said: "The lady Vivian would be vexed, I fear, To meet you vested in these learned weeds Of gravity and death; for she abhors Mortality in all its hues and emblems— Black wear, long argument, and all the cold And solemn things that appertain to graves."— And Merlin, listening, to himself had said, "This fellow has a freedom, yet I like him;" And then aloud: "I trust you. Deck me out, However, with a temperate regard For what your candid eye may find in me Of inward coloring. Let them reap my beard, MERLIN Moreover, with a sort of reverence, For I shall never look on it again. And though your lady frown her face away To think of me in black, for God's indulgence, Array me not in scarlet or in yellow."— And so it came to pass that Merlin sat At ease in purple, even though his chin Reproached him as he pinched it, and seemed yet A little fearful of its nakedness. He might have sat and scanned himself for ever Had not the careful Blaise, regarding him, Remarked again that in his proper judgment, And on the valid word of his attendants, No more was to be done. "Then do no more," Said Merlin, with a last look at his chin; "Never do more when there's no more to do, And you may shun thereby the bitter taste Of many disillusions and regrets. God's pity on us that our words have wings And leave our deeds to crawl so far below them; For we have all two heights, we men who dream, Whether we lead or follow, rule or serve."— "God's pity on us anyhow," Blaise answered, "Or most of us. Meanwhile, I have to say, As long as you are here, and I'm alive, Your summons will assure the loyalty Of all my diligence and expedition. The gong that you hear singing in the distance Was rung for your attention and your presence."— "I wonder at this fellow, yet I like him," Said Merlin; and he rose to follow him. The lady Vivian in a fragile sheath Of crimson, dimmed and veiled ineffably By the flame-shaken gloom wherein she rat, COLLECTED POEMS And twinkled if she moved, heard Merlin coming, And smiled as if to make herself believe Her joy was all a triumph; yet her blood Confessed a tingling of more wonderment Than all her five and twenty worldly years Of waiting for this triumph could remember; And when she knew and felt the slower tread Of his unseen advance among the shadows To the small haven of uncertain light That held her in it as a torch-lit shoal Might hold a smooth red fish, her listening skin Responded with a creeping underneath it, And a crinkling that was incident alike To darkness, love, and mice. When he was there, She looked up at him in a whirl of mirth And wonder, as in childhood she had gazed Wide-eyed on royal mountebanks who made So brief a shift of the impossible That kings and queens would laugh and shake themselves; Then rising slowly on her little feet, Like a slim creature lifted, she thrust out Her two small hands as if to push him back— Whereon he seized them. "Go away," she said; "I never saw you in my life before."— "You say the truth," he answered; "when I met Myself an hour ago, my words were yours. God made the man you see for you to like, If possible. If otherwise, turn down These two prodigious and remorseless thumbs And leave your lions to annihilate him."— "I have no other lion than yourself," She said; "and since you cannot eat yourself, Pray do a lonely woman, who is, you say, More like a tree than any other thing MERLIN In your discrimination, the large honor Of sharing with her a small kind of supper."— "Yes, you are like a tree,—or like a flower; More like a flower to-night." He bowed his head And kissed the ten small fingers he was holding, As calmly as if each had been a son; Although his heart was leaping and his eyes Had sight for nothing save a swimming crimson Between two glimmering arms. "More like a flower To-night," he said, as now he scanned again The immemorial meaning of her face And drew it nearer to his eyes. It seemed A flower of wonder with a crimson stem Came leaning slowly and regretfully To meet his will—a flower of change and peril That had a clinging blossom of warm olive Half stifled with a tyranny of black, And held the wayward fragrance of a rose Made woman by delirious alchemy. She raised her face and yoked his willing neck With half her weight; and with hot lips that left The world with only one philosophy For Merlin or for Anaxagoras, Called his to meet them and in one long hush Of capture to surrender and make hers The last of anything that might remain Of what was now their beardless wizardry. Then slowly she began to push herself Away, and slowly Merlin let her go As far from him as his outreaching hands Could hold her fingers while his eyes had all The beauty of the woodland and the world Before him in the firelight, like a nymph Of cities, or a queen a little weary Of inland stillness and immortal trees. COLLECTED POEMS "Are you to let me go again sometime," She said,—"before I starve to death, I wonder? If not, I'll have to bite the lion's paws, And make him roar. He cannot shake his mane, For now the lion has no mane to shake; The lion hardly knows himself without it, And thinks he has no face, but there's a lady Who says he had no face until he lost it. So there we are. And there's a flute somewhere, Playing a strange old tune. You know the words: `The Lion and the Lady are both hungry.' " Fatigue and hunger—tempered leisurely With food that some devout magician's oven Might after many failures have delivered, And wine that had for decades in the dark Of Merlin's grave been slowly quickening, And with half-heard, dream-weaving interludes Of distant flutes and viols, made more distant By far, nostalgic hautboys blown from nowhere,— Were tempered not so leisurely, may be, With Vivian's inextinguishable eyes Between two shining silver candlesticks That lifted each a trembling flame to make The rest of her a dusky loveliness Against a bank of shadow. Merlin made, As well as he was able while he ate, A fair division of the fealty due To food and beauty, albeit more times than one Was he at odds with his urbanity In honoring too long the grosser viand. "The best invention in Broceliande Has not been over-taxed in vain, I see," She told him, with her chin propped on her fingers And her eyes flashing blindness into his: MERLIN "I put myself out cruelly to please you, And you, for that, forget almost at once The name and image of me altogether. You needn't, for when all is analyzed, It's only a bird-pie that you are eating." "I know not what you call it," Merlin said; "Nor more do I forget your name and image, Though I do eat; and if I did not eat, Your sending out of ships and caravans To get whatever 'tis that's in this thing Would be a sorrow for you all your days; And my great love, which you have seen by now, Might look to you a lie; and like as not You'd actuate some sinewed mercenary To carry me away to God knows where And seal me in a fearsome hole to starve, Because I made of this insidious picking An idle circumstance. My dear fair lady— And there is not another under heaven So fair as you are as I see you now— I cannot look at you too much and eat; And I must eat, or be untimely ashes, Whereon the light of your celestial gaze Would fall, I fear me, for no longer time Than on the solemn dust of Jeremiah— Whose beard you likened once, in heathen jest, To mine that now is no man's." "Are you sorry?" Said Vivian, filling Merlin's empty goblet; "If you are sorry for the loss of it, Drink more of this and you may tell me lies Enough to make me sure that you are glad; But if your love is what you say it is, COLLECTED POEMS Be never sorry that my love took off That horrid hair to make your face at last A human fact. Since I have had your name To dream of and say over to myself, The visitations of that awful beard Have been a terror for my nights and days— For twenty years. I've seen it like an ocean, Blown seven ways at once and wrecking ships, With men and women screaming for their lives; I've seen it woven into shining ladders That ran up out of sight and so to heaven, All covered with white ghosts with hanging robes Like folded wings,—and there were millions of them, Climbing, climbing, climbing, all the time; And all the time that I was watching them I thought how far above me Merlin was, And wondered always what his face was like. But even then, as a child, I knew the day Would come some time when I should see his face And hear his voice, and have him in my house Till he should care no more to stay in it, And go away to found another kingdom."— "Not that," he said; and, sighing, drank more wine; "One kingdom for one Merlin is enough."— "One Merlin for one Vivian is enough," She said. "If you care much, remember that; But the Lord knows how many Vivians One Merlin's entertaining eye might favor, Indifferently well and all at once, If they were all at hand. Praise heaven they're not." "If they were in the world—praise heaven they're not— And if one Merlin's entertaining eye Saw two of them, there might be left him then The sight of no eye to see anything— MERLIN Not even the Vivian who is everything, She being Beauty, Beauty being She, She being Vivian, and so on for ever."— "I'm glad you don't see two of me," she said; "For there's a whole world yet for you to eat And drink and say to me before I know The sort of creature that you see in me. I'm withering for a little more attention, But, being woman, I can wait. These cups That you see coming are for the last there is Of what my father gave to kings alone, And far from always. You are more than kings To me; therefore I give it all to you, Imploring you to spare no more of it Than a small cockle-shell would hold for me To pledge your love and mine in. Take the rest, That I may see tonight the end of it. I'll have no living remnant of the dead Annoying me until it fades and sours Of too long cherishing; for Time enjoys The look that's on our faces when we scowl On unexpected ruins, and thrift itself May be a sort of slow unwholesome fire That eats away to dust the life that feeds it. You smile, I see, but I said what I said. One hardly has to live a thousand years To contemplate a lost economy; So let us drink it while it's yet alive And you and I are not untimely ashes. My last words are your own, and I don't like 'em."— A sudden laughter scattered from her eyes A threatening wisdom. He smiled and let her laugh, Then looked into the dark where there was nothing: "There's more in this than I have seen," he thought, "Though I shall see it."—"Drink," she said again; COLLECTED POEMS "There's only this much in the world of it, And I am near to giving all to you Because you are so great and I so little." With a long-kindling gaze that caught from hers A laughing flame, and with a hand that shook Like Arthur's kingdom, Merlin slowly raised A golden cup that for a golden moment Was twinned in air with hers; and Vivian, Who smiled at him across their gleaming rims, From eyes that made a fuel of the night Surrounding her, shot glory over gold At Merlin, while their cups touched and his trembled. He drank, not knowing what, nor caring much For kings who might have cared less for themselves, He thought, had all the darkness and wild light That fell together to make Vivian Been there before them then to flower anew Through sheathing crimson into candle-light With each new leer of their loose, liquorish eyes. Again he drank, and he cursed every king Who might have touched her even in her cradle; For what were kings to such as he, who made them And saw them totter—for the world to see, And heed, if the world would? He drank again, And yet again—to make himself assured No manner of king should have the last of it— The cup that Vivian filled unfailingly Until she poured for nothing. "At the end Of this incomparable flowing gold," She prattled on to Merlin, who observed Her solemnly, "I fear there may be specks."— He sighed aloud, whereat she laughed at him And pushed the golden cup a little nearer. He scanned it with a sad anxiety, MERLIN And then her face likewise, and shook his head As if at her concern for such a matter: "Specks? What are specks? Are you afraid of them?" He murmured slowly, with a drowsy tongue; "There are specks everywhere. I fear them not. If I were king in Camelot, I might Fear more than specks. But now I fear them not. You are too strange a lady to fear specks." He stared a long time at the cup of gold Before him but he drank no more. There came Between him and the world a crumbling sky Of black and crimson, with a crimson cloud That held a far off town of many towers. All swayed and shaken, till at last they fell, And there was nothing but a crimson cloud That crumbled into nothing, like the sky That vanished with it, carrying away The world, the woman, and all memory of them, Until a slow light of another sky Made gray an open casement, showing him Faint shapes of an exotic furniture That glimmered with a dim magnificence, And letting in the sound of many birds That were, as he lay there remembering, The only occupation of his ears Until it seemed they shared a fainter sound, As if a sleeping child with a black head Beside him drew the breath of innocence. One shining afternoon around the fountain, As on the shining day of his arrival, The sunlight was alive with flying silver That had for Merlin a more dazzling flash Than jewels rained in dreams, and a richer sound COLLECTED POEMS Than harps, and all the morning stars together,— When jewels and harps and stars and everything That flashed and sang and was not Vivian, Seemed less than echoes of her least of words— For she was coming. Suddenly, somewhere Behind him, she was coming; that was all He knew until she came and took his hand And held it while she talked about the fishes. When she looked up he thought a softer light Was in her eyes than once he had found there; And had there been left yet for dusky women A beauty that was heretofore not hers, He told himself he must have seen it then Before him in the face at which he smiled And trembled. "Many men have called me wise," He said, "but you are wiser than all wisdom If you know what you are."—"I don't," she said; "I know that you and I are here together; I know that I have known for twenty years That life would be almost a constant yawning Until you came; and now that you are here, I know that you are not to go away Until you tell me that I'm hideous; I know that I like fishes, ferns, and snakes,— Maybe because I liked them when the world Was young and you and I were salamanders; I know, too, a cool place not far from here, Where there are ferns that are like marching men Who never march away. Come now and see them, And do as they do—never march away. When they are gone, some others, crisp and green, Will have their place, but never march away."— He smoothed her silky fingers, one by one: "Some other Merlin, also, do you think, Will have his place—and never march away?"— MERLIN Then Vivian laid a finger on his lips And shook her head at him before she laughed: "There is no other Merlin than yourself, And you are never going to be old." Oblivious of a world that made of him A jest, a legend, and a long regret, And with a more commanding wizardry Than his to rule a kingdom where the king Was Love and the queen Vivian, Merlin found His queen without the blemish of a word That was more rough than honey from her lips, Or the first adumbration of a frown To cloud the night-wild fire that in her eyes Had yet a smoky friendliness of home, And a foreknowing care for mighty trifles. "There are miles and miles for you to wander in," She told him once: "Your prison yard is large, And I would rather take my two ears off And feed them to the fishes in the fountain Than buzz like an incorrigible bee For always around yours, and have you hate The sound of me; for some day then, for certain, Your philosophic rage would see in me A bee in earnest, and your hand would smite My life away. And what would you do then? I know: for years and years you'd sit alone Upon my grave, and be the grieving image Of lean remorse, and suffer miserably; And often, all day long, you'd only shake Your celebrated head and all it holds, Or beat it with your fist the while you groaned Aloud and went on saying to yourself: `Never should I have killed her, or believed She was a bee that buzzed herself to death, COLLECTED POEMS First having made me crazy, had there been Judicious distance and wise absences To keep the two of us inquisitive.' "— "I fear you bow your unoffending head Before a load that should be mine," said he; "If so, you led me on by listening. You should have shrieked and jumped, and then fled yelling; That's the best way when a man talks too long. God's pity on me if I love your feet More now than I could ever love the face Of any one of all those Vivians You summoned out of nothing on the night When I saw towers. I'll wander and amend."— At that she flung the noose of her soft arms Around his neck and kissed him instantly: "You are the wisest man that ever was, And I've a prayer to make: May all you say To Vivian be a part of what you knew Before the curse of her unquiet head Was on your shoulder, as you have it now, To punish you for knowing beyond knowledge. You are the only one who sees enough To make me see how far away I am From all that I have seen and have not been; You are the only thing there is alive Between me as I am and as I was When Merlin was a dream. You are to listen When I say now to you that I'm alone. Like you, I saw too much; and unlike you I made no kingdom out of what I saw— Or none save this one here that you must rule, Believing you are ruled. I see too far To rule myself. Time's way with you and me Is our way, in that we are out of Time And out of tune with Time. We have this place, MERLIN And you must hold us in it or we die. Look at me now and say if what I say Be folly or not; for my unquiet head Is no conceit of mine. I had it first When I was born; and I shall have it with me Till my unquiet soul is on its way To be, I hope, where souls are quieter. So let the first and last activity Of what you say so often is your love Be always to remember that our lyres Are not strung for Today. On you it falls To keep them in accord here with each other, For you have wisdom, I have only sight For distant things—and you. And you are Merlin. Poor wizard! Vivian is your punishment For making kings of men who are not kings; And you are mine, by the same reasoning, For living out of Time and out of tune With anything but you. No other man Could make me say so much of what I know As I say now to you. And you are Merlin!" She looked up at him till his way was lost Again in the familiar wilderness Of night that love made for him in her eyes, And there he wandered as he said he would; He wandered also in his prison-yard, And, when he found her coming after him, Beguiled her with her own admonishing And frowned upon her with a fierce reproof That many a time in the old world outside Had set the mark of silence on strong men— Whereat she laughed, not always wholly sure, Nor always wholly glad, that he who played So lightly was the wizard of her dreams: COLLECTED POEMS "No matter—if only Merlin keep the world Away," she thought. "Our lyres have many strings, But he must know them all, for he is Merlin." And so for years, till ten of them were gone,— Ten years, ten seasons, or ten flying ages— Fate made Broceliande a paradise, By none invaded, until Dagonet, Like a discordant, awakward bird of doom, Flew in with Arthur's message. For the King, In sorrow cleaving to simplicity, And having in his love a quick remembrance Of Merlin's old affection for the fellow, Had for this vain, reluctant enterprise Appointed him—the knight who made men laugh, And was a fool because he played the fool. "The King believes today, as in his boyhood, That I am Fate; and I can do no more Than show again what in his heart he knows," Said Merlin to himself and Vivian: "This time I go because I made him King, Thereby to be a mirror for the world; This time I go, but never after this, For I can be no more than what I was, And I can do no more than I have done." He took her slowly in his arms and felt Her body throbbing like a bird against him: "This time I go; I go because I must." And in the morning, when he rode away With Dagonet and Blaise through the same gate That once had clanged as if to shut for ever, She had not even asked him not to go; For it was then that in his lonely gaze MERLIN Of helpless love and sad authority She found the gleam of his imprisoned power That Fate withheld; and, pitying herself, She pitied the fond Merlin she had changed, And saw the Merlin who had changed the world. VI "No kings are coming on their hands and knees, Nor yet on horses or in chariots, To carry me away from you again," Said Merlin, winding around Vivian's ear A shred of her black hair. "King Arthur knows That I have done with kings, and that I speak No more their crafty language. Once I knew it, But now the only language I have left Is one that I must never let you hear Too long, or know too well. When towering deeds Once done shall only out of dust and words Be done again, the doer may then be wary Lest in the complement of his new fabric There be more words than dust." "Why tell me so?" Said Vivian; and a singular thin laugh Came after her thin question. "Do you think That I'm so far away from history That I require, even of the wisest man Who ever said the wrong thing to a woman, So large a light on what I know already— When all I seek is here before me now In your new eyes that you have brought for me From Camelot? The eyes you took away Were sad and old; and I could see in them A Merlin who remembered all the kings COLLECTED POEMS He ever saw, and wished himself, almost, Away from Vivian, to make other kings, And shake the world again in the old manner. I saw myself no bigger than a beetle For several days, and wondered if your love Were large enough to make me any larger When you came back. Am I a beetle still?" She stood up on her toes and held her cheek For some time against his, and let him go. "I fear the time has come for me to wander A little in my prison-yard," he said.— "No, tell me everything that you have seen And heard and done, and seen done, and heard done, Since you deserted me. And tell me first What the King thinks of me."—"The King believes That you are almost what you are," he told her: "The beauty of all ages that are vanished, Reborn to be the wonder of one woman."— "I knew he hated me. What else of him?"— "And all that I have seen and heard and done, Which is not much, would make a weary telling; And all your part of it would be to sleep, And dream that Merlin had his beard again."— "Then tell me more about your good fool knight, Sir Dagonet. If Blaise were not half-mad Already with his pondering on the name And shield of his unshielding nameless father, I'd make a fool of him. I'd call him Ajax; I'd have him shake his fist at thunder-storms, And dance a jig as long as there was lightning, And so till I forgot myself entirely. Not even your love may do so much as that."— "Thunder and lightning are no friends of mine," Said Merlin slowly, "more than they are yours; MERLIN They bring me nearer to the elements From which I came than I care now to be."— "You owe a service to those elements; For by their service you outwitted age And made the world a kingdom of your will."— He touched her hand, smiling: "Whatever service Of mine awaits them will not be forgotten," He said; and the smile faded on his face.— "Now of all graceless and ungrateful wizards—" But there she ceased, for she found in his eyes The first of a new fear. "The wrong word rules Today," she said; "and we'll have no more journeys." Although he wandered rather more than ever Since he had come again to Brittany From Camelot, Merlin found eternally Before him a new loneliness that made Of garden, park, and woodland, all alike, A desolation and a changelessness Defying reason, without Vivian Beside him, like a child with a black head, Or moving on before him, or somewhere So near him that, although he saw it not With eyes, he felt the picture of her beauty And shivered at the nearness of her being. Without her now there was no past or future, And a vague, soul-consuming premonition He found the only tenant of the present; He wondered, when she was away from him, If his avenging injured intellect Might shine with Arthur's kingdom a twin mirror, Fate's plaything, for new ages without eyes To see therein themselves and their declension. Love made his hours a martyrdom without her; The world was like an empty house without her, COLLECTED POEMS Where Merlin was a prisoner of love Confined within himself by too much freedom, Repeating an unending exploration Of many solitary silent rooms, And only in a way remembering now That once their very solitude and silence Had by the magic of expectancy Made sure what now he doubted—though his doubts, Day after day, were founded on a shadow. For now to Merlin, in his paradise, Had come an unseen angel with a sword Unseen, the touch of which was a long fear For longer sorrow that had never come, Yet might if he compelled it. He discovered, One golden day in autumn as he wandered, That he had made the radiance of two years A misty twilight when he might as well Have had no mist between him and the sun, The sun being Vivian. On his coming then To find her all in green against a wall Of green and yellow leaves, and crumbling bread For birds around the fountain while she sang And the birds ate the bread, he told himself That everything today was as it was At first, and for a minute he believed it. "I'd have you always all in green out here," He said, "if I had much to say about it."— She clapped her crumbs away and laughed at him: "I've covered up my bones with every color That I can carry on them without screaming, And you have liked them all—or made me think so."— "I must have liked them if you thought I did," He answered, sighing; "but the sight of you MERLIN Today as on the day I saw you first, All green, all wonderful" . . . He tore a leaf To pieces with a melancholy care That made her smile.—"Why pause at `wonderful'? You've hardly been yourself since you came back From Camelot, where that unpleasant King Said things that you have never said to me."— He looked upon her with a worn reproach: "The King said nothing that I keep from you."— "What is it then?" she asked, imploringly; "You man of moods and miracles, what is it?"— He shook his head and tore another leaf: "There is no need of asking what it is; Whatever you or I may choose to name it, The name of it is Fate, who played with me And gave me eyes to read of the unwritten More lines than I have read. I see no more Today than yesterday, but I remember. My ways are not the ways of other men; My memories go forward. It was you Who said that we were not in tune with Time; It was not I who said it."—"But you knew it; What matter then who said it?"—"It was you Who said that Merlin was your punishment For being in tune with him and not with Time— With Time or with the world; and it was you Who said you were alone, even here with Merlin; It was not I who said it. It is I Who tell you now my inmost thoughts." He laughed As if at hidden pain around his heart, But there was not much laughing in his eyes. They walked, and for a season they were silent: "I shall know what you mean by that," she said, "When you have told me. Here's an oak you like, And here's a place that fits me wondrous well COLLECTED POEMS To sit in. You sit there. I've seen you there Before; and I have spoiled your noble thoughts By walking all my fingers up and down Your countenance, as if they were the feet Of a small animal with no great claws. Tell me a story now about the world, And the men in it, what they do in it, And why it is they do it all so badly."— "I've told you every story that I know, Almost," he said.—"O, don't begin like that."— "Well, once upon a time there was a King."— "That has a more commendable address; Go on, and tell me all about the King; I'll bet the King had warts or carbuncles, Or something wrong in his divine insides, To make him wish that Adam had died young." Merlin observed her slowly with a frown Of saddened wonder. She laughed rather lightly, And at his heart he felt again the sword Whose touch was a long fear for longer sorrow. "Well, once upon a time there was a king," He said again, but now in a dry voice That wavered and betrayed a venturing. He paused, and would have hesitated longer, But something in him that was not himself Compelled an utterance that his tongue obeyed, As an unwilling child obeys a father Who might be richer for obedience If he obeyed the child: "There was a king Who would have made his reign a monument For kings and peoples of the waiting ages To reverence and remember, and to this end He coveted and won, with no ado To make a story of, a neighbor queen MERLIN Who limed him with her smile and had of him, In token of their sin, what he found soon To be a sort of mongrel son and nephew— And a most precious reptile in addition— To ornament his court and carry arms, And latterly to be the darker half Of ruin. Also the king, who made of love More than he made of life and death together, Forgot the world and his example in it For yet another woman—one of many— And this one he made Queen, albeit he knew That her unsworn allegiance to the knight That he had loved the best of all his order Must one day bring along the coming end Of love and honor and of everything; And with a kingdom builded on two pits Of living sin,—so founded by the will Of one wise counsellor who loved the king, And loved the world and therefore made him king To be a mirror for it,—the king reigned well For certain years, awaiting a sure doom; For certain years he waved across the world A royal banner with a Dragon on it; And men of every land fell worshipping The Dragon as it were the living God, And not the living sin." She rose at that, And after a calm yawn, she looked at Merlin: "Why all this new insistence upon sin?" She said; "I wonder if I understand This king of yours, with all his pits and dragons; I know I do not like him." A thinner light Was in her eyes than he had found in them Since he became the willing prisoner COLLECTED POEMS That she had made of him; and on her mouth Lay now a colder line of irony Than all his fears or nightmares could have drawn Before today: "What reason do you know For me to listen to this king of yours? What reading has a man of woman's days, Even though the man be Merlin and a prophet?" "I know no call for you to love the king," Said Merlin, driven ruinously along By the vindictive urging of his fate; "I know no call for you to love the king, Although you serve him, knowing not yet the king You serve. There is no man, or any woman, For whom the story of the living king Is not the story of the living sin. I thought my story was the common one, For common recognition and regard." "Then let us have no more of it," she said; "For we are not so common, I believe, That we need kings and pits and flags and dragons To make us know that we have let the world Go by us. Have you missed the world so much That you must have it in with all its clots And wounds and bristles on to make us happy— Like Blaise, with shouts and horns and seven men Triumphant with a most unlovely boar? Is there no other story in the world Than this one of a man that you made king To be a moral for the speckled ages? You said once long ago, if you remember, 'You are too strange a lady to fear specks'; And it was you, you said, who feared them not. Why do you look at me as at a snake MERLIN All coiled to spring at you and strike you dead? I am not going to spring at you, or bite you; I'm going home And you, if you are kind, Will have no fear to wander for an hour. I'm sure the time has come for you to wander; And there may come a time for you to say What most you think it is that we need here To make of this Broceliande a refuge Where two disheartened sinners may forget A world that has today no place for them." A melancholy wave of revelation Broke over Merlin like a rising sea, Long viewed unwillingly and long denied. He saw what he had seen, but would not feel, Till now the bitterness of what he felt Was in his throat, and all the coldness of it Was on him and around him like a flood Of lonelier memories than he had said Were memories, although he knew them now For what they were—for what his eyes had seen, For what his ears had heard and what his heart Had felt, with him not knowing what it felt. But now he knew that his cold angel's name Was Change, and that a mightier will than his Or Vivian's had ordained that he be there. To Vivian he could not say anything But words that had no more of hope in them Than anguish had of peace: "I meant the world . . . I meant the world," he groaned; "not you—not me." Again the frozen line of irony Was on her mouth. He looked up once at it. And then away—too fearful of her eyes To see what he could hear now in her laugh COLLECTED POEMS That melted slowly into what she said, Like snow in icy water: "This world of yours Will surely be the end of us. And why not? I'm overmuch afraid we're part of it,— Or why do we build walls up all around us, With gates of iron that make us think the day Of judgment's coming when they clang behind us? And yet you tell me that you fear no specks! With you I never cared for them enough To think of them. I was too strange a lady. And your return is now a speckled king And something that you call a living sin— That's like an uninvited poor relation Who comes without a welcome, rather late, And on a foundered horse." "Specks? What are specks?" He gazed at her in a forlorn wonderment That made her say: "You said, `I fear them not.' `If I were king in Camelot,' you said, `I might fear more than specks.' Have you forgotten? Don't tell me, Merlin, you are growing old. Why don't you make somehow a queen of me, And give me half the world? I'd wager thrushes That I should reign, with you to turn the wheel, As well as any king that ever was. The curse on me is that I cannot serve A ruler who forgets that he is king." In his bewildered misery Merlin then Stared hard at Vivian's face, more like a slave Who sought for common mercy than like Merlin: "You speak a language that was never mine, Or I have lost my wits. Why do you seize The flimsiest of opportunities MERLIN To make of what I said another thing Than love or reason could have let me say, Or let me fancy? Why do you keep the truth So far away from me, when all your gates Will open at your word and let me go To some place where no fear or weariness Of yours need ever dwell? Why does a woman, Made otherwise a miracle of love And loveliness, and of immortal beauty, Tear one word by the roots out of a thousand, And worry it, and torture it, and shake it. Like a small dog that has a rag to play with? What coil of an ingenious destiny Is this that makes of what I never meant A meaning as remote as hell from heaven?" "I don't know," Vivian said reluctantly, And half as if in pain; "I'm going home. I'm going home and leave you here to wander, Pray take your kings and sins away somewhere And bury them, and bury the Queen in also. I know this king; he lives in Camelot, And I shall never like him. There are specks Almost all over him. Long live the king, But not the king who lives in Camelot, With Modred, Lancelot, and Guinevere— And all four speckled like a merry nest Of addled eggs together. You made him King Because you loved the world and saw in him From infancy a mirror for the millions. The world will see itself in him, and then The world will say its prayers and wash its face, And build for some new king a new foundation. Long live the King! . . . But now I apprehend A time for me to shudder and grow old COLLECTED POEMS And garrulous—and so become a fright For Blaise to take out walking in warm weather— Should I give way to long considering Of worlds you may have lost while prisoned here With me and my light mind. I contemplate Another name for this forbidden place, And one more fitting. Tell me, if you find it, Some fitter name than Eden. We have had A man and woman in it for some time, And now, it seems, we have a Tree of Knowledge." She looked up at the branches overhead And shrugged her shoulders. Then she went away; And what was left of Merlin's happiness, Like a disloyal phantom, followed her. He felt the sword of his cold angel thrust And twisted in his heart, as if the end Were coming next, but the cold angel passed Invisibly and left him desolate, With misty brow and eyes. "The man who sees May see too far, and he may see too late The path he takes unseen," he told himself When he found thought again. "The man who sees May go on seeing till the immortal flame That lights and lures him folds him in its heart, And leaves of what there was of him to die An item of inhospitable dust That love and hate alike must hide away; Or there may still be charted for his feet A dimmer faring, where the touch of time Were like the passing of a twilight moth From flower to flower into oblivion, If there were not somewhere a barren end Of moths and flowers, and glimmering far away Beyond a desert where the flowerless days MERLIN Are told in slow defeats and agonies, The guiding of a nameless light that once Had made him see too much—and has by now Revealed in death, to the undying child Of Lancelot, the Grail. For this pure light Has many rays to throw, for many men To follow; and the wise are not all pure, Nor are the pure all wise who follow it. There are more rays than men. But let the man Who saw too much, and was to drive himself From paradise, play too lightly or too long Among the moths and flowers, he finds at last There is a dim way out; and he shall grope Where pleasant shadows lead him to the plain That has no shadow save his own behind him. And there, with no complaint, nor much regret, Shall he plod on, with death between him now And the far light that guides him, till he falls And has an empty thought of empty rest; Then Fate will put a mattock in his hands And lash him while he digs himself the grave That is to be the pallet and the shroud Of his poor blundering bones. The man who saw Too much must have an eye to see at last Where Fate has marked the clay; and he shall delve, Although his hand may slacken, and his knees May rock without a method as he toils; For there's a delving that is to be done— If not for God, for man. I see the light, But I shall fall before I come to it; For I am old. I was young yesterday. Time's hand that I have held away so long Grips hard now on my shoulder. Time has won. Tomorrow I shall say to Vivian COLLECTED POEMS That I am old and gaunt and garrulous, And tell her one more story: I am old." There were long hours for Merlin after that, And much long wandering in his prison-yard, Where now the progress of each heavy step Confirmed a stillness of impending change And imminent farewell. To Vivian's ear There came for many days no other story Than Merlin's iteration of his love And his departure from Broceliande, Where Merlin still remained. In Vivian's eye, There was a quiet kindness, and at times A smoky flash of incredulity That faded into pain. Was this the Merlin— This incarnation of idolatry And all but supplicating deference— This bowed and reverential contradiction Of all her dreams and her realities— Was this the Merlin who for years and years Before she found him had so made her love him That kings and princes, thrones and diadems, And honorable men who drowned themselves For love, were less to her than melon-shells? Was this the Merlin whom her fate had sent One spring day to come ringing at her gate, Bewildering her love with happy terror That later was to be all happiness? Was this the Merlin who had made the world Half over, and then left it with a laugh To be the youngest, oldest, weirdest, gayest, And wisest, and sometimes the foolishest Of all the men of her consideration? Was this the man who had made other men As ordinary as arithmetic? MERLIN Was this man Merlin who came now so slowly Towards the fountain where she stood again In shimmering green? Trembling, he took her hands And pressed them fondly, one upon the other, Between his: "I was wrong that other day, For I have one more story. I am old." He waited like one hungry for the word Not said; and she found in his eyes a light As patient as a candle in a window That looks upon the sea and is a mark For ships that have gone down. "Tomorrow," he said; "Tomorrow I shall go away again To Camelot; and I shall see the King Once more; and I may come to you again Once more; and I shall go away again For ever. There is now no more than that For me to do; and I shall do no more. I saw too much when I saw Camelot; And I saw farther backward into Time, And forward, than a man may see and live, When I made Arthur king. I saw too far, But not so far as this. Fate played with me As I have played with Time; and Time, like me, Being less than Fate, will have on me his vengeance. On Fate there is no vengeance, even for God." He drew her slowly into his embrace And held her there, but when he kissed her lips They were as cold as leaves and had no answer; For Time had given him then, to prove his words, A frozen moment of a woman's life. When Merlin the next morning came again In the same pilgrim robe that he had worn COLLECTED POEMS While he sat waiting where the cherry-blossoms Outside the gate fell on him and around him Grief came to Vivian at the sight of him; And like a flash of a swift ugly knife, A blinding fear came with it. "Are you going?" She said, more with her lips than with her voice; And he said, "I am going. Blaise and I Are going down together to the shore, And Blaise is coming back. For this one day Be good enough to spare him, for I like him. I tell you now, as once I told the King, That I can be no more than what I was, And I can say no more than I have said. Sometimes you told me that I spoke too long And sent me off to wander. That was good. I go now for another wandering, And I pray God that all be well with you." For long there was a whining in her ears Of distant wheels departing. When it ceased, She closed the gate again so quietly That Merlin could have heard no sound of it. VII By Merlin's Rock, where Dagonet the fool Was given through many a dying afternoon To sit and meditate on human ways And ways divine, Gawaine and Bedivere Stood silent, gazing down on Camelot. The two had risen and were going home: "It hits me sore, Gawaine," said Bedivere, "To think on all the tumult and affliction Down there, and all the noise and preparation MERLIN That hums of coming death, and, if my fears Be born of reason, of what's more than death. Wherefore, I say to you again, Gawaine,— To you—that this late hour is not too late For you to change yourself and change the King: For though the King may love me with a love More tried, and older, and more sure, may be, Than for another, for such a time as this The friend who turns him to the world again Shall have a tongue more gracious and an eye More shrewd than mine. For such a time as this The King must have a glamour to persuade him." "The King shall have a glamour, and anon," Gawaine said, and he shot death from his eyes; "If you were King, as Arthur is—or was— And Lancelot had carried off your Queen, And killed a score or so of your best knights— Not mentioning my two brothers, whom he slew Unarmored and unarmed—God save your wits! Two stewards with skewers could have done as much, And you and I might now be rotting for it." "But Lancelot's men were crowded,—they were crushed; And there was nothing for them but to strike Or die, not seeing where they struck. Think you They would have slain Gareth and Gaheris, And Tor, and all those other friends of theirs? God's mercy for the world he made, I say, And for the blood that writes the story of it. Gareth and Gaheris, Tor and Lamorak,— All dead, with all the others that are dead! These years have made me turn to Lamorak For counsel—and now Lamorak is dead." COLLECTED POEMS "Why do you fling those two names in my face? 'Twas Modred made an end of Lamorak, Not I; and Lancelot now has done for Tor. I'll urge no king on after Lancelot For such a two as Tor and Lamorak: Their father killed my father, and their friend Was Lancelot, not I. I'll own my fault— I'm living; and while I've a tongue can talk, I'll say this to the King: `Burn Lancelot By inches till he give you back the Queen; Then hang him—drown him—or do anything To rid the world of him.' He killed my brothers, And he was once my friend. Now damn the soul Of him who killed my brothers! There you have me." "You are a strong man, Gawaine, and your strength Goes ill where foes are. You may cleave their limbs And heads off, but you cannot damn their souls; What you may do now is to save their souls, And bodies too, and like enough your own. Remember that King Arthur is a king, And where there is a king there is a kingdom. Is not the kingdom any more to you Than one brief enemy? Would you see it fall And the King with it, for one mortal hate That burns out reason? Gawaine, you are king Today. Another day may see no king But Havoc, if you have no other word For Arthur now than hate for Lancelot. Is not the world as large as Lancelot? Is Lancelot, because one woman's eyes Are brighter when they look on him, to sluice The world with angry blood? Poor flesh! Poor flesh! And you, Gawaine,—are you so gaffed with hate You cannot leave it and so plunge away MERLIN To stiller places and there see, for once, What hangs on this pernicious expedition The King in his insane forgetfulness Would undertake—with you to drum him on? Are you as mad as he and Lancelot Made ravening into one man twice as mad As either? Is the kingdom of the world, Now rocking, to go down in sound and blood And ashes and sick ruin, and for the sake Of three men and a woman? If it be so, God's mercy for the world he made, I say,— And say again to Dagonet. Sir Fool, Your throne is empty, and you may as well Sit on it and be ruler of the world From now till supper-time." Sir Dagonet, Appearing, made reply to Bedivere's Dry welcome with a famished look of pain, On which he built a smile: "If I were King, You, Bedivere, should be my counsellor; And we should have no more wars over women. I'll sit me down and meditate on that." Gawaine, for all his anger, laughed a little, And clapped the fool's lean shoulder; for he loved him And was with Arthur when he made him knight. Then Dagonet said on to Bedivere, As if his tongue would make a jest of sorrow: "Sometime I'll tell you what I might have done Had I been Lancelot and you King Arthur— Each having in himself the vicious essence That now lives in the other and makes war. When all men are like you and me, my lord, When all are rational or rickety, There may be no more war. But what's here now? COLLECTED POEMS Lancelot loves the Queen, and he makes war Of love; the King, being bitten to the soul By love and hate that work in him together, Makes war of madness; Gawaine hates Lancelot, And he, to be in tune, makes war of hate; Modred hates everything, yet he can see With one damned illegitimate small eye His father's crown, and with another like it He sees the beauty of the Queen herself; He needs the two for his ambitious pleasure, And therefore he makes war of his ambition; And somewhere in the middle of all this There's a squeezed world that elbows for attention. Poor Merlin, buried in Broceliande! He must have had an academic eye For woman when he founded Arthur's kingdom, And in Broceliande he may be sorry. Flutes, hautboys, drums, and viols. God be with him! I'm glad they tell me there's another world, For this one's a disease without a doctor." "No, not so bad as that," said Bedivere; The doctor, like ourselves, may now be learning; And Merlin may have gauged his enterprise Whatever the cost he may have paid for knowing. We pass, but many are to follow us, And what they build may stay; though I believe Another age will have another Merlin, Another Camelot, and another King. Sir Dagonet, farewell." "Farewell, Sir Knight, And you, Sir Knight: Gawaine, you have the world Now in your fingers—an uncommon toy, Albeit a small persuasion in the balance MERLIN With one man's hate. I'm glad you're not a fool, For then you might be rickety, as I am, And rational as Bedivere. Farewell. I'll sit here and be king. God save the King!" But Gawaine scowled and frowned and answered nothing As he went slowly down with Bedivere To Camelot, where Arthur's army waited The King's word for the melancholy march To Joyous Gard, where Lancelot hid the Queen And armed his host, and there was now no joy, As there was now no joy for Dagonet While he sat brooding, with his wan cheek-bones Hooked with his bony fingers: "Go, Gawaine," He mumbled: "Go your way, and drag the world Along down with you. What's a world or so To you if you can hide an ell of iron Somewhere in Lancelot, and hear him wheeze And sputter once or twice before he goes Wherever the Queen sends him? There's a man Who should have been a king, and would have been, Had he been born so. So should I have been A king, had I been born so, fool or no: King Dagonet, or Dagonet the King; King-Fool, Fool-King; 'twere not impossible. I'll meditate on that and pray for Arthur, Who made me all I am, except a fool. Now he goes mad for love, as I might go Had I been born a king and not a fool. Today I think I'd rather be a fool; Today the world is less than one scared woman— Wherefore a field of waving men may soon Be shorn by Time's indifferent scythe, because The King is mad. The seeds of history Are small, but given a few gouts of warm blood COLLECTED POEMS For quickening, they sprout out wondrously And have a leaping growth whereof no man May shun such harvesting of change or death, Or life, as may fall on him to be borne When I am still alive and rickety, And Bedivere's alive and rational— If he come out of this, and there's a doubt,— The King, Gawaine, Modred, and Lancelot May all be lying underneath a weight Of bloody sheaves too heavy for their shoulders All spent, and all dishonored, and all dead; And if it come to be that this be so, And it be true that Merlin saw the truth, Such harvest were the best. Your fool sees not So far as Merlin sees: yet if he saw The truth—why then, such harvest were the best. I'll pray for Arthur; I can do no more." "Why not for Merlin? Or do you count him, In this extreme, so foreign to salvation That prayer would be a stranger to his name?" Poor Dagonet, with terror shaking him, Stood up and saw before him an old face Made older with an inch of silver beard, And faded eyes more eloquent of pain And ruin than all the faded eyes of age Till now had ever been, although in them There was a mystic and intrinsic peace Of one who sees where men of nearer sight See nothing. On their way to Camelot, Gawaine and Bedivere had passed him by, With lax attention for the pilgrim cloak They passed, and what it hid: yet Merlin saw MERLIN Their faces, and he saw the tale was true That he had lately drawn from solemn strangers. "Well, Dagonet, and by your leave," he said, "I'll rest my lonely relics for a while On this rock that was mine and now is yours. I favor the succession; for you know Far more than many doctors, though your doubt Is your peculiar poison. I foresaw Long since, and I have latterly been told What moves in this commotion down below To show men what it means. It means the end— If men whose tongues had less to say to me Than had their shoulders are adept enough To know; and you may pray for me or not, Sir Friend, Sir Dagonet." "Sir fool, you mean," Dagonet said, and gazed on Merlin sadly: "I'll never pray again for anything, And last of all for this that you behold— The smouldering faggot of unlovely bones That God has given to me to call Myself. When Merlin comes to Dagonet for prayer, It is indeed the end." "And in the end Are more beginnings, Dagonet, than men Shall name or know today. It was the end Of Arthur's insubstantial majesty When to him and his knights the Grail foreshowed The quest of life that was to be the death Of many, and the slow discouraging Of many more. Or do I err in this?" COLLECTED POEMS "No," Dagonet replied; "there was a Light; And Galahad, in the Siege Perilous, Alone of all on whom it fell, was calm; There was a Light wherein men saw themselves In one another as they might become— Or so they dreamed. There was a long to-do, And Gawaine, of all forlorn ineligibles, Rose up the first, and cried more lustily Than any after him that he should find The Grail, or die for it,—though he did neither; For he came back as living and as fit For new and old iniquity as ever. Then Lancelot came back, and Bors came back,— Like men who had seen more than men should see, And still come back. They told of Percival Who saw too much to make of this worn life A long necessity, and of Galahad, Who died and is alive. They all saw Something. God knows the meaning or the end of it, But they saw Something. And if I've an eye, Small joy has the Queen been to Lancelot Since he came back from seeing what he saw; For though his passion hold him like hot claws, He's neither in the world nor out of it. Gawaine is king, though Arthur wears the crown; And Gawaine's hate for Lancelot is the sword That hangs by one of Merlin's fragile hairs Above the world. Were you to see the King, The frenzy that has overthrown his wisdom, Instead of him and his upheaving empire, Might have an end." "I came to see the King," Said Merlin, like a man who labors hard And long with an importunate confession. MERLIN "No, Dagonet, you cannot tell me why, Although your tongue is eager with wild hope To tell me more than I may tell myself About myself. All this that was to be Might show to man how vain it were to wreck The world for self if it were all in vain. When I began with Arthur I could see In each bewildered man who dots the earth A moment with his days a groping thought Of an eternal will, strangely endowed With merciful illusions whereby self Becomes the will itself and each man swells In fond accordance with his agency. Now Arthur, Modred, Lancelot, and Gawaine Are swollen thoughts of this eternal will Which have no other way to find the way That leads them on to their inheritance Than by the time-infuriating flame Of a wrecked empire, lighted by the torch Of woman, who, together with the light That Galahad found, is yet to light the world." A wan smile crept across the weary face Of Dagonet the fool: "If you knew that Before your burial in Broceliande, No wonder your eternal will accords With all your dreams of what the world requires. My master, I may say this unto you Because I am a fool, and fear no man; My fear is that I've been a groping thought That never swelled enough. You say the torch Of woman and the light that Galahad found Are some day to illuminate the world? I'll meditate on that. The world is done For me; and I have been to make men laugh, COLLECTED POEMS A lean thing of no shape and many capers. I made them laugh, and I could laugh anor Myself to see them killing one another Because a woman with corn-colored hair Has pranked a man with horns. 'Twas but a flash Of chance, and Lancelot, the other day That saved this pleasing sinner from the fire That she may spread for thousands. Were she now The cinder the King willed, or were you now To see the King, the fire might yet go out; But the eternal will says otherwise. So be it; I'll assemble certain gold That I may say is mine and get myself Away from this accurst unhappy court, And in some quiet place where shepherd clowns And cowherds may have more respondent ears Than kings and kingdom-builders, I shall troll Old men to easy graves and be a child Again among the children of the earth. I'll have no more kings, even though I loved King Arthur, who is mad, as I could love No other man save Merlin, who is dead." "Not wholly dead, but old. Merlin is old." The wizard shivered as he spoke, and stared Away into the sunset where he saw Once more, as through a cracked and cloudy glass, A crumbling sky that held a crimson cloud Wherein there was a town of many towers All swayed and shaken, in a woman's hand This time, till out of it there spilled and flashed And tumbled, like loose jewels, town, towers, and walls, And there was nothing but a crumbling sky That made anon of black and red and ruin A wild and final rain on Camelot. MERLIN He bowed, and pressed his eyes: "Now by my soul, I have seen this before—all black and red— Like that—like that—like Vivian—black and red; Like Vivian, when her eyes looked into mine Across the cups of gold. A flute was playing— Then all was black and red." Another smile Crept over the wan face of Dagonet, Who shivered in his turn. "The torch of woman," He muttered, "and the light that Galahad found, Will some day save us all, as they saved Merlin. Forgive my shivering wits, but I am cold, And it will soon be dark. Will you go down With me to see the King, or will you not? If not, I go tomorrow to the shepherds. The world is mad, and I'm a groping thought Of your eternal will; the world and I Are strangers, and I'll have no more of it— Except you go with me to see the King." "No, Dagonet, you cannot leave me now," Said Merlin, sadly. "You and I are old; And, as you say, we fear no man. God knows I would not have the love that once you had For me be fear of me, for I am past All fearing now. But Fate may send a fly Sometimes, and he may sting us to the grave, So driven to test our faith in what we see. Are you, now I am coming to an end, As Arthur's days are coming to an end, To sting me like a fly? I do not ask Of you to say that you see what I see, Where you see nothing; nor do I require Of any man more vision than is his; COLLECTED POEMS Yet I could wish for you a larger part For your last entrance here than this you play Tonight of a sad insect stinging Merlin. The more you sting, the more he pities you; And you were never overfond of pity. Had you been so, I doubt if Arthur's love, Or Gawaine's, would have made of you a knight. No, Dagonet, you cannot leave me now, Nor would you if you could. You call yourself A fool, because the world and you are strangers. You are a proud man, Dagonet; you have suffered What I alone have seen. You are no fool; And surely you are not a fly to sting My love to last regret. Believe or not What I have seen, or what I say to you, But say no more to me that I am dead Because the King is mad, and you are old, And I am older. In Broceliande Time overtook me as I knew he must; And I, with a fond overplus of words, Had warned the lady Vivian already, Before these wrinkles and this hesitancy Inhibiting my joints oppressed her sight With age and dissolution. She said once That she was cold and cruel; but she meant That she was warm and kind, and over-wise For woman in a world where men see not Beyond themselves. She saw beyond them all, As I did; and she waited, as I did, The coming of a day when cherry-blossoms Were to fall down all over me like snow In springtime. I was far from Camelot That afternoon; and I am farther now From her. I see no more for me to do Than to leave her and Arthur and the world MERLIN Behind me, and to pray that all be well With Vivian, whose unquiet heart is hungry For what is not, and what shall never be Without her, in a world that men are making, Knowing not how, nor caring yet to know How slowly and how grievously they do it,— Though Vivian, in her golden shell of exile, Knows now and cares, not knowing that she cares, Nor caring that she knows. In time to be, The like of her shall have another name Than Vivian, and her laugh shall be a fire, Not shining only to consume itself With what it burns. She knows not yet the name Of what she is, for now there is no name; Some day there shall be. Time has many names, Unwritten yet, for what we say is old Because we are so young that it seems old. And this is all a part of what I saw Before you saw King Arthur. When we parted. I told her I should see the King again, And, having seen him, might go back again To see her face once more. But I shall see No more the lady Vivian. Let her love What man she may, no other love than mine Shall be an index of her memories. I fear no man who may come after me, And I see none. I see her, still in green, Beside the fountain. I shall not go back. We pay for going back; and all we get Is one more needless ounce of weary wisdom To bring away with us. If I come not, The lady Vivian will remember me, And say: `I knew him when his heart was young, Though I have lost him now. Time called him home, COLLECTED POEMS And that was as it was; for much is lost Between Broceliande and Camelot.' " He stared away into the west again, Where now no crimson cloud or phantom town Deceived his eyes. Above a living town There were gray clouds and ultimate suspense, And a cold wind was coming. Dagonet, Now crouched at Merlin's feet in his dejection, Saw multiplying lights far down below, Where lay the fevered streets. At length he felt On his lean shoulder Merlin's tragic hand And trembled, knowing that a few more days Would see the last of Arthur and the first Of Modred, whose dark patience had attained To one precarious half of what he sought: "And even the Queen herself may fall to him," Dagonet murmured.—"The Queen fall to Modred? Is that your only fear tonight?" said Merlin; "She may, but not for long."—"No, not my fear; For I fear nothing. But I wish no fate Like that for any woman the King loves, Although she be the scourge and the end of him That you saw coming, as I see it now." Dagonet shook, but he would have no tears, He swore, for any king, queen, knave, or wizard— Albeit he was a stranger among those Who laughed at him because he was a fool. "You said the truth, I cannot leave you now," He stammered, and was angry for the tears That mocked his will and choked him. Merlin smiled, Faintly, and for the moment: "Dagonet, I need your word as one of Arthur's knights MERLIN That you will go on with me to the end Of my short way, and say unto no man Or woman that you found or saw me here. No good would follow, for a doubt would live Unstifled of my loyalty to him Whose deeds are wrought for those who are to come; And many who see not what I have seen, Or what you see tonight, would prattle on For ever, and their children after them, Of what might once have been had I gone down With you to Camelot to see the King. I came to see the King,—but why see kings? All this that was to be is what I saw Before there was an Arthur to be king, And so to be a mirror wherein men May see themselves; and pause. If they see not, Or if they do see and they ponder not,— I saw; but I was neither Fate nor God. I saw too much; and this would be the end, Were there to be an end. I saw myself— A sight no other man has ever seen; And through the dark that lay beyond myself I saw two fires that are to light the world." On Dagonet the silent hand of Merlin Weighed now as living iron that held him down With a primeval power. Doubt, wonderment, Impatience, and a self-accusing sorrow Born of an ancient love, possessed and held him Until his love was more than he could name, And he was Merlin's fool, not Arthur's now: "Say what you will, I say that I'm the fool Of Merlin, King of Nowhere; which is Here. With you for king and me for court, what else Have we to sigh for but a place to sleep? COLLECTED POEMS I know a tavern that will take us in; And on the morrow I shall follow you Until I die for you. And when I die . . ."— "Well, Dagonet, the King is listening."— And Dagonet answered, hearing in the words Of Merlin a grave humor and a sound Of graver pity, "I shall die a fool." He heard what might have been a father's laugh, Faintly behind him; and the living weight Of Merlin's hand was lifted. They arose, And, saying nothing, found a groping way Down through the gloom together. Fiercer now, The wind was like a flying animal That beat the two of them incessantly With icy wings, and bit them as they went. The rock above them was an empty place Where neither seer nor fool should view again The stricken city. Colder blew the wind Across the world, and on it heavier lay The shadow and the burden of the night; And there was darkness over Camelot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TOWN DOWN THE RIVER (1910) To Theodore Roosevelt THE MASTER* * Supposed to have been written not long after the Civil War. (Lincoln) A flying word from here and there Had sown the name at which we sneered, But soon the name was everywhere, To be reviled and then revered: A presence to be loved and feared, We cannot hide it, or deny That we, the gentlemen who jeered, May be forgotten by and by. He came when days were perilous And hearts of men were sore beguiled; And having made his note of us, He pondered and was reconciled. Was ever master yet so mild As he, and so untamable? We doubted, even when he smiled, Not knowing what he knew so well. He knew that undeceiving fate Would shame us whom he served unsought; He knew that he must wince and wait— The jest of those for whom he fought; COLLECTED POEMS He knew devoutly what he thought Of us and of our ridicule; He knew that we must all be taught Like little children in a school. We gave a glamour to the task That he encountered and saw through, But little of us did he ask, And little did we ever do. And what appears if we review The season when we railed and chaffed? It is the face of one who knew That we were learning while we laughed. The face that in our vision feels Again the venom that we flung, Transfigured to the world reveals The vigilance to which we clung. Shrewd, hallowed, harassed, and among The mysteries that are untold, The face we see was never young Nor could it wholly have been old. For he, to whom we had applied Our shopman's test of age and worth, Was elemental when he died, As he was ancient at his birth: The saddest among kings of earth, Bowed with a galling crown, this man Met rancor with a cryptic mirth, Laconic—and Olympian. The love, the grandeur, and the fame Are bounded by the world alone; THE TOWN DOWN THE RIVER The calm, the smouldering, and the flame Of awful patience were his own: With him they are forever flown Past all our fond self-shadowings, Wherewith we cumber the Unknown As with inept, Icarian wings. For we were not as other men: 'Twas ours to soar and his to see; But we are coming down again, And we shall come down pleasantly; Nor shall we longer disagree On what it is to be sublime, But flourish in our perigee And have one Titan at a time. THE TOWN DOWN THE RIVER I Said the Watcher by the Way To the young and the unladen, To the boy and to the maiden, "God be with you both to-day. First your song came ringing, Now you come, you two,— Knowing naught of what you do, Or of what your dreams are bringing. "O you children who go singing To the Town down the River, Where the millions cringe and shiver, Tell me what you know to-day; Tell me how far you are going, COLLECTED POEMS Tell me how you find your way. O you children who go dreaming, Tell me what you dream to-day." "He is old and we have heard him," Said the boy then to the maiden; "He is old and heavy laden With a load we throw away. Care may come to find us, Age may lay us low; Still, we seek the light we know, And the dead we leave behind us. "Did he think that he would blind us Into such a small believing As to live without achieving, When the lights have led so far? Let him watch or let him wither,— Shall he tell us where we are? We know best who go together, Downward, onward, and so far." II Said the Watcher by the Way To the fiery folk that hastened, To the loud and the unchastened, "You are strong, I see, to-day. Strength and hope may lead you To the journey's end,— Each to be the other's friend If the Town should fail to need you. "And are ravens there to feed you In the Town down the River, THE TOWN DOWN THE RIVER Where the gift appalls the giver And youth hardens day by day? O you brave and you unshaken, Are you truly on your way? And are sirens in the River, That you come so far to-day?" "You are old, and we have listened," Said the voice of one who halted; "You are sage and self-exalted, But your way is not our way. You that cannot aid us Give us words to eat. Be assured that they are sweet, And that we are as God made us. "Not in vain have you delayed us, Though the River still be calling Through the twilight that is falling And the Town be still so far. By the whirlwind of your wisdom Leagues are lifted as leaves are; But a king without a kingdom Fails us, who have come so far." III Said the Watcher by the Way To the slower folk who stumbled, To the weak and the world-humbled, "Tell me how you fare to-day. Some with ardor shaken, All with honor scarred, Do you falter, finding hard The far chance that you have taken? COLLECTED POEMS "Or, do you at length awaken To an antic retribution, Goading to a new confusion The drugged hopes of yesterday? O you poor mad men that hobble, Will you not return, or stay? Do you trust, you broken people, To a dawn without the day?" "You speak well of what you know not," Muttered one; and then a second: "You have begged and you have beckoned, But you see us on our way. Who are you to scold us, Knowing what we know? Jeremiah, long ago, Said as much as you have told us. "As we are, then, you behold us: Derelicts of all conditions, Poets, rogues, and sick physicians, Plodding forward from afar; Forward now into the darkness Where the men before us are; Forward, onward, out of grayness, To the light that shone so far." IV Said the Watcher by the Way To some aged ones who lingered, To the shrunken, the claw-fingered, "So you come for me to-day."— "Yes, to give you warning; You are old," one said; AN ISLAND "You have old hairs on your head, Fit for laurel, not for scorning. "From the first of early morning We have toiled along to find you; We, as others, have maligned you, But we need your scorn to-day. By the light that we saw shining, Let us not be lured alway; Let us hear no River calling When to-morrow is to-day." "But your lanterns are unlighted And the Town is far before you: Let us hasten, I implore you," Said the Watcher by the Way. "Long have I waited, Longer have I known That the Town would have its own, And the call be for the fated. "In the name of all created, Let us hear no more, my brothers; Are we older than all others? Are the planets in our way?"— "Hark," said one; "I hear the River, Calling always, night and day."— "Forward, then! The lights are shining," Said the Watcher by the Way. AN ISLAND (Saint Helena, 1821) Take it away, and swallow it yourself. Ha! Look you, there's a rat. COLLECTED POEMS Last night there were a dozen on that shelf, And two of them were living in my hat. Look! Now he goes, but he'll come back— Ha? But he will, I say . . Il reviendra-z-à Pâques, Ou à la Trinité . . . Be very sure that he'll return again; For said the Lord: Imprimis, we have rats, And having rats, we have rain.— So on the seventh day He rested, and made Pain. —Man, if you love the Lord, and if the Lord Love liars, I will have you at your word And swallow it. Voilà. Bah! Where do I say it is That I have lain so long? Where do I count myself among the dead, As once above the living and the strong? And what is this that comes and goes, Fades and swells and overflows, Like music underneath and overhead? What is it in me now that rings and roars Like fever-laden wine? What ruinous tavern-shine Is this that lights me far from worlds and wars And women that were mine? Where do I say it is That Time has made my bed? What lowering outland hostelry is this For one the stars have disinherited? An island, I have said: A peak, where fiery dreams and far desires Are rained on, like old fires: AN ISLAND A vermin region by the stars abhorred, Where falls the flaming word By which I consecrate with unsuccess An acreage of God's forgetfulness, Left here above the foam and long ago Made right for my duress; Where soon the sea, My foaming and long-clamoring enemy, Will have within the cryptic, old embrace Of her triumphant arms—a memory. Why then, the place? What forage of the sky or of the shore Will make it any more, To me, than my award of what was left Of number, time, and space? And what is on me now that I should heed The durance or the silence or the scorn? I was the gardener who had the seed Which holds within its heart the food and fire That gives to man a glimpse of his desire; And I have tilled, indeed, Much land, where men may say that I have planted Unsparingly my corn— For a world harvest-haunted And for a world unborn. Meanwhile, am I to view, as at a play, Through smoke the funeral flames of yesterday, And think them far away? Am I to doubt and yet be given to know That where my demon guides me, there I go?— An island? Be it so. For islands, after all is said and done, Tell but a wilder game that was begun, COLLECTED POEMS When Fate, the mistress of iniquities, The mad Queen-spinner of all discrepancies, Beguiled the dyers of the dawn that day, And even in such a curst and sodden way Made my three colors one. —So be it, and the way be as of old: So be the weary truth again retold Of great kings overthrown Because they would be kings, and lastly kings alone. Fling to each dog his bone. Flags that are vanished, flags that are soiled and furled, Say what will be the word when I am gone: What learned little acrid archive men Will burrow to find me out and burrow again,— But all for naught, unless To find there was another Island. . . . Yes, There are too many islands in this world, There are too many rats, and there is too much rain. So three things are made plain Between the sea and sky: Three separate parts of one thing, which is Pain . . . Bah, what a way to die!— To leave my Queen still spinning there on high, Still wondering, I dare say, To see me in this way . . . Madame à sa tour monte Si haut qu'elle peut monter— Like one of our Commissioners . . . ai! ai! Prometheus and the women have to cry, But no, not I . . . Faugh, what a way to die! But who are these that come and go Before me, shaking laurel as they pass? AN ISLAND Laurel, to make me know For certain what they mean: That now my Fate, my Queen, Having found that she, by way of right reward, Will after madness go remembering, And laurel be as grass,— Remembers the one thing That she has left to bring. The floor about me now is like a sward Grown royally. Now it is like a sea That heaves with laurel heavily, Surrendering an outworn enmity For what has come to be. But not for you, returning with your curled And haggish lips. And why are you alone? Why do you stay when all the rest are gone? Why do you bring those treacherous eyes that reek With venom and hate the while you seek To make me understand?— Laurel from every land, Laurel, but not the world? Fury, or perjured Fate, or whatsoever, Tell me the bloodshot word that is your name And I will pledge remembrance of the same That shall be crossed out never; Whereby posterity May know, being told, that you have come to me, You and your tongueless train without a sound, With covetous hands and eyes and laurel all around, Foreshowing your endeavor To mirror me the demon of my days, To make me doubt him, loathe him, face to face. Bowed with unwilling glory from the quest COLLECTED POEMS That was ordained and manifest, You shake it off and wish me joy of it? Laurel from every place, Laurel, but not the rest? Such are the words in you that I divine, Such are the words of men. So be it, and what then? Poor, tottering counterfeit, Are you a thing to tell me what is mine? Grant we the demon sees An inch beyond the line, What comes of mine and thine? A thousand here and there may shriek and freeze, Or they may starve in fine. The Old Physician has a crimson cure For such as these, And ages after ages will endure The minims of it that are victories. The wreath may go from brow to brow, The state may flourish, flame, and cease; But through the fury and the flood somehow The demons are acquainted and at ease, And somewhat hard to please. Mine, I believe, is laughing at me now In his primordial way, Quite as he laughed of old at Hannibal, Or rather at Alexander, let us say. Therefore, be what you may, Time has no further need Of you, or of your breed. My demon, irretrievably astray, Has ruined the last chorus of a play That will, so he avers, be played again some day; And you, poor glowering ghost, AN ISLAND Have staggered under laurel here to boast Above me, dying, while you lean In triumph awkward and unclean, About some words of his that you have read? Thing, do I not know them all? He tells me how the storied leaves that fall Are tramped on, being dead? They are sometimes: with a storm foul enough They are seized alive and they are blown far off To mould on islands.—What else have you read? He tells me that great kings look very small When they are put to bed; And this being said, He tells me that the battles I have won Are not my own, But his—howbeit fame will yet atone For all defect, and sheave the mystery: The follies and the slaughters I have done Are mine alone, And so far History. So be the tale again retold And leaf by clinging leaf unrolled Where I have written in the dawn, With ink that fades anon, Like Cæsar's, and the way be as of old. Ho, is it you? I thought you were a ghost. Is it time for you to poison me again? Well, here's our friend the rain,— Mironton, mironton, mirontaine . . . Man, I could murder you almost, You with your pills and toast. Take it away and eat it, and shoot rats. Ha! there he comes. Your rat will never fail, My punctual assassin, to prevail— COLLECTED POEMS While he has power to crawl, Or teeth to gnaw withal— Where kings are caged. Why has a king no cats? You say that I'll achieve it if I try? Swallow it?—No, not I . . . God, what a way to die! CALVERLY'S We go no more to Calverly's, For there the lights are few and low; And who are there to see by them, Or what they see, we do not know. Poor strangers of another tongue May now creep in from anywhere, And we, forgotten, be no more Than twilight on a ruin there. We two, the remnant. All the rest Are cold and quiet. You nor I, Nor fiddle now, nor flagon-lid, May ring them back from where they lie. No fame delays oblivion For them, but something yet survives: A record written fair, could we But read the book of scattered lives. There'll be a page for Leffingwell, And one for Lingard, the Moon-calf; And who knows what for Clavering, Who died because he couldn't laugh? Who knows or cares? No sign is here, No face, no voice, no memory; LEFFINGWELL No Lingard with his eerie joy, No Clavering, no Calverly. We cannot have them here with us To say where their light lives are gone, Or if they be of other stuff Than are the moons of Ilion. So, be their place of one estate With ashes, echoes, and old wars,— Or ever we be of the night, Or we be lost among the stars. LEFFINGWELL I—The Lure No, no,—forget your Cricket and your Ant, For I shall never set my name to theirs That now bespeak the very sons and heirs Incarnate of Queen Gossip and King Cant. The case of Leffingwell is mixed, I grant, And futile seems the burden that he bears; But are we sounding his forlorn affairs Who brand him parasite and sycophant? I tell you, Leffingwell was more than these; And if he prove a rather sorry knight, What quiverings in the distance of what light May not have lured him with high promises, And then gone down?—He may have been deceived; He may have lied,—he did; and he believed. II—The Quickstep The dirge is over, the good work is done, All as he would have had it, and we go; COLLECTED POEMS And we who leave him say we do not know How much is ended or how much begun. So men have said before of many a one; So men may say of us when Time shall throw Such earth as may be needful to bestow On you and me the covering hush we shun. Well hated, better loved, he played and lost, And left us; and we smile at his arrears; And who are we to know what it all cost, Or what we may have wrung from him, the buyer? The pageant of his failure-laden years Told ruin of high price. The place was higher. III—Requiescat We never knew the sorrow or the pain Within him, for he seemed as one asleep— Until he faced us with a dying leap, And with a blast of paramount, profane, And vehement valediction did explain To each of us, in words that we shall keep, Why we were not to wonder or to weep, Or ever dare to wish him back again. He may be now an amiable shade, With merry fellow-phantoms unafraid Around him—but we do not ask. We know That he would rise and haunt us horribly, And be with us o' nights of a certainty. Did we not hear him when he told us so? CLAVERING CLAVERING I say no more for Clavering Than I should say of him who fails To bring his wounded vessel home When reft of rudder and of sails; I say no more than I should say Of any other one who sees Too far for guidance of to-day, Too near for the eternities. I think of him as I should think Of one who for scant wages played, And faintly, a flawed instrument That fell while it was being made; I think of him as one who fared, Unfaltering and undeceived, Amid mirages of renown And urgings of the unachieved; I think of him as one who gave To Lingard leave to be amused, And listened with a patient grace That we, the wise ones, had refused; I think of metres that he wrote For Cubit, the ophidian guest: "What Lilith, or Dark Lady" . . . Well, Time swallows Cubit with the rest. I think of last words that he said One midnight over Calverly: "Good-by—good man." He was not good; So Clavering was wrong, you see. COLLECTED POEMS I wonder what had come to pass Could he have borrowed for a spell The fiery-frantic indolence That made a ghost of Leffingwell; I wonder if he pitied us Who cautioned him till he was gray To build his house with ours on earth And have an end of yesterday; I wonder what it was we saw To make us think that we were strong; I wonder if he saw too much, Or if he looked one way too long. But when were thoughts or wonderings To ferret out the man within? Why prate of what he seemed to be, And all that he might not have been? He clung to phantoms and to friends, And never came to anything. He left a wreath on Cubit's grave. I say no more for Clavering. LINGARD AND THE STARS The table hurled itself, to our surprise, At Lingard, and anon rapped eagerly: "When earth is cold and there is no more sea, There will be what was Lingard. Otherwise, Why lure the race to ruin through the skies? And why have Leffingwell, or Calverly?"— PASA THALASSA THALASSA "I wish the ghost would give his name," said he; And searching gratitude was in his eyes. He stood then by the window for a time, And only after the last midnight chime Smote the day dead did he say anything: "Come out, my little one, the stars are bright; Come out, you lælaps, and inhale the night." And so he went away with Clavering. PASA THALASSA THALASSA "The sea is everywhere the sea." I Gone—faded out of the story, the sea-faring friend I remember? Gone for a decade, they say: never a word or a sign. Gone with his hard red face that only his laughter could wrinkle, Down where men go to be still, by the old way of the sea. Never again will he come, with rings in his ears like a pirate, Back to be living and seen, here with his roses and vines; Here where the tenants are shadows and echoes of years uneventful, Memory meets the event, told from afar by the sea. Smoke that floated and rolled in the twilight away from the chimney Floats and rolls no more. Wheeling and falling, instead, Down with a twittering flash go the smooth and inscrutable swallows, Down to the place made theirs by the cold work of the sea. Roses have had their day, and the dusk is on yarrow and worm-wood— Dusk that is over the grass, drenched with memorial dew; COLLECTED POEMS Trellises lie like bones in a ruin that once was a garden, Swallows have lingered and ceased, shadows and echoes are all. II Where is he lying to-night, as I turn away down to the valley, Down where the lamps of men tell me the streets are alive? Where shall I ask, and of whom, in the town or on land or on water, News of a time and a place buried alike and with him? Few now remain who may care, nor may they be wiser for caring, Where or what manner the doom, whether by day or by night; Whether in Indian deeps or on flood-laden fields of Atlantis, Or by the roaring Horn, shrouded in silence he lies. Few now remain who return by the weed-weary path to his cottage, Drawn by the scene as it was—met by the chill and the change; Few are alive who report, and few are alive who remember, More of him now than a name carved somewhere on the sea. "Where is he lying?" I ask, and the lights in the valley are nearer; Down to the streets I go, down to the murmur of men. Down to the roar of the sea in a ship may be well for another— Down where he lies to-night, silent, and under the storms. MOMUS "Where's the need of singing now?"— Smooth your brow, Momus, and be reconciled, For King Kronos is a child— UNCLE ANANIAS Child and father, Or god rather, And all gods are wild. "Who reads Byron any more?"— Shut the door, Momus, for I feel a draught; Shut it quick, for some one laughed.— "What's become of Browning? Some of Wordsworth lumbers like a raft? "What are poets to find here?"— Have no fear: When the stars are shining blue There will yet be left a few Themes availing— And these failing, Momus, there'll be you. UNCLE ANANIAS His words were magic and his heart was true, And everywhere he wandered he was blessed. Out of all ancient men my childhood knew I choose him and I mark him for the best. Of all authoritative liars, too, I crown him loveliest. How fondly I remember the delight That always glorified him in the spring; The joyous courage and the benedight Profusion of his faith in everything! COLLECTED POEMS He was a good old man, and it was right That he should have his fling. And often, underneath the apple-trees, When we surprised him in the summer time, With what superb magnificence and ease He sinned enough to make the day sublime! And if he liked us there about his knees, Truly it was no crime. All summer long we loved him for the same Perennial inspiration of his lies; And when the russet wealth of autumn came, There flew but fairer visions to our eyes— Multiple, tropical, winged with a feathery flame, Like birds of paradise. So to the sheltered end of many a year He charmed the seasons out with pageantry Wearing upon his forehead, with no fear, The laurel of approved iniquity. And every child who knew him, far or near, Did love him faithfully. THE WHIP The doubt you fought so long The cynic net you cast, The tyranny, the wrong, The ruin, they are past; And here you are at last, Your blood no longer vexed. The coffin has you fast, The clod will have you next. THE WHIP But fear you not the clod, Nor ever doubt the grave: The roses and the sod Will not forswear the wave. The gift the river gave Is now but theirs to cover: The mistress and the slave Are gone now, and the lover. You left the two to find Their own way to the brink Then—shall I call you blind?— You chose to plunge and sink. God knows the gall we drink Is not the mead we cry for, Nor was it, I should think— For you—a thing to die for. Could we have done the same, Had we been in your place?— This funeral of your name Throws no light on the case. Could we have made the chase, And felt then as you felt?— But what's this on your face, Blue, curious, like a welt? There were some ropes of sand Recorded long ago, But none, I understand, Of water. Is it so? And she—she struck the blow, You but a neck behind. . . You saw the river flow— Still, shall I call you blind? COLLECTED POEMS THE WHITE LIGHTS (Broadway, 1906) When in from Delos came the gold That held the dream of Pericles, When first Athenian ears were told The tumult of Euripides, When men met Aristophanes, Who fledged them with immortal quills— Here, where the time knew none of these, There were some islands and some hills. When Rome went ravening to see The sons of mothers end their days, When Flaccus bade Leuconoö To banish her Chaldean ways, When first the pearled, alembic phrase Of Maro into music ran— Here there was neither blame nor praise For Rome, or for the Mantuan. When Avon, like a faery floor, Lay freighted, for the eyes of One, With galleons laden long before By moonlit wharves in Avalon— Here, where the white lights have begun To seethe a way for something fair, No prophet knew, from what was done, That there was triumph in the air. EXIT For what we owe to other days, Before we poisoned him with praise, THE WISE BROTHERS May we who shrank to find him weak Remember that he cannot speak. For envy that we may recall, And for our faith before the fall, May we who are alive be slow To tell what we shall never know. For penance he would not confess, And for the fateful emptiness Of early triumph undermined, May we now venture to be kind. LEONORA They have made for Leonora this low dwelling in the ground, And with cedar they have woven the four walls round. Like a little dryad hiding she'll be wrapped all in green, Better kept and longer valued than by ways that would have been. They will come with many roses in the early afternoon, They will come with pinks and lilies and with Leonora soon; And as long as beauty's garments over beauty's limbs are thrown, There'll be lilies that are liars, and the rose will have its own. There will be a wondrous quiet in the house that they have made, And to-night will be a darkness in the place where she'll be laid; But the builders, looking forward into time, could only see Darker nights for Leonora than to-night shall ever be. THE WISE BROTHERS First Voice So long adrift, so fast aground, What foam and ruin have we found— COLLECTED POEMS We, the Wise Brothers? Could heaven and earth be framed amiss, That we should land in fine like this— We, and no others? Second Voice Convoyed by what accursèd thing Made we this evil reckoning— We, the Wise Brothers? And if the failure be complete, Why look we forward from defeat— We, and what others? Third Voice Blown far from harbors once in sight, May we not, going far, go right,— We, the Wise Brothers? Companioned by the whirling spheres, Have we no more than what appears— We, and all others? BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD "There, but for the grace of God, goes . . ." There is a question that I ask, And ask again: What hunger was half-hidden by the mask That he wore then? There was a word for me to say That I said not; And in the past there was another day That I forgot: BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD A dreary, cold, unwholesome day, Racked overhead,— As if the world were turning the wrong way, And the sun dead: A day that comes back well enough Now he is gone. What then? Has memory no other stuff To seize upon? Wherever he may wander now In his despair, Would he be more contented in the slough If all were there? And yet he brought a kind of light Into the room; And when he left, a tinge of something bright Survived the gloom. Why will he not be where he is, And not with me? The hours that are my life are mine, not his,— Or used to be. What numerous imps invisible Has he at hand, Far-flying and forlorn as what they tell At his command? What hold of weirdness or of worth Can he possess, That he may speak from anywhere on earth His loneliness? COLLECTED POEMS Shall I be caught and held again In the old net?— He brought a sorry sunbeam with him then, But it beams yet. FOR ARVIA On Her Fifth Birthday You Eyes, you large and all-inquiring Eyes, That look so dubiously into me, And are not satisfied with what you see, Tell me the worst and let us have no lies: Tell me the meaning of your scrutinies. And of myself. Am I a Mystery? Am I a Boojum—or just Company? What do you say? What do you think, You Eyes You say not; but you think, beyond a doubt; And you have the whole world to think about, With very little time for little things. So let it be; and let it all be fair— For you, and for the rest who cannot share Your gold of unrevealed awakenings. THE SUNKEN CROWN Nothing will hold him longer—let him go; Let him go down where others have gone down; Little he cares whether we smile or frown, Or if we know, or if we think we know. SHADRACH O'LEARY The call is on him for his overthrow, Say we; so let him rise, or let him drown. Poor fool! He plunges for the sunken crown, And we—we wait for what the plunge may show. Well, we are safe enough. Why linger, then? The watery chance was his, not ours. Poor fool! Poor truant, poor Narcissus out of school; Poor jest of Ascalon; poor king of men.— The crown, if he be wearing it, may cool His arrogance, and he may sleep again. DOCTOR OF BILLIARDS Of all among the fallen from on high, We count you last and leave you to regain Your born dominion of a life made vain By three spheres of insidious ivory. You dwindle to the lesser tragedy— Content, you say. We call, but you remain. Nothing alive gone wrong could be so plain, Or quite so blasted with absurdity. You click away the kingdom that is yours, And you click off your crown for cap and bells; You smile, who are still master of the feast, And for your smile we credit you the least; But when your false, unhallowed laugh occurs, We seem to think there may be something else. SHADRACH O'LEARY O'Leary was a poet—for a while: He sang of many ladies frail and fair, COLLECTED POEMS The rolling glory of their golden hair, And emperors extinguished with a smile. They foiled his years with many an ancient wile, And if they limped, O'Leary didn't care: He turned them loose and had them everywhere, Undoing saints and senates with their guile. But this was not the end. A year ago I met him—and to meet was to admire: Forgotten were the ladies and the lyre, And the small, ink-fed Eros of his dream. By questioning I found a man to know— A failure spared, a Shadrach of the Gleam. HOW ANNANDALE WENT OUT "They called it Annandale—and I was there To flourish, to find words, and to attend: Liar, physician, hypocrite, and friend, I watched him; and the sight was not so fair As one or two that I have seen elsewhere: An apparatus not for me to mend— A wreck, with hell between him and the end, Remained of Annandale; and I was there. "I knew the ruin as I knew the man; So put the two together, if you can, Remembering the worst you know of me. Now view yourself as I was, on the spot— With a slight kind of engine. Do you see? Like this . . . You wouldn't hang me? I thought not." ALMA MATER He knocked, and I beheld him at the door— A vision for the gods to verify. "What battered ancientry is this," thought I, "And when, if ever, did we meet before?" But ask him as I might, I got no more For answer than a moaning and a cry: Too late to parley, but in time to die, He staggered, and lay shapeless on the floor. When had I known him? And what brought him here? Love, warning, malediction, hunger, fear? Surely I never thwarted such as he?— Again, what soiled obscurity was this: Out of what scum, and up from what abyss, Had they arrived—these rags of memory? MINIVER CHEEVY Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn, Grew lean while he assailed the seasons; He wept that he was ever born, And he had reasons. Miniver loved the days of old When swords were bright and steeds were prancing; The vision of a warrior bold Would set him dancing. Miniver sighed for what was not, And dreamed, and rested from his labors; He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot, And Priam's neighbors. Miniver mourned the ripe renown That made so many a name so fragrant; He mourned Romance, now on the town, And Art, a vagrant. COLLECTED POEMS Miniver loved the Medici, Albeit he had never seen one; He would have sinned incessantly Could he have been one. Miniver cursed the commonplace And eyed a khaki suit with loathing; He missed the mediæval grace Of iron clothing. Miniver scorned the gold he sought, But sore annoyed was he without it; Miniver thought, and thought, and thought, And thought about it. Miniver Cheevy, born too late, Scratched his head and kept on thinking; Miniver coughed, and called it fate, And kept on drinking. THE PILOT From the Past and Unavailing Out of cloudland we are steering: After groping, after fearing, Into starlight we come trailing, And we find the stars are true. Still, O comrade, what of you? You are gone, but we are sailing, And the old ways are all new. For the Lost and Unreturning We have drifted, we have waited; Uncommanded and unrated, VICKERY'S MOUNTAIN We have tossed and wandered, yearning For a charm that comes no more From the old lights by the shore: We have shamed ourselves in learning What you knew so long before. For the Breed of the Far-going Who are strangers, and all brothers, May forget no more than others Who looked seaward with eyes flowing. But are brothers to bewail One who fought so foul a gale? You have won beyond our knowing, You are gone, but yet we sail. VICKERY'S MOUNTAIN Blue in the west the mountain stands, And through the long twilight Vickery sits with folded hands, And Vickery's eyes are bright. Bright, for he knows what no man else On earth as yet may know: There's a golden word that he never tells, And a gift that he will not show. He dreams of honor and wealth and fame, He smiles, and well he may; For to Vickery once a sick man came Who did not go away. The day before the day to be, "Vickery," said the guest, "You know as you live what's left of me— And you shall know the rest. COLLECTED POEMS "You know as you live that I have come To this we call the end. No doubt you have found me troublesome, But you've also found a friend; "For we shall give and you shall take The gold that is in view; The mountain there and I shall make A golden man of you. "And you shall leave a friend behind Who neither frets nor feels; And you shall move among your kind With hundreds at your heels. "Now this that I have written here Tells all that need be told; So, Vickery, take the way that's clear. And be a man of gold." Vickery turned his eyes again To the far mountain-side, And wept a tear for worthy men Defeated and defied. Since then a crafty score of years Have come, and they have gone; But Vickery counts no lost arrears: He lingers and lives on. Blue in the west the mountain stands, Familiar as a face. Blue, but Vickery knows what sands Are golden at its base. BON VOYAGE He dreams and lives upon the day When he shall walk with kings. Vickery smiles—and well he may. The life-caged linnet sings. Vickery thinks the time will come To go for what is his; But hovering, unseen hands at home Will hold him where he is. There's a golden word that he never tells And a gift that he will not show. All to be given to some one else— And Vickery not to know. BON VOYAGE Child of a line accurst And old as Troy, Bringer of best and worst In wild alloy— Light, like a linnet first, He sang for joy. Thrall to the gilded ease Of every day, Mocker of all degrees And always gay, Child of the Cyclades And of Broadway— Laughing and half divine The boy began, Drunk with a woodland wine Thessalian: But there was rue to twine The pipes of Pan. COLLECTED POEMS Therefore he skipped and flew The more along, Vivid and always new And always wrong, Knowing his only clew A siren song. Careless of each and all He gave and spent: Feast or a funeral He laughed and went, Laughing to be so small In the event. Told of his own deceit By many a tongue, Flayed for his long defeat By being young, Lured by the fateful sweet Of songs unsung— Knowing it in his heart, But knowing not The secret of an art That few forgot, He played the twinkling part That was his lot. And when the twinkle died, As twinkles do, He pushed himself aside And out of view: Out with the wind and tide, Before we knew. ATHERTON'S GAMBIT THE COMPANION Let him answer as he will, Or be lightsome as he may, Now nor after shall he say Worn-out words enough to kill, Or to lull down by their craft, Doubt, that was born yesterday, When he lied and when she laughed. Let him find another name For the starlight on the snow, Let him teach her till she know That all seasons are the same, And all sheltered ways are fair,— Still, wherever she may go, Doubt will have a dwelling there. ATHERTON'S GAMBIT The master played the bishop's pawn, For jest, while Atherton looked on; The master played this way and that, And Atherton, amazed thereat, Said "Now I have a thing in view That will enlighten one or two, And make a difference or so In what it is they do not know." The morning stars together sang And forth a mighty music rang— COLLECTED POEMS Not heard by many, save as told Again through magic manifold By such a few as have to play For others, in the Master's way, The music that the Master made When all the morning stars obeyed. Atherton played the bishop's pawn While more than one or two looked on; Atherton played this way and that, And many a friend, amused thereat, Went on about his business Nor cared for Atherton the less; A few stood longer by the game, With Atherton to them the same. The morning stars are singing still, To crown, to challenge, and to kill; And if perforce there falls a voice On pious ears that have no choice Except to urge an erring hand To wreak its homage on the land, Who of us that is worth his while Will, if he listen, more than smile? Who of us, being what he is, May scoff at others' ecstasies? However we may shine to-day, More-shining ones are on the way; And so it were not wholly well To be at odds with Azrael,— Nor were it kind of any one To sing the end of Atherton. TWO GARDENS IN LINNDALE FOR A DEAD LADY No more with overflowing light Shall fill the eyes that now are faded, Nor shall another's fringe with night Their woman-hidden world as they did. No more shall quiver down the days The flowing wonder of her ways, Whereof no language may requite The shifting and the many-shaded. The grace, divine, definitive, Clings only as a faint forestalling; The laugh that love could not forgive Is hushed, and answers to no calling; The forehead and the little ears Have gone where Saturn keeps the years; The breast where roses could not live Has done with rising and with falling. The beauty, shattered by the laws That have creation in their keeping, No longer trembles at applause, Or over children that are sleeping; And we who delve in beauty's lore Know all that we have known before Of what inexorable cause Makes Time so vicious in his reaping. TWO GARDENS IN LINNDALE Two brothers, Oakes and Oliver, Two gentle men as ever were, Would roam no longer, but abide In Linndale, where their fathers died, And each would be a gardener. COLLECTED POEMS "Now first we fence the garden through, With this for me and that for you," Said Oliver.—"Divine!" said Oakes, "And I, while I raise artichokes, Will do what I was born to do." "But this is not the soil, you know," Said Oliver, "to make them grow: The parent of us, who is dead, Compassionately shook his head Once on a time and told me so." "I hear you, gentle Oliver," Said Oakes, "and in your character I find as fair a thing indeed As ever bloomed and ran to seed Since Adam was a gardener. "Still, whatsoever I find there, Forgive me if I do not share The knowing gloom that you take on Of one who doubted and is done: For chemistry meets every prayer." "Sometimes a rock will meet a plough," Said Oliver; "but anyhow 'Tis here we are, 'tis here we live, With each to take and each to give: There's no room for a quarrel now. "I leave you in all gentleness To science and a ripe success. Now God be with you, brother Oakes, With you and with your artichokes: You have the vision, more or less." TWO GARDENS IN LINNDALE "By fate, that gives to me no choice, I have the vision and the voice: Dear Oliver, believe in me, And we shall see what we shall see; Henceforward let us both rejoice." "But first, while we have joy to spare We'll plant a little here and there; And if you be not in the wrong, We'll sing together such a song As no man yet sings anywhere." They planted and with fruitful eyes Attended each his enterprise. "Now days will come and days will go, And many a way be found, we know," Said Oakes, "and we shall sing, likewise." "The days will go, the years will go, And many a song be sung, we know," Said Oliver; "and if there be Good harvesting for you and me, Who cares if we sing loud or low?" They planted once, and twice, and thrice, Like amateurs in paradise; And every spring, fond, foiled, elate, Said Oakes, "We are in tune with Fate: One season longer will suffice." Year after year 'twas all the same: With none to envy, none to blame, They lived along in innocence, Nor ever once forgot the fence, Till on a day the Stranger came. COLLECTED POEMS He came to greet them where they were, And he too was a Gardener: He stood between these gentle men, He stayed a little while, and then The land was all for Oliver. 'Tis Oliver who tills alone Two gardens that are now his own; 'Tis Oliver who sows and reaps And listens, while the other sleeps, For songs undreamed of and unknown. 'Tis he, the gentle anchorite, Who listens for them day and night; But most he hears them in the dawn, When from his trees across the lawn Birds ring the chorus of the light. He cannot sing without the voice, But he may worship and rejoice For patience in him to remain, The chosen heir of age and pain, Instead of Oakes—who had no choice. 'Tis Oliver who sits beside The other's grave at eventide, And smokes, and wonders what new race Will have two gardens, by God's grace, In Linndale, where their fathers died. And often, while he sits and smokes, He sees the ghost of gentle Oakes Uprooting, with a restless hand, Soft, shadowy flowers in a land Of asphodels and artichokes. THE REVEALER THE REVEALER (Roosevelt) He turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion . . And the men of the city said unto him, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion?—Judges, 14. The palms of Mammon have disowned The gift of our complacency; The bells of ages have intoned Again their rhythmic irony; And from the shadow, suddenly, 'Mid echoes of decrepit rage, The seer of our necessity Confronts a Tyrian heritage. Equipped with unobscured intent He smiles with lions at the gate, Acknowledging the compliment Like one familiar with his fate; The lions, having time to wait, Perceive a small cloud in the skies, Whereon they look, disconsolate, With scared, reactionary eyes. A shadow falls upon the land,— They sniff, and they are like to roar; For they will never understand What they have never seen before. They march in order to the door, Not knowing the best thing to seek, Nor caring if the gods restore The lost composite of the Greek. COLLECTED POEMS The shadow fades, the light arrives, And ills that were concealed are seen; The combs of long-defended hives Now drip dishonored and unclean; No Nazarite or Nazarene Compels our questioning to prove The difference that is between Dead lions—or the sweet thereof. But not for lions, live or dead, Except as we are all as one, Is he the world's accredited Revealer of what we have done; What You and I and Anderson Are still to do is his reward; If we go back when he is gone— There is an Angel with a Sword. He cannot close again the doors That now are shattered for our sake; He cannot answer for the floors We crowd on, or for walls that shake; He cannot wholly undertake The cure of our immunity; He cannot hold the stars, or make Of seven years a century. So Time will give us what we earn Who flaunt the handful for the whole, And leave us all that we may learn Who read the surface for the soul; And we'll be steering to the goal, For we have said so to our sons: When we who ride can pay the toll, Time humors the far-seeing ones. THE REVEALER Down to our nose's very end We see, and are invincible,— Too vigilant to comprehend The scope of what we cannot sell; But while we seem to know as well As we know dollars, or our skins, The Titan may not always tell Just where the boundary begins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LANCELOT (1920) To Lewis M. Isaacs LANCELOT I Gawaine, aware again of Lancelot In the King's garden, coughed and followed him; Whereat he turned and stood with folded arms And weary-waiting eyes, cold and half-closed— Hard eyes, where doubts at war with memories Fanned a sad wrath. "Why frown upon a friend? Few live that have too many," Gawaine said, And wished unsaid, so thinly came the light Between the narrowing lids at which he gazed. "And who of us are they that name their friends?" Lancelot said. "They live that have not any. Why do they live, Gawaine? Ask why, and answer." Two men of an elected eminence, They stood for a time silent. Then Gawaine, Acknowledging the ghost of what was gone, Put out his hand: "Rather, I say, why ask? If I be not the friend of Lancelot, May I be nailed alive along the ground And emmets eat me dead. If I be not The friend of Lancelot, may I be fried With other liars in the pans of hell. What item otherwise of immolation Your Darkness may invent, be it mine to endure And yours to gloat on. For the time between, Consider this thing you see that is my hand. If once, it has been yours a thousand times; COLLECTED POEMS Why not again? Gawaine has never lied To Lancelot; and this, of all wrong days— This day before the day when you go south To God knows what accomplishment of exile— Were surely an ill day for lies to find An issue or a cause or an occasion. King Ban your father and King Lot my father, Were they alive, would shake their heads in sorrow To see us as we are, and I shake mine In wonder. Will you take my hand, or no? Strong as I am, I do not hold it out For ever and on air. You see—my hand." Lancelot gave his hand there to Gawaine, Who took it, held it, and then let it go, Chagrined with its indifference. "Yes, Gawaine, I go tomorrow, and I wish you well; You and your brothers, Gareth, Gaheris,— And Agravaine; yes, even Agravaine, Whose tongue has told all Camelot and all Britain More lies than yet have hatched of Modred's envy. You say that you have never lied to me, And I believe it so. Let it be so. For now and always. Gawaine, I wish you well. Tomorrow I go south, as Merlin went, But not for Merlin's end. I go, Gawaine, And leave you to your ways. There are ways left." "There are three ways I know, three famous ways, And all in Holy Writ," Gawaine said, smiling: "The snake's way and the eagle's way are two, And then we have a man's way with a maid— Or with a woman who is not a maid. Your late way is to send all women scudding, To the last flash of the last cramoisy, LANCELOT While you go south to find the fires of God. Since we came back again to Camelot From our immortal Quest—I came back first— No man has known you for the man you were Before you saw whatever 't was you saw, To make so little of kings and queens and friends Thereafter. Modred? Agravaine? My brothers? And what if they be brothers? What are brothers, If they be not our friends, your friends and mine? You turn away, and my words are no mark On you affection or your memory? So be it then, if so it is to be. God save you, Lancelot; for by Saint Stephen, You are no more than man to save yourself." "Gawaine, I do not say that you are wrong, Or that you are ill-seasoned in your lightness; You say that all you know is what you saw, And on your own averment you saw nothing. Your spoken word, Gawaine, I have not weighed In those unhappy scales of inference That have no beam but one made out of hates And fears, and venomous conjecturings; Your tongue is not the sword that urges me Now out of Camelot. Two other swords There are that are awake, and in their scabbards Are parching for the blood of Lancelot. Yet I go not away for fear of them, But for a sharper care. You say the truth, But not when you contend the fires of God Are my one fear,—for there is one fear more. Therefore I go. Gawaine, I wish you well." "Well-wishing in a way is well enough; So, in a way, is caution; so, in a way, COLLECTED POEMS Are leeches, neatherds, and astrologers. Lancelot, listen. Sit you down and listen: You talk of swords and fears and banishment. Two swords, you say; Modred and Agravaine, You mean. Had you meant Gaheris and Gareth, Or willed an evil on them, I should welcome And hasten your farewell. But Agravaine Hears little what I say; his ears are Modred's. The King is Modred's father, and the Queen A prepossession of Modred's lunacy. So much for my two brothers whom you fear, Not fearing for yourself. I say to you, Fear not for anything—and so be wise And amiable again as heretofore; Let Modred have his humor, and Agravaine His tongue. The two of them have done their worst, And having done their worst, what have they done? A whisper now and then, a chirrup or so In corners,—and what else? Ask what, and answer." Still with a frown that had no faith in it, Lancelot, pitying Gawaine's lost endeavour To make an evil jest of evidence, Sat fronting him with a remote forbearance— Whether for Gawaine blind or Gawaine false, Or both, or neither, he could not say yet, If ever; and to himself he said no more Than he said now aloud: "What else, Gawaine? What else, am I to say? Then ruin, I say; Destruction, dissolution, desolation, I say,—should I compound with jeopardy now. For there are more than whispers here, Gawaine: The way that we have gone so long together Has underneath our feet, without our will, Become a twofold faring. Yours, I trust, LANCELOT May lead you always on, as it has led you, To praise and to much joy. Mine, I believe, Leads off to battles that are not yet fought, And to the Light that once had blinded me. When I came back from seeing what I saw, I saw no place for me in Camelot. There is no place for me in Camelot. There is no place for me save where the Light May lead me; and to that place I shall go. Meanwhile I lay upon your soul no load Of counsel or of empty admonition; Only I ask of you, should strife arise In Camelot, to remember, if you may, That you've an ardor that outruns your reason, Also a glamour that outshines your guile; And you are a strange hater. I know that; And I'm in fortune that you hate not me. Yet while we have our sins to dream about, Time has done worse for time than in our making; Albeit there may be sundry falterings And falls against us in the Book of Man." "Praise Adam, you are mellowing at last! I've always liked this world, and would so still; And if it is your new Light leads you on To such an admirable gait, for God's sake, Follow it, follow it, follow it, Lancelot; Follow it as you never followed glory. Once I believed that I was on the way That you call yours, but I came home again To Camelot—and Camelot was right, For the world knows its own that knows not you; You are a thing too vaporous to be sharing The carnal feast of life. You mow down men Like elder-stems, and you leave women sighing COLLECTED POEMS For one more sight of you; but they do wrong. You are a man of mist, and have no shadow. God save you, Lancelot. If I laugh at you, I laugh in envy and in admiration." The joyless evanescence of a smile, Discovered on the face of Lancelot By Gawaine's unrelenting vigilance, Wavered, and with a sullen change went out; And then there was the music of a woman Laughing behind them, and a woman spoke: "Gawaine, you said `God save you, Lancelot.' Why should He save him any more to-day Than on another day? What has he done, Gawaine, that God should save him?" Guinevere, With many questions in her dark blue eyes And one gay jewel in her golden hair, Had come upon the two of them unseen, Till now she was a russet apparition At which the two arose—one with a dash Of easy leisure in his courtliness, One with a stately calm that might have pleased The Queen of a strange land indifferently. The firm incisive languor of her speech, Heard once, was heard through battles: "Lancelot, What have you done to-day that God should save you What has he done, Gawaine, that God should save him? I grieve that you two pinks of chivalry Should be so near me in my desolation, And I, poor soul alone, know nothing of it. What has he done, Gawaine?" With all her poise, To Gawaine's undeceived urbanity She was less queen than woman for the nonce, LANCELOT And in her eyes there was a flickering Of a still fear that would not be veiled wholly With any mask of mannered nonchalance. "What has he done? Madam, attend your nephew; And learn from him, in your incertitude, That this inordinate man Lancelot, This engine of renown, this hewer down daily Of potent men by scores in our late warfare, Has now inside his head a foreign fever That urges him away to the last edge Of everything, there to efface himself In ecstasy, and so be done with us. Hereafter, peradventure certain birds Will perch in meditation on his bones, Quite as if they were some poor sailor's bones, Or felon's jettisoned, or fisherman's, Or fowler's bones, or Mark of Cornwall's bones. In fine, this flower of men that was our comrade Shall be for us no more, from this day on, Than a much remembered Frenchman far away. Magnanimously I leave you now to prize Your final sight of him; and leaving you, I leave the sun to shine for him alone, Whiles I grope on to gloom. Madam, farewell; And you, contrarious Lancelot, farewell." II The flash of oak leaves over Guinevere That afternoon, with the sun going down, Made memories there for Lancelot, although The woman who in silence looked at him Now seemed his inventory of the world That he must lose, or suffer to be lost For love of her who sat there in the shade, COLLECTED POEMS With oak leaves flashing in a golden light Over her face and over her golden hair. "Gawaine has all the graces, yet he knows; He knows enough to be the end of us, If so he would," she said. "He knows and laughs And we are at the mercy of a man Who, if the stars went out, would only laugh." She looked away at a small swinging blossom, And then she looked intently at her fingers, While a frown gathered slowly round her eyes, And wrinkled her white forehead. Lancelot, Scarce knowing whether to himself he spoke Or to the Queen, said emptily: "As for Gawaine, My question is, if any curious hind Or knight that is alive in Britain breathing, Or prince, or king, knows more of us, or less, Than Gawaine, in his gay complacency, Knows or believes he knows. There's over muc Of knowing in this realm of many tongues, Where deeds are less to those who tell of them Than are the words they sow; and you and I Are like to yield a granary of such words, For God knows what next harvesting. Gawain I fear no more than Gareth, or Colgrevance; So far as it is his to be the friend Of any man, so far is he my friend— Till I have crossed him in some enterprise Unlikely and unborn. So fear not Gawaine But let your primal care be now for one Whose name is yours." The Queen, with her blue eyes Too bright for joy, still gazed on Lancelot, LANCELOT Who stared as if in angry malediction Upon the shorn grass growing at his feet. "Why do you speak as if the grass had ears And I had none? What are you saying now, So darkly to the grass, of knights and hinds? Are you the Lancelot who rode, long since, Away from me on that unearthly Quest, Which left no man the same who followed it— Or none save Gawaine, who came back so soon That we had hardly missed him?" Faintly then She smiled a little, more in her defence, He knew, than for misprision of a man Whom yet she feared: "Why do you set this day— This golden day, when all are not so golden— To tell me, with your eyes upon the ground, That idle words have been for idle tongues And ears a moment's idle entertainment? Have I become, and all at once, a thing So new to courts, and to the buzz they make, That I should hear no murmur, see no sign? Where malice and ambition dwell with envy, They go the farthest who believe the least; So let them,—while I ask of you again, Why this day for all this? Was yesterday A day of ouphes and omens? Was it Friday? I don't remember. Days are all alike When I have you to look on; when you go, There are no days but hours. You might say now What Gawaine said, and say it in our language." The sharp light still was in her eyes, alive And anxious with a reminiscent fear. Lancelot, like a strong man stricken hard With pain, looked up at her unhappily; And slowly, on a low and final note, COLLECTED POEMS Said: "Gawaine laughs alike at what he knows, And at the loose convenience of his fancy; He sees in others what his humor needs To nourish it, and lives a merry life. Sometimes a random shaft of his will hit Nearer the mark than one a wise man aims With infinite address and reservation; So has it come to pass this afternoon." Blood left the quivering cheeks of Guinevere As color leaves a cloud; and where white was Before, there was a ghostliness not white, But gray; and over it her shining hair Coiled heavily its mocking weight of gold. The pride of her forlorn light-heartedness Fled like a storm-blown feather; and her fear, Possessing her, was all that she possessed. She sought for Lancelot, but he seemed gone. There was a strong man glowering in a chair Before her, but he was not Lancelot, Or he would look at her and say to her That Gawaine's words were less than chaff in the wind— A nonsense about exile, birds, and bones, Born of an indolence of empty breath. "Say what has come to pass this afternoon," She said, "or I shall hear you all my life, Not hearing what it was you might have told." He felt the trembling of her slow last words, And his were trembling as he answered them: "Why this day, why no other? So you ask, And so must I in honor tell you more— For what end, I have yet no braver guess Than Modred has of immortality, Or you of Gawaine. Could I have him alone LANCELOT Between me and the peace I cannot know, My life were like the sound of golden bells Over still fields at sunset, where no storm Should ever blast the sky with fire again, Or thunder follow ruin for you and me,— As like it will, if I for one more day, Assume that I see not what I have seen, See now, and shall see. There are no more lies Left anywhere now for me to tell myself That I have not already told myself, And overtold, until today I seem To taste them as I might the poisoned fruit That Patrise had of Mador, and so died. And that same apple of death was to be food For Gawaine; but he left it and lives on, To make his joy of living your confusion. His life is his religion; he loves life With such a manifold exuberance That poison shuns him and seeks out a way To wreak its evil upon innocence. There may be chance in this, there may be law; Be what there be, I do not fear Gawaine." The Queen, with an indignant little foot, Struck viciously the unoffending grass And said: "Why not let Gawaine go his way? I'll think of him no more, fear him no more, And hear of him no more. I'll hear no more Of any now save one who is, or was, All men to me. And he said once to me That he would say why this day, of all days, Was more mysteriously felicitous For solemn commination than another." Again she smiled, but her blue eyes were telling No more their story of old happiness. COLLECTED POEMS "For me today is not as other days," He said, "because it is the first, I find, That has empowered my will to say to you What most it is that you must hear and heed. When Arthur, with a faith unfortified, Sent me alone, of all he might have sent, That May-day to Leodogran your father, I went away from him with a sore heart; For in my heart I knew that I should fail My King, who trusted me too far beyond The mortal outpost of experience. And this was after Merlin's admonition, Which Arthur, in his passion, took for less Than his inviolable majesty. When I rode in between your father's guards And heard his trumpets blown for my loud honor, I sent my memory back to Camelot, And said once to myself, `God save the king!' But the words tore my throat and were like blood Upon my tongue. Then a great shout went up From shining men around me everywhere; And I remember more fair women's eyes Than there are stars in autumn, all of them Thrown on me for a glimpse of that high knight Sir Lancelot—Sir Lancelot of the Lake. I saw their faces and I saw not one To sever a tendril of my integrity; But I thought once again, to make myself Believe a silent lie, `God save the King' . . . I saw your face, and there were no more kings." The sharp light softened in the Queen's blue eyes, And for a moment there was joy in them: "Was I so menacing to the peace, I wonder, Of anyone else alive? But why go back? LANCELOT I tell you that I fear Gawaine no more; And if you fear him not, and I fear not What you fear not, what have we then to fear?" Fatigued a little with her reasoning, She waited longer than a woman waits, Without a cloudy sign, for Lancelot's Unhurried answer: "Whether or not you fear, Know always that I fear for me no stroke Maturing for the joy of any knave Who sees the world, with me alive in it, A place too crowded for the furtherance Of his inflammatory preparations. But Lot of Orkney had a wife, a dark one; And rumor says no man who gazed at her, Attentively, might say his prayers again Without a penance or an absolution. I know not about that; but the world knows That Arthur prayed in vain once, if he prayed, Or we should have no Modred watching us. Know then that what you fear to call my fear Is all for you; and what is all for you Is all for love, which were the same to me As life—had I not seen what I have seen. But first I am to tell you what I see, And what I mean by fear. It is yourself That I see now; and if I saw you only, I might forego again all other service, And leave to Time, who is Love's almoner, The benefaction of what years or days Remaining might be found unchronicled For two that have not always watched or seen The sands of gold that flow for golden hours. If I saw you alone! But I know now That you are never more to be alone. The shape of one infernal foul attendant COLLECTED POEMS Will be for ever prowling after you, To leer at me like a damned thing whipped out Of the last cave in hell. You know his name. Over your shoulder I could see him now, Adventuring his misbegotten patience For one destroying word in the King's ear— The word he cannot whisper there quite yet, Not having it yet to say. If he should say it, Then all this would be over, and our days Of life, your days and mine, be over with it. No day of mine that were to be for you Your last, would light for me a longer span Than for yourself; and there would be no twilight." The Queen's implacable calm eyes betrayed The doubt that had as yet for what he said No healing answer: "If I fear no more Gawaine, I fear your Modred even less. Your fear, you say, is for an end outside Your safety; and as much as that I grant you. And I believe in your belief, moreover, That some far-off unheard-of retribution Hangs over Camelot, even as this oak-bough, That I may almost reach, hangs overhead, All dark now. Only a small time ago The light was falling through it, and on me. Another light, a longer time ago, Was living in your eyes, and we were happy. Yet there was Modred then as he is now, As much a danger then as he is now, And quite as much a nuisance. Let his eyes Have all the darkness in them they may hold, And there will be less left of it outside For fear to grope and thrive in. Lancelot, I say the dark is not what you fear most. LANCELOT There is a Light that you fear more today Than all the darkness that has ever been; Yet I doubt not that your Light will burn on For some time yet without your ministration. I'm glad for Modred,—though I hate his eyes,— That he should hold me nearer to your thoughts Than I should hold myself, I fear, without him; I'm glad for Gawaine, also,—who, you tell me, Misled my fancy with his joy of living." Incredulous of her voice and of her lightness, He saw now in the patience of her smile A shining quiet of expectancy That made as much of his determination As he had made of giants and Sir Peris. "But I have more to say than you have heard," He faltered—"though God knows what you have heard Should be enough." "I see it now," she said; "I see it now as always women must Who cannot hold what holds them any more. If Modred's hate were now the only hazard— The only shadow between you and me— How long should I be saying all this to you, Or you be listening? No, Lancelot,—no. I knew it coming for a longer time Than you fared for the Grail. You told yourself, When first that wild light came to make men mad Round Arthur's Table—as Gawaine told himself, And many another tired man told himself— That it was God, not something new, that called you. Well, God was something new to most of them, And so they went away. But you were changing Long before you, or Bors, or Percival, COLLECTED POEMS Or Galahad rode away—or poor Gawaine, Who came back presently; and for a time Before you went—albeit for no long time— I may have made for your too loyal patience A jealous exhibition of my folly— All for those two Elaines; and one of them Is dead, poor child, for you. How do you feel, You men, when women die for you? They do, Sometimes, you know. Not often, but sometimes." Discomfiture, beginning with a scowl And ending in a melancholy smile, Crept over Lancelot's face the while he stared, More like a child than like the man he was, At Guinevere's demure serenity Before him in the shadow, soon to change Into the darkness of a darker night Than yet had been since Arthur was a king. "What seizure of an unrelated rambling Do you suppose it was that had you then?" He said; and with a frown that had no smile Behind it, he sat brooding. The Queen laughed, And looked at him again with lucent eyes That had no sharpness in them; they were soft now, And a blue light, made wet with happiness, Distilled from pain into abandonment, Shone out of them and held him while she smiled, Although they trembled with a questioning Of what his gloom foretold: "All that I saw Was true, and I have paid for what I saw— More than a man may know. Hear me, and listen: You cannot put me or the truth aside, With half-told words that I could only wish LANCELOT No man had said to me; not you, of all men. If there were only Modred in the way, Should I see now, from here and in this light, So many furrows over your changed eyes? Why do you fear for me when all my fears Are for the needless burden you take on? To put me far away, and your fears with me, Were surely no long toil, had you the will To say what you have known and I have known Longer than I dare guess. Have little fear: Never shall I become for you a curse Laid on your conscience to be borne for ever; Nor shall I be a weight for you to drag On always after you, as a poor slave Drags iron at his heels. Therefore, today, These ominous reassurances of mine Would seem to me to be a waste of life, And more than life." Lancelot's memory wandered Into the blue and wistful distances That her soft eyes unveiled. He knew their trick, As he knew the great love that fostered it, And the wild passionate fate that hid itself In all the perilous calm of white and gold That was her face and hair, and might as well Have been of gold and marble for the world, And for the King. Before he knew, she stood Behind him with her warm hands on his cheeks, And her lips on his lips; and though he heard Not half of what she told, he heard enough To make as much of it, or so it seemed, As man was ever told, or should be told, Or need be, until everything was told, And all the mystic silence of the stars COLLECTED POEMS Had nothing more to keep or to reveal. "If there were only Modred in the way," She murmured, "would you come to me tonight? The King goes to Carleon or Carlisle, Or some place where there's hunting. Would you come, If there were only Modred in the way?" She felt his hand on hers and laid her cheek Upon his forehead, where the furrows were: "All these must go away, and so must I— Before there are more shadows. You will come, And you may tell me everything you must That I must hear you tell me—if I must— Of bones and horrors and of horrid waves That break for ever on the world's last edge." III Lancelot looked about him, but he saw No Guinevere. The place where she had sat Was now an empty chair that might have been The shadowy throne of an abandoned world, But for the living fragrance of a kiss That he remembered, and a living voice That hovered when he saw that she was gone. There was too much remembering while he felt Upon his cheek the warm sound of her words; There was too much regret; there was too much Remorse. Regret was there for what had gone, Remorse for what had come. Yet there was time, That had not wholly come. There was time enough Between him and the night—as there were shoals Enough, no doubt, that in the sea somewhere Were not yet hidden by the drowning tide. "So there is here between me and the dark Some twilight left," he said. He sighed, and said LANCELOT Again, "Time, tide, and twilight—and the dark; And then, for me, the Light. But what for her? I do not think of anything but life That I may give to her by going now; And if I look into her eyes again, Or feel her breath upon my face again, God knows if I may give so much as life; Or if the durance of her loneliness Would have it for the asking. What am I? What have I seen that I must leave behind So much of heaven and earth to burn itself Away in white and gold, until in time There shall be no more white and no more gold? I cannot think of such a time as that; I cannot—yet I must; for I am he That shall have hastened it and hurried on To dissolution all that wonderment— That envy of all women who have said She was a child of ice and ivory; And of all men, save one. And who is he? Who is this Lancelot that has betrayed His King, and served him with a cankered honor? Who is this Lancelot that sees the Light And waits now in the shadow for the dark? Who is this King, this Arthur, who believes That what has been, and is, will be for ever,— Who has no eye for what he will not see, And will see nothing but what's passing here In Camelot, which is passing? Why are we here? What are we doing—kings, queens, Camelots, And Lancelots? And what is this dim world That I would leave, and cannot leave tonight Because a Queen is in it and a King Has gone away to some place where there's hunting— Carleon or Carlisle! Who is this Queen, COLLECTED POEMS This pale witch-wonder of white fire and gold, This Guinevere that I brought back with me From Cameliard for Arthur, who knew then What Merlin told, as he forgets it now And rides away from her—God watch the world!— To some place where there's hunting! What are kings? And how much longer are there to be kings? When are the millions who are now like worms To know that kings are worms, if they are worms? When are the women who make toys of men To know that they themselves are less than toys When Time has laid upon their skins the touch Of his all-shrivelling fingers? When are they To know that men must have an end of them When men have seen the Light and left the world That I am leaving now. Yet, here I am, And all because a king has gone a-hunting. . . . Carleon or Carlisle!" So Lancelot Fed with a sullen rancor, which he knew To be as false as he was to the King, The passion and the fear that now in him Were burning like two slow infernal fires That only flight and exile far away From Camelot should ever cool again. "Yet here I am," he said,—"and here I am. Time, tide, and twilight; and there is no twilight— And there is not much time. But there's enough To eat and drink in; and there may be time For me to frame a jest or two to prove How merry a man may be who sees the Light. And I must get me up and go along, Before the shadows blot out everything, And leave me stumbling among skeletons. LANCELOT God, what a rain of ashes falls on him Who sees the new and cannot leave the old!" He rose and looked away into the south Where a gate was, by which he might go out, Now, if he would, while Time was yet there with him— Time that was tearing minutes out of life While he stood shivering in his loneliness, And while the silver lights of memory Shone faintly on a far-off eastern shore Where he had seen on earth for the last time The triumph and the sadness in the face Of Galahad, for whom the Light was waiting. Now he could see the face of him again, He fancied; and his flickering will adjured him To follow it and be free. He followed it Until it faded and there was no face, And there was no more light. Yet there was time That had not come, though he could hear it now Like ruining feet of marching conquerors That would be coming soon and were not men. Forlornly and unwillingly he came back To find the two dim chairs. In one of them Was Guinevere, and on her phantom face There fell a golden light that might have been The changing gleam of an unchanging gold That was her golden hair. He sprang to touch The wonder of it, but she too was gone, Like Galahad; he was alone again With shadows, and one face that he still saw. The world had no more faces now than one That for a moment, with a flash of pain, Had shown him what it is that may be seen In embers that break slowly into dust, Where for a time was fire. He saw it there COLLECTED POEMS Before him, and he knew it was not good That he should learn so late, and of this hour, What men may leave behind them in the eyes Of women who have nothing more to give, And may not follow after. Once again He gazed away to southward, but the face Of Galahad was not there. He turned, and saw Before him, in the distance, many lights In Arthur's palace; for the dark had come To Camelot, while Time had come and gone. IV Not having viewed Carleon or Carlisle, The King came home to Camelot after midnight, Feigning an ill not feigned; and his return Brought Bedivere, and after him Gawaine, To the King's inner chamber, where they waited Through the grim light of dawn. Sir Bedivere, By nature stern to see, though not so bleak Within as to be frozen out of mercy, Sat with arms crossed and with his head weighed low In heavy meditation. Once or twice His eyes were lifted for a careful glimpse Of Gawaine at the window, where he stood Twisting his fingers feverishly behind him, Like one distinguishing indignantly, For swift eclipse and for offence not his, The towers and roofs and the sad majesty Of Camelot in the dawn, for the last time. Sir Bedivere, at last, with a long sigh That said less of his pain than of his pity, Addressed the younger knight who turned and heard His elder, but with no large eagerness: LANCELOT "So it has come, Gawaine; and we are here. I find when I see backward something farther, By grace of time, than you are given to see— Though you, past any doubt, see much that I See not—I find that what the colder speech Of reason most repeated says to us Of what is in a way to come to us Is like enough to come. And we are here. Before the unseeing sun is here to mock us, Or the King here to prove us, we are here. We are the two, it seems, that are to make Of words and of our presences a veil Between him and the sight of what he does. Little have I to say that I may tell him: For what I know is what the city knows, Not what it says,—for it says everything. The city says the first of all who met The sword of Lancelot was Colgrevance, Who fell dead while he wept—a brave machine, Cranked only for the rudiments of war. But some of us are born to serve and shift, And that's not well. The city says, also, That you and Lancelot were in the garden, Before the sun went down." "Yes," Gawaine groaned; "Yes, we were there together in the garden, Before the sun went down; and I conceive A place among the possibilities For me with other causes unforeseen Of what may shake down soon to grief and ashes This kingdom and this empire. Bedivere, Could I have given a decent seriousness To Lancelot while he said things to me That pulled his heart half out of him by the roots, COLLECTED POEMS And left him, I see now, half sick with pity For my poor uselessness to serve a need That I had never known, we might be now Asleep and easy in our beds at home, And we might hear no murmurs after sunrise Of what we are to hear. A few right words Of mine, if said well, might have been enough. That shall I never know. I shall know only That it was I who laughed at Lancelot When he said what lay heaviest on his heart. By now he might be far away from here, And farther from the world. But the Queen came; The Queen came, and I left them there together; And I laughed as I left them. After dark I met with Modred and said what I could, When I had heard him, to discourage him. His mother was my mother. I told Bors, And he told Lancelot; though as for that, My story would have been the same as his, And would have had the same acknowledgment: `Thanks, but no matter'—or to that effect. The Queen, of course, had fished him for his word, And had it on the hook when she went home; And after that, an army of red devils Could not have held the man away from her. And I'm to live as long as I'm to wonder What might have been, had I not been—myself. I heard him, and I laughed. Then the Queen came." "Recriminations are not remedies, Gawaine; and though you cast them at yourself, And hurt yourself, you cannot end or swerve The flowing of these minutes that leave hours Behind us, as we leave our faded selves And yesterdays. The surest-visioned of us LANCELOT Are creatures of our dreams and inferences, And though it look to us a few go far For seeing far, the fewest and the farthest Of all we know go not beyond themselves. No, Gawaine, you are not the cause of this; And I have many doubts if all you said, Or in your lightness may have left unsaid, Would have unarmed the Queen. The Queen was there."— Gawaine looked up, and then looked down again: "Good God, if I had only said—said something!" "Say nothing now, Gawaine." Bedivere sighed, And shook his head: "Morning is not in the west. The sun is rising and the King is coming; Now you may hear him in the corridor, Like a sick landlord shuffling to the light For one last look-out on his mortgaged hills. But hills and valleys are not what he sees; He sees with us the fire—the sign—the law. The King that is the father of the law Is weaker than his child, except he slay it. Not long ago, Gawaine, I had a dream Of a sword over kings, and of a world Without them."—"Dreams, dreams."—"Hush, Gawaine." King Arthur Came slowly on till in the darkened entrance He stared and shivered like a sleep-walker, Brought suddenly awake where a cliff's edge Is all he sees between another step And his annihilation. Bedivere rose, And Gawaine rose; and with instinctive arms They partly guided, partly carried him, To the King's chair. COLLECTED POEMS "I thank you, gentlemen, Though I am not so shaken, I dare say, As you would have me. This is not the hour When kings who do not sleep are at their best; And had I slept this night that now is over, No man should ever call me King again." He pulled his heavy robe around him closer, And laid upon his forehead a cold hand That came down warm and wet. "You, Bedivere, And you, Gawaine, are shaken with events Incredible yesterday,—but kings are men. Take off their crowns and tear away their colors And let them see with my eyes what I see— Yes, they are men, indeed! If there's a slave In Britain with a reptile at his heart Like mine that with his claws of ice and fire Tears out of me the fevered roots of mercy, Find him, and I will make a king of him! And then, so that his happiness may swell Tenfold, I'll sift the beauty of all courts And capitals, to fetch the fairest woman That evil has in hiding; after that, That he may know the sovran one man living To be his friend, I'll prune all chivalry To one sure knight. In this wise our new king Will have his queen to love, as I had mine,— His friend that he may trust, as I had mine,— And he will be as gay, if all goes well, As I have been: as fortunate in his love, And in his friend as fortunate—as I am! And what am I? . . . And what are you—you two! If you are men, why don't you say I'm dreaming? I know men when I see them, I know daylight; And I see now the gray shine of our dreams. I tell you I'm asleep and in my bed! . . . LANCELOT But no—no . . . I remember. You are men. You are no dreams—but God, God, if you were! If I were strong enough to make you vanish And have you back again with yesterday— Before I lent myself to that false hunting, Which yet may stalk the hours of many more Than Lancelot's unhappy twelve who died,— With a misguided Colgrevance to lead them, And Agravaine to follow and fall next,— Then should I know at last that I was King, And I should then be King. But kings are men, And I have gleaned enough these two years gone To know that queens are women. Merlin told me: `The love that never was.' Two years ago He told me that: `The love that never was!' I saw—but I saw nothing. Like the bird That hides his head, I made myself see nothing. But yesterday I saw—and I saw fire. I think I saw it first in Modred's eyes; Yet he said only truth—and fire is right. It is—it must be fire. The law says fire. And I, the King who made the law, say fire! What have I done—what folly have I said, Since I came here, of dreaming? Dreaming? Ha! I wonder if the Queen and Lancelot Are dreaming! . . . Lancelot! Have they found him yet? He slashed a way into the outer night— Somewhere with Bors. We'll have him here anon, And we shall feed him also to the fire. There are too many faggots lying cold That might as well be cleansing, for our good, A few deferred infections of our state That honor should no longer look upon. Thank heaven, I man my drifting wits again! COLLECTED POEMS Gawaine, your brothers, Gareth and Gaheris, Are by our royal order there to see And to report. They went unwillingly, For they are new to law and young to justice; But what they are to see will harden them With wholesome admiration of a realm Where treason's end is ashes. Ashes. Ashes! Now this is better. I am King again. Forget, I pray, my drowsy temporizing, For I was not then properly awake. . . . What? Hark! Whose crass insanity is that! If I be King, go find the fellow and hang him Who beats into the morning on that bell Before there is a morning! This is dawn! What! Bedivere? Gawaine? You shake your heads? I tell you this is dawn! . . . What have I done? What have I said so lately that I flinch To think on! What have I sent those boys to see? I'll put clouts on my eyes, and I'll not see it! Her face, and hands, and little small white feet, And all her shining hair and her warm body— No—for the love of God, no!—it's alive! She's all alive, and they are burning her— The Queen—the love—the love that never was! Gawaine! Bedivere! Gawaine!—Where is Gawaine! Is he there in the shadow? Is he dead? Are we all dead? Are we in hell?—Gawaine! . . . I cannot see her now in the smoke. Her eyes Are what I see—and her white body is burning! She never did enough to make me see her Like that—to make her look at me like that! There's not room in the world for so much evil As I see clamoring in her poor white face For pity. Pity her, God! God! . . . Lancelot!" LANCELOT V Gawaine, his body trembling and his heart Pounding as if he were a boy in battle, Sat crouched as far away from everything As walls would give him distance. Bedivere Stood like a man of stone with folded arms, And wept in stony silence. The King moved His pallid lips and uttered fitfully Low fragments of a prayer that was half sad, Half savage, and was ended in a crash Of distant sound that anguish lifted near To those who heard it. Gawaine sprang again To the same casement where the towers and roofs Had glimmered faintly a long hour ago, But saw no terrors yet—though now he heard A fiercer discord than allegiance rings To rouse a mourning city: blows, groans, cries, Loud iron struck on iron, horses trampling, Death-yells and imprecations, and at last A moaning silence. Then a murmuring Of eager fearfulness, which had a note Of exultation and astonishment, Came nearer, till a tumult of hard feet Filled the long corridor where late the King Had made a softer progress. "Well then, Lucan," The King said, urging an indignity To qualify suspense: "For what arrears Of grace are we in debt for this attention? Why all this early stirring of our sentries, And their somewhat unseasoned innovation, To bring you at this unappointed hour? COLLECTED POEMS Are we at war with someone or another, Without our sanction or intelligence? Are Lucius and the Romans here to greet us, Or was it Lucius we saw dead?" Sir Lucan Bowed humbly in amazed acknowledgment Of his intrusion, meanwhile having scanned What three grief-harrowed faces were revealing: "Praise God, sir, there are tears in the King's eyes, And in his friends'. Having regarded them, And having ventured an abrupt appraisal Of what I translate. . . ." "Lucan," the King said, "No matter what procedure or persuasion Gave you an entrance—tell us what it is That you have come to tell us, and no more. There was a most uncivil sound abroad Before you came. Who riots in the city?" "Sir, will your patience with a clement ear, Attend the confirmation of events, I will, with all available precision, Say what this morning has inaugurated. No preface or prolonged exordium Need aggravate the narrative, I venture. The man of God, requiring of the Queen A last assoiling prayer for her salvation, Heard what none else did hear save God the Father. Then a great hush descended on a scene Where stronger men than I fell on their knees, And wet with tears their mail of shining iron That soon was to be cleft unconscionably Beneath a blast of anguish as intense And fabulous in ardor and effect LANCELOT As Jove's is in his lightning. To be short, They led the Queen—and she went bravely to it, Or so she was configured in the picture— A brief way more; and we who did see that, Believed we saw the last of all her sharing In this conglomerate and perplexed existence. But no—and here the prodigy comes in— The penal flame had hardly bit the faggot, When, like an onslaught out of Erebus, There came a crash of horses, and a flash Of axes, and a hewing down of heroes, Not like to any in its harsh, profound, Unholy, and uneven execution. I felt the breath of one horse on my neck, And of a sword that all but left a chasm Where still, praise be to God, I have intact A face, if not a fair one. I achieved My flight, I trust, with honorable zeal, Not having arms, or mail, or preservation In any phase of necessary iron. I found a refuge; and there saw the Queen, All white, and in a swound of woe uplifted By Lionel, while a dozen fought about him, And Lancelot, who seized her while he struck, And with his insane army galloped away, Before the living, whom he left amazed, Were sure they were alive among the dead. Not even in the legendary mist Of wars that none today may verify, Did ever men annihilate their kind With a more vicious inhumanity, Or a more skilful frenzy. Lancelot And all his heated adjuncts are by now Too far, I fear, for such immediate Reprisal as your majesty perchance . . ." COLLECTED POEMS "O' God's name, Lucan," the King cried, "be still!" He gripped with either sodden hand an arm Of his unyielding chair, while his eyes blazed In anger, wonder, and fierce hesitation. Then with a sigh that may have told unheard Of an unwilling gratitude, he gazed Upon his friends who gazed again at him; But neither King nor friend said anything Until the King turned once more to Sir Lucan: "Be still, or publish with a shorter tongue The names of our companions who are dead. Well, were you there? Or did you run so fast That you were never there? You must have eyes, Or you could not have run to find us here." Then Lucan, with a melancholy glance At Gawaine, who stood glaring his impatience, Addressed again the King: "I will be short, sir; Too brief to measure with finality The scope of what I saw with indistinct Amazement and incredulous concern. Sir Tor, Sir Griflet, and Sir Aglovale Are dead. Sir Gillimer, he is dead. Sir—Sir— But should a living error be detailed In my account, how should I meet your wrath For such a false addition to your sorrow?" He turned again to Gawaine, who shook now As if the fear in him were more than fury.— The King, observing Gawaine, beat his foot In fearful hesitancy on the floor: "No, Lucan; if so kind an error lives In your dead record, you need have no fear. My sorrow has already, in the weight Of this you tell, too gross a task for that." LANCELOT "Then I must offer you cold naked words, Without the covering warmth of even one Forlorn alternative," said Lucan, slowly: "Sir Gareth, and Sir Gaheris—are dead." The rage of a fulfilled expectancy, Long tortured on a rack of endless moments, Flashed out of Gawaine's overflowing eyes While he flew forward, seizing Lucan's arms, And hurled him while he held him.—"Stop, Gawaine," The King said grimly. "Now is no time for that. If Lucan, in a too bewildered heat Of observation or sad reckoning, Has added life to death, our joy therefor Will be the larger. You have lost yourself." "More than myself it is that I have lost," Gawaine said, with a chocking voice that faltered: "Forgive me, Lucan; I was a little mad. Gareth?—and Gaheris? Do you say their names, And then say they are dead! They had no arms— No armor. They were like you—and you live! Why do you live when they are dead! You ran, You say? Well, why were they not running— If they ran only for a pike to die with? I knew my brothers, and I know your tale Is not all told. Gareth?—and Gaheris? Would they stay there to die like silly children? Did they believe the King would have them die For nothing? There are dregs of reason, Lucan, In lunacy itself. My brothers, Lucan, Were murdered like two dogs. Who murdered them?" Lucan looked helplessly at Bedivere, The changeless man of stone, and then at Gawaine: COLLECTED POEMS "I cannot use the word that you have used, Though yours must have an answer. Your two brothers Would not have squandered or destroyed themselves In a vain show of action. I pronounce it, If only for their known obedience To the King's instant wish. Know then your brothers Were caught and crowded, this way and then that, With men and horses raging all around them; And there were swords and axes everywhere That heads of men were. Armored and unarmored, They knew the iron alike. In so great press, Discrimination would have had no pause To name itself; and therefore Lancelot Saw not—or seeing, he may have seen too late— On whom his axes fell." "Why do you flood The name of Lancelot with words enough To drown him and his army—and his axes! . . . His axes?—or his axe! Which, Lucan? Speak! Speak, or by God you'll never speak again! . . . Forgive me, Lucan; I was a little mad. You, sir, forgive me; and you, Bedivere. There are too many currents in this ocean Where I'm adrift, and I see no land yet. Men tell of a great whirlpool in the north Where ships go round until the men aboard Go dizzy, and are dizzy when they're drowning. But whether I'm to drown or find the shore, There is one thing—and only one thing now— For me to know. . . . His axes? or his axe! Say, Lucan, or I—O Lucan, speak—speak—speak! Lucan, did Lancelot kill my two brothers?" "I say again that in all human chance He knew not upon whom his axe was falling." LANCELOT "So! Then it was his axe and not his axes. It was his hell-begotten self that did it, And it was not his men. Gareth! Gaheris! You came too soon. There was no place for you Where there was Lancelot. My folly it was, Not yours, to take for true the inhuman glamour Of his high-shining fame for that which most Was not the man. The truth we see too late Hides half its evil in our stupidity; And we gape while we groan for what we learn. An hour ago and I was all but eager To mourn with Bedivere for grief I had That I did not say something to this villain— To this true, gracious, murderous friend of mine— To comfort him and urge him out of this, While I was half a fool and half believed That he was going. Well, there is this to say: The world that has him will not have him long. You see how calm I am, now I have said it? And you, sir, do you see how calm I am? And it was I who told of shipwrecks—whirlpools— Drowning! I must have been a little mad, Not having occupation. Now I have one. And I have now a tongue as many-phrased As Lucan's. Gauge it, Lucan, if you will; Or take my word. It's all one thing to me— All one, all one! There's only one thing left . . . Gareth and Gaheris! Gareth! . . . Lancelot!" "Look, Bedivere," the King said: "look to Gawaine. Now lead him, you and Lucan, to a chair— As you and Gawaine led me to this chair Where I am sitting. We may all be led, If there be coming on for Camelot Another day like this. Now leave me here, COLLECTED POEMS Alone with Gawaine. When a strong man goes Like that, it makes him sick to see his friends Around him. Leave us, and go now. Sometimes I'll scarce remember that he's not my son, So near he seems. I thank you, gentlemen." The King, alone with Gawaine, who said nothing, Had yet no heart for news of Lancelot Or Guinevere. He saw them on their way To Joyous Gard, where Tristram and Isolt Had islanded of old their stolen love, While Mark of Cornwall entertained a vengeance Envisaging an ending of all that; And he could see the two of them together As Mark had seen Isolt there, and her knight,— Though not, like Mark, with murder in his eyes. He saw them as if they were there already, And he were a lost thought long out of mind; He saw them lying in each other's arms, Oblivious of the living and the dead They left in Camelot. Then he saw the dead That lay so quiet outside the city walls, And wept, and left the Queen to Lancelot— Or would have left her, had the will been his To leave or take; for now he could acknowledge An inrush of a desolate thanksgiving That she, with death around her, had not died. The vision of a peace that humbled him, And yet might save the world that he had won, Came slowly into view like something soft And ominous on all-fours, without a spirit To make it stand upright. "Better be that, Even that, than blood," he sighed, "if that be peace." But looking down on Gawaine, who said nothing, He shook his head: "The King has had his world, LANCELOT And he shall have no peace. With Modred here, And Agravaine with Gareth, who is dead With Gaheris, Gawaine will have no peace. Gawaine or Modred—Gawaine with his hate, Or Modred with his anger for his birth, And the black malady of his ambition— Will make of my Round Table, where was drawn The circle of a world, a thing of wreck And yesterday—a furniture forgotten; And I, who loved the world as Merlin did, May lose it as he lost it, for a love That was not peace, and therefore was not love." VI The dark of Modred's hour not yet availing, Gawaine it was who gave the King no peace; Gawaine it was who goaded him and drove him To Joyous Gard, where now for long his army, Disheartened with unprofitable slaughter, Fought for their weary King and wearily Died fighting. Only Gawaine's hate it was That held the King's knights and his warrior slaves Close-hived in exile, dreaming of old scenes Where Sorrow, and her demon sister Fear, Now shared the dusty food of loneliness, From Orkney to Cornwall. There was no peace, Nor could there be, so Gawaine told the King, And so the King in anguish told himself, Until there was an end of one of them— Of Gawaine or the King, or Lancelot, Who might have had an end, as either knew, Long since of Arthur and of Gawaine with him. One evening in the moonlight Lancelot And Bors, his kinsman, and the loyalest, COLLECTED POEMS If least assured, of all who followed him, Sat gazing from an ivy-cornered casement In angry silence upon Arthur's horde, Who in the silver distance, without sound, Were dimly burying dead men. Sir Bors, Reiterating vainly what was told As wholesome hearing for unhearing ears, Said now to Lancelot: "And though it be For no more now than always, let me speak: You have a pity for the King, you say, That is not hate; and for Gawaine you have A grief that is not hate. Pity and grief! And the Queen all but shrieking out her soul That morning when we snatched her from the faggots That were already crackling when we came! Why, Lancelot, if in you is an answer, Have you so vast a charity for the King, And so enlarged a grief for his gay nephew, Whose tireless hate for you has only one Disastrous appetite? You know for what— For your slow blood. I knew you, Lancelot, When all this would have been a merry fable For smiling men to yawn at and forget, As they forget their physic. Pity and grief Are in your eyes. I see them well enough; And I saw once with you, in a far land, The glimmering of a Light that you saw nearer— Too near for your salvation or advantage, If you be what you seem. What I saw then Made life a wilder mystery than ever, And earth a new illusion. You, maybe, Saw pity and grief. What I saw was a Gleam, To fight for or to die for—till we know Too much to fight or die. Tonight you turn A page whereon your deeds are to engross LANCELOT Inexorably their story of tomorrow; And then tomorrow. How many of these tomorrows Are coming to ask unanswered why this war Was fought and fought for the vain sake of slaughter? Why carve a compost of a multitude, When only two, discriminately despatched, Would sum the end of what you know is ending And leave to you the scorch of no more blood Upon your blistered soul? The Light you saw Was not for this poor crumbling realm of Arthur, Nor more for Rome; but for another state That shall be neither Rome nor Camelot, Nor one that we may name. Why longer, then, Are you and Gawaine to anoint with war, That even in hell would be superfluous, A reign already dying, and ripe to die? I leave you to your last interpretation Of what may be the pleasure of your madness." Meanwhile a mist was hiding the dim work Of Arthur's men; and like another mist, All gray, came Guinevere to Lancelot, Whom Bors had left, not having had of him The largess of a word. She laid her hands Upon his hair, vexing him to brief speech: "And you—are you like Bors?" "I may be so," She said; and she saw faintly where she gazed, Like distant insects of a shadowy world, Dim clusters here and there of shadowy men Whose occupation was her long abhorrence: "If he came here and went away again, And all for nothing, I may be like Bors. Be glad, at least, that I am not like Mark COLLECTED POEMS Of Cornwall, who stood once behind a man And slew him without saying he was there. Not Arthur, I believe, nor yet Gawaine, Would have done quite like that; though only God May say what there's to come before this war Shall have an end—unless you are to see, As I have seen so long, a way to end it." He frowned, and watched again the coming mist That hid with a cold veil of augury The stillness of an empire that was dying: "And are you here to say that if I kill Gawaine and Arthur we shall both be happy?" "Is there still such a word as happiness? I come to tell you nothing, Lancelot, That folly and waste have not already told you. Were you another man than Lancelot, I might say folly and fear. But no,—no fear, As I know fear, was yet composed and wrought, By man, for your delay and your undoing. God knows how cruelly and how truly now You might say, that of all who breathe and suffer There may be others who are not so near To you as I am, and so might say better What I say only with a tongue not apt Or guarded for much argument. A woman, As men have known since Adam heard the first Of Eve's interpreting of how it was In Paradise, may see but one side only— Where maybe there are two, to say no more. Yet here, for you and me, and so for all Caught with us in this lamentable net, I see but one deliverance: I see none, Unless you cut for us a clean way out, LANCELOT So rending these hate-woven webs of horror Before they mesh the world. And if the world Or Arthur's name be now a dying glory, Why bleed it for the sparing of a man Who hates you, and a King that hates himself? If war be war—and I make only blood Of your red writing—why dishonor Time For torture longer drawn in your slow game Of empty slaughter? Tomorrow it will be The King's move, I suppose, and we shall have One more magnificent waste of nameless pawns, And of a few more knights. God, how you love This game!—to make so loud a shambles of it, When you have only twice to lift your finger To signal peace, and give to this poor drenched And clotted earth a time to heal itself. Twice over I say to you, if war be war, Why play with it? Why look a thousand ways Away from what it is, only to find A few stale memories left that would requite Your tears with your destruction? Tears, I say, For I have seen your tears; I see them now, Although the moon is dimmer than it was Before I came. I wonder if I dimmed it. I wonder if I brought this fog here with me To make you chillier even than you are When I am not so near you. . . . Lancelot, There must be glimmering yet somewhere within you The last spark of a little willingness To tell me why it is this war goes on. Once I believed you told me everything; And what you may have hidden was no matter, For what you told was all I needed then. But crumbs that are a festival for joy Make a dry fare for sorrow; and the few COLLECTED POEMS Spared words that were enough to nourish faith, Are for our lonely fears a frugal poison. So, Lancelot, if only to bring back For once the ghost of a forgotten mercy, Say now, even though you strike me to the floor When you have said it, for what untold end All this goes on. Am I not anything now? Is Gawaine, who would feed you to wild swine, And laugh to see them tear you, more than I am? Is Arthur, at whose word I was dragged out To wear for you the fiery crown itself Of human torture, more to you than I am? Am I, because you saw death touch me once, Too gross a trifle to be longer prized? Not many days ago, when you lay hurt And aching on your bed, and I cried out Aloud on heaven that I should bring you there, You said you would have paid the price of hell To save me that foul morning from the fire. You paid enough: yet when you told me that, With death going on outside the while you said it, I heard the woman in me asking why. Nor do I wholly find an answer now In any shine of any far-off Light You may have seen. Knowing the world, you know How surely and how indifferently that Light Shall burn through many a war that is to be, To which this war were no more than a smear On circumstance. The world has not begun. The Light you saw was not the Light of Rome, Or Time, though you seem battling here for time, While you are still at war with Arthur's host And Gawaine's hate. How many thousand men Are going to their death before Gawaine And Arthur go to theirs—and I to mine?" LANCELOT Lancelot, looking off into the fog, In which his fancy found the watery light Of a dissolving moon, sighed without hope Of saying what the Queen would have him say: "I fear, my lady, my fair nephew Bors, Whose tongue affords a random wealth of sound, May lately have been scattering on the air For you a music less oracular Than to your liking. . . . Say, then, you had split The uncovered heads of two men with an axe, Not knowing whose heads—if that's a palliation— And seen their brains fly out and splash the ground As they were common offal, and then learned That you had butchered Gaheris and Gareth— Gareth, who had for me a greater love Than any that has ever trod the ways Of a gross world that early would have crushed him,— Even you, in your quick fever of dispatch, Might hesitate before you drew the blood Of him that was their brother, and my friend. Yes, he was more my friend, was I to know, Than I had said or guessed; for it was Gawaine Who gave to Bors the word that might have saved us, And Arthur's fading empire, for the time Till Modred had in his dark wormy way Crawled into light again with a new ruin At work in that occult snake's brain of his. And even in your prompt obliteration Of Arthur from a changing world that rocks Itself into a dizziness around him, A moment of attendant reminiscence Were possible, if not likely. Had he made A knight of you, scrolling your name with his Among the first of men—and in his love Inveterately the first—and had you then COLLECTED POEMS Betrayed his fame and honor to the dust That now is choking him, you might in time— You might, I say—to my degree succumb. Forgive me, if my lean words are for yours Too bare an answer, and ascribe to them No tinge of allegation or reproach. What I said once to you I said for ever— That I would pay the price of hell to save you. As for the Light, leave that for me alone; Or leave as much of it as yet for me May shine. Should I, through any unforeseen Remote effect of awkwardness or chance, Be done to death or durance by the King, I leave some writing wherein I beseech For you the clemency of afterthought. Were I to die and he to see me dead, My living prayer, surviving the cold hand That wrote, would leave you in his larger prudence, If I have known the King, free and secure To bide the summoning of another King More great than Arthur. But all this is language; And I know more than words have yet the scope To show of what's to come. Go now to rest; And sleep, if there be sleep. There was a moon; And now there is no sky where the moon was. Sometimes I wonder if this be the world We live in, or the world that lives in us." The new day, with a cleansing crash of rain That washed and sluiced the soiled and hoof-torn field Of Joyous Gard, prepared for Lancelot And his wet men the not unwelcome scene Of a drenched emptiness without an army. "Our friend the foe is given to dry fighting," Said Lionel, advancing with a shrug, LANCELOT To Lancelot, who saw beyond the rain. And later Lionel said, "What fellows are they, Who are so thirsty for their morning ride That swimming horses would have hardly time To eat before they swam? You, Lancelot, If I see rather better than a blind man, Are waiting on three pilgrims who must love you, To voyage a flood like this. No friend have I, To whisper not of three, on whom to count For such a loyal wash. The King himself Would entertain a kindly qualm or so, Before he suffered such a burst of heaven To splash even three musicians." "Good Lionel, I thank you, but you need afflict your fancy No longer for my sake. For these who come, If I be not immoderately deceived, Are bearing with them the white flower of peace— Which I could hope might never parch or wither, Were I a stranger to this ravening world Where we have mostly a few rags and tags Between our skins and those that wrap the flesh Of less familiar brutes we feed upon That we may feed the more on one another." "Well, now that we have had your morning grace Before our morning meat, pray tell to me The why and whence of this anomalous Horse-riding offspring of the Fates. Who are they?" "I do not read their features or their names; But if I read the King, they are from Rome, Spurred here by the King's prayer for no delay; COLLECTED POEMS And I pray God aloud that I say true." And after a long watching, neither speaking, "You do," said Lionel; "for by my soul, I see no other than my lord the Bishop, Who does God's holy work in Rochester. Since you are here, you may as well abide here, While I go foraging." Now in the gateway, The Bishop, who rode something heavily, Was glad for rest though grim in his refusal At once of entertainment or refection: "What else you do, Sir Lancelot, receive me As one among the honest when I say That my voluminous thanks were less by cantos Than my damp manner feels. Nay, hear my voice: If once I'm off this royal animal, How o' God's name shall I get on again? Moreover, the King waits. With your accord, Sir Lancelot, I'll dry my rainy face, While you attend what's herein written down, In language of portentous brevity, For the King's gracious pleasure and for yours, Whereof the burden is the word of Rome, Requiring your deliverance of the Queen Not more than seven days hence. The King returns Anon to Camelot; and I go with him, Praise God, if what he waits now is your will To end an endless war. No recrudescence, As you may soon remark, of what is past Awaits the Queen, or any doubt soever Of the King's mercy. Have you more to say Than Rome has written, or do I perceive Your tranquil acquiescence? Is it so? Then be it so! Venite. Pax vobiscum." LANCELOT "To end an endless war with `pax vobiscum' Would seem a ready schedule for a bishop; Would God that I might see the end of it!" Lancelot, like a statue in the gateway, Regarded with a qualified rejoicing The fading out of his three visitors Into the cold and swallowing wall of storm Between him and the battle-wearied King And the unwearying hatred of Gawaine. To Bors his nephew, and to Lionel, He glossed a tale of Roman intercession, Knowing that for a time, and a long time, The sweetest fare that he might lay before them Would hold an evil taste of compromise. To Guinevere, who questioned him at noon Of what by then had made of Joyous Gard A shaken hive of legend-heavy wonder, He said what most it was the undying Devil, Who ruled him when he might, would have him say: "Your confident arrangement of the board For this day's game was notably not to be; Today was not for the King's move or mine, But for the Bishop's; and the board is empty. The words that I have waited for more days Than are to now my tallage of gray hairs Have come at last, and at last you are free. So, for a time, there will be no more war; And you are going home to Camelot." "To Camelot?" . . . "To Camelot." But his words Were said for no queen's hearing. In his arms He caught her when she fell; and in his arms He carried her away. The word of Rome Was in the rain. There was no other sound. COLLECTED POEMS VII All day the rain came down on Joyous Gard, Where now there was no joy, and all that night The rain came down. Shut in for none to find him Where an unheeded log-fire fought the storm With upward swords that flashed along the wall Faint hieroglyphs of doom not his to read, Lancelot found a refuge where at last He might see nothing. Glad for sight of nothing, He saw no more. Now and again he buried A lonely thought among the coals and ashes Outside the reaching flame and left it there, Quite as he left outside in rainy graves The sacrificial hundreds who had filled them. "They died, Gawaine," he said, "and you live on, You and the King, as if there were no dying; And it was I, Gawaine, who let you live— You and the King. For what more length of time, I wonder, may there still be found on earth Foot-room for four of us? We are too many For one world, Gawaine; and there may be soon, For one or other of us, a way out. As men are listed, we are men for men To fear; and I fear Modred more than any. But even the ghost of Modred at the door— The ghost I should have made him—would employ For time as hard as this a louder knuckle, Assuredly now, than that. And I would see No mortal face till morning. . . . Well, are you well Again? Are you as well again as ever?" He led her slowly on with a cold show Of care that was less heartening for the Queen LANCELOT Than anger would have been, into the firelight, And there he gave her cushions. "Are you warm?" He said; and she said nothing. "Are you afraid?" He said again; "are you still afraid of Gawaine? As often as you think of him and hate him, Remember too that he betrayed his brothers To us that he might save us. Well, he saved us; And Rome, whose name to you was never music, Saves you again, with heaven alone may tell What others who might have their time to sleep In earth out there, with the rain falling on them, And with no more to fear of wars tonight Than you need fear of Gawaine or of Arthur. The way before you is a safer way For you to follow than when I was in it. We children who forget the whips of Time, To live within the hour, are slow to see That all such hours are passing. They were past When you came here with me." She looked away, Seeming to read the firelight on the walls Before she spoke: "When I came here with you, And found those eyes of yours, I could have wished And prayed it were the end of hours, and years. What was it made you save me from the fire, If only out of memories and forebodings To build around my life another fire Of slower faggots? If you had let me die, Those other faggots would be ashes now, And all of me that you have ever loved Would be a few more ashes. If I read The past as well as you have read the future You need say nothing of ingratitude, For I say only lies. My soul, of course, COLLECTED POEMS It was you loved. You told me so yourself. And that same precious blue-veined cream-white soul Will soon be safer, if I understand you, In Camelot, where the King is, than elsewhere On earth. What more, in faith, have I to ask Of earth or heaven than that! Although I fell When you said Camelot, are you to know, Surely, the stroke you gave me then was not The measure itself of ecstasy? We women Are such adept inveterates in our swooning That we fall down for joy as easily As we eat one another to show our love. Even horses, seeing again their absent masters, Have wept for joy; great dogs have died of it." Having said as much as that, she frowned and held Her small white hands out for the fire to warm them. Forward she leaned, and forward her thoughts went— To Camelot. But they were not there long, Her thoughts; for soon she flashed her eyes again, And he found in them what he wished were tears Of angry sorrow for what she had said. "What are you going to do with me?" she asked; And all her old incisiveness came back, With a new thrust of malice, which he felt And feared. "What are you going to do with me? What does a child do with a worn-out doll? I was a child once; and I had a father. He was a king; and, having royal ways, He made a queen of me—King Arthur's queen. And if that happened, once upon a time, Why may it not as well be happening now That I am not a queen? Was I a queen When first you brought me here with one torn rag To cover me? Was I overmuch a queen When I sat up at last, and in a gear LANCELOT That would have made a bishop dance to Cardiff To see me wearing it? Was I Queen then?" "You were the Queen of Christendom," he said, Not smiling at her, "whether now or not You deem it an unchristian exercise To vilipend the wearing of the vanished. The women may have reasoned, insecurely, That what one queen had worn would please another. I left them to their ingenuities." Once more he frowned away a threatening smile, But soon forgot the memory of all smiling While he gazed on the glimmering face and hair Of Guinevere—the glory of white and gold That had been his, and were, for taking of it, Still his, to cloud, with an insidious gleam Of earth, another that was not of earth, And so to make of him a thing of night— A moth between a window and a star, Not wholly lured by one or led by the other. The more he gazed upon her beauty there, The longer was he living in two kingdoms, Not owning in his heart the king of either, And ruling not himself. There was an end Of hours, he told her silent face again, In silence. On the morning when his fury Wrenched her from that foul fire in Camelot, Where blood paid irretrievably the toll Of her release, the whips of Time had fallen Upon them both. All this to Guinevere He told in silence and he told in vain. Observing her ten fingers variously, She sighed, as in equivocal assent, "No two queens are alike." COLLECTED POEMS "Is that the flower Of all your veiled invention?" Lancelot said, Smiling at last: "If you say, saying all that, You are not like Isolt—well, you are not. Isolt was a physician, who cured men Their wounds, and sent them rowelling for more; Isolt was too dark, and too versatile; She was too dark for Mark, if not for Tristram. Forgive me; I was saying that to myself, And not to make you shiver. No two queens— Was that it?—are alike? A longer story Might have a longer telling and tell less. Your tale's as brief as Pelleas with his vengeance On Gawaine, whom he swore that he would slay At once for stealing of the lady Ettard." "Treasure my scantling wits, if you enjoy them; Wonder a little, too, that I conserve them Through the eternal memory of one morning, And in these years of days that are the death Of men who die for me. I should have died. I should have died for them." "You are wrong," he said; "They died because Gawaine went mad with hate For loss of his two brothers and set the King On fire with fear, the two of them believing His fear was vengeance when it was in fact A royal desperation. They died because Your world, my world, and Arthur's world is dying, As Merlin said it would. No blame is yours; For it was I who led you from the King— Or rather, to say truth, it was your glory That led my love to lead you from the King— By flowery ways, that always end somewhere, LANCELOT To fire and fright and exile, and release. And if you bid your memory now to blot Your story from the book of what has been, Your phantom happiness were a ghost indeed, And I the least of weasels among men,— Too false to manhood and your sacrifice To merit a niche in hell. If that were so, I'd swear there was no light for me to follow, Save your eyes to the grave; and to the last I might not know that all hours have an end; I might be one of those who feed themselves By grace of God, on hopes dryer than hay, Enjoying not what they eat, yet always eating. The Vision shattered, a man's love of living Becomes at last a trap and a sad habit, More like an ailing dotard's love of liquor That ails him, than a man's right love of woman, Or of his God. There are men enough like that, And I might come to that. Though I see far Before me now, could I see, looking back, A life that you could wish had not been lived, I might be such a man. Could I believe Our love was nothing mightier then than we were, I might be such a man—a living dead man, One of these days." Guinevere looked at him, And all that any woman has not said Was in one look: "Why do you stab me now With such a needless `then'? If I am going— And I suppose I am—are the words all lost That men have said before to dogs and children To make them go away? Why use a knife, When there are words enough without your `then' To cut as deep as need be? What I ask you COLLECTED POEMS Is never more to ask me if my life Be one that I could wish had not been lived— And that you never torture it again, To make it bleed and ache as you do now, Past all indulgence or necessity. Were you to give a lonely child who loved you One living thing to keep—a bird, may be— Before you went away from her forever, Would you, for surety not to be forgotten, Maim it and leave it bleeding on her fingers? And would you leave the child alone with it— Alone, and too bewildered even to cry, Till you were out of sight? Are you men never To know what words are? Do you doubt sometimes A Vision that lets you see so far away That you forget so lightly who it was You must have cared for once to be so kind— Or seem so kind—when she, and for that only, Had that been all, would throw down crowns and glories To share with you the last part of the world? And even the queen in me would hardly go So far off as to vanish. If I were patched And scrapped in what the sorriest fisher-wife In Orkney might give mumbling to a beggar, I doubt if oafs and yokels would annoy me More than I willed they should. Am I so old And dull, so lean and waning, or what not, That you must hurry away to grasp and hoard The small effect of time I might have stolen From you and from a Light that where it lives Must live for ever? Where does history tell you The Lord himself would seem in so great haste As you for your perfection? If our world— Your world and mine and Arthur's, as you say— Is going out now to make way for another, LANCELOT Why not before it goes, and I go with it, Have yet one morsel more of life together, Before death sweeps the table and our few crumbs Of love are a few last ashes on a fire That cannot hurt your Vision, or burn long? You cannot warm your lonely fingers at it For a great waste of time when I am dead: When I am dead you will be on your way, With maybe not so much as one remembrance Of all I was, to follow you and torment you. Some word of Bors may once have given color To some few that I said, but they were true— Whether Bors told them first to me, or whether I told them first to Bors. The Light you saw Was not the Light of Rome; the word you had Of Rome was not the word of God—though Rome Has refuge for the weary and heavy-laden. Were I to live too long I might seek Rome Myself, and be the happier when I found it. Meanwhile, am I to be no more to you Than a moon-shadow of a lonely stranger Somewhere in Camelot? And is there no region In this poor fading world of Arthur's now Where I may be again what I was once— Before I die? Should I live to be old, I shall have been long since too far away For you to hate me then; and I shall know How old I am by seeing it in your eyes." Her misery told itself in a sad laugh, And in a rueful twisting of her face That only beauty's perilous privilege Of injury would have yielded or suborned As hope's infirm accessory while she prayed Through Lancelot to heaven for Lancelot. She looked away: "If I were God," she said, COLLECTED POEMS "I should say, `Let them be as they have been. A few more years will heap no vast account Against eternity, and all their love Was what I gave them. They brought on the end Of Arthur's empire, which I wrought through Merlin For the world's knowing of what kings and queens Are made for; but they knew not what they did— Save as a price, and as a fear that love Might end in fear. It need not end that way, And they need fear no more for what I gave them; For it was I who gave them to each other.' If I were God, I should say that to you." He saw tears quivering in her pleading eyes, But through them she could see, with a wild hope, That he was fighting. When he spoke, he smiled— Much as he might have smiled at her, she thought, Had she been Gawaine, Gawaine having given To Lancelot, who yet would have him live, An obscure wound that would not heal or kill. "My life was living backward for the moment," He said, still burying in the coals and ashes Thoughts that he would not think. His tongue was dry, And each dry word he said was choking him As he said on: "I cannot ask of you That you be kind to me, but there's a kindness That is your proper debt. Would you cajole Your reason with a weary picturing On walls or on vain air of what your fancy, Like firelight, makes of nothing but itself? Do you not see that I go from you only Because you go from me?—because our path Led where at last it had an end in havoc, As long we knew it must—as Arthur too, And Merlin knew it must?—as God knew it must? LANCELOT A power that I should not have said was mine— That was not mine, and is not mine—avails me Strangely tonight, although you are here with me; And I see much in what has come to pass That is to be. The Light that I have seen, As you say true, is not the light of Rome, Albeit the word of Rome that set you free Was more than mine or the King's. To flout that word Would sound the preparation of a terror To which a late small war on our account Were a king's pastime and a queen's annoyance; And that, for the good fortune of a world As yet not over-fortuned, may not be. There may be war to come when you are gone, For I doubt yet Gawaine; but Rome will hold you, Hold you in Camelot. If there be more war, No fire of mine shall feed it, nor shall you Be with me to endure it. You are free; And free, you are going home to Camelot. There is no other way than one for you, Nor is there more than one for me. We have lived, And we shall die. I thank you for my life. Forgive me if I say no more tonight." He rose, half blind with pity that was no longer The servant of his purpose or his will, To grope away somewhere among the shadows For wine to drench his throat and his dry tongue, That had been saying he knew not what to her For whom his life-devouring love was now A scourge of mercy. Like a blue-eyed Medea Of white and gold, broken with grief and fear And fury that shook her speechless while she waited, Yet left her calm enough for Lancelot COLLECTED POEMS To see her without seeing, she stood up To breathe and suffer. Fury could not live long, With grief and fear like hers and love like hers, When speech came back: "No other way now than one? Free? Do you call me free? Do you mean by that There was never woman alive freer to live Than I am free to die? Do you call me free Because you are driven so near to death yourself With weariness of me, and the sight of me, That you must use a crueller knife than ever, And this time at my heart, for me to watch Before you drive it home? For God's sake, drive it! Drive it as often as you have the others, And let the picture of each wound it makes On me be shown to women and men for ever; And the good few that know—let them reward you. I hear them, in such low and pitying words As only those who know, and are not many, Are used to say: `The good knight Lancelot It was who drove the knife home to her heart, Rather than drive her home to Camelot.' Home! Free! Would you let me go there again— To be at home?—be free? To be his wife? To live in his arms always, and so hate him That I could heap around him the same faggots That you put out with blood? Go home, you say? Home?—where I saw the black post waiting for me That morning?—saw those good men die for me— Gareth and Gaheris, Lamorak's brother Tor, And all the rest? Are men to die for me For ever? Is there water enough, do you think, Between this place and that for me to drown in?" "There is time enough, I think, between this hour And some wise hour tomorrow, for you to sleep in. LANCELOT When you are safe again in Camelot, The King will not molest you or pursue you; The King will be a suave and chastened man. In Camelot you shall have no more to dread Than you shall hear then of this rain that roars Tonight as if it would be roaring always. I do not ask you to forgive the faggots, Though I would have you do so for your peace. Only the wise who know may do so much, And they, as you say truly, are not many. And I would say no more of this tonight." "Then do not ask me for the one last thing That I shall give to God! I thought I died That morning. Why am I alive again, To die again? Are you all done with me? Is there no longer something left of me That made you need me? Have I lost myself So fast that what a mirror says I am Is not what is, but only what was once? Does half a year do that with us, I wonder, Or do I still have something that was mine That afternoon when I was in the sunset, Under the oak, and you were looking at me? Your look was not all sorrow for your going To find the Light and leave me in the dark— But I am the daughter of Leodogran, And you are Lancelot,—and have a tongue To say what I may not. . . . Why must I go To Camelot when your kinsmen hold all France? Why is there not some nook in some old house Where I might hide myself—with you or not? Is there no castle, or cabin, or cave in the woods? Yes, I could love the bats and owls, in France, A lifetime sooner than I could the King COLLECTED POEMS That I shall see in Camelot, waiting there For me to cringe and beg of him again The dust of mercy, calling it holy bread. I wronged him, but he bought me with a name Too large for my king-father to relinquish— Though I prayed him, and I prayed God aloud, To spare that crown. I called it crown enough To be my father's child—until you came. And then there were no crowns or kings or fathers Under the sky. I saw nothing but you. And you would whip me back to bury myself In Camelot, with a few slave maids and lackeys To be my grovelling court; and even their faces Would not hide half the story. Take me to France— To France or Egypt,—anywhere else on earth Than Camelot! Is there not room in France For two more dots of mortals?—or for one?— For me alone? Let Lionel go with me— Or Bors. Let Bors go with me into France, And leave me there. And when you think of me, Say Guinevere is in France, where she is happy; And you may say no more of her than that . . . Why do you not say something to me now— Before I go? Why do you look—and look? Why do you frown as if you thought me mad? I am not mad—but I shall soon be mad, If I go back to Camelot where the King is. Lancelot! . . . Is there nothing left of me? Nothing of what you called your white and gold, And made so much of? Has it all gone by? He must have been a lonely God who made Man in his image and then made only a woman! Poor fool she was! Poor Queen! Poor Guinevere! There were kings and bishops once, under her window Like children, and all scrambling for a flower. LANCELOT Time was!—God help me, what am I saying now! Does a Queen's memory wither away to that? Am I so dry as that? Am I a shell? Have I become so cheap as this? . . . I wonder Why the King cared!" She fell down on her knees Crying, and held his knees with hungry fear. Over his folded arms, as over the ledge Of a storm-shaken parapet, he could see, Below him, like a tumbling flood of gold, The Queen's hair with a crumpled foam of white Around it: "Do you ask, as a child would, For France because it has a name? How long Do you conceive the Queen of the Christian world Would hide herself in France were she to go there? How long should Rome require to find her there? And how long, Rome or not, would such a flower As you survive the unrooting and transplanting That you commend so ingenuously tonight? And if we shared your cave together, how long, And in the joy of what obscure seclusion, If I may say it, were Lancelot of the Lake And Guinevere an unknown man and woman, For no eye to see twice? There are ways to France, But why pursue them for Rome's interdict, And for a longer war? Your path is now As open as mine is dark—or would be dark, Without the Light that once had blinded me To death, had I seen more. I shall see more, And I shall not be blind. I pray, moreover, That you be not so now. You are a Queen, And you may be no other. You are too brave And kind and fair for men to cheer with lies. We cannot make one world of two, nor may we Count one life more than one. Could we go back COLLECTED POEMS To the old garden, we should not stay long; The fruit that we should find would all be fallen, And have the taste of earth." When she looked up, A tear fell on her forehead. "Take me away!" She cried. "Why do you do this? Why do you say this? If you are sorry for me, take me away From Camelot! Send me away—drive me away— Only away from there! The King is there— And I may kill him if I see him there. Take me away—take me away to France! And if I cannot hide myself in France, Then let me die in France!" He shook his head, Slowly, and raised her slowly in his arms, Holding her there; and they stood long together. And there was no sound then of anything, Save a low moaning of a broken woman, And the cold roaring down of that long rain. All night the rain came down on Joyous Gard; And all night, there before the crumbling embers That faded into feathery death-like dust, Lancelot sat and heard it. He saw not The fire that died, but he heard rain that fell On all those graves around him and those years Behind him; and when dawn came, he was cold. At last he rose, and for a time stood seeing The place where she had been. She was not there; He was not sure that she had ever been there; He was not sure there was a Queen, or a King, Or a world with kingdoms on it. He was cold. He was not sure of anything but the Light— LANCELOT The Light he saw not. "And I shall not see it," He thought, "so long as I kill men for Gawaine. If I kill him, I may as well kill myself; And I have killed his brothers." He tried to sleep, But rain had washed the sleep out of his life, And there was no more sleep. When he awoke, He did not know that he had been asleep; And the same rain was falling. At some strange hour It ceased, and there was light. And seven days after, With a cavalcade of silent men and women, The Queen rode into Camelot, where the King was, And Lancelot rode grimly at her side. When he rode home again to Joyous Gard, The storm in Gawaine's eyes and the King's word Of banishment attended him. "Gawaine Will give the King no peace," Lionel said; And Lancelot said after him, "Therefore The King will have no peace."—And so it was That Lancelot, with many of Arthur's knights That were not Arthur's now, sailed out one day From Cardiff to Bayonne, where soon Gawaine, The King, and the King's army followed them, For longer sorrow and for longer war. VIII For longer war they came, and with a fury That only Modred's opportunity, Seized in the dark of Britain, could have hushed And ended in a night. For Lancelot, When he was hurried amazed out of his rest Of a gray morning to the scarred gray wall Of Benwick, where he slept and fought, and saw Not yet the termination of a strife COLLECTED POEMS That irked him out of utterance, found again Before him a still plain without an army. What the mist hid between him and the distance He knew not, but a multitude of doubts And hopes awoke in him, and one black fear, At sight of a truce-waving messenger In whose approach he read, as by the Light Itself, the last of Arthur. The man reined His horse outside the gate, and Lancelot, Above him on the wall, with a sick heart, Listened: "Sir Gawaine to Sir Lancelot Sends greeting; and this with it, in his hand. The King has raised the siege, and you in France He counts no longer with his enemies. His toil is now for Britain, and this war With you, Sir Lancelot, is an old war, If you will have it so."—"Bring the man in," Said Lancelot, "and see that he fares well." All through the sunrise, and alone, he sat With Gawaine's letter, looking toward the sea That flowed somewhere between him and the land That waited Arthur's coming, but not his. "King Arthur's war with me is an old war, If I will have it so," he pondered slowly; "And Gawaine's hate for me is an old hate, If I will have it so. But Gawaine's wound Is not a wound that heals; and there is Modred— Inevitable as ruin after flood. The cloud that has been darkening Arthur's empire May now have burst, with Arthur still in France, Many hours away from Britain, and a world Away from me. But I read this in my heart. If in the blot of Modred's evil shadow, Conjecture views a cloudier world than is, LANCELOT So much the better, then, for clouds and worlds, And kings. Gawaine says nothing yet of this, But when he tells me nothing he tells all. Now he is here, fordone and left behind, Pursuant of his wish; and there are words That he would say to me. Had I not struck him Twice to the earth, unwillingly, for my life, My best eye then, I fear, were best at work On what he has not written. As it is, If I go seek him now, and in good faith, My faith may dig my grave. If so, then so. If I know only with my eyes and ears, I may as well not know." Gawaine, having scanned His words and sent them, found a way to sleep— And sleeping, to forget. But he remembered Quickly enough when he woke up to meet With his the shining gaze of Lancelot Above him in a shuttered morning gloom, Seeming at first a darkness that had eyes. Fear for a moment seized him, and his heart, Long whipped and driven with fever, paused and flickered, As like to fail too soon. Fearing to move, He waited; fearing to speak, he waited; fearing To see too clearly or too much, he waited; For what, he wondered—even the while he knew It was for Lancelot to say something. And soon he did: "Gawaine, I thought at first No man was here." "No man was, till you came. Sit down; and for the love of God who made you, Say nothing to me now of my three brothers. Gareth and Gaheris and Agravaine COLLECTED POEMS Are gone; and I am going after them; Of such is our election. When you gave That ultimate knock on my revengeful head, You did a piece of work." "May God forgive," Lancelot said, "I did it for my life, Not yours." "I know, but I was after yours; Had I been Lancelot, and you Gawaine, You might be dead." "Had you been Lancelot, And I Gawaine, my life had not been yours— Not willingly. Your brothers are my debt That I shall owe to sorrow and to God, For whatsoever payment there may be. What I have paid is not a little, Gawaine." "Why leave me out? A brother more or less Would hardly be the difference of a shaving. My loose head would assure you, saying this, That I have no more venom in me now On their account than mine, which is not much. There was a madness feeding on us all, As we fed on the world. When the world sees, The world will have in turn another madness; And so, as I've a glimpse, ad infinitum. But I'm not of the seers: Merlin it was Who turned a sort of ominous early glimmer On my profane young life. And after that He falls himself, so far that he becomes One of our most potential benefits— Like Vivian, or the mortal end of Modred. LANCELOT Why could you not have taken Modred also, And had the five of us? You did your best, We know, yet he's more poisonously alive Than ever; and he's a brother, of a sort, Or half of one, and you should not have missed him A gloomy curiosity was our Modred, From his first intimation of existence. God made him as He made the crocodile, To prove He was omnipotent. Having done so, And seeing then that Camelot, of all places Ripe for annihilation, most required him, He put him there at once, and there he grew. And there the King would sit with him for hours, Admiring Modred's growth; and all the time His evil it was that grew, the King not seeing In Modred the Almighty's instrument Of a world's overthrow. You, Lancelot, And I, have rendered each a contribution; And your last hard attention on my skull Might once have been a benison on the realm, As I shall be, too late, when I'm laid out With a clean shroud on—though I'd liefer stay A while alive with you to see what's coming. But I was not for that; I may have been For something, but not that. The King, my uncle, Has had for all his life so brave a diet Of miracles, that his new fare before him Of late has ailed him strangely; and of all Who loved him once he needs you now the most— Though he would not so much as whisper this To me or to my shadow. He goes alone To Britain, with an army brisk as lead, To battle with his Modred for a throne That waits, I fear, for Modred—should your France Not have it otherwise. And the Queen's in this, COLLECTED POEMS For Modred's game and prey. God save the Queen, If not the King! I've always liked this world; And I would a deal rather live in it Than leave it in the middle of all this music. If you are listening, give me some cold water." Lancelot, seeing by now in dim detail What little was around him to be seen, Found what he sought and held a cooling cup To Gawaine, who, with both hands clutching it, Drank like a child. "I should have had that first," He said, with a loud breath, "before my tongue Began to talk. What was it saying? Modred? All through the growing pains of his ambition I've watched him; and I might have this and that To say about him, if my hours were days. Well, if you love the King and hope to save him, Remember his many infirmities of virtue— Considering always what you have in Modred, For ever unique in his iniquity. My truth might have a prejudicial savor To strangers, but we are not strangers now. Though I have only one spoiled eye that sees, I see in yours we are not strangers now. I tell you, as I told you long ago— When the Queen came to put my candles out With her gold head and her propinquity— That all your doubts that you had then of me, When they were more than various imps and harpies Of your inflamed invention, were sick doubts: King Arthur was my uncle, as he is now; But my Queen-aunt, who loved him something less Than cats love rain, was not my only care. Had all the women who came to Camelot Been aunts of mine, I should have been, long since, LANCELOT The chilliest of all unwashed eremites In a far land alone. For my dead brothers, Though I would leave them where I go to them, I read their story as I read my own, And yours, and—were I given the eyes of God— As I might yet read Modred's. For the Queen, May she be safe in London where she's hiding Now in the Tower. For the King, you only— And you but hardly—may deliver him yet From that which Merlin's vision long ago, If I made anything of Merlin's words, Foretold of Arthur's end. And for ourselves, And all who died for us, or now are dying Like rats around us of their numerous wounds And ills and evils, only this do I know— And this you know: The world has paid enough For Camelot. It is the world's turn now— Or so it would be if the world were not The world. `Another Camelot,' Bedivere says; `Another Camelot and another King'— Whatever he means by that. With a lineal twist, I might be king myself; and then, my lord, Time would have sung my reign—I say not how. Had I gone on with you, and seen with you Your Gleam, and had some ray of it been mine, I might be seeing more and saying less. Meanwhile, I liked this world; and what was on The Lord's mind when He made it is no matter. Be lenient, Lancelot; I've a light head. Merlin appraised it once when I was young, Telling me then that I should have the world To play with. Well, I've had it, and played with it; And here I'm with you now where you have sent me Neatly to bed, with a towel over one eye; And we were two of the world's ornaments. COLLECTED POEMS Praise all you are that Arthur was your King; You might have had no Gleam had I been King, Or had the Queen been like some queens I knew. King Lot, my father—" Lancelot laid a finger On Gawaine's lips: "You are too tired for that."— "Not yet," said Gawaine, "though I may be soon. Think you that I forget this Modred's mother Was mine as well as Modred's? When I meet My mother's ghost, what shall I do—forgive? When I'm a ghost, I'll forgive everything . . . It makes me cold to think what a ghost knows. Put out the bonfire burning in my head, And light one at my feet. When the King thought The Queen was in the flames, he called on you: `God, God,' he said, and `Lancelot.' I was there, And so I heard him. That was a bad morning For kings and queens, and there are to be worse. Bedivere had a dream, once on a time: `Another Camelot and another King,' He says when he's awake; but when he dreams, There are no kings. Tell Bedivere, some day, That he saw best awake. Say to the King That I saw nothing vaster than my shadow, Until it was too late for me to see; Say that I loved him well, but served him ill— If you two meet again. Say to the Queen . . . Say what you may say best. Remember me To Pelleas, too, and tell him that his lady Was a vain serpent. He was dying once For love of her, and had me in his eye For company along the dusky road Before me now. But Pelleas lived, and married. Lord God, how much we know!—What have I done? LANCELOT Why do you scowl? Well, well,—so the earth clings To sons of earth; and it will soon be clinging, To this one son of earth you deprecate, Closer than heretofore. I say too much, Who should be thinking all a man may think When he has no machine. I say too much— Always. If I persuade the devil again That I'm asleep, will you espouse the notion For a small hour or so? I might be glad— Not to be here alone." He gave his hand Slowly, in hesitation. Lancelot shivered, Knowing the chill of it. "Yes, you say too much," He told him, trying to smile. "Now go to sleep; And if you may, forget what you forgive." Lancelot, for slow hours that were as long As leagues were to the King and his worn army, Sat waiting,—though not long enough to know From any word of Gawaine, who slept on, That he was glad not to be there alone.— "Peace to your soul, Gawaine," Lancelot said, And would have closed his eyes. But they were closed. IX So Lancelot, with a world's weight upon him, Went heavily to that heaviest of all toil, Which of itself tells hard in the beginning Of what the end shall be. He found an army That would have razed all Britain, and found kings For generals; and they all went to Dover, Where the white cliffs were ghostlike in the dawn, And after dawn were deathlike. For the word Of the dead King's last battle chilled the sea Before a sail was down; and all who came COLLECTED POEMS With Lancelot heard soon from little men, Who clambered overside with larger news, How ill had fared the great. Arthur was dead, And Modred with him, each by the other slain; And there was no knight left of all who fought On Salisbury field save one, Sir Bedivere, Of whom the tale was told that he had gone Darkly away to some far hermitage, To think and die. There were tales told of a ship. Anon, by further sounding of more men, Each with a more delirious involution Than his before him, he believed at last The Queen was yet alive—if it were life To draw now the Queen's breath, or to see Britain With the Queen's eyes—and that she fared somewhere To westward out of London, where the Tower Had held her, as once Joyous Gard had held her, For dolorous weeks and months a prisoner there, With Modred not far off, his eyes afire For her and for the King's avenging throne, That neither King nor son should see again. " `The world had paid enough for Camelot,' Gawaine said; and the Queen had paid enough, God knows," said Lancelot. He saw Bors again And found him angry—angry with his tears, And with his fate that was a reason for them: "Could I have died with Modred on my soul, And had the King lived on, then had I lived On with him; and this played-out world of ours Might not be for the dead." "A played-out world, Although that world be ours, had best be dead," Said Lancelot: "There are worlds enough to follow. LANCELOT `Another Camelot and another King,' Bedivere said. And where is Bedivere now? And Camelot?" "There is no Camelot," Bors answered. "Are we going back to France, Or are we to tent here and feed our souls On memories and on ruins till even our souls Are dead? Or are we to set free for sport An idle army for what comes of it?" "Be idle till you hear from me again, Or for a fortnight. Then, if you have no word, Go back; and I may follow you alone, In my own time, in my own way." "Your way Of late, I fear, has been too much your own; But what has been, has been, and I say nothing. For there is more than men at work in this; And I have not your eyes to find the Light, Here in the dark—though some day I may see it." "We shall all see it, Bors," Lancelot said, With his eyes on the earth. He said no more. Then with a sad farewell, he rode away, Somewhere into the west. He knew not where. "We shall all see it, Bors," he said again. Over and over he said it, still as he rode, And rode, away to the west, he knew not where, Until at last he smiled unhappily At the vain sound of it. "Once I had gone Where the Light guided me, but the Queen came, And then there was no Light. We shall all see—" COLLECTED POEMS He bit the words off short, snapping his teeth, And rode on with his memories before him, Before him and behind. They were a cloud For no Light now to pierce. They were a cloud Made out of what was gone; and what was gone Had now another lure than once it had, Before it went so far away from him— To Camelot. And there was no Camelot now— Now that no Queen was there, all white and gold, Under an oaktree with another sunlight Sifting itself in silence on her glory Through the dark leaves above her where she sat, Smiling at what she feared, and fearing least What most there was to fear. Ages ago That must have been; for a king's world had faded Since then, and a king with it. Ages ago, And yesterday, surely it must have been That he had held her moaning in the firelight And heard the roaring down of that long rain, As if to wash away the walls that held them Then for that hour together. Ages ago, And always, it had been that he had seen her, As now she was, floating along before him, Too far to touch and too fair not to follow, Even though to touch her were to die. He closed His eyes, only to see what he had seen When they were open; and he found it nearer. Seeing nothing now but the still white and gold In a wide field of sable, smiling at him, But with a smile not hers until today— A smile to drive no votary from the world To find the Light. "She is not what it is That I see now," he said: "No woman alive And out of hell was ever like that to me. What have I done to her since I have lost her? LANCELOT What have I done to change her? No, it is I— I who have changed. She is not one who changes. The Light came, and I did not follow it; Then she came, knowing not what thing she did, And she it was I followed. The gods play Like that, sometimes; and when the gods are playing, Great men are not so great as the great gods Had led them once to dream. I see her now Where now she is alone. We are all alone, We that are left; and if I look too long Into her eyes . . . I shall not look too long. Yet look I must. Into the west, they say, She went for refuge. I see nuns around her; But she, with so much history tenanting Her eyes, and all that gold over her eyes, Were not yet, I should augur, out of them. If I do ill to see her, then may God Forgive me one more trespass. I would leave The world and not the shadow of it behind me." Time brought his weary search to a dusty end One afternoon in Almesbury, where he left, With a glad sigh, his horse in an innyard; And while he ate his food and drank his wine, Thrushes, indifferent in their loyalty To Arthur dead and to Pan never dead, Sang as if all were now as all had been. Lancelot heard them till his thoughts came back To freeze his heart again under the flood Of all his icy fears. What should he find? And what if he should not find anything? "Words, after all," he said, "are only words; And I have heard so many in these few days That half my wits are sick." COLLECTED POEMS He found the queen, But she was not the Queen of white and gold That he had seen before him for so long. There was no gold; there was no gold anywhere. The black hood, and the white face under it, And the blue frightened eyes, were all he saw— Until he saw more black, and then more white. Black was a foreign foe to Guinevere; And in the glimmering stillness where he found her Now, it was death; and she Alcestis-like, Had waited unaware for the one hand Availing, so he thought, that would have torn Off and away the last fell shred of doom That was destroying and dishonoring All the world held of beauty. His eyes burned With a sad anger as he gazed at hers That shone with a sad pity. "No," she said; "You have not come for this. We are done with this. For there are no queens here; there is a Mother. The Queen that was is only a child now, And you are strong. Remember you are strong, And that your fingers hurt when they forget How strong they are." He let her go from him And while he gazed around him, he frowned hard And long at the cold walls: "Is this the end Of Arthur's kingdom and of Camelot?"— She told him with a motion of her shoulders All that she knew of Camelot or of kingdoms; And then said: "We are told of other States Where there are palaces, if we should need them, That are not made with hands. I thought you knew." Dumb, like a man twice banished, Lancelot Stood gazing down upon the cold stone floor; LANCELOT And she, demurely, with a calm regard That he met once and parried, stood apart, Appraising him with eyes that were no longer Those he had seen when first they had seen his. They were kind eyes, but they were not the eyes Of his desire; and they were not the eyes That he had followed all the way from Dover. "I feared the Light was leading you," she said, "So far by now from any place like this That I should have your memory, but no more. Might not that way have been the wiser way? There is no Arthur now, no Modred now,— No Guinevere." She paused, and her voice wandered Away from her own name: "There is nothing now That I can see between you and the Light That I have dimmed so long. If you forgive me, And I believe you do—though I know all That I have cost, when I was worth so little— There is no hazard that I see between you And all you sought so long, and would have found Had I not always hindered you. Forgive me— I could not let you go. God pity men When women love too much—and women more." He scowled and with an iron shrug he said: "Yes, there is that between me and the light." He glared at her black hood as if to seize it; Their eyes met, and she smiled: "No, Lancelot; We are going by two roads to the same end; Or let us hope, at least, what knowledge hides, And so believe it. We are going somewhere. Why the new world is not for you and me, I cannot say; but only one was ours. I think we must have lived in our one world All that earth had for us. You are good to me, Coming to find me here for the last time; COLLECTED POEMS For I should have been lonely many a night, Not knowing if you cared. I do know now; And there is not much else for me to know That earth may tell me. I found in the Tower, With Modred watching me, that all you said That rainy night was true. There was time there To find out everything. There were long days, And there were nights that I should not have said God would have made a woman to endure. I wonder if a woman lives who knows All she may do." "I wonder if one woman Knows one thing she may do," Lancelot said, With a sad passion shining out of him While he gazed on her beauty, palled with black That hurt him like a sword. The full blue eyes And the white face were there, and the red lips Were there, but there was no gold anywhere. "What have you done with your gold hair?" he said; "I saw it shining all the way from Dover, But here I do not see it. Shall I see it?"— Faintly again she smiled: "Yes, you may see it All the way back to Dover; but not here. There's not much of it here, and what there is Is not for you to see." "Well, if not here," He said at last, in a low voice that shook, "Is there no other place left in the world?" "There is not even the world left, Lancelot, For you and me." "There is France left," he said. His face flushed like a boy's, but he stood firm As a peak in the sea and waited. LANCELOT "How many lives Must a man have in one to make him happy?" She asked, with a wan smile of recollection That only made the black that was around Her calm face more funereal: "Was it you, Or was it Gawaine who said once to me, `We cannot make one world of two, nor may we Count one life more than one. Could we go back To the old garden' . . . Was it you who said it, Or was it Bors? He was always saying something. It may have been Bors." She was not looking then At Lancelot; she was looking at her fingers In her old way, as to be sure again How many of them she had. He looked at her, Without the power to smile, and for the time Forgot that he was Lancelot: "Is it fair For you to drag that back, out of its grave, And hold it up like this for the small feast Of a small pride?" "Yes, fair enough for a woman," Guinevere said, not seeing his eyes. "How long Do you conceive the Queen of the Christian world Would hide herself in France . . ." "Why do you pause? I said it; I remember when I said it; And it was not today. Why in the name Of grief should we hide anywhere? Bells and banners Are not for our occasion, but in France There may be sights and silences more fair Than pageants. There are seas of difference Between this land and France, albeit to cross them COLLECTED POEMS Were no immortal voyage, had you an eye For France that you had once." "I have no eye Today for France, I shall have none tomorrow; And you will have no eye for France tomorrow. Fatigue and loneliness, and your poor dream Of what I was, have led you to forget. When you have had your time to think and see A little more, then you will see as I do; And if you see France, I shall not be there, Save as a memory there. We are done, you and I, With what we were. `Could we go back again, The fruit that we should find'—but you know best What we should find. I am sorry for what I said; But a light word, though it cut one we love, May save ourselves the pain of a worse wound. We are all women. When you see one woman— When you see me—before you in your fancy, See me all white and gold, as I was once. I shall not harm you then; I shall not come Between you and the Gleam that you must follow, Whether you will or not. There is no place For me but where I am; there is no place For you save where it is that you are going. If I knew everything as I know that, I should know more than Merlin, who knew all, And long ago, that we are to know now. What more he knew he may not then have told The King, or anyone,—maybe not even himself; Though Vivian may know something by this time That he has told her. Have you wished, I wonder, That I was more like Vivian, or Isolt? The dark ones are more devious and more famous, LANCELOT And men fall down more numerously before them— Although I think more men get up again, And go away again, than away from us. If I were dark, I might say otherwise. Try to be glad, even if you are sorry, That I was not born dark; for I was not. For me there was no dark until it came When the King came, and with his heavy shadow Put out the sun that you made shine again Before I was to die. So I forgive The faggots; I can do no more than that— For you, or God." She looked away from him And in the casement saw the sunshine dying: "The time that we have left will soon be gone; When the bell rings, it rings for you to go, But not for me to go. It rings for me To stay—and pray. I, who have not prayed much, May as well pray now. I have not what you have To make me see, though I shall have, sometime, A new light of my own. I saw in the Tower, When all was darkest and I may have dreamed, A light that gave to men the eyes of Time To read themselves in silence. Then it faded, And the men faded. I was there alone. I shall not have what you have, or much else— In this place. I shall see in other places What is not here. I shall not be alone. And I shall tell myself that you are seeing All that I cannot see. For the time now, What most I see is that I had no choice, And that you came to me. How many years Of purgatory shall I pay God for saying This to you here?" Her words came slowly out, And her mouth shook. COLLECTED POEMS He took her two small hands That were so pale and empty, and so cold: "Poor child, I said too much and heard too little Of what I said. But when I found you here, So different, so alone, I would have given My soul to be a chattel and a gage For dicing fiends to play for, could so doing Have brought one summer back." "When they are gone," She said, with grateful sadness in her eyes, "We do not bring them back, or buy them back, Even with our souls. I see now it is best We do not buy them back, even with our souls." A slow and hollow bell began to sound Somewhere above them, and the world became For Lancelot one wan face—Guinevere's face. "When the bell rings, it rings for you to go," She said; "and you are going . . . I am not. Think of me always as I used to be, All white and gold—for that was what you called me. You may see gold again when you are gone; And I shall not be there."—He drew her nearer To kiss the quivering lips that were before him For the last time. "No, not again," she said; "I might forget that I am not alone . . . I shall not see you in this world again, But I am not alone. No, . . . not alone. We have had all there was, and you were kind— Even when you tried so hard once to be cruel. I knew it then . . . or now I do. Good-bye." He crushed her cold white hands and saw them falling Away from him like flowers into a grave. LANCELOT When she looked up to see him, he was gone; And that was all she saw till she awoke In her white cell, where the nuns carried her With many tears and many whisperings. "She was the Queen, and he was Lancelot," One said. "They were great lovers. It is not good To know too much of love. We who love God Alone are happiest. Is it not so, Mother?"— "We who love God alone, my child, are safest," The Mother replied; "and we are not all safe Until we are all dead. We watch, and pray." Outside again, Lancelot heard the sound Of reapers he had seen. With lighter tread He walked away to them to see them nearer; He walked and heard again the sound of thrushes Far off. He saw below him, stilled with yellow, A world that was not Arthur's, and he saw The convent roof; and then he could see nothing But a wan face and two dim lonely hands That he had left behind. They were down there, Somewhere, her poor white face and hands, alone. "No man was ever alone like that," he thought, Not knowing what last havoc pity and love Had still to wreak on wisdom. Gradually, In one long wave it whelmed him, and then broke— Leaving him like a lone man on a reef, Staring for what had been with him, but now Was gone and was a white face under the sea, Alive there, and alone—always alone. He closed his eyes, and the white face was there, But not the gold. The gold would not come back. There were gold fields of corn that lay around him, But they were not the gold of Guinevere— Though men had once, for sake of saying words, COLLECTED POEMS Prattled of corn about it. The still face Was there, and the blue eyes that looked at him Through all the stillness of all distances; And he could see her lips, trying to say Again, "I am not alone." And that was all His life had said to him that he remembered While he sat there with his hands over his eyes, And his heart aching. When he rose again The reapers had gone home. Over the land Around him in the twilight there was rest. There was rest everywhere; and there was none That found his heart. "Why should I look for peace When I have made the world a ruin of war?" He muttered; and a Voice within him said: "Where the Light falls, death falls; a world has died For you, that a world may live. There is no peace. Be glad no man or woman bears for ever The burden of first days. There is no peace." A word stronger than his willed him away From Almesbury. All alone he rode that night, Under the stars, led by the living Voice That would not give him peace. Into the dark He rode, but not for Dover. Under the stars, Alone, all night he rode, out of a world That was not his, or the King's; and in the night He felt a burden lifted as he rode, While he prayed he might bear it for the sake Of a still face before him that was fading, Away in a white loneliness. He made, Once, with groping hand as if to touch it, But a black branch of leaves was all he found. Now the still face was dimmer than before, And it was not so near him. He gazed hard, LANCELOT But through his tears he could not see it now; And when the tears were gone he could see only That all he saw was fading, always fading; And she was there alone. She was the world That he was losing; and the world he sought Was all a tale for those who had been living, And had not lived. Once even he turned his horse, And would have brought his army back with him To make her free. They should be free together. But the Voice within him said: "You are not free. You have come to the world's end, and it is best You are not free. Where the Light falls, death falls; And in the darkness comes the Light." He turned Again; and he rode on, under the stars, Out of the world, into he knew not what, Until a vision chilled him and he saw, Now as in Camelot, long ago in the garden, The face of Galahad who had seen and died, And was alive, now in a mist of gold. He rode on into the dark, under the stars, And there were no more faces. There was nothing. But always in the darkness he rode on, Alone; and in the darkness came the Light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THREE TAVERNS (1920) To Thomas Sergeant Perry and Lilla Cabot Perry THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW There were faces to remember in the Valley of the Shadow, There were faces unregarded, there were faces to forget; There were fires of grief and fear that are a few forgotten ashes, There were sparks of recognition that are not forgotten yet. For at first, with an amazed and overwhelming indignation At a measureless malfeasance that obscurely willed it thus, They were lost and unacquainted—till they found themselves in others, Who had groped as they were groping where dim ways were perilous. There were lives that were as dark as are the fears and intuitions Of a child who knows himself and is alone with what he knows; There were pensioners of dreams and there were debtors of illusions, All to fail before the triumph of a weed that only grows. There were thirsting heirs of golden sieves that held not wine or water, And had no names in traffic or more value there than toys: There were blighted sons of wonder in the Valley of the Shadow, Where they suffered and still wondered why their wonder made no noise. There were slaves who dragged the shackles of a precedent unbroken, Demonstrating the fulfilment of unalterable schemes, Which had been, before the cradle, Time's inexorable tenants Of what were now the dusty ruins of their father's dreams. COLLECTED POEMS There were these, and there were many who had stumbled up to manhood, Where they saw too late the road they should have taken long ago: There were thwarted clerks and fiddlers in the Valley of the Shadow, The commemorative wreckage of what others did not know. And there were daughters older than the mothers who had borne them, Being older in their wisdom, which is older than the earth; And they were going forward only farther into darkness, Unrelieved as were the blasting obligations of their birth; And among them, giving always what was not for their possession, There were maidens, very quiet, with no quiet in their eyes; There were daughters of the silence in the Valley of the Shadow, Each an isolated item in the family sacrifice. There were creepers among catacombs where dull regrets were torches, Giving light enough to show them what was there upon the shelves— Where there was more for them to see than pleasure would remember Of something that had been alive and once had been themselves. There were some who stirred the ruins with a solid imprecation, While as many fled repentance for the promise of despair: There were drinkers of wrong waters in the Valley of the Shadow, And all the sparkling ways were dust that once had led them there. There were some who knew the steps of Age incredibly beside them, THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW And his fingers upon shoulders that had never felt the wheel; And their last of empty trophies was a gilded cup of nothing, Which a contemplating vagabond would not have come to steal. Long and often had they figured for a larger valuation, But the size of their addition was the balance of a doubt: There were gentlemen of leisure in the Valley of the Shadow, Not allured by retrospection, disenchanted, and played out. And among the dark endurances of unavowed reprisals There were silent eyes of envy that saw little but saw well; And over beauty's aftermath of hazardous ambitions There were tears for what had vanished as they vanished where they fell. Not assured of what was theirs, and always hungry for the nameless, There were some whose only passion was for Time who made them cold: There were numerous fair women in the Valley of the Shadow, Dreaming rather less of heaven than of hell when they were old. Now and then, as if to scorn the common touch of common sorrow, There were some who gave a few the distant pity of a smile; And another cloaked a soul as with an ash of human embers, Having covered thus a treasure that would last him for a while. There were many by the presence of the many disaffected, Whose exemption was included in the weight that others bore: There were seekers after darkness in the Valley of the Shadow, And they alone were there to find what they were looking for. So they were, and so they are; and as they came are coming others, And among them are the fearless and the meek and the unborn; And a question that has held us heretofore without an answer May abide without an answer until all have ceased to mourn. COLLECTED POEMS For the children of the dark are more to name than are the wretched, Or the broken, or the weary, or the baffled, or the shamed: There are builders of new mansions in the Valley of the Shadow, And among them are the dying and the blinded and the maimed. THE WANDERING JEW I saw by looking in his eyes That they remembered everything; And this was how I came to know That he was here, still wandering. For though the figure and the scene Were never to be reconciled, I knew the man as I had known His image when I was a child. With evidence at every turn, I should have held it safe to guess That all the newness of New York Had nothing new in loneliness; Yet here was one who might be Noah, Or Nathan, or Abimelech, Or Lamech, out of ages lost,— Or, more than all, Melchizedek. Assured that he was none of these, I gave them back their names again, To scan once more those endless eyes Where all my questions ended then. I found in them what they revealed That I shall not live to forget, THE WANDERING JEW And wondered if they found in mine Compassion that I might regret. Pity, I learned, was not the least Of time's offending benefits That had now for so long impugned The conservation of his wits: Rather it was that I should yield, Alone, the fealty that presents The tribute of a tempered ear To an untempered eloquence. Before I pondered long enough On whence he came and who he was, I trembled at his ringing wealth Of manifold anathemas; I wondered, while he seared the world, What new defection ailed the race, And if it mattered how remote Our fathers were from such a place. Before there was an hour for me To contemplate with less concern The crumbling realm awaiting us Than his that was beyond return, A dawning on the dust of years Had shaped with an elusive light Mirages of remembered scenes That were no longer for the sight. For now the gloom that hid the man Became a daylight on his wrath, And one wherein my fancy viewed New lions ramping in his path. The old were dead and had no fangs, COLLECTED POEMS Wherefore he loved them—seeing not They were the same that in their time Had eaten everything they caught. The world around him was a gift Of anguish to his eyes and ears, And one that he had long reviled As fit for devils, not for seers. Where, then, was there a place for him That on this other side of death Saw nothing good, as he had seen No good come out of Nazareth? Yet here there was a reticence, And I believe his only one, That hushed him as if he beheld A Presence that would not be gone. In such a silence he confessed How much there was to be denied; And he would look at me and live, As others might have looked and died. As if at last he knew again That he had always known, his eyes Were like to those of one who gazed On those of One who never dies. For such a moment he revealed What life has in it to be lost; And I could ask if what I saw, Before me there, was man or ghost. He may have died so many times That all there was of him to see Was pride, that kept itself alive As too rebellious to be free; NEIGHBORS He may have told, when more than once Humility seemed imminent, How many a lonely time in vain The Second Coming came and went. Whether he still defies or not The failure of an angry task That relegates him out of time To chaos, I can only ask. But as I knew him, so he was; And somewhere among men to-day Those old, unyielding eyes may flash, And flinch—and look the other way. NEIGHBORS As often as we thought of her, We thought of a gray life That made a quaint economist Of a wolf-haunted wife; We made the best of all she bore That was not ours to bear, And honored her for wearing things That were not things to wear. There was a distance in her look That made us look again; And if she smiled, we might believe That we had looked in vain. Rarely she came inside our doors, And had not long to stay; And when she left, it seemed somehow That she was far away. COLLECTED POEMS At last, when we had all forgot That all is here to change, A shadow on the commonplace Was for a moment strange. Yet there was nothing for surprise, Nor much that need be told: Love, with his gift of pain, had given More than one heart could hold. THE MILL The miller's wife had waited long, The tea was cold, the fire was dead; And there might yet be nothing wrong In how he went and what he said: "There are no millers any more," Was all that she had heard him say; And he had lingered at the door So long that it seemed yesterday. Sick with a fear that had no form She knew that she was there at last; And in the mill there was a warm And mealy fragrance of the past. What else there was would only seem To say again what he had meant; And what was hanging from a beam Would not have heeded where she went. And if she thought it followed her, She may have reasoned in the dark That one way of the few there were Would hide her and would leave no mark: THE THREE TAVERNS Black water, smooth above the weir Like starry velvet in the night, Though ruffled once, would soon appear The same as ever to the sight. THE DARK HILLS Dark hills at evening in the west, Where sunset hovers like a sound Of golden horns that sang to rest Old bones of warriors under ground, Far now from all the bannered ways Where flash the legions of the sun, You fade—as if the last of days Were fading, and all wars were done. THE THREE TAVERNS When the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and The Three Taverns. (Acts xxviii, 15) Herodion, Apelles, Amplias, And Andronicus? Is it you I see— At last? And is it you now that are gazing As if in doubt of me? Was I not saying That I should come to Rome? I did say that; And I said furthermore that I should go On westward, where the gateway of the world Lets in the central sea. I did say that, But I say only, now, that I am Paul— COLLECTED POEMS A prisoner of the Law, and of the Lord A voice made free. If there be time enough To live, I may have more to tell you then Of western matters. I go now to Rome, Where Cæsar waits for me, and I shall wait, And Cæsar knows how long. In Cæsarea There was a legend of Agrippa saying In a light way to Festus, having heard My deposition, that I might be free, Had I stayed free of Cæsar; but the word Of God would have it as you see it is— And here I am. The cup that I shall drink Is mine to drink—the moment or the place Not mine to say. If it be now in Rome, Be it now in Rome; and if your faith exceed The shadow cast of hope, say not of me Too surely or too soon that years and shipwreck, And all the many deserts I have crossed That are not named or regioned, have undone Beyond the brevities of our mortal healing The part of me that is the least of me. You see an older man than he who fell Prone to the earth when he was nigh Damascus, Where the great light came down; yet I am he That fell, and he that saw, and he that heard. And I am here, at last; and if at last I give myself to make another crumb For this pernicious feast of time and men— Well, I have seen too much of time and men To fear the ravening or the wrath of either. Yes, it is Paul you see—the Saul of Tarsus That was a fiery Jew, and had men slain For saying Something was beyond the Law, And in ourselves. I fed my suffering soul THE THREE TAVERNS Upon the Law till I went famishing, Not knowing that I starved. How should I know, More then than any, that the food I had— What else it may have been—was not for me? My fathers and their fathers and their fathers Had found it good, and said there was no other, And I was of the line. When Stephen fell, Among the stones that crushed his life away, There was no place alive that I could see For such a man. Why should a man be given To live beyond the Law? So I said then, As men say now to me. How then do I Persist in living? Is that what you ask? If so, let my appearance be for you No living answer; for Time writes of death On men before they die, and what you see Is not the man. The man that you see not— The man within the man—is most alive; Though hatred would have ended, long ago, The bane of his activities. I have lived, Because the faith within me that is life Endures to live, and shall, till soon or late, Death, like a friend unseen, shall say to me My toil is over and my work begun. How often, and how many a time again, Have I said I should be with you in Rome! He who is always coming never comes, Or comes too late, you may have told yourselves; And I may tell you now that after me, Whether I stay for little or for long, The wolves are coming. Have an eye for them, And a more careful ear for their confusion Than you need have much longer for the sound Of what I tell you—should I live to say COLLECTED POEMS More than I say to Cæsar. What I know Is down for you to read in what is written; And if I cloud a little with my own Mortality the gleam that is immortal, I do it only because I am I— Being on earth and of it, in so far As time flays yet the remnant. This you know; And if I sting men, as I do sometimes, With a sharp word that hurts, it is because Man's habit is to feel before he sees; And I am of a race that feels. Moreover, The world is here for what is not yet here For more than are a few; and even in Rome, Where men are so enamored of the Cross That fame has echoed, and increasingly, The music of your love and of your faith To foreign ears that are as far away As Antioch and Haran, yet I wonder How much of love you know, and if your faith Be the shut fruit of words. If so, remember Words are but shells unfilled. Jews have at least A Law to make them sorry they were born If they go long without it; and these Gentiles, For the first time in shrieking history, Have love and law together, if so they will, For their defense and their immunity In these last days. Rome, if I know the name, Will have anon a crown of thorns and fire Made ready for the wreathing of new masters, Of whom we are appointed, you and I,— And you are still to be when I am gone, Should I go presently. Let the word fall, Meanwhile, upon the dragon-ridden field Of circumstance, either to live or die; Concerning which there is a parable, THE THREE TAVERNS Made easy for the comfort and attention Of those who preach, fearing they preach in vain. You are to plant, and then to plant again Where you have gathered, gathering as you go; For you are in the fields that are eternal, And you have not the burden of the Lord Upon your mortal shoulders. What you have Is a light yoke, made lighter by the wearing, Till it shall have the wonder and the weight Of a clear jewel, shining with a light Wherein the sun and all the fiery stars May soon be fading. When Gamaliel said That if they be of men these things are nothing But if they be of God, they are for none To overthrow, he spoke as a good Jew, And one who stayed a Jew; and he said all. And you know, by the temper of your faith, How far the fire is in you that I felt Before I knew Damascus. A word here, Or there, or not there, or not anywhere, Is not the Word that lives and is the life; And you, therefore, need weary not yourselves With jealous aches of others. If the world Were not a world of aches and innovations, Attainment would have no more joy of it. There will be creeds and schisms, creeds in creeds, And schisms in schisms; myriads will be done To death because a farthing has two sides, And is at last a farthing. Telling you this, I, who bid men to live, appeal to Cæsar. Once I had said the ways of God were dark, Meaning by that the dark ways of the Law. Such is the Glory of our tribulations; For the Law kills the flesh that kills the Law, And we are then alive. We have eyes then; COLLECTED POEMS And we have then the Cross between two worlds— To guide us, or to blind us for a time, Till we have eyes indeed. The fire that smites A few on highways, changing all at once, Is not for all. The power that holds the world Away from God that holds himself away— Farther away than all your works and words Are like to fly without the wings of faith— Was not, nor ever shall be, a small hazard Enlivening the ways of easy leisure Or the cold road of knowledge. When our eyes Have wisdom, we see more than we remember; And the old world of our captivities May then become a smitten glimpse of ruin, Like one where vanished hewers have had their day Of wrath on Lebanon. Before we see, Meanwhile, we suffer; and I come to you, At last, through many storms and through much night. Yet whatsoever I have undergone, My keepers in this instance are not hard. But for the chance of an ingratitude, I might indeed be curious of their mercy, And fearful of their leisure while I wait, A few leagues out of Rome. Men go to Rome, Not always to return—but not that now. Meanwhile, I seem to think you look at me With eyes that are at last more credulous Of my identity. You remark in me No sort of leaping giant, though some words Of mine to you from Corinth may have leapt A little through your eyes into your soul. I trust they were alive, and are alive Today; for there be none that shall indite So much of nothing as the man of words THE THREE TAVERNS Who writes in the Lord's name for his name's sake And has not in his blood the fire of time To warm eternity. Let such a man— If once the light is in him and endures— Content himself to be the general man, Set free to sift the decencies and thereby To learn, except he be one set aside For sorrow, more of pleasure than of pain; Though if his light be not the light indeed, But a brief shine that never really was, And fails, leaving him worse than where he was, Then shall he be of all men destitute. And here were not an issue for much ink, Or much offending faction among scribes. The Kingdom is within us, we are told; And when I say to you that we possess it In such a measure as faith makes it ours, I say it with a sinner's privilege Of having seen and heard, and seen again, After a darkness; and if I affirm To the last hour that faith affords alone The Kingdom entrance and an entertainment, I do not see myself as one who says To man that he shall sit with folded hands Against the Coming. If I be anything, I move a driven agent among my kind, Establishing by the faith of Abraham, And by the grace of their necessities, The clamoring word that is the word of life Nearer than heretofore to the solution Of their tomb-serving doubts. If I have loosed A shaft of language that has flown sometimes A little higher than the hearts and heads Of nature's minions, it will yet be heard, COLLECTED POEMS Like a new song that waits for distant ears. I cannot be the man that I am not; And while I own that earth is my affliction, I am a man of earth, who says not all To all alike. That were impossible. Even as it were so that He should plant A larger garden first. But you today Are for the larger sowing; and your seed, A little mixed, will have, as He foresaw, The foreign harvest of a wider growth, And one without an end. Many there are, And are to be, that shall partake of it, Though none may share it with an understanding That is not his alone. We are all alone; And yet we are all parcelled of one order— Jew, Gentile, or barbarian in the dark Of wildernesses that are not so much As names yet in a book. And there are many, Finding at last that words are not the Word, And finding only that, will flourish aloft, Like heads of captured Pharisees on pikes, Our contradictions and discrepancies; And there are many more will hang themselves Upon the letter, seeing not in the Word The friend of all who fail, and in their faith A sword of excellence to cut them down. As long as there are glasses that are dark— And there are many—we see darkly through them; All which have I conceded and set down In words that have no shadow. What is dark Is dark, and we may not say otherwise; Yet what may be as dark as a lost fire For one of us, may still be for another A coming gleam across the gulf of ages, THE THREE TAVERNS And a way home from shipwreck to the shore; And so, through pangs and ills and desperations, There may be light for all. There shall be light. As much as that, you know. You cannot say This woman or that man will be the next On whom it falls; you are not here for that. You ministration is to be for others The firing of a rush that may for them Be soon the fire itself. The few at first Are fighting for the multitude at last; Therefore remember what Gamaliel said Before you, when the sick were lying down In streets all night for Peter's passing shadow. Fight, and say what you feel; say more than words. Give men to know that even their days of earth To come are more than ages that are gone. Say what you feel, while you have time to say it. Eternity will answer for itself, Without your intercession; yet the way For many is a long one, and as dark, Meanwhile, as dreams of hell. See not your toil Too much, and if I be away from you, Think of me as a brother to yourselves, Of many blemishes. Beware of stoics, And give your left hand to grammarians; And when you seem, as many a time you may, To have no other friend than hope, remember That you are not the first, or yet the last. The best of life, until we see beyond The shadows of ourselves (and they are less Than even the blindest of indignant eyes Would have them) is in what we do not know. Make, then, for all your fears a place to sleep With all your faded sins; nor think yourselves COLLECTED POEMS Egregious and alone for your defects Of youth and yesterday. I was young once; And there's a question if you played the fool With a more fervid and inherent zeal Than I have in my story to remember, Or gave your necks to folly's conquering foot, Or flung yourselves with an unstudied aim, More frequently than I. Never mind that. Man's little house of days will hold enough, Sometimes, to make him wish it were not his, But it will not hold all. Things that are dead Are best without it, and they own their death By virtue of their dying. Let them go,— But think you not the world is ashes yet, And you have all the fire. The world is here Today, and it may not be gone tomorrow; For there are millions, and there may be more, To make in turn a various estimation Of its old ills and ashes, and the traps Of its apparent wrath. Many with ears That hear not yet, shall have ears given to them, And then they shall hear strangely. Many with eyes That are incredulous of the Mystery Shall yet be driven to feel, and then to read Where language has an end and is a veil, Not woven of our words. Many that hate Their kind are soon to know that without love Their faith is but the perjured name of nothing. I that have done some hating in my time See now no time for hate; I that have left, Fading behind me like familiar lights That are to shine no more for my returning, Home, friends, and honors,—I that have lost all else For wisdom, and the wealth of it, say now To you that out of wisdom has come love, DEMOS That measures and is of itself the measure Of works and hope and faith. Your longest hours Are not so long that you may torture them And harass not yourselves; and the last days Are on the way that you prepare for them, And was prepared for you, here in a world Where you have sinned and suffered, striven and seen. If you be not so hot for counting them Before they come that you consume yourselves, Peace may attend you all in these last days— And me, as well as you. Yes, even in Rome. Well, I have talked and rested, though I fear My rest has not been yours; in which event, Forgive one who is only seven leagues From Cæsar. When I told you I should come, I did not see myself the criminal You contemplate, for seeing beyond the Law That which the Law saw not. But this, indeed, Was good of you, and I shall not forget; No, I shall not forget you came so far To meet a man so dangerous. Well, farewell. They come to tell me I am going now— With them. I hope that we shall meet again, But none may say what he shall find in Rome. DEMOS I All you that are enamored of my name And least intent on what most I require, Beware; for my design and your desire, Deplorably, are not as yet the same. COLLECTED POEMS Beware, I say, the failure and the shame Of losing that for which you now aspire So blindly, and of hazarding entire The gift that I was bringing when I came. Give as I will, I cannot give you sight Whereby to see that with you there are some To lead you, and be led. But they are dumb Before the wrangling and the shrill delight Of your deliverance that has not come, And shall not, if I fail you—as I might. II So little have you seen of what awaits Your fevered glimpse of a democracy Confused and foiled with an equality Not equal to the envy it creates, That you see not how near you are the gates Of an old king who listens fearfully To you that are outside and are to be The noisy lords of imminent estates. Rather be then your prayer that you shall have Your kingdom undishonored. Having all, See not the great among you for the small, But hear their silence; for the few shall save The many, or the many are to fall— Still to be wrangling in a noisy grave. THE FLYING DUTCHMAN Unyielding in the pride of his defiance, Afloat with none to serve or to command, TACT Lord of himself at last, and all by Science, He seeks the Vanished Land. Alone, by the one light of his one thought, He steers to find the shore from which we came, Fearless of in what coil he may be caught On seas that have no name. Into the night he sails; and after night There is a dawning, though there be no sun; Wherefore, with nothing but himself in sight, Unsighted, he sails on. At last there is a lifting of the cloud Between the flood before him and the sky; And then—though he may curse the Power aloud That has no power to die— He steers himself away from what is haunted By the old ghost of what has been before,— Abandoning, as always, and undaunted, One fog-walled island more. TACT Observant of the way she told So much of what was true, No vanity could long withhold Regard that was her due: She spared him the familiar guile, So easily achieved, That only made a man to smile And left him undeceived. COLLECTED POEMS Aware that all imagining Of more than what she meant Would urge an end of everything, He stayed; and when he went, They parted with a merry word That was to him as light As any that was ever heard Upon a starry night. She smiled a little, knowing well That he would not remark That ruins of a day that fell Around her in the dark: He saw no ruins anywhere, Nor fancied there were scars On anyone who lingered there, Alone below the stars. ON THE WAY (Philadelphia, 1794) Note.—The following imaginary dialogue between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, which is not based upon any specific incident in American history, may be supposed to have occurred a few months previous to Hamilton's retirement from Washington's Cabinet in 1795 and a few years before the political ingenuities of Burr—who has been characterized, without much exaggeration, as the inventor of American politics—began to be conspicuously formidable to the Federalists. These activities on the part of Burr resulted, as the reader will remember, in the Burr-Jefferson tie for the Presidency in 1800, and finally in the Burr-Hamilton duel at Weehawken in 1804. Burr Hamilton, if he rides you down, remember That I was here to speak, and so to save ON THE WAY Your fabric from catastrophe. That's good; For I perceive that you observe him also. A President, a-riding of his horse, May dust a General and be forgiven; But why be dusted—when we're all alike, All equal, and all happy? Here he comes— And there he goes. And we, by your new patent, Would seem to be two kings here by the wayside, With our two hats off to his Excellency. Why not his Majesty, and done with it? Forgive me if I shook your meditation, But you that weld our credit should have eyes To see what's coming. Bury me first if I do. Hamilton There's always in some pocket of your brain A care for me; wherefore my gratitude For your attention is commensurate With your concern. Yes, Burr, we are two kings; We are as royal as two ditch-diggers; But owe me not your sceptre. These are the days When first a few seem all; but if we live We may again be seen to be the few That we have always been. These are the days When men forget the stars, and are forgotten. Burr But why forget them? They're the same that winked Upon the world when Alcibiades Cut off his dog's tail to induce distinction. There are dogs yet, and Alcibiades Is not forgotten. COLLECTED POEMS Hamilton Yes, there are dogs enough, God knows; and I can hear them in my dreams. Burr Never a doubt. But what you hear the most Is your new music, something out of tune With your intention. How in the name of Cain, I seem to hear you ask, are men to dance, When all men are musicians. Tell me that, I hear you saying, and I'll tell you the name Of Samson's mother. But why shroud yourself Before the coffin comes? For all you know, The tree that is to fall for your last house Is now a sapling. You may have to wait So long as to be sorry; though I doubt it, For you are not at home in your new Eden Where chilly whispers of a likely frost Accumulate already in the air. I think a touch of ermine, Hamilton, Would be for you in your autumnal mood A pleasant sort of warmth along the shoulders. Hamilton If so it is you think, you may as well Give over thinking. We are done with ermine. What I fear most is not the multitude, But those who are to loop it with a string That has one end in France and one end here. I'm not so fortified with observation That I could swear that more than half a score Among us who see lightning see that ruin Is not the work of thunder. Since the world ON THE WAY Was ordered, there was never a long pause For caution between doing and undoing. Burr Go on, sir; my attention is a trap Set for the catching of all compliments To Monticello, and all else abroad That has a name or an identity. Hamilton I leave to you the names—there are too many; Yet one there is to sift and hold apart, As now I see. There comes at last a glimmer That is not always clouded, or too late. But I was near and young, and had the reins To play with while he manned a team so raw That only God knows where the end had been Of all that riding without Washington. There was a nation in the man who passed us, If there was not a world. I may have driven Since then some restive horses, and alone, And through a splashing of abundant mud; But he who made the dust that sets you on To coughing, made the road. Now it seems dry, And in a measure safe. Burr Here's a new tune From Hamilton. Has your caution all at once, And over night, grown till it wrecks the cradle? I have forgotten what my father said When I was born, but there's a rustling of it Among my memories, and it makes a noise COLLECTED POEMS About as loud as all that I have held And fondled heretofore of your same caution. But that's affairs, not feelings. If our friends Guessed half we say of them, our enemies Would itch in our friends' jackets. Howsoever, The world is of a sudden on its head, And all are spilled—unless you cling alone With Washington. Ask Adams about that. Hamilton We'll not ask Adams about anything. We fish for lizards when we choose to ask For what we know already is not coming, And we must eat the answer. Where's the use Of asking when this man says everything, With all his tongues of silence? Burr I dare say. I dare say, but I won't. One of those tongues I'll borrow for the nonce. He'll never miss it. We mean his Western Majesty, King George. Hamilton I mean the man who rode by on his horse. I'll beg of you the meed of your indulgence If I should say this planet may have done A deal of weary whirling when at last, If ever, Time shall aggregate again A majesty like his that has a no name. Burr Then you concede his Majesty? That's good, And what of yours? Here are two majesties. ON THE WAY Favor the Left a little, Hamilton, Or you'll be floundering in the ditch that waits For riders who forget where they are riding. If we and France, as you anticipate, Must eat each other, what Cæsar, if not yourself, Do you see for the master of the feast? There may be a place waiting on your head For laurel thick as Nero's. You don't know. I have not crossed your glory, though I might If I saw thrones at auction. Hamilton Yes, you might. If war is on the way, I shall be—here; And I've no vision of your distant heels. Burr I see that I shall take an inference To bed with me to-night to keep me warm. I thank you, Hamilton, and I approve Your fealty to the aggregated greatness Of him you lean on while he leans on you. Hamilton This easy phrasing is a game of yours That you may win to lose. I beg your pardon, But you that have the sight will not employ The will to see with it. If you did so, There might be fewer ditches dug for others In your perspective; and there might be fewer Contemporary motes of prejudice Between you and the man who made the dust. Call him a genius or a gentleman, COLLECTED POEMS A prophet or a builder, or what not, But hold your disposition off the balance, And weigh him in the light. Once (I believe I tell you nothing new to your surmise, Or to the tongues of towns and villages) I nourished with an adolescent fancy— Surely forgivable to you, my friend— An innocent and amiable conviction That I was, by the grace of honest fortune, A savior at his elbow through the war, Where I might have observed, more than I did, Patience and wholesome passion. I was there, And for such honor I gave nothing worse Than some advice at which he may have smiled. I must have given a modicum besides, Or the rough interval between those days And these would never have made for me my friends, Or enemies. I should be something somewhere— I say not what—but I should not be here If he had not been there. Possibly, too, You might not—or that Quaker with his cane. Burr Possibly, too, I should. When the Almighty Rides a white horse, I fancy we shall know it. Hamilton It was a man, Burr, that was in my mind; No god, or ghost, or demon—only a man: A man whose occupation is the need Of those who would not feel it if it bit them; And one who shapes an age while he endures The pin pricks of inferiorities; A cautious man, because he is but one; ON THE WAY A lonely man, because he is a thousand. No marvel you are slow to find in him The genius that is one spark or is nothing: His genius is a flame that he must hold So far above the common heads of men That they may view him only through the mist Of their defect, and wonder what he is. It seems to me the mystery that is in him That makes him only more to me a man Than any other I have ever known. Burr I grant you that his worship is a man. I'm not so much at home with mysteries, May be, as you—so leave him with his fire: God knows that I shall never put it out. He has not made a cripple of himself In his pursuit of me, though I have heard His condescension honors me with parts. Parts make a whole, if we've enough of them; And once I figured a sufficiency To be at least an atom in the annals Of your republic. But I must have erred. Hamilton You smile as if your spirit lived at ease With error. I should not have named it so, Failing assent from you; nor, if I did, Should I be so complacent in my skill To comb the tangled language of the people As to be sure of anything in these days. Put that much in account with modesty. COLLECTED POEMS Burr What in the name of Ahab, Hamilton, Have you, in the last region of your dreaming, To do with "people"? You may be the devil In your dead-reckoning of what reefs and shoals Are waiting on the progress of our ship Unless you steer it, but you'll find it irksome Alone there in the stern; and some warm day There'll be an inland music in the rigging, And afterwards on deck. I'm not affined Or favored overmuch at Monticello, But there's a mighty swarming of new bees About the premises, and all have wings. If you hear something buzzing before long, Be thoughtful how you strike, remembering also There was a fellow Naboth had a vineyard, And Ahab cut his hair off and went softly. Hamilton I don't remember that he cut his hair off. Burr Somehow I rather fancy that he did. If so, it's in the Book; and if not so, He did the rest, and did it handsomely. Hamilton Commend yourself to Ahab and his ways If they inveigle you to emulation; But where, if I may ask it, are you tending With your invidious wielding of the Scriptures? You call to mind an eminent archangel Who fell to make him famous. Would you fall So far as he, to be so far remembered? ON THE WAY Burr Before I fall or rise, or am an angel, I shall acquaint myself a little further With our new land's new language, which is not— Peace to your dreams—an idiom to your liking. I'm wondering if a man may always know How old a man may be at thirty-seven; I wonder likewise if a prettier time Could be decreed for a good man to vanish Than about now for you, before you fade, And even your friends are seeing that you have had Your cup too full for longer mortal triumph. Well, you have had enough, and had it young; And the old wine is nearer to the lees Than you are to the work that you are doing. Hamilton When does this philological excursion Into new lands and languages begin? Burr Anon—that is, already. Only Fortune Gave me this afternoon the benefaction Of your blue back, which I for love pursued, And in pursuing may have saved your life— Also the world a pounding piece of news: Hamilton bites the dust of Washington, Or rather of his horse. For you alone, Or for your fame, I'd wish it might have been so. Hamilton Not every man among us has a friend So jealous for the other's fame. How long COLLECTED POEMS Are you to diagnose the doubtful case Of Demos—and what for? Have you a sword For some new Damocles? If it's for me, I have lost all official appetite, And shall have faded, after January, Into the law. I'm going to New York. Burr No matter where you are, one of these days I shall come back to you and tell you something. This Demos, I have heard, has in his wrist A pulse that no two doctors have as yet Counted and found the same, and in his mouth A tongue that has the like alacrity For saying or not for saying what most it is That pullulates in his ignoble mind. One of these days I shall appear again, To tell you more of him and his opinions; I shall not be so long out of your sight, Or take myself so far, that I may not, Like Alcibiades, come back again. He went away to Phrygia, and fared ill. Hamilton There's an example in Themistocles: He went away to Persia, and fared well. Burr So? Must I go so far? And if so, why so? I had not planned it so. Is this the road I take? If so, farewell. Hamilton Quite so. Farewell. JOHN BROWN JOHN BROWN Though for your sake I would not have you now So near to me tonight as now you are, God knows how much a stranger to my heart Was any cold word that I may have written; And you, poor woman that I made my wife, You have had more of loneliness, I fear, Than I—though I have been the most alone, Even when the most attended. So it was God set the mark of his inscrutable Necessity on one that was to grope, And serve, and suffer, and withal be glad For what was his, and is, and is to be, When his old bones, that are a burden now, Are saying what the man who carried them Had not the power to say. Bones in a grave, Cover them as they will with choking earth, May shout the truth to men who put them there, More than all orators. And so, my dear, Since you have cheated wisdom for the sake Of sorrow, let your sorrow be for you, This last of nights before the last of days, The lying ghost of what there is of me That is the most alive. There is no death For me in what they do. Their death it is They should heed most when the sun comes again To make them solemn. There are some I know Whose eyes will hardly see their occupation, For tears in them—and all for one old man; For some of them will pity this old man, Who took upon himself the work of God Because he pitied millions. That will be For them, I fancy, their compassionate COLLECTED POEMS Best way of saying what is best in them To say; for they can say no more than that, And they can do no more than what the dawn Of one more day shall give them light enough To do. But there are many days to be, And there are many men to give their blood, As I gave mine for them. May they come soon! May they come soon, I say. And when they come, May all that I have said unheard be heard, Proving at last, or maybe not—no matter— What sort of madness was the part of me That made me strike, whether I found the mark Or missed it. Meanwhile, I've a strange content, A patience, and a vast indifference To what men say of me and what men fear To say. There was a work to be begun, And when the Voice, that I have heard so long, Announced as in a thousand silences An end of preparation, I began The coming work of death which is to be, That life may be. There is no other way Than the old way of war for a new land That will not know itself and is tonight A stranger to itself, and to the world A more prodigious upstart among states Than I was among men, and so shall be Till they are told and told, and told again; For men are children, waiting to be told, And most of them are children all their lives. The good God in his wisdom had them so, That now and then a madman or a seer May shake them out of their complacency And shame them into deeds. The major file See only what their fathers may have seen, JOHN BROWN Or may have said they saw when they saw nothing. I do not say it matters what they saw. Now and again to some lone soul or other God speaks, and there is hanging to be done,— As once there was a burning of our bodies Alive, albeit our souls were sorry fuel. But now the fires are few, and we are poised Accordingly, for the state's benefit, A few still minutes between heaven and earth. The purpose is, when they have seen enough Of what it is that they are not to see, To pluck me as an unripe fruit of treason, And then to fling me back to the same earth Of which they are, as I suppose, the flower— Not given to know the riper fruit that waits For a more comprehensive harvesting. Yes, may they come, and soon. Again I say, May they come soon!—before too many of them Shall be the bloody cost of our defection. When hell waits on the dawn of a new state, Better it were that hell should not wait long,— Or so it is I see it who should see As far or farther into time tonight Than they who talk and tremble for me now, Or wish me to those everlasting fires That are for me no fear. Too many fires Have sought me out and seared me to the bone— Thereby, for all I know, to temper me For what was mine to do. If I did ill What I did well, let men say I was mad; Or let my name for ever be a question That will not sleep in history. What men say I was will cool no cannon, dull no sword, Invalidate no truth. Meanwhile, I was; COLLECTED POEMS And the long train is lighted that shall burn, Though floods of wrath may drench it, and hot feet May stamp it for a slight time into smoke That shall blaze up again with growing speed, Until at last a fiery crash will come To cleanse and shake a wounded hemisphere, And heal it of a long malignity That angry time discredits and disowns. Tonight there are men saying many things; And some who see life in the last of me Will answer first the coming call to death; For death is what is coming, and then life. I do not say again for the dull sake Of speech what you have heard me say before, But rather for the sake of all I am, And all God made of me. A man to die As I do must have done some other work Than man's alone. I was not after glory, But there was glory with me, like a friend, Throughout those crippling years when friends were few, And fearful to be known by their own names When mine was vilified for their approval. Yet friends they are, and they did what was given Their will to do; they could have done no more. I was the one man mad enough, it seems, To do my work; and now my work is over. And you, my dear, are not to mourn for me, Or for your sons, more than a soul should mourn In Paradise, done with evil and with earth. There is not much of earth in what remains For you; and what there may be left of it For your endurance you shall have at last In peace, without the twinge of any fear For my condition; for I shall be done JOHN BROWN With plans and actions that have heretofore Made your days long and your nights ominous With darkness and the many distances That were between us. When the silence comes, I shall in faith be nearer to you then Than I am now in fact. What you see now Is only the outside of an old man, Older than years have made him. Let him die, And let him be a thing for little grief. There was a time for service and he served; And there is no more time for anything But a short gratefulness to those who gave Their scared allegiance to an enterprise That has the name of treason—which will serve As well as any other for the present. There are some deeds of men that have no names, And mine may like as not be one of them. I am not looking far for names tonight. The King of Glory was without a name Until men gave Him one; yet there He was, Before we found Him and affronted Him With numerous ingenuities of evil, Of which one, with His aid, is to be swept And washed out of the world with fire and blood. Once I believed it might have come to pass With a small cost of blood; but I was dreaming— Dreaming that I believed. The Voice I heard When I left you behind me in the north,— To wait there and to wonder and grow old Of loneliness,—told only what was best, And with a saving vagueness, I should know Till I knew more. And had I known even then— After grim years of search and suffering, So many of them to end as they began— COLLECTED POEMS After my sickening doubts and estimations Of plans abandoned and of new plans vain— After a weary delving everywhere For men with every virtue but the Vision— Could I have known, I say, before I left you That summer morning, all there was to know— Even unto the last consuming word That would have blasted every mortal answer As lightning would annihilate a leaf, I might have trembled on that summer morning; I might have wavered; and I might have failed. And there are many among men today To say of me that I had best have wavered. So has it been, so shall it always be, For those of us who give ourselves to die Before we are so parcelled and approved As to be slaughtered by authority. We do not make so much of what they say As they of what our folly says of us; They give us hardly time enough for that, And thereby we gain much by losing little. Few are alive to-day with less to lose Than I who tell you this, or more to gain; And whether I speak as one to be destroyed For no good end outside his own destruction, Time shall have more to say than men shall hear Between now and the coming of that harvest Which is to come. Before it comes, I go— By the short road that mystery makes long For man's endurance of accomplishment. I shall have more to say when I am dead. THE FALSE GODS THE FALSE GODS "We are false and evanescent, and aware of our deceit, From the straw that is our vitals to the clay that is our feet. You may serve us if you must, and you shall have your wage of ashes,— Though arrears due thereafter may be hard for you to meet. "You may swear that we are solid, you may say that we are strong, But we know that we are neither and we say that you are wrong; You may find an easy worship in acclaiming our indulgence, But your large admiration of us now is not for long. "If your doom is to adore us with a doubt that's never still, And you pray to see our faces—pray in earnest, and you will. You may gaze at us and live, and live assured of our confusion: For the False Gods are mortal, and are made for you to kill. "And you may as well observe, while apprehensively at ease With an Art that's inorganic and is anything you please, That anon your newest ruin may lie crumbling unregarded, Like an old shrine forgotten in a forest of new trees. "Howsoever like no other be the mode you may employ, There's an order in the ages for the ages to enjoy; Though the temples you are shaping and the passions you are singing Are a long way from Athens and a longer way from Troy. "When we promise more than ever of what never shall arrive, And you seem a little more than ordinarily alive, Make a note that you are sure you understand our obligations— For there's grief always auditing where two and two are five. COLLECTED POEMS "There was this for us to say and there was this for you to know, Though it humbles and it hurts us when we have to tell you so If you doubt the only truth in all our perjured composition, May the True Gods attend you and forget us when we go." ARCHIBALD'S EXAMPLE Old Archibald, in his eternal chair, Where trespassers, whatever their degree, Were soon frowned out again, was looking off Across the clover when he said to me: "My green hill yonder, where the sun goes down Without a scratch, was once inhabited By trees that injured him—an evil trash That made a cage, and held him while he bled. "Gone fifty years, I see them as they were Before they fell. They were a crooked lot To spoil my sunset, and I saw no time In fifty years for crooked things to rot. "Trees, yes; but not a service or a joy To God or man, for they were thieves of light. So down they came. Nature and I looked on, And we were glad when they were out of sight. "Trees are like men, sometimes; and that being so, So much for that." He twinkled in his chair, And looked across the clover to the place That he remembered when the trees were there. LONDON BRIDGE LONDON BRIDGE "Do I hear them? Yes, I hear the children singing—and what of it? Have you come with eyes afire to find me now and ask me that? If I were not their father and if you were not their mother, We might believe they made a noise. . . . What are you— driving at!" "Well, be glad that you can hear them, and be glad they are so near us,— For I have heard the stars of heaven, and they were nearer still. All within an hour it is that I have heard them calling, And though I pray for them to cease, I know they never will; For their music on my heart, though you may freeze it, will fall always, Like summer snow that never melts upon a mountain-top. Do you hear them? Do you hear them overhead—the children —singing? Do you hear the children singing? . . . God, will you make them stop!" "And what now in His holy name have you to do with mountains? We're back to town again, my dear, and we've a dance tonight. Frozen hearts and falling music? Snow and stars, and—what the devil! Say it over to me slowly, and be sure you have it right." `God knows if I be right or wrong in saying what I tell you, Or if I know the meaning any more of what I say. All I know is, it will kill me if I try to keep it hidden— Well, I met him. . . . Yes. I met him, and I talked with him— today." COLLECTED POEMS "You met him? Did you meet the ghost of someone you had poisoned, Long ago, before I knew you for the woman that you are? Take a chair; and don't begin your stories always in the middle. Was he man, or was he demon? Anyhow, you've gone too far To go back, and I'm your servant. I'm the lord, but you're the master. Now go on with what you know, for I'm excited." "Do you mean— Do you mean to make me try to think that you know less than I do?" "I know that you foreshadow the beginning of a scene. Pray be careful, and as accurate as if the doors of heaven Were to swing or to stay bolted from now on for evermore." "Do you conceive, with all your smooth contempt of every feeling, Of hiding what you know and what you must have known before? Is it worth a woman's torture to stand here and have you smiling, With only your poor fetish of possession on your side? No thing but one is wholly sure, and that's not one to scare me; When I meet it I may say to God at last that I have tried. And yet, for all I know, or all I dare believe, my trials Henceforward will be more for you to bear than are your own; And you must give me keys of yours to rooms I have not entered. Do you see me on your threshold all my life, and there alone? Will you tell me where you see me in your fancy—when it leads you Far enough beyond the moment for a glance at the abyss?" LONDON BRIDGE "Will you tell me what intrinsic and amazing sort of nonsense You are crowding on the patience of the man who gives you— this? Look around you and be sorry you're not living in an attic, With a civet and a fish-net, and with you to pay the rent. I say words that you can spell without the use of all your letters; And I grant, if you insist, that I've a guess at what you meant." "Have I told you, then, for nothing, that I met him? Are you trying To be merry while you try to make me hate you?" "Think again, My dear, before you tell me, in a language unbecoming To a lady, what you plan to tell me next. If I complain, If I seem an atom peevish at the preference you mention— Or imply, to be precise—you may believe, or you may not, That I'm a trifle more aware of what he wants than you are. But I shouldn't throw that at you. Make believe that I forgot. Make believe that he's a genius, if you like,—but in the meantime Don't go back to rocking-horses. There, there, there, now." "Make believe! When you see me standing helpless on a plank above a whirlpool, Do I drown, or do I hear you when you say it? Make believe? How much more am I to say or do for you before I tell you That I met him! What's to follow now may be for you to choose. Do you hear me? Won't you listen? It's an easy thing to listen. . . ." "And it's easy to be crazy when there's everything to lose." COLLECTED POEMS "If at last you have a notion that I mean what I am saying, Do I seem to tell you nothing when I tell you I shall try? If you save me, and I lose him—I don't know—it won't much matter. I dare say that I've lied enough, but now I do not lie." "Do you fancy me the one man who has waited and said nothing While a wife has dragged an old infatuation from a tomb? Give the thing a little air and it will vanish into ashes. There you are—piff! presto!" "When I came into this room, It seemed as if I saw the place, and you there at your table, As you are now at this moment, for the last time in my life; And I told myself before I came to find you, `I shall tell him, If I can, what I have learned of him since I became his wife.' And if you say, as I've no doubt you will before I finish, That you have tried unceasingly, with all your might and main, To teach me, knowing more than I of what it was I needed, Don't think, with all you may have thought, that you have tried in vain; For you have taught me more than hides in all the shelves of knowledge Of how little you found that's in me and was in me all along. I believed, if I intruded nothing on you that I cared for, I'd be half as much as horses,—and it seems that I was wrong; I believed there was enough of earth in me, with all my nonsense Over things that made you sleepy, to keep something still awake; But you taught me soon to read my book, and God knows I have read it— Ages longer than an angel would have read it for your sake. I have said that you must open other doors than I have entered, LONDON BRIDGE But I wondered while I said it if I might not be obscure. Is there anything in all your pedigrees and inventories With a value more elusive than a dollar's? Are you sure That if I starve another year for you I shall be stronger To endure another like it—and another—till I'm dead?" "Has your tame cat sold a picture?—or more likely had a windfall? Or for God's sake, what's broke loose? Have you a bee-hive in your head? A little more of this from you will not be easy hearing Do you know that? Understand it, if you do; for if you won't. . . . What the devil are you saying! Make believe you never said it, And I'll say I never heard it. . . . Oh, you. . . . If you. . . ." "If I don't?" "There are men who say there's reason hidden somewhere in a woman, But I doubt if God himself remembers where the key was hung." "He may not; for they say that even God himself is growing. I wonder if He makes believe that He is growing young; I wonder if He makes believe that women who are giving All they have in holy loathing to a stranger all their lives Are the wise ones who build houses in the Bible. . . ." "Stop—you devil!" ". . . Or that souls are any whiter when their bodies are called wives. If a dollar's worth of gold will hoop the walls of hell together, Why need heaven be such a ruin of a place that never was? COLLECTED POEMS And if at last I lied my starving soul away to nothing, Are you sure you might not miss it? Have you come to such a pass That you would have me longer in your arms if you discovered That I made you into someone else. . . . Oh! . . . Well, there are worse ways. But why aim it at my feet—unless you fear you may be sorry. . . . There are many days ahead of you." "I do not see those days." "I can see them. Granted even I am wrong, there are the children. And are they to praise their father for his insight if we die? Do you hear them? Do you hear them overhead—the children —singing? Do you hear them? Do you hear the children?" "Damn the children!" "Why? What have they done? . . . Well, then,—do it. . . . Do it now, and have it over." "Oh, you devil! . . . Oh, you. . . ." "No, I'm not a devil, I'm a prophet— One who sees the end already of so much that one end more Would have now the small importance of one other small illusion, Which in turn would have a welcome where the rest have gone before. But if I were you, my fancy would look on a little farther For the glimpse of a release that may be somewhere still in sight. TASKER NORCROSS Furthermore, you must remember those two hundred invitations For the dancing after dinner. We shall have to shine tonight. We shall dance, and be as happy as a pair of merry spectres, On the grave of all the lies that we shall never have to tell; We shall dance among the ruins of the tomb of our endurance, And I have not a doubt that we shall do it very well. There!—I'm glad you've put it back; for I don't like it. Shut the drawer now. No—no—don't cancel anything. I'll dance until I drop. I can't walk yet, but I'm going to. . . . Go away somewhere, and leave me. . . . Oh, you children! Oh, you children! . . . God, will they never stop!" TASKER NORCROSS "Whether all towns and all who live in them— So long as they be somewhere in this world That we in our complacency call ours— Are more or less the same, I leave to you. I should say less. Whether or not, meanwhile, We've all two legs—and as for that, we haven't— There were three kinds of men where I was born: The good, the not so good, and Tasker Norcross. Now there are two kinds." "Meaning, as I divine, Your friend is dead," I ventured. Ferguson, Who talked himself at last out of the world He censured, and is therefore silent now, Agreed indifferently: "My friends are dead— Or most of them." COLLECTED POEMS "Remember one that isn't," I said, protesting. "Honor him for his ears; Treasure him also for his understanding." Ferguson sighed, and then talked on again: "You have an overgrown alacrity For saying nothing much and hearing less; And I've a thankless wonder, at the start, How much it is to you that I shall tell What I have now to say of Tasker Norcross, And how much to the air that is around you. But given a patience that is not averse To the slow tragedies of haunted men— Horrors, in fact, if you've a skilful eye To know them at their firesides, or out walking,—" "Horrors," I said, "are my necessity; And I would have them, for their best effect, Always out walking." Ferguson frowned at me: "The wisest of us are not those who laugh Before they know. Most of us never know— Or the long toil of our mortality Would not be done. Most of us never know— And there you have a reason to believe In God, if you may have no other. Norcross, Or so I gather of his infirmity, Was given to know more than he should have known, And only God knows why. See for yourself An old house full of ghosts of ancestors, Who did their best, or worst, and having done it, Died honorably; and each with a distinction That hardly would have been for him that had it, Had honor failed him wholly as a friend. Honor that is a friend begets a friend. TASKER NORCROSS Whether or not we love him, still we have him; And we must live somehow by what we have, Or then we die. If you say chemistry, Then you must have your molecules in motion, And in their right abundance. Failing either, You have not long to dance. Failing a friend, A genius, or a madness, or a faith Larger than desperation, you are here For as much longer than you like as may be. Imagining now, by way of an example, Myself a more or less remembered phantom— Again, I should say less—how many times A day should I come back to you? No answer. Forgive me when I seem a little careless, But we must have examples, or be lucid Without them; and I question your adherence To such an undramatic narrative As this of mine, without the personal hook." "A time is given in Ecclesiastes For divers works," I told him. "Is there one For saying nothing in return for nothing? If not, there should be." I could feel his eyes, And they were like two cold inquiring points Of a sharp metal. When I looked again, To see them shine, the cold that I had felt Was gone to make way for a smouldering Of lonely fire that I, as I knew then, Could never quench with kindness or with lies. I should have done whatever there was to do For Ferguson, yet I could not have mourned In honesty for once around the clock The loss of him, for my sake or for his, Try as I might; nor would his ghost approve, Had I the power and the unthinking will COLLECTED POEMS To make him tread again without an aim The road that was behind him—and without The faith, or friend, or genius, or the madness That he contended was imperative. After a silence that had been too long, "It may be quite as well we don't," he said; "As well, I mean, that we don't always say it. You know best what I mean, and I suppose You might have said it better. What was that? Incorrigible? Am I incorrigible? Well, it's a word; and a word has its use, Or, like a man, it will soon have a grave. It's a good word enough. Incorrigible, May be, for all I know, the word for Norcross. See for yourself that house of his again That he called home: An old house, painted white, Square as a box, and chillier than a tomb To look at or to live in. There were trees— Too many of them, if such a thing may be— Before it and around it. Down in front There was a road, a railroad, and a river; Then there were hills behind it, and more trees. The thing would fairly stare at you through trees, Like a pale inmate out of a barred window With a green shade half down; and I dare say People who passed have said: `There's where he lives. We know him, but we do not seem to know That we remember any good of him, Or any evil that is interesting. There you have all we know and all we care.' They might have said it in all sorts of ways; And then, if they perceived a cat, they might Or might not have remembered what they said. The cat might have a personality— TASKER NORCROSS And maybe the same one the Lord left out Of Tasker Norcross, who, for lack of it, Saw the same sun go down year after year; All which at last was my discovery. And only mine, so far as evidence Enlightens one more darkness. You have known All round you, all your days, men who are nothing— Nothing, I mean, so far as time tells yet Of any other need it has of them Than to make sextons hardy—but no less Are to themselves incalculably something, And therefore to be cherished. God, you see, Being sorry for them in their fashioning, Indemnified them with a quaint esteem Of self, and with illusions long as life. You know them well, and you have smiled at them; And they, in their serenity, may have had Their time to smile at you. Blessed are they That see themselves for what they never were Or were to be, and are, for their defect, At ease with mirrors and the dim remarks That pass their tranquil ears." "Come, come," said I; "There may be names in your compendium That we are not yet all on fire for shouting. Skin most of us of our mediocrity, We should have nothing then that we could scratch. The picture smarts. Cover it, if you please, And do so rather gently. Now for Norcross." Ferguson closed his eyes in resignation, While a dead sigh came out of him. "Good God!" He said, and said it only half aloud, As if he knew no longer now, nor cared, COLLECTED POEMS If one were there to listen: "Have I said nothing— Nothing at all—of Norcross? Do you mean To patronize him till his name becomes A toy made out of letters? If a name Is all you need, arrange an honest column Of all the people you have ever known That you have never liked. You'll have enough; And you'll have mine, moreover. No, not yet. If I assume too many privileges, I pay, and I alone, for their assumption; By which, if I assume a darker knowledge Of Norcross than another, let the weight Of my injustice aggravate the load That is not on your shoulders. When I came To know this fellow Norcross in his house, I found him as I found him in the street— No more, no less; indifferent, but no better. `Worse' were not quite the word: he was not bad; He was not . . . well, he was not anything. Has your invention ever entertained The picture of a dusty worm so dry That even the early bird would shake his head And fly on farther for another breakfast?" "But why forget the fortune of the worm," I said, "if in the dryness you deplore Salvation centred and endured? Your Norcross May have been one for many to have envied." "Salvation? Fortune? Would the worm say that? He might; and therefore I dismiss the worm With all dry things but one. Figures away, Do you begin to see this man a little? Do you begin to see him in the air, With all the vacant horrors of his outline TASKER NORCROSS For you to fill with more than it will hold? If so, you needn't crown yourself at once With epic laurel if you seem to fill it. Horrors, I say, for in the fires and forks Of a new hell—if one were not enough— I doubt if a new horror would have held him With a malignant ingenuity More to be feared than his before he died. You smile, as if in doubt. Well, smile again. Now come into his house, along with me: The four square sombre things that you see first Around you are four walls that go as high As to the ceiling. Norcross knew them well, And he knew others like them. Fasten to that With all the claws of your intelligence; And hold the man before you in his house As if he were a white rat in a box, And one that knew himself to be no other. I tell you twice that he knew all about it, That you may not forget the worst of all Our tragedies begin with what we know. Could Norcross only not have known, I wonder How many would have blessed and envied him! Could he have had the usual eye for spots On others, and for none upon himself, I smile to ponder on the carriages That might as well as not have clogged the town In honor of his end. For there was gold, You see, though all he needed was a little, And what he gave said nothing of who gave it He would have given it all if in return There might have been a more sufficient face— To greet him when he shaved. Though you insist It is the dower, and always, of our degree Not to be cursed with such invidious insight, COLLECTED POEMS Remember that you stand, you and your fancy, Now in his house; and since we are together, See for yourself and tell me what you see. Tell me the best you see. Make a slight noise Of recognition when you find a book That you would not as lief read upside down As otherwise, for example. If there you fail, Observe the walls and lead me to the place, Where you are led. If there you meet a picture That holds you near it for a longer time Than you are sorry, you may call it yours, And hang it in the dark of your remembrance, Where Norcross never sees. How can he see That has no eyes to see? And as for music, He paid with empty wonder for the pangs Of his infrequent forced endurance of it; And having had no pleasure, paid no more For needless immolation, or for the sight Of those who heard what he was never to hear. To see them listening was itself enough To make him suffer; and to watch worn eyes, On other days, of strangers who forgot Their sorrows and their failures and themselves Before a few mysterious odds and ends Of marble carted from the Parthenon— And all for seeing what he was never to see, Because it was alive and he was dead— Here was a wonder that was more profound Than any that was in fiddles and brass horns. "He knew, and in his knowledge there was death. He knew there was a region all around him That lay outside man's havoc and affairs, And yet was not all hostile to their tumult, TASKER NORCROSS Where poets would have served and honored him, And saved him, had there been anything to save. But there was nothing, and his tethered range Was only a small desert. Kings of song Are not for thrones in deserts. Towers of sound And flowers of sense are but a waste of heaven Where there is none to know them from the rocks And sand-grass of his own monotony That makes earth less than earth. He could see that, And he could see no more. The captured light That may have been or not, for all he cared, The song that is in sculpture was not his, But only, to his God-forgotten eyes, One more immortal nonsense in a world Where all was mortal, or had best be so, And so be done with. `Art,' he would have said, `Is not life, and must therefore be a lie;' And with a few profundities like that He would have controverted and dismissed The benefit of the Greeks. He had heard of them, As he had heard of his aspiring soul— Never to the perceptible advantage, In his esteem, of either. `Faith,' he said, Or would have said if he had thought of it, `Lives in the same house with Philosophy, Where the two feed on scraps and are forlorn As orphans after war. He could see stars, On a clear night, but he had not an eye To see beyond them. He could hear spoken words, But had no ear for silence when alone. He could eat food of which he knew the savor, But had no palate for the Bread of Life, That human desperation, to his thinking, Made famous long ago, having no other. Now do you see? Do you begin to see?" COLLECTED POEMS I told him that I did begin to see; And I was nearer than I should have been To laughing at his malign inclusiveness, When I considered that, with all our speed, We are not laughing yet at funerals. I see him now as I could see him then, And I see now that it was good for me, As it was good for him, that I was quiet; For Time's eye was on Ferguson, and the shaft Of its inquiring hesitancy had touched him, Or so I chose to fancy more than once Before he told of Norcross. When the word Of his release (he would have called it so) Made half an inch of news, there were no tears That are recorded. Women there may have been To wish him back, though I should say, not knowing, The few there were to mourn were not for love, And were not lovely. Nothing of them, at least, Was in the meagre legend that I gathered Years after, when a chance of travel took me So near the region of his nativity That a few miles of leisure brought me there; For there I found a friendly citizen Who led me to his house among the trees That were above a railroad and a river. Square as a box and chillier than a tomb It was indeed, to look at or to live in— All which had I been told. "Ferguson died," The stranger said, "and then there was an auction. I live here, but I've never yet been warm. Remember him? Yes, I remember him. I knew him—as a man may know a tree— For twenty years. He may have held himself A little high when he was here, but now . . . Yes, I remember Ferguson. Oh, yes." SOUVENIR Others, I found, remembered Ferguson, But none of them had heard of Tasker Norcross. A SONG AT SHANNON'S Two men came out of Shannon's, having known The faces of each other for as long As they had listened there to an old song, Sung thinly in a wastrel monotone By some unhappy night-bird, who had flown Too many times and with a wing too strong To save himself, and so done heavy wrong To more frail elements than his alone. Slowly away they went, leaving behind More light than was before them. Neither met The other's eyes again or said a word. Each to his loneliness or to his kind, Went his own way, and with his own regret, Not knowing what the other may have heard. SOUVENIR A vanished house that for an hour I knew By some forgotten chance when I was young Had once a glimmering window overhung With honeysuckle wet with evening dew. Along the path tall dusky dahlias grew, And shadowy hydrangeas reached and swung Ferociously; and over me, among The moths and mysteries, a blurred bat flew. COLLECTED POEMS Somewhere within there were dim presences Of days that hovered and of years gone by. I waited, and between their silences There was an evanescent faded noise; And though a child, I knew it was the voice Of one whose occupation was to die. DISCOVERY We told of him as one who should have soared And seen for us the devastating light Whereof there is not either day or night, And shared with us the glamour of the Word That fell once upon Amos to record For men at ease in Zion, when the sight Of ills obscured aggrieved him and the might Of Hamath was a warning of the Lord. Assured somehow that he would make us wise, Our pleasure was to wait; and our surprise Was hard when we confessed the dry return Of his regret. For we were still to learn That earth has not a school where we may go For wisdom, or for more than we may know. FIRELIGHT Ten years together without yet a cloud, They seek each other's eyes at intervals Of gratefulness to firelight and four walls For love's obliteration of the crowd. Serenely and perennially endowed And bowered as few may be, their joy recalls INFERENTIAL No snake, no sword; and over them there falls The blessing of what neither says aloud. Wiser for silence, they were not so glad Were she to read the graven tale of lines On the wan face of one somewhere alone; Nor were they more content could he have had Her thoughts a moment since of one who shines Apart, and would be hers if he had known. THE NEW TENANTS The day was here when it was his to know How fared the barriers he had built between His triumph and his enemies unseen, For them to undermine and overthrow; And it was his no longer to forego The sight of them, insidious and serene, Where they were delving always and had been Left always to be vicious and to grow. And there were the new tenants who had come, By doors that were left open unawares, Into his house, and were so much at home There now that he would hardly have to guess, By the slow guile of their vindictiveness, What ultimate insolence would soon be theirs. INFERENTIAL Although I saw before me there the face Of one whom I had honored among men The least, and on regarding him again COLLECTED POEMS Would not have had him in another place, He fitted with an unfamiliar grace The coffin where I could not see him then As I had seen him and appraised him when I deemed him unessential to the race. For there was more of him than what I saw. And there was on me more than the old awe That is the common genius of the dead. I might as well have heard him: "Never mind; If some of us were not so far behind, The rest of us were not so far ahead." THE RAT As often as he let himself be seen We pitied him, or scorned him, or deplored The inscrutable profusion of the Lord Who shaped as one of us a thing so mean— Who made him human when he might have been A rat, and so been wholly in accord With any other creature we abhorred As always useless and not always clean. Now he is hiding all alone somewhere, And in a final hole not ready then; For now he is among those over there Who are not coming back to us again. And we who do the fiction of our share Say less of rats and rather more of men. RAHEL TO VARNHAGEN RAHEL TO VARNHAGEN Note.—Rahel Robert and Varnhagen von Ense were married, after many protestations on her part, in 1814. The marriage—so far as he was concerned at any rate—appears to have been satisfactory. Now you have read them all; or if not all, As many as in all conscience I should fancy To be enough. There are no more of them— Or none to burn your sleep, or to bring dreams Of devils. If these are not sufficient, surely You are a strange young man. I might live on Alone, and for another forty years, Or not quite forty,—are you happier now?— Always to ask if there prevailed elsewhere Another like yourself that would have held These aged hands as long as you have held them, Not once observing, for all I can see, How they are like your mother's. Well, you have read His letters now, and you have heard me say That in them are the cinders of a passion That was my life; and you have not yet broken Your way out of my house, out of my sight,— Into the street. You are a strange young man. I know as much as that of you, for certain; And I'm already praying, for your sake, That you be not too strange. Too much of that May lead you bye and bye through gloomy lanes To a sad wilderness, where one may grope Alone, and always, or until he feels Ferocious and invisible animals That wait for men and eat them in the dark. Why do you sit there on the floor so long, Smiling at me while I try to be solemn? COLLECTED POEMS Do you not hear it said for your salvation, When I say truth? Are you, at four and twenty, So little deceived in us that you interpret The humor of a woman to be noticed As her choice between you and Acheron? Are you so unscathed yet as to infer That if a woman worries when a man, Or a man-child, has wet shoes on his feet She may as well commemorate with ashes The last eclipse of her tranquillity? If you look up at me and blink again, I shall not have to make you tell me lies To know the letters you have not been reading I see now that I may have had for nothing A most unpleasant shivering in my conscience When I laid open for your contemplation The wealth of my worn casket. If I did, The fault was not yours wholly. Search again This wreckage we may call for sport a face, And you may chance upon the price of havoc That I have paid for a few sorry stones That shine and have no light—yet once were stars, And sparkled on a crown. Little and weak They seem; and they are cold, I fear, for you. But they that once were fire for me may not Be cold again for me until I die; And only God knows if they may be then. There is a love that ceases to be love In being ourselves. How, then, are we to lose it? You that are sure that you know everything There is to know of love, answer me that. Well? . . . You are not even interested. Once on a far off time when I was young, I felt with your assurance, and all through me, RAHEL TO VARNHAGEN That I had undergone the last and worst Of love's inventions. There was a boy who brought The sun with him and woke me up with it, And that was every morning; every night I tried to dream of him, but never could, More than I might have seen in Adam's eyes Their fond uncertainty when Eve began The play that all her tireless progeny Are not yet weary of. One scene of it Was brief, but was eternal while it lasted; And that was while I was the happiest Of an imaginary six or seven, Somewhere in history but not on earth, For whom the sky had shaken and let stars Rain down like diamonds. Then there were clouds, And a sad end of diamonds; whereupon Despair came, like a blast that would have brought Tears to the eyes of all the bears in Finland, And love was done. That was how much I knew. Poor little wretch! I wonder where he is This afternoon. Out of this rain, I hope. At last, when I had seen so many days Dressed all alike, and in their marching order, Go by me that I would not always count them, One stopped—shattering the whole file of Time, Or so it seemed; and when I looked again, There was a man. He struck once with his eyes, And then there was a woman. I, who had come To wisdom, or to vision, or what you like, By the old hidden road that has no name,— I, who was used to seeing without flying So much that others fly from without seeing, Still looked, and was afraid, and looked again. And after that, when I had read the story COLLECTED POEMS Told in his eyes, and felt within my heart The bleeding wound of their necessity, I knew the fear was his. If I had failed him And flown away from him, I should have lost Ingloriously my wings in scrambling back, And found them arms again. If he had struck me Not only with his eyes but with his hands, I might have pitied him and hated love, And then gone mad. I, who have been so strong— Why don't you laugh?—might even have done all that. I, who have learned so much, and said so much, And had the commendations of the great For one who rules herself—why don't you cry?— And own a certain small authority Among the blind, who see no more than ever, But like my voice,—I would have tossed it all To Tophet for one man; and he was jealous. I would have wound a snake around my neck And then have let it bite me till I died, If my so doing would have made me sure That one man might have lived; and he was jealous. I would have driven these hands into a cage That held a thousand scorpions, and crushed them, If only by so poisonous a trial I could have crushed his doubt. I would have wrung My living blood with mediaeval engines Out of my screaming flesh, if only that Would have made one man sure. I would have paid For him the tiresome price of body and soul, And let the lash of a tongue-weary town Fall as it might upon my blistered name; And while it fell I could have laughed at it, Knowing that he had found out finally Where the wrong was. But there was evil in him That would have made no more of his possession RAHEL TO VARNHAGEN Than confirmation of another fault; And there was honor—if you call it honor That hoods itself with doubt and wears a crown Of lead that might as well be gold and fire. Give it as heavy or as light a name As any there is that fits. I see myself Without the power to swear to this or that That I might be if he had been without it. Whatever I might have been that I was not, It only happened that it wasn't so. Meanwhile, you might seem to be listening: If you forget yourself and go to sleep, My treasure, I shall not say this again. Look up once more into my poor old face, Where you see beauty, or the Lord knows what, And say to me aloud what else there is Than ruins in it that you most admire. No, there was never anything like that; Nature has never fastened such a mask Of radiant and impenetrable merit On any woman as you say there is On this one. Not a mask? I thank you, sir, But you see more with your determination, I fear, than with your prudence or your conscience; And you have never met me with my eyes In all the mirrors I've made faces at. No, I shall never call you strange again: You are the young and inconvincible Epitome of all blind men since Adam. May the blind lead the blind, if that be so? And we shall need no mirrors? You are saying What most I feared you might. But if the blind, Or one of them, be not so fortunate As to put out the eyes of recollection, COLLECTED POEMS She might at last, without her meaning it, Lead on the other, without his knowing it, Until the two of them should lose themselves Among dead craters in a lava-field As empty as a desert on the moon. I am not speaking in a theatre, But in a room so real and so familiar That sometimes I would wreck it. Then I pause, Remembering there is a King in Weimar— A monarch, and a poet, and a shepherd Of all who are astray and are outside The realm where they should rule. I think of him, And save the furniture; I think of you, And am forlorn, finding in you the one To lavish aspirations and illusions Upon a faded and forsaken house Where love, being locked alone, was nigh to burning House and himself together. Yes, you are strange, To see in such an injured architecture Room for new love to live in. Are you laughing? No? Well, you are not crying, as you should be. Tears, even if they told only gratitude For your escape, and had no other story, Were surely more becoming than a smile For my unwomanly straightforwardness In seeing for you, through my close gate of years Your forty ways to freedom. Why do you smile? And while I'm trembling at my faith in you In giving you to read this book of danger That only one man living might have written— These letters, which have been a part of me So long that you may read them all again As often as you look into my face, And hear them when I speak to you, and feel them Whenever you have to touch me with your hand,— RAHEL TO VARNHAGEN Why are you so unwilling to be spared? Why do you still believe in me? But no, I'll find another way to ask you that. I wonder if there is another way That says it better, and means anything. There is no other way that could be worse? I was not asking you; it was myself Alone that I was asking. Why do I dip For lies, when there is nothing in my well But shining truth, you say? How do you know? Truth has a lonely life down where she lives; And many a time, when she comes up to breathe, She sinks before we seize her, and makes ripples. Possibly you may know no more of me Than a few ripples; and they may soon be gone, Leaving you then with all my shining truth Drowned in a shining water; and when you look You may not see me there, but something else That never was a woman—being yourself. You say to me my truth is past all drowning, And safe with you for ever? You know all that? How do you know all that, and who has told you? You know so much that I'm an atom frightened Because you know so little. And what is this? You know the luxury there is in haunting The blasted thoroughfares of disillusion— If that's your name for them—with only ghosts For company? You know that when a woman Is blessed, or cursed, with a divine impatience (Another name of yours for a bad temper) She must have one at hand on whom to wreak it (That's what you mean, whatever the turn you give it), Sure of a kindred sympathy, and thereby Effect a mutual calm? You know that wisdom, Given in vain to make a food for those COLLECTED POEMS Who are without it, will be seen at last, And even at last only by those who gave it, As one or more of the forgotten crumbs That others leave? You know that men's applause And women's envy savor so much of dust That I go hungry, having at home no fare But the same changeless bread that I may swallow Only with tears and prayers? Who told you that? You know that if I read, and read alone, Too many books that no men yet have written, I may go blind, or worse? You know yourself, Of all insistent and insidious creatures, To be the one to save me, and to guard For me their flaming language? And you know That if I give much headway to the whim That's in me never to be quite sure that even Through all those years of storm and fire I waited For this one rainy day, I may go on, And on, and on alone, through smoke and ashes, To a cold end? You know so dismal much As that about me? . . . Well, I believe you do. NIMMO Since you remember Nimmo, and arrive At such a false and florid and far drawn Confusion of odd nonsense, I connive No longer, though I may have led you on. So much is told and heard and told again, So many with his legend are engrossed, That I, more sorry now than I was then, May live on to be sorry for his ghost. NIMMO You knew him, and you must have known his eyes,— How deep they were, and what a velvet light Came out of them when anger or surprise, Or laughter, or Francesca, made them bright. No, you will not forget such eyes, I think,— And you say nothing of them. Very well. I wonder if all history's worth a wink, Sometimes, or if my tale be one to tell. For they began to lose their velvet light; Their fire grew dead without and small within; And many of you deplored the needless fight That somewhere in the dark there must have been. All fights are needless, when they're not our own, But Nimmo and Francesca never fought. Remember that; and when you are alone, Remember me—and think what I have thought. Now, mind you, I say nothing of what was, Or never was, or could or could not be: Bring not suspicion's candle to the glass That mirrors a friend's face to memory. Of what you see, see all,—but see no more; For what I show you here will not be there. The devil has had his way with paint before, And he's an artist,—and you needn't stare. There was a painter and he painted well: He'd paint you Daniel in the lion's den, Beelzebub, Elaine, or William Tell. I'm coming back to Nimmo's eyes again. COLLECTED POEMS The painter put the devil in those eyes, Unless the devil did, and there he stayed; And then the lady fled from paradise, And there's your fact. The lady was afraid. She must have been afraid, or may have been, Of evil in their velvet all the while; But sure as I'm a sinner with a skin, I'll trust the man as long as he can smile. I trust him who can smile and then may live In my heart's house, where Nimmo is today. God knows if I have more than men forgive To tell him; but I played, and I shall pay. I knew him then, and if I know him yet, I know in him, defeated and estranged, The calm of men forbidden to forget The calm of women who have loved and changed. But there are ways that are beyond our ways, Or he would not be calm and she be mute, As one by one their lost and empty days Pass without even the warmth of a dispute. God help us all when women think they see; God save us when they do. I'm fair; but though I know him only as he looks to me, I know him,—and I tell Francesca so. And what of Nimmo? Little would you ask Of him, could you but see him as I can, At his bewildered and unfruitful task Of being what he was born to be—a man. PEACE ON EARTH Better forget that I said anything Of what your tortured memory may disclose; I know him, and your worst remembering Would count as much as nothing, I suppose. Meanwhile, I trust him; and I know his way Of trusting me, and always in his youth. I'm painting here a better man, you say, Than I, the painter; and you say the truth. PEACE ON EARTH He took a frayed hat from his head, And "Peace on Earth" was what he said. "A morsel out of what you're worth, And there we have it: Peace on Earth. Not much, although a little more Than what there was on earth before I'm as you see, I'm Ichabod,— But never mind the ways I've trod; I'm sober now, so help me God." I could not pass the fellow by. "Do you believe in God?" said I; "And is there to be Peace on Earth?" "Tonight we celebrate the birth," He said, "of One who died for men; The Son of God, we say. What then? Your God, or mine? I'd make you laugh Were I to tell you even half That I have learned of mine today Where yours would hardly seem to stay. COLLECTED POEMS Could He but follow in and out Some anthropoids I know about, The god to whom you may have prayed Might see a world He never made." "Your words are flowing full," said I; "But yet they give me no reply; Your fountain might as well be dry." "A wiser One than you, my friend, Would wait and hear me to the end; And for his eyes a light would shine Through this unpleasant shell of mine That in your fancy makes of me A Christmas curiosity. All right, I might be worse than that; And you might now be lying flat; I might have done it from behind, And taken what there was to find. Don't worry, for I'm not that kind. `Do I believe in God?' Is that The price tonight of a new hat? Has he commanded that his name Be written everywhere the same? Have all who live in every place Identified his hidden face? Who knows but he may like as well My story as one you may tell? And if he show me there be Peace On Earth, as there be fields and trees Outside a jail-yard, am I wrong If now I sing him a new song? Your world is in yourself, my friend, For your endurance to the end; And all the Peace there is on Earth LATE SUMMER Is faith in what your world is worth, And saying, without any lies, Your world could not be otherwise." "One might say that and then be shot," I told him; and he said: "Why not?" I ceased, and gave him rather more Than he was counting of my store. "And since I have it, thanks to you, Don't ask me what I mean to do," Said he. "Believe that even I Would rather tell the truth than lie— On Christmas Eve. No matter why." His unshaved, educated face, His inextinguishable grace. And his hard smile, are with me still, Deplore the vision as I will; For whatsoever he be at, So droll a derelict as that Should have at least another hat. LATE SUMMER (Alcaics) Confused, he found her lavishing feminine Gold upon clay, and found her inscrutable; And yet she smiled. Why, then, should horrors Be as they were, without end, her playthings? And why were dead years hungrily telling her Lies of the dead, who told them again to her? If now she knew, there might be kindness Clamoring yet where a faith lay stifled. COLLECTED POEMS A little faith in him, and the ruinous Past would be for time to annihilate, And wash out, like a tide that washes Out of the sand what a child has drawn there. God, what a shining handful of happiness, Made out of days and out of eternities, Were now the pulsing end of patience— Could he but have what a ghost had stolen! What was a man before him, or ten of them, While he was here alive who could answer them, And in their teeth fling confirmations Harder than agates against an egg-shell? But now the man was dead, and would come again Never, though she might honor ineffably The flimsy wraith of him she conjured Out of a dream with his wand of absence. And if the truth were now but a mummery, Meriting pride's implacable irony, So much the worse for pride. Moreover, Save her or fail, there was conscience always. Meanwhile, a few misgivings of innocence, Imploring to be sheltered and credited, Were not amiss when she revealed them. Whether she struggled or not, he saw them. Also, he saw that while she was hearing him Her eyes had more and more of the past in them; And while he told what cautious honor Told him was all he had best be sure of, LATE SUMMER He wondered once or twice, inadvertently, Where shifting winds were driving his argosies, Long anchored and as long unladen, Over the foam for the golden chances. "If men were not for killing so carelessly, And women were for wiser endurances," He said, "we might have yet a world here Fitter for Truth to be seen abroad in; "If Truth were not so strange in her nakedness, And we were less forbidden to look at it, We might not have to look." He stared then Down at the sand where the tide threw forward Its cold, unconquered lines, that unceasingly Foamed against hope, and fell. He was calm enough, Although he knew he might be silenced Out of all calm; and the night was coming. "I climb for you the peak of his infamy That you may choose your fall if you cling to it. No more for me unless you say more. All you have left of a dream defends you: "The truth may be as evil an augury As it was needful now for the two of us. We cannot have the dead between us. Tell me to go, and I go."—She pondered: "What you believe is right for the two of us Makes it as right that you are not one of us. If this be needful truth you tell me, Spare me, and let me have lies hereafter." COLLECTED POEMS She gazed away where shadows were covering The whole cold ocean's healing indifference. No ship was coming. When the darkness Fell, she was there, and alone, still gazing. AN EVANGELIST'S WIFE "Why am I not myself these many days, You ask? And have you nothing more to ask? I do you wrong? I do not hear your praise To God for giving you me to share your task? "Jealous—of Her? Because her cheeks are pink, And she has eyes? No, not if she had seven. If you should only steal an hour to think, Sometime, there might be less to be forgiven. "No, you are never cruel. If once or twice I found you so, I could applaud and sing. Jealous of—What? You are not very wise. Does not the good Book tell you anything? "In David's time poor Michal had to go. Jealous of God? Well, if you like it so." THE OLD KING'S NEW JESTER You that in vain would front the coming order With eyes that meet forlornly what they must, And only with a furtive recognition See dust where there is dust,— Be sure you like it always in your faces, THE OLD KING'S NEW JESTER Obscuring your best graces, Blinding your speech and sight, Before you seek again your dusty places Where the old wrong seems right. Longer ago than cave-men had their changes Our fathers may have slain a son o two, Discouraging a further dialectic Regarding what was new; And after their unstudied admonition Occasional contrition For their old-fashioned ways May have reduced their doubts, and in addition Softened their final days. Farther away than feet shall ever travel Are the vague towers of our unbuilded State; But there are mightier things than we to lead us, That will not let us wait. And we go on with none to tell us whether Or not we've each a tether Determining how fast or how far we go; And it is well, since we must go together, That we are not to know. If the old wrong and all its injured glamour Haunts you by day and gives your night no peace, You may as well, agreeably and serenely, Give the new wrong its lease; For should you nourish a too fervid yearning For what is not returning, The vicious and unfused ingredient May give you qualms—and one or two concerning The last of your content. COLLECTED POEMS LAZARUS "No, Mary, there was nothing—not a word. Nothing, and always nothing. Go again Yourself, and he may listen—or at least Look up at you, and let you see his eyes. I might as well have been the sound of rain, A wind among the cedars, or a bird; Or nothing. Mary, make him look at you; And even if he should say that we are nothing, To know that you have heard him will be something. And yet he loved us, and it was for love The Master gave him back. Why did he wait So long before he came? Why did he weep? I thought he would be glad—and Lazarus— To see us all again as he had left us— All as it was, all as it was before." Mary, who felt her sister's frightened arms Like those of someone drowning who had seized her, Fearing at last they were to fail and sink Together in this fog-stricken sea of strangeness, Fought sadly, with bereaved indignant eyes, To find again the fading shores of home That she had seen but now could see no longer Now she could only gaze into the twilight, And in the dimness know that he was there, Like someone that was not. He who had been Their brother, and was dead, now seemed alive Only in death again—or worse than death; For tombs at least, always until today, Though sad were certain. There was nothing certain For man or God in such a day as this; For there they were alone, and there was he— LAZARUS Alone; and somewhere out of Bethany, The Master—who had come to them so late, Only for love of them and then so slowly, And was for their sake hunted now by men Who feared Him as they feared no other prey— For the world's sake was hidden. "Better the tomb For Lazarus than life, if this be life," She thought; and then to Martha, "No, my dear," She said aloud; "not as it was before. Nothing is ever as it was before, Where Time has been. Here there is more than Time; And we that are so lonely and so far From home, since he is with us here again, Are farther now from him and from ourselves Than we are from the stars. He will not speak Until the spirit that is in him speaks; And we must wait for all we are to know, Or even to learn that we are not to know. Martha, we are too near to this for knowledge, And that is why it is that we must wait. Our friends are coming if we call for them, And there are covers we'll put over him To make him warmer. We are too young, perhaps, To say that we know better what is best Than he. We do not know how old he is. If you remember what the Master said, Try to believe that we need have no fear. Let me, the selfish and the careless one, Be housewife and a mother for tonight; For I am not so fearful as you are, And I was not so eager." Martha sank Down at her sister's feet and there sat watching A flower that had a small familiar name COLLECTED POEMS That was as old as memory, but was not The name of what she saw now in its brief And infinite mystery that so frightened her That life became a terror. Tears again Flooded her eyes and overflowed. "No, Mary," She murmured slowly, hating her own words Before she heard them, "you are not so eager To see our brother as we see him now; Neither is he who gave him back to us. I was to be the simple one, as always, And this was all for me." She stared again Over among the trees where Lazarus, Who seemed to be a man who was not there, Might have been one more shadow among shadows, If she had not remembered. Then she felt The cool calm hands of Mary on her face, And shivered, wondering if such hands were real. "The Master loved you as he loved us all, Martha; and you are saying only things That children say when they have had no sleep. Try somehow now to rest a little while; You know that I am here, and that our friends Are coming if I call." Martha at last Arose, and went with Mary to the door, Where they stood looking off at the same place, And at the same shape that was always there As if it would not ever move or speak, And always would be there. "Mary, go now, Before the dark that will be coming hides him. I am afraid of him out there alone, Unless I see him; and I have forgotten What sleep is. Go now—make him look at you— LAZARUS And I shall hear him if he stirs or whispers. Go!—or I'll scream and bring all Bethany To come and make him speak. Make him say once That he is glad, and God may say the rest. Though He say I shall sleep, and sleep for ever, I shall not care for that . . . Go!" Mary, moving Almost as if an angry child had pushed her, Went forward a few steps; and having waited As long as Martha's eyes would look at hers, Went forward a few more, and a few more; And so, until she came to Lazarus, Who crouched with his face hidden in his hands, Like one that had no face. Before she spoke, Feeling her sister's eyes that were behind her As if the door where Martha stood were now As far from her as Egypt, Mary turned Once more to see that she was there. Then, softly, Fearing him not so much as wondering What his first word might be, said, "Lazarus, Forgive us if we seemed afraid of you;" And having spoken, pitied her poor speech That had so little seeming gladness in it, So little comfort, and so little love. There was no sign from him that he had heard, Or that he knew that she was there, or cared Whether she spoke to him again or died There at his feet. "We love you, Lazarus, And we are not afraid. The Master said We need not be afraid. Will you not say To me that you are glad? Look, Lazarus! Look at my face, and see me. This is Mary." COLLECTED POEMS She found his hands and held them. They were cool, Like hers, but they were not so calm as hers. Through the white robes in which his friends had wrapped him When he had groped out of that awful sleep, She felt him trembling and she was afraid. At last he sighed; and she prayed hungrily To God that she might hear again the voice Of Lazarus, whose hands were giving her now The recognition of a living pressure That was almost a language. When he spoke, Only one word that she had waited for Came from his lips, and that word was her name. "I heard them saying, Mary, that he wept Before I woke." The words were low and shaken, Yet Mary knew that he who uttered them Was Lazarus; and that would be enough Until there should be more . . . "Who made him come, That he should weep for me? . . . Was it you, Mary?" The questions held in his incredulous eyes Were more than she would see. She looked away; But she had felt them and should feel for ever, She thought, their cold and lonely desperation That had the bitterness of all cold things That were not cruel. "I should have wept," he said, "If I had been the Master. . . ." Now she could feel His hands above her hair—the same black hair That once he made a jest of, praising it, While Martha's busy eyes had left their work To flash with laughing envy. Nothing of that Was to be theirs again; and such a thought Was like the flying by of a quick bird Seen through a shadowy doorway in the twilight. LAZARUS For now she felt his hands upon her head, Like weights of kindness: "I forgive you, Mary. . . . You did not know—Martha could not have known— Only the Master knew. . . . Where is he now? Yes, I remember. They came after him. May the good God forgive him. . . . I forgive him. I must; and I may know only from him The burden of all this. . . Martha was here— But I was not yet here. She was afraid. . . . Why did he do it, Mary? Was it—you? Was it for you? . . . Where are the friends I saw? Yes, I remember. They all went away. I made them go away. . . . Where is he now? . . . What do I see down there? Do I see Martha— Down by the door? . . . I must have time for this." Lazarus looked about him fearfully, And then again at Mary, who discovered Awakening apprehension in his eyes, And shivered at his feet. All she had feared Was here; and only in the slow reproach Of his forgiveness lived his gratitude. Why had he asked if it was all for her That he was here? And what had Martha meant? Why had the Master waited? What was coming To Lazarus, and to them, that had not come? What had the Master seen before he came, That he had come so late? "Where is he, Mary?" Lazarus asked again. "Where did he go?" Once more he gazed about him, and once more At Mary for an answer. "Have they found him? Or did he go away because he wished COLLECTED POEMS Never to look into my eyes again? . . . That, I could understand. . . . Where is he, Mary?" "I do not know," she said. "Yet in my heart I know that he is living, as you are living— Living, and here. He is not far from us. He will come back to us and find us all— Lazarus, Martha, Mary—everything— All as it was before. Martha said that. And he said we were not to be afraid." Lazarus closed his eyes while on his face A tortured adumbration of a smile Flickered an instant. "All as it was before," He murmured wearily. "Martha said that; And he said you were not to be afraid . . . Not you . . . Not you . . . Why should you be afraid? Give all your little fears, and Martha's with them, To me; and I will add them unto mine, Like a few rain-drops to Gennesaret." "If you had frightened me in other ways, Not willing it," Mary said, "I should have known You still for Lazarus. But who is this? Tell me again that you are Lazarus; And tell me if the Master gave to you No sign of a new joy that shall be coming To this house that he loved. Are you afraid? Are you afraid, who have felt everything— And seen . . .?" But Lazarus only shook his head, Staring with his bewildered shining eyes Hard into Mary's face. "I do not know, Mary," he said, after a long time. "When I came back, I knew the Master's eyes LAZARUS Were looking into mine. I looked at his, And there was more in them than I could see. At first I could see nothing but his eyes; Nothing else anywhere was to be seen— Only his eyes. And they looked into mine— Long into mine, Mary, as if he knew." Mary began to be afraid of words As she had never been afraid before Of loneliness or darkness, or of death, But now she must have more of them or die: "He cannot know that there is worse than death," She said. "And you . . ." "Yes, there is worse than death." Said Lazarus; "and that was what he knew; And that is what it was that I could see This morning in his eyes. I was afraid, But not as you are. There is worse than death, Mary; and there is nothing that is good For you in dying while you are still here. Mary, never go back to that again. You would not hear me if I told you more, For I should say it only in a language That you are not to learn by going back. To be a child again is to go forward— And that is much to know. Many grow old, And fade, and go away, not knowing how much That is to know. Mary, the night is coming, And there will soon be darkness all around you. Let us go down where Martha waits for us, And let there be light shining in this house." He rose, but Mary would not let him go: "Martha, when she came back from here, said only COLLECTED POEMS That she heard nothing. And have you no more For Mary now than you had then for Martha? Is Nothing, Lazarus, all you have for me? Was Nothing all you found where you have been? If that be so, what is there worse than that— Or better—if that be so? And why should you, With even our love, go the same dark road over?" "I could not answer that, if that were so,' Said Lazarus,—"not even if I were God. Why should He care whether I came or stayed, If that were so? Why should the Master weep— For me, or for the world,—or save himself Longer for nothing? And if that were so, Why should a few years' more mortality Make him a fugitive where flight were needless, Had he but held his peace and given his nod To an old Law that would be new as any? I cannot say the answer to all that; Though I may say that he is not afraid, And that it is not for the joy there is In serving an eternal Ignorance Of our futility that he is here. Is that what you and Martha mean by Nothing? Is that what you are fearing? If that be so, There are more weeds than lentils in your garden. And one whose weeds are laughing at his harvest May as well have no garden; for not there Shall he be gleaning the few bits and orts Of life that are to save him. For my part, I am again with you, here among shadows That will not always be so dark as this; Though now I see there's yet an evil in me That made me let you be afraid of me. No, I was not afraid—not even of life. LAZARUS I thought I was . . . I must have time for this; And all the time there is will not be long. I cannot tell you what the Master saw This morning in my eyes. I do not know. I cannot yet say how far I have gone, Or why it is that I am here again, Or where the old road leads. I do not know. I know that when I did come back, I saw His eyes again among the trees and faces— Only his eyes; and they looked into mine— Long into mine—long, long, as if he knew."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AVON'S HARVEST, ETC. (1921) To Seth Ellis Pope AVON'S HARVEST Fear, like a living fire that only death Might one day cool, had now in Avon's eyes Been witness for so long of an invasion That made of a gay friend whom we had known Almost a memory, wore no other name As yet for us than fear. Another man Than Avon might have given to us at least A futile opportunity for words We might regret. But Avon, since it happened, Fed with his unrevealing reticence The fire of death we saw that horribly Consumed him while he crumbled and said nothing. So many a time had I been on the edge, And off again, of a foremeasured fall Into the darkness and discomfiture Of his oblique rebuff, that finally My silence honored his, holding itself Away from a gratuitous intrusion That likely would have widened a new distance Already wide enough, if not so new. But there are seeming parallels in space That may converge in time; and so it was I walked with Avon, fought and pondered with him, While he made out a case for So-and-so, Or slaughtered What's-his-name in his old way, With a new difference. Nothing in Avon lately COLLECTED POEMS Was, or was ever again to be for us, Like him that we remembered; and all the while We saw that fire at work within his eyes And had no glimpse of what was burning there. So for a year it went; and so it went For half another year—when, all at once, At someone's tinkling afternoon at home I saw that in the eyes of Avon's wife The fire that I had met the day before In his had found another living fuel. To look at her and then to think of him, And thereupon to contemplate the fall Of a dim curtain over the dark end Of a dark play, required of me no more Clairvoyance than a man who cannot swim Will exercise in seeing that his friend Off shore will drown except he save himself. To her I could say nothing, and to him No more than tallied with a long belief That I should only have it back again For my chagrin to ruminate upon, Ingloriously, for the still time it starved; And that would be for me as long a time As I remembered Avon—who is yet Not quite forgotten. On the other hand, For saying nothing I might have with me always An injured and recriminating ghost Of a dead friend. The more I pondered it The more I knew there was not much to lose, Albeit for one whose delving hitherto Had been a forage of his own affairs, The quest, however golden the reward, Was irksome—and as Avon suddenly And soon was driven to let me see, was needless. AVON'S HARVEST It seemed an age ago that we were there One evening in the room that in the days When they could laugh he called the Library. "He calls it that, you understand," she said, "Because the dictionary always lives here. He's not a man of books, yet he can read, And write. He learned it all at school."—He smiled, And answered with a fervor that rang then Superfluous: "Had I learned a little more At school, it might have been as well for me." And I remember now that he paused then, Leaving a silence that one had to break. But this was long ago, and there was now No laughing in that house. We were alone This time, and it was Avon's time to talk. I waited, and anon became aware That I was looking less at Avon's eyes Than at the dictionary, like one asking Already why we make so much of words That have so little weight in the true balance. "Your name is Resignation for an hour," He said; "and I'm a little sorry for you. So be resigned. I shall not praise your work, Or strive in any way to make you happy. My purpose only is to make you know How clearly I have known that you have known There was a reason waited on your coming, And, if it's in me to see clear enough, To fish the reason out of a black well Where you see only a dim sort of glimmer That has for you no light." "I see the well," I said, "but there's a doubt about the glimmer— COLLECTED POEMS Say nothing of the light. I'm at your service; And though you say that I shall not be happy, I shall be if in some way I may serve. To tell you fairly now that I know nothing Is nothing more than fair."—"You know as much As any man alive—save only one man, If he's alive. Whether he lives or not Is rather for time to answer than for me; And that's a reason, or a part of one, For your appearance here. You do not know him, And even if you should pass him in the street He might go by without your feeling him Between you and the world. I cannot say Whether he would, but I suppose he might." "And I suppose you might, if urged," I said, "Say in what water it is that we are fishing. You that have reasons hidden in a well, Not mentioning all your nameless friends that walk The streets and are not either dead or living For company, are surely, one would say To be forgiven if you may seem distraught— I mean distrait. I don't know what I mean. I only know that I am at your service, Always, yet with a special reservation That you may deem eccentric. All the same Unless your living dead man comes to life, Or is less indiscriminately dead, I shall go home." "No, you will not go home," Said Avon; "or I beg that you will not." So saying, he went slowly to the door And turned the key. "Forgive me and my manners, But I would be alone with you this evening. AVON'S HARVEST The key, as you observe, is in the lock; And you may sit between me and the door, Or where you will. You have my word of honor That I would spare you the least injury That might attend your presence here this evening." "I thank you for your soothing introduction, Avon," I said. "Go on. The Lord giveth, The Lord taketh away. I trust myself Always to you and to your courtesy. Only remember that I cling somewhat Affectionately to the old tradition."— "I understand you and your part," said Avon; "And I dare say it's well enough, tonight, We play around the circumstance a little. I've read of men that half way to the stake Would have their little joke. It's well enough; Rather a waste of time, but well enough." I listened as I waited, and heard steps Outside of one who paused and then went on; And, having heard, I might as well have seen The fear in his wife's eyes. He gazed away, As I could see, in helpless thought of her, And said to me: "Well, then, it was like this. Some tales will have a deal of going back In them before they are begun. But this one Begins in the beginning—when he came. I was a boy at school, sixteen years old, And on my way, in all appearances, To mark an even-tempered average Among the major mediocrities Who serve and earn with no especial noise Or vast reward. I saw myself, even then, A light for no high shining; and I feared COLLECTED POEMS No boy or man—having, in truth, no cause. I was enough a leader to be free, And not enough a hero to be jealous. Having eyes and ears, I knew that I was envied, And as a proper sort of compensation Had envy of my own for two or three— But never felt, and surely never gave, The wound of any more malevolence Than decent youth, defeated for a day, May take to bed with him and kill with sleep. So, and so far, my days were going well, And would have gone so, but for the black tiger That many of us fancy is in waiting, But waits for most of us in fancy only. For me there was no fancy in his coming, Though God knows I had never summoned him, Or thought of him. To this day I'm adrift And in the dark, out of all reckoning, To find a reason why he ever was, Or what was ailing Fate when he was born On this alleged God-ordered earth of ours. Now and again there comes one of his kind— By chance, we say. I leave all that to you. Whether it was an evil chance alone, Or some invidious juggling of the stars, Or some accrued arrears of ancestors Who throve on debts that I was here to pay, Or sins within me that I knew not of, Or just a foretaste of what waits in hell For those of us who cannot love a worm,— Whatever it was, or whence or why it was, One day there came a stranger to the school. And having had one mordacious glimpse of him That filled my eyes and was to fill my life, I have known Peace only as one more word AVON'S HARVEST Among the many others we say over That have an airy credit of no meaning. One of these days, if I were seeing many To live, I might erect a cenotaph To Job's wife. I assume that you remember; If you forget, she's extant in your Bible." Now this was not the language of a man Whom I had known as Avon, and I winced Hearing it—though I knew that in my heart There was no visitation of surprise. Unwelcome as it was, and off the key Calamitously, it overlived a silence That was itself a story and affirmed A savage emphasis of honesty That I would only gladly have attuned If possible, to vinous innovation. But his indifferent wassailing was always Too far within the measure of excess For that; and then there were those eyes of his. Avon indeed had kept his word with me, And there was not much yet to make me happy. "So there we were," he said, "we two together, Breathing one air. And how shall I go on To say by what machinery the slow net Of my fantastic and increasing hate Was ever woven as it was around us? I cannot answer; and you need not ask What undulating reptile he was like, For such a worm as I discerned in him Was never yet on earth or in the ocean, Or anywhere else than in my sense of him. Had all I made of him been tangible, The Lord must have invented long ago COLLECTED POEMS Some private and unspeakable new monster Equipped for such a thing's extermination; Whereon the monster, seeing no other monster Worth biting, would have died with his work done. There's a humiliation in it now, As there was then, and worse than there was then; For then there was the boy to shoulder it Without the sickening weight of added years Galling him to the grave. Beware of hate That has no other boundary than the grave Made for it, or for ourselves. Beware, I say; And I'm a sorry one, I fear, to say it, Though for the moment we may let that go And while I'm interrupting my own story I'll ask of you the favor of a look Into the street. I like it when it's empty. There's only one man walking? Let him walk. I wish to God that all men might walk always, And so, being busy, love one another more." "Avon," I said, now in my chair again, "Although I may not be here to be happy, If you are careless, I may have to laugh. I have disliked a few men in my life, But never to the scope of wishing them To this particular pedestrian hell Of your affection. I should not like that. Forgive me, for this time it was your fault." He drummed with all his fingers on his chair, And, after a made smile of acquiescence, Took up again the theme of his aversion, Which now had flown along with him alone For twenty years, like Io's evil insect, To sting him when it would. The decencies AVON'S HARVEST Forbade that I should look at him for ever, Yet many a time I found myself ashamed Of a long staring at him, and as often Essayed the dictionary on the table, Wondering if in its interior There was an uncompanionable word To say just what was creeping in my hair, At which my scalp would shrink,—at which, again, I would arouse myself with a vain scorn, Remembering that all this was in New York— As if that were somehow the banishing For ever of all unseemly presences— And listen to the story of my friend, Who, as I feared, was not for me to save, And, as I knew, knew also that I feared it. "Humiliation," he began again, "May be or not the best of all bad names I might employ; and if you scent remorse, There may be growing such a flower as that In the unsightly garden where I planted, Not knowing the seed or what was coming of it. I've done much wondering if I planted it; But our poor wonder, when it comes too late, Fights with a lath, and one that solid fact Breaks while it yawns and looks another way For a less negligible adversary. Away with wonder, then; though I'm at odds With conscience, even tonight, for good assurance That it was I, or chance and I together, Did all that sowing. If I seem to you To be a little bitten by the question, Without a miracle it might be true; The miracle is to me that I'm not eaten Long since to death of it, and that you sit COLLECTED POEMS With nothing more agreeable than a ghost. If you had thought a while of that, you might, Unhappily, not have come; and your not coming Would have been desolation—not for you, God save the mark!—for I would have you here. I shall not be alone with you to listen; And I should be far less alone tonight With you away, make what you will of that. "I said that we were going back to school, And we may say that we are there—with him. This fellow had no friend, and, as for that, No sign of an apparent need of one, Save always and alone—myself. He fixed His heart and eyes on me, insufferably,— And in a sort of Nemesis-like way, Invincibly. Others who might have given A welcome even to him, or I'll suppose so— Adorning an unfortified assumption With gold that might come off with afterthought— Got never, if anything, more out of him Than a word flung like refuse in their faces, And rarely that. For God knows what good reason, He lavished his whole altered arrogance On me; and with an overweening skill, Which had sometimes almost a cringing in it, Found a few flaws in my tight mail of hate And slowly pricked a poison into me In which at first I failed at recognizing An unfamiliar subtle sort of pity. But so it was, and I believe he knew it; Though even to dream it would have been absurd— Until I knew it, and there was no need Of dreaming. For the fellow's indolence, And his malignant oily swarthiness AVON'S HARVEST Housing a reptile blood that I could see Beneath it, like hereditary venom Out of old human swamps, hardly revealed Itself the proper spawning-ground of pity. But so it was. Pity, or something like it, Was in the poison of his proximity; For nothing else that I have any name for Could have invaded and so mastered me With a slow tolerance that eventually Assumed a blind ascendency of custom That saw not even itself. When I came in, Often I'd find him strewn along my couch Like an amorphous lizard with its clothes on, Reading a book and waiting for its dinner. His clothes were always odiously in order, Yet I should not have thought of him as clean— Not even if he had washed himself to death Proving it. There was nothing right about him. Then he would search, never quite satisfied, Though always in a measure confident, My eyes to find a welcome waiting in them, Unwilling, as I see him now, to know That it would never be there. Looking back, I am not sure that he would not have died For me, if I were drowning or on fire, Or that I would not rather have let myself Die twice than owe the debt of my survival To him, though he had lost not even his clothes. No, there was nothing right about that fellow; And after twenty years to think of him I should be quite as helpless now to serve him As I was then. I mean—without my story. Be patient, and you'll see just what I mean— Which is to say, you won't. But you can listen, And that's itself a large accomplishment COLLECTED POEMS Uncrowned; and may be, at a time like this, A mighty charity. It was in January This evil genius came into our school, And it was June when he went out of it— If I may say that he was wholly out Of any place that I was in thereafter. But he was not yet gone. When we are told By Fate to bear what we may never bear, Fate waits a little while to see what happens; And this time it was only for the season Between the swift midwinter holidays And the long progress into weeks and months Of all the days that followed—with him there To make them longer. I would have given an eye, Before the summer came, to know for certain That I should never be condemned again To see him with the other; and all the while There was a battle going on within me Of hate that fought remorse—if you must have it— Never to win, . . . never to win but once, And having won, to lose disastrously, And as it was to prove, interminably— Or till an end of living may annul, If so it be, the nameless obligation That I have not the Christian revenue In me to pay. A man who has no gold, Or an equivalent, shall pay no gold Until by chance or labor or contrivance He makes it his to pay; and he that has No kindlier commodity than hate, Glossed with a pity that belies itself In its negation and lacks alchemy To fuse itself to—love, would you have me say? I don't believe it. No, there is no such word. If I say tolerance, there's no more to say. AVON'S HARVEST And he who sickens even in saying that— What coin of God has he to pay the toll To peace on earth? Good will to men—oh, yes! That's easy; and it means no more than sap, Until we boil the water out of it Over the fire of sacrifice. I'll do it; And in a measurable way I've done it— But not for him. What are you smiling at? Well, so it went until a day in June. We were together under an old elm, Which now, I hope, is gone—though it's a crime In me that I should have to wish the death Of such a tree as that. There were no trees Like those that grew at school—until he came. We stood together under it that day, When he, by some ungovernable chance, All foreign to the former crafty care That he had used never to cross my favor, Told of a lie that stained a friend of mine With a false blot that a few days washed off. A trifle now, but a boy's honor then— Which then was everything. There were some words Between us, but I don't remember them. All I remember is a bursting flood Of half a year's accumulated hate, And his incredulous eyes before I struck him. He had gone once too far; and when he knew it, He knew it was all over; and I struck him. Pound for pound, he was the better brute; But bulking in the way then of my fist And all there was alive in me to drive it, Three of him misbegotten into one Would have gone down like him—and being larger, Might have bled more, if that were necessary. He came up soon; and if I live for ever, COLLECTED POEMS The vengeance in his eyes, and a weird gleam Of desolation—if I make you see it— Will be before me as it is tonight. I shall not ever know how long it was I waited his attack that never came; It might have been an instant or an hour That I stood ready there, watching his eyes, And the tears running out of them. They made Me sick, those tears; for I knew, miserably, They were not there for any pain he felt. I do not think he felt the pain at all. He felt the blow. . . . Oh, the whole thing was bad— So bad that even the bleaching suns and rains Of years that wash away to faded lines, Or blot out wholly, the sharp wrongs and ills Of youth, have had no cleansing agent in them To dim the picture. I still see him going Away from where I stood; and I shall see him Longer, sometime, than I shall see the face Of whosoever watches by the bed On which I die—given I die that way. I doubt if he could reason his advantage In living any longer after that Among the rest of us. The lad he slandered, Or gave a negative immunity No better than a stone he might have thrown Behind him at his head, was of the few I might have envied; and for that being known, My fury became sudden history, And I a sudden hero. But the crown I wore was hot; and I would happily Have hurled it, if I could, so far away That over my last hissing glimpse of it There might have closed an ocean. He went home The next day, and the same unhappy chance AVON'S HARVEST That first had fettered me and my aversion To his unprofitable need of me Brought us abruptly face to face again Beside the carriage that had come for him. We met, and for a moment we were still— Together. But I was reading in his eyes More than I read at college or at law In years that followed. There was blankly nothing For me to say, if not that I was sorry; And that was more than hate would let me say— Whatever the truth might be. At last he spoke, And I could see the vengeance in his eyes, And a cold sorrow—which, if I had seen Much more of it, might yet have mastered me. But I would see no more of it. `Well, then,' He said, `have you thought yet of anything Worth saying? If so, there's time. If you are silent, I shall know where you are until you die.' I can still hear him saying those words to me Again, without a loss or an addition; I know, for I have heard them ever since. And there was in me not an answer for them Save a new roiling silence. Once again I met his look, and on his face I saw There was a twisting in the swarthiness That I had often sworn to be the cast Of his ophidian mind. He had no soul. There was to be no more of him—not then. The carriage rolled away with him inside, Leaving the two of us alive together In the same hemisphere to hate each other. I don't know now whether he's here alive, Or whether he's here dead. But that, of course, As you would say, is only a tired man's fancy. You know that I have driven the wheels too fast COLLECTED POEMS Of late, and all for gold I do not need. When are we mortals to be sensible, Paying no more for life than life is worth? Better for us, no doubt, we do not know How much we pay or what it is we buy." He waited, gazing at me as if asking The worth of what the universe had for sale For one confessed remorse. Avon, I knew, Had driven the wheels too fast, and not for gold. "If you had given him then your hand," I said, "And spoken, though it strangled you, the truth, I should not have the melancholy honor Of sitting here alone with you this evening. If only you had shaken hands with him, And said the truth, he would have gone his way, And you your way. He might have wished you dead, But he would not have made you miserable. At least," I added, indefensibly, "That's what I hope is true." He pitied me, But had the magnanimity not to say so. "If only we had shaken hands," he said, "And I had said the truth, we might have been In half a moment rolling on the gravel. If I had said the truth, I should have said That never at any moment on the clock Above us in the tower since his arrival Had I been in a more proficient mood To throttle him. If you had seen his eyes As I did, and if you had seen his face At work as I did, you might understand. I was ashamed of it, as I am now, But that's the prelude to another theme; AVON'S HARVEST For now I'm saying only what had happened If I had taken his hand and said the truth. The wise have cautioned us that where there's hate There's also fear. The wise are right sometimes. There may be now, but there was no fear then. There was just hatred, hauled up out of hell For me to writhe in; and I writhed in it." I saw that he was writhing in it still; But having a magnanimity myself, I waited. There was nothing else to do But wait, and to remember that his tale, Though well along, as I divined it was, Yet hovered among shadows and regrets Of twenty years ago. When he began Again to speak, I felt them coming nearer. "Whenever your poet or your philosopher Has nothing richer for us," he resumed, "He burrows among remnants, like a mouse In a waste-basket, and with much dry noise Comes up again, having found Time at the bottom And filled himself with its futility. `Time is at once,' he says, to startle us, `A poison for us, if we make it so, And, if we make it so, an antidote For the same poison that afflicted us.' I'm witness to the poison, but the cure Of my complaint is not, for me, in Time. There may be doctors in eternity To deal with it, but they are not here now. There's no specific for my three diseases That I could swallow, even if I should find it, And I shall never find it here on earth." COLLECTED POEMS "Mightn't it be as well, my friend," I said, "For you to contemplate the uncompleted With not such an infernal certainty?" "And mightn't it be as well for you, my friend," Said Avon, "to be quiet while I go on? When I am done, then you may talk all night— Like a physician who can do no good, But knows how soon another would have his fee Were he to tell the truth. Your fee for this Is in my gratitude and my affection; And I'm not eager to be calling in Another to take yours away from you, Whatever it's worth. I like to think I know. Well then, again. The carriage rolled away With him inside; and so it might have gone For ten years rolling on, with him still in it, For all it was I saw of him. Sometimes I heard of him, but only as one hears Of leprosy in Boston or New York And wishes it were somewhere else. He faded Out of my scene—yet never quite out of it: `I shall know where you are until you die,' Were his last words; and they are the same words That I received thereafter once a year, Infallibly on my birthday, with no name; Only a card, and the words printed on it. No, I was never rid of him—not quite; Although on shipboard, on my way from here To Hamburg, I believe that I forgot him. But once ashore, I should have been half ready To meet him there, risen up out of the ground, With hoofs and horns and tail and everything. Believe me, there was nothing right about him, AVON'S HARVEST Though it was not in Hamburg that I found him. Later, in Rome, it was we found each other, For the first time since we had been at school. There was the same slow vengeance in his eyes When he saw mine, and there was a vicious twist On his amphibious face that might have been On anything else a smile—rather like one We look for on the stage than in the street. I must have been a yard away from him Yet as we passed I felt the touch of him Like that of something soft in a dark room. There's hardly need of saying that we said nothing, Or that we gave each other an occasion For more than our eyes uttered. He was gone Before I knew it, like a solid phantom; And his reality was for me some time In its achievement—given that one's to be Convinced that such an incubus at large Was ever quite real. The season was upon us When there are fitter regions in the world— Though God knows he would have been safe enough Than Rome for strayed Americans to live in, And when the whips of their itineraries Hurry them north again. I took my time, Since I was paying for it, and leisurely Went where I would—though never again to move Without him at my elbow or behind me. My shadow of him, wherever I found myself, Might horribly as well have been the man— Although I should have been afraid of him No more than of a large worm in a salad. I should omit the salad, certainly, And wish the worm elsewhere. And so he was, In fact; yet as I go on to grow older, I question if there's anywhere a fact COLLECTED POEMS That isn't the malevolent existence Of one man who is dead, or is not dead, Or what the devil it is that he may be. There must be, I suppose, a fact somewhere, But I don't know it. I can only tell you That later, when to all appearances I stood outside a music-hall in London, I felt him and then saw that he was there. Yes, he was there, and had with him a woman Who looked as if she didn't know. I'm sorry To this day for that woman—who, no doubt, Is doing well. Yes, there he was again; There were his eyes and the same vengeance in them That I had seen in Rome and twice before— Not mentioning all the time, or most of it, Between the day I struck him and that evening. That was the worst show that I ever saw, But you had better see it for yourself Before you say so too. I went away, Though not for any fear that I could feel Of him or of his worst manipulations, But only to be out of the same air That made him stay alive in the same world With all the gentlemen that were in irons For uncommendable extravagances That I should reckon slight compared with his Offence of being. Distance would have made him A moving fly-speck on the map of life,— But he would not be distant, though his flesh And bone might have been climbing Fujiyama Or Chimborazo—with me there in London, Or sitting here. My doom it was to see him, Be where I might. That was ten years ago; And having waited season after season His always imminent evil recrudescence, AVON'S HARVEST And all for nothing, I was waiting still, When the Titanic touched a piece of ice And we were for a moment where we are, With nature laughing at us. When the noise Had spent itself to names, his was among them; And I will not insult you or myself With a vain perjury. I was far from cold. It seemed as for the first time in my life I knew the blessedness of being warm; And I remember that I had a drink, Having assuredly no need of it. Pity a fool for his credulity, If so you must. But when I found his name Among the dead, I trusted once the news; And after that there were no messages In ambush waiting for me on my brithday. There was no vestige yet of any fear, You understand—if that's why you are smiling." I said that I had not so much as whispered The name aloud of any fear soever, And that I smiled at his unwonted plunge Into the perilous pool of Dionysus. "Well, if you are so easily diverted As that," he said, drumming his chair again, "You will be pleased, I think, with what is coming; And though there be divisions and departures, Imminent from now on, for your diversion I'll do the best I can. More to the point, I know a man who if his friends were like him Would live in the woods all summer and all winter, Leaving the town and its iniquities To die of their own dust. But having his wits, Henceforth he may conceivably avoid COLLECTED POEMS The adventure unattended. Last October He took me with him into the Maine woods, Where, by the shore of a primeval lake, With woods all round it, and a voyage away From anything wearing clothes, he had reared somehow A lodge, or camp, with a stone chimney in it, And a wide fireplace to make men forget Their sins who sat before it in the evening, Hearing the wind outside among the trees And the black water washing on the shore. I never knew the meaning of October Until I went with Asher to that place, Which I shall not investigate again Till I be taken there by other forces Than are innate in my economy. `You may not like it,' Asher said, `but Asher Knows what is good. So put your faith in Asher, And come along with him.' He's an odd bird, Yet I could wish for the world's decency There might be more of him. And so it was I found myself, at first incredulous, Down there with Asher in the wilderness, Alive at last with a new liberty And with no sore to fester. He perceived In me an altered favor of God's works, And promptly took upon himself the credit, Which, in a fashion, was as accurate As one's interpretation of another Is like to be. So for a frosty fortnight We had the sunlight with us on the lake, And the moon with us when the sun was down. `God gave his adjustants a holiday,' Asher assured me, `when He made this place'; And I agreed with him that it was heaven,— Till it was hell for me for then and after. AVON'S HARVEST "There was a village miles away from us Where now and then we paddled for the mail And incidental small commodities That perfect exile might require, and stayed The night after the voyage with an antique Survival of a broader world than ours Whom Asher called The Admiral. This time, A little out of sorts and out of tune With paddling, I let Asher go alone, Sure that his heart was happy. Then it was That hell came. I sat gazing over there Across the water, watching the sun's last fire Above those gloomy and indifferent trees That might have been a wall around the world, When suddenly, like faces over the lake, Out of the silence of that other shore I was aware of hidden presences That soon, no matter how many of them there were, Would all be one. I could not look behind me, Where I could hear that one of them was breathing, For, if I did, those others over there Might all see that at last I was afraid; And I might hear them without seeing them, Seeing that other one. You were not there; And it is well for you that you don't know What they are like when they should not be there. And there were chilly doubts of whether or not I should be seeing the rest that I should see With eyes, or otherwise. I could not be sure; And as for going over to find out, All I may tell you now is that my fear Was not the fear of dying, though I knew soon That all the gold in all the sunken ships That have gone down since Tyre would not have paid For me the ferriage of myself alone COLLECTED POEMS To that infernal shore. I was in hell, Remember; and if you have never been there You may as well not say how easy it is To find the best way out. There may not be one. Well, I was there; and I was there alone— Alone for the first time since I was born; And I was not alone. That's what it is To be in hell. I hope you will not go there. All through that slow, long, desolating twilight Of incoherent certainties, I waited; Never alone—never to be alone; And while the night grew down upon me there, I thought of old Prometheus in the story That I had read at school, and saw mankind All huddled into clusters in the dark, Calling to God for light. There was a light Coming for them, but there was none for me Until a shapeless remnant of a moon Rose after midnight over the black trees Behind me. I should hardly have confessed The heritage then of my identity To my own shadow; for I was powerless there, As I am here. Say what you like to say To silence, but say none of it to me Tonight. To say it now would do no good, And you are here to listen. Beware of hate, And listen. Beware of hate, remorse, and fear, And listen. You are staring at the damned, But yet you are no more the one than he To say that it was he alone who planted The flower of death now growing in his garden. Was it enough, I wonder, that I struck him? I shall say nothing. I shall have to wait Until I see what's coming, if it comes, When I'm a delver in another garden— AVON'S HARVEST If such an one there be. If there be none, All's well—and over. Rather a vain expense, One might affirm—yet there is nothing lost. Science be praised that there is nothing lost." I'm glad the venom that was on his tongue May not go down on paper; and I'm glad No friend of mine alive, far as I know, Has a tale waiting for me with an end Like Avon's. There was here an interruption, Though not a long one—only while we heard, As we had heard before, the ghost of steps Faintly outside. We knew that she was there Again; and though it was a kindly folly, I wished that Avon's wife would go to sleep. "I was afraid, this time, but not of man— Or man as you may figure him," he said. "It was not anything my eyes had seen That I could feel around me in the night, There by that lake. If I had been alone, There would have been the joy of being free, Which in imagination I had won With unimaginable expiation— But I was not alone. If you had seen me, Waiting there for the dark and looking off Over the gloom of that relentless water, Which had the stillness of the end of things That evening on it, I might well have made For you the picture of the last man left Where God, in his extinction of the rest, Had overlooked him and forgotten him. Yet I was not alone. Interminably The minutes crawled along and over me, Slow, cold, intangible, and invisible, COLLECTED POEMS As if they had come up out of that water. How long I sat there I shall never know, For time was hidden out there in the black lake, Which now I could see only as a glimpse Of black light by the shore. There were no stars To mention, and the moon was hours away Behind me. There was nothing but myself, And what was coming. On my breast I felt The touch of death, and I should have died then. I ruined good Asher's autumn as it was, For he will never again go there alone, If ever he goes at all. Nature did ill To darken such a faith in her as his, Though he will have it that I had the worst Of her defection, and will hear no more Apologies. If it had to be for someone, I think it well for me it was for Asher. I dwell on him, meaning that you may know him Before your last horn blows. He has a name That's like a tree, and therefore like himself— By which I mean you find him where you leave him. I saw him and The Admiral together While I was in the dark, but they were far— Far as around the world from where I was; And they knew nothing of what I saw not While I knew only I was not alone. I made a fire to make the place alive, And locked the door. But even the fire was dead, And all the life there was was in the shadow It made of me. My shadow was all of me; The rest had had its day, and there was night Remaining—only night, that's made for shadows, Shadows and sleep and dreams, or dreams without it. The fire went slowly down, and now the moon, Or that late wreck of it, was coming up; AVON'S HARVEST And though it was a martyr's work to move, I must obey my shadow, and I did. There were two beds built low against the wall, And down on one of them, with all my clothes on, Like a man getting into his own grave, I lay—and waited. As the firelight sank, The moonlight, which had partly been consumed By the black trees, framed on the other wall A glimmering window not far from the ground. The coals were going, and only a few sparks Were there to tell of them; and as they died The window lightened, and I saw the trees. They moved a little, but I could not move, More than to turn my face the other way; And then, if you must have it so, I slept. We'll call it so—if sleep is your best name For a sort of conscious, frozen catalepsy Wherein a man sees all there is around him As if it were not real, and he were not Alive. You may call it anything you please That made me powerless to move hand or foot, Or to make any other living motion Than after a long horror, without hope, To turn my face again the other way. Some force that was not mine opened my eyes, And, as I knew it must be,—it was there." Avon covered his eyes—whether to shut The memory and the sight of it away, Or to be sure that mine were for the moment Not searching his with pity, is now no matter. My glance at him was brief, turning itself To the familiar pattern of his rug, Wherein I may have sought a consolation— As one may gaze in sorrow on a shell, COLLECTED POEMS Or a small apple. So it had come, I thought; And heard, no longer with a wonderment, The faint recurring footsteps of his wife, Who, knowing less than I knew, yet knew more. Now I could read, I fancied, through the fear That latterly was living in her eyes, To the sure source of its authority. But he went on, and I was there to listen: "And though I saw it only as a blot Between me and my life, it was enough To make me know that he was watching there— Waiting for me to move, or not to move, Before he moved. Sick as I was with hate Reborn, and chained with fear that was more than fear, I would have gambled all there was to gain Or lose in rising there from where I lay And going out after it. `Before the dawn,' I reasoned, `there will be a difference here. Therefore it may as well be done outside.' And then I found I was immovable, As I had been before; and a dead sweat Rolled out of me as I remembered him When I had seen him leaving me at school. `I shall know where you are until you die,' Were the last words that I had heard him say; And there he was. Now I could see his face, And all the sad, malignant desperation That was drawn on it after I had struck him, And on my memory since that afternoon. But all there was left now for me to do Was to lie there and see him while he squeezed His unclean outlines into the dim room, And half erect inside, like a still beast With a face partly man's, came slowly on AVON'S HARVEST Along the floor to the bed where I lay, And waited. There had been so much of waiting, Through all those evil years before my respite— Which now I knew and recognized at last As only his more venomous preparation For the vile end of a deceiving peace— That I began to fancy there was on me The stupor that explorers have alleged As evidence of nature's final mercy When tigers have them down upon the earth And wild hot breath is heavy on their faces. I could not feel his breath, but I could hear it; Though fear had made an anvil of my heart Where demons, for the joy of doing it, Were sledging death down on it. And I saw His eyes now, as they were, for the first time— Aflame as they had never been before With all their gathered vengeance gleaming in them, And always that unconscionable sorrow That would not die behind it. Then I caught The shadowy glimpse of an uplifted arm, And a moon-flash of metal. That was all. . . . "When I believed I was alive again I was with Asher and The Admiral, Whom Asher had brought with him for a day With nature. They had found me when they came; And there was not much left of me to find. I had not moved or known that I was there Since I had seen his eyes and felt his breath; And it was not for some uncertain hours After they came that either would say how long That might have been. It should have been much longer. All you may add will be your own invention, For I have told you all there is to tell. COLLECTED POEMS Tomorrow I shall have another birthday, And with it there may come another message— Although I cannot see the need of it, Or much more need of drowning, if that's all Men drown for—when they drown. You know as much As I know about that, though I've a right, If not a reason, to be on my guard; And only God knows what good that will do. Now you may get some air. Good night!—and thank you." He smiled, but I would rather he had not. I wished that Avon's wife would go to sleep, But whether she found sleep that night or not I do not know. I was awake for hours, Toiling in vain to let myself believe That Avon's apparition was a dream, And that he might have added, for romance, The part that I had taken home with me For reasons not in Avon's dictionary. But each recurrent memory of his eyes, And of the man himself that I had known So long and well, made soon of all my toil An evanescent and a vain evasion; And it was half as in expectancy That I obeyed the summons of his wife A little before dawn, and was again With Avon in the room where I had left him, But not with the same Avon I had left. The doctor, an august authority, With eminence abroad as well as here, Looked hard at me as if I were the doctor And he the friend. "I have had eyes on Avon For more than half a year," he said to me, "And I have wondered often what it was MR. FLOOD'S PARTY That I could see that I was not to see. Though he was in the chair where you are looking, I told his wife—I had to tell her something— It was a nightmare and an aneurism; And so, or partly so, I'll say it was. The last without the first will be enough For the newspapers and the undertaker; Yet if we doctors were not all immune From death, disease, and curiosity, My diagnosis would be sorry for me. He died, you know, because he was afraid— And he had been afraid for a long time; And we who knew him well would all agree To fancy there was rather more than fear. The door was locked inside—they broke it in To find him—but she heard him when it came. There are no signs of any visitors, Or need of them. If I were not a child Of science, I should say it was the devil. I don't believe it was another woman, And surely it was not another man." MR. FLOOD'S PARTY Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night Over the hill between the town below And the forsaken upland hermitage That held as much as he should ever know On earth again of home, paused warily. The road was his with not a native near; And Eben, having leisure, said aloud, For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear: COLLECTED POEMS "Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon Again, and we may not have many more; The bird is on the wing, the poet says, And you and I have said it here before. Drink to the bird." He raised up to the light The jug that he had gone so far to fill, And answered huskily: "Well, Mr. Flood, Since you propose it, I believe I will." Alone, as if enduring to the end A valiant armor of scarred hopes outworn, He stood there in the middle of the road Like Roland's ghost winding a silent horn. Below him, in the town among the trees, Where friends of other days had honored him, A phantom salutation of the dead Rang thinly till old Eben's eyes were dim. Then, as a mother lays her sleeping child Down tenderly, fearing it may awake, He set the jug down slowly at his feet With trembling care, knowing that most things break; And only when assured that on firm earth It stood, as the uncertain lives of men Assuredly did not, he paced away, And with his hand extended paused again: "Well, Mr. Flood, we have not met like this In a long time; and many a change has come To both of us, I fear, since last it was We had a drop together. Welcome home!" Convivially returning with himself, Again he raised the jug up to the light; And with an acquiescent quaver said: "Well, Mr. Flood, if you insist, I might. BEN TROVATO "Only a very little, Mr. Flood— For auld lang syne. No more, sir; that will do." So, for the time, apparently it did, And Eben evidently thought so too; For soon amid the silver loneliness Of night he lifted up his voice and sang, Secure, with only two moons listening, Until the whole harmonious landscape rang— "For auld lang syne." The weary throat gave out, The last word wavered; and the song being done, He raised again the jug regretfully And shook his head, and was again alone. There was not much that was ahead of him, And there was nothing in the town below— Where strangers would have shut the many doors That many friends had opened long ago. BEN TROVATO The deacon thought. "I know them," he began, "And they are all you ever heard of them— Allurable to no sure theorem, The scorn or the humility of man. You say `Can I believe it?'—and I can; And I'm unwilling even to condemn The benefaction of a stratagem Like hers—and I'm a Presbyterian. "Though blind, with but a wandering hour to live, He felt the other woman in the fur That now the wife had on. Could she forgive All that? Apparently. Her rings were gone, COLLECTED POEMS Of course; and when he found that she had none, He smiled—as he had never smiled at her." THE TREE IN PAMELA'S GARDEN Pamela was too gentle to deceive Her roses. "Let the men stay where they are," She said, "and if Apollo's avatar Be one of them, I shall not have to grieve." And so she made all Tilbury Town believe She sighed a little more for the North Star Than over men, and only in so far As she was in a garden was like Eve. Her neighbors—doing all that neighbors can To make romance of reticence meanwhile— Seeing that she had never loved a man, Wished Pamela had a cat, or a small bird, And only would have wondered at her smile Could they have seen that she had overheard. VAIN GRATUITIES Never was there a man much uglier In eyes of other women, or more grim: "The Lord has filled her chalice to the brim, So let us pray she's a philosopher," They said; and there was more they said of her— Deeming it, after twenty years with him, No wonder that she kept her figure slim And always made you think of lavender. LOST ANCHORS But she, demure as ever, and as fair, Almost, as they remembered her before She found him, would have laughed had she been there; And all they said would have been heard no more Than foam that washes on an island shore Where there are none to listen or to care. JOB THE REJECTED They met, and overwhelming her distrust With penitence, he praised away her fear; They married, and Job gave him half a year To wreck the temple, as we knew he must. He fumbled hungrily to readjust A fallen altar, but the road was clear By which it was her will to disappear That evening when Job found him in the dust. Job would have deprecated such a way Of heaving fuel on a sacred fire, Yet even the while we saw it going out, Hardly was Job to find his hour to shout; And Job was not, so far as we could say, The confirmation of her soul's desire. LOST ANCHORS Like a dry fish flung inland far from shore, There lived a sailor, warped and ocean-browned, Who told of an old vessel, harbor-drowned And out of mind a century before, COLLECTED POEMS Where divers, on descending to explore A legend that had lived its way around The world of ships, in the dark hulk had found Anchors, which had been seized and seen no more. Improving a dry leisure to invest Their misadventure with a manifest Analogy that he may read who runs, The sailor made it old as ocean grass— Telling of much that once had come to pass With him, whose mother should have had no sons. RECALLED Long after there were none of them alive About the place—where there is now no place But a walled hole where fruitless vines embrace Their parent skeletons that yet survive In evil thorns—none of us could arrive At a more cogent answer to their ways Than one old Isaac in his latter days Had humor or compassion to contrive. I mentioned them, and Isaac shook his head: "The Power that you call yours and I call mine Extinguished in the last of them a line That Satan would have disinherited. When we are done with all but the Divine, We die." And there was no more to be said. MODERNITIES Small knowledge have we that by knowledge met May not some day be quaint as any told In almagest or chronicle of old, AFTERTHOUGHTS Whereat we smile because we are as yet The last—though not the last who may forget What cleavings and abrasions manifold Have marked an armor that was never scrolled Before for human glory and regret. With infinite unseen enemies in the way We have encountered the intangible, To vanquish where our fathers, who fought well, Scarce had assumed endurance for a day; Yet we shall have our darkness, even as they, And there shall be another tale to tell. AFTERTHOUGHTS We parted where the old gas-lamp still burned Under the wayside maple and walked on, Into the dark, as we had always done; And I, no doubt, if he had not returned, Might yet be unaware that he had earned More than earth gives to many who have won More than it has to give when they are gone— As duly and indelibly I learned. The sum of all that he came back to say Was little then, and would be less today: With him there were no Delphic heights to climb, Yet his were somehow nearer the sublime. He spoke, and went again by the old way— Not knowing it would be for the last time. COLLECTED POEMS CAPUT MORTUUM Not even if with a wizard force I might Have summoned whomsoever I would name, Should anyone else have come than he who came, Uncalled, to share with me my fire that night; For though I should have said that all was right, Or right enough, nothing had been the same As when I found him there before the flame, Always a welcome and a useful sight. Unfailing and exuberant all the time, Having no gold he paid with golden rhyme, Of older coinage than his old defeat, A debt that like himself was obsolete In Art's long hazard, where no man may choose Whether he play to win or toil to lose. MONADNOCK THROUGH THE TREES Before there was in Egypt any sound Of those who reared a more prodigious means For the self-heavy sleep of kings and queens Than hitherto had mocked the most renowned,— Unvisioned here and waiting to be found, Alone, amid remote and older scenes, You loomed above ancestral evergreens Before there were the first of us around. And when the last of us, if we know how, See farther from ourselves than we do now, Assured with other sight than heretofore MANY ARE CALLED That we have done our mortal best and worst,— Your calm will be the same as when the first Assyrians went howling south to war. THE LONG RACE Up the old hill to the old house again Where fifty years ago the friend was young Who should be waiting somewhere there among Old things that least remembered most remain, He toiled on with a pleasure that was pain To think how soon asunder would be flung The curtain half a century had hung Between the two ambitions they had slain. They dredged an hour for words, and then were done. "Good-bye! . . . You have the same old weather-vane— Your little horse that's always on the run." And all the way down back to the next train, Down the old hill to the old road again, It seemed as if the little horse had won. MANY ARE CALLED The Lord Apollo, who has never died, Still holds alone his immemorial reign, Supreme in an impregnable domain That with his magic he has fortified; And though melodious multitudes have tried In ecstasy, in anguish, and in vain, COLLECTED POEMS With invocation sacred and profane To lure him, even the loudest are outside. Only at unconjectured intervals, By will of him on whom no man may gaze, By word of him whose law no man has read, A questing light may rift the sullen walls, To cling where mostly its infrequent rays Fall golden on the patience of the dead. REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT (Amsterdam, 1645) And there you are again, now as you are. Observe yourself as you discern yourself In your discredited ascendency; Without your velvet or your feathers now, Commend your new condition to your fate, And your conviction to the sieves of time. Meanwhile appraise yourself, Rembrandt van Ryn, Now as you are—formerly more or less Distinguished in the civil scenery, And once a painter. There you are again, Where you may see that you have on your shoulders No lovelier burden for an ornament Than one man's head that's yours. Praise be to God That you have that; for you are like enough To need it now, my friend, and from now on; For there are shadows and obscurities Immediate or impending on your view, That may be worse than you have ever painted For the bewildered and unhappy scorn REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT Of injured Hollanders in Amsterdam Who cannot find their fifty florins' worth Of Holland face where you have hidden it In your new golden shadow that excites them, Or see that when the Lord made color and light He made not one thing only, or believe That shadows are not nothing. Saskia said, Before she died, how they would swear at you, And in commiseration at themselves. She laughed a little, too, to think of them— And then at me. . . . That was before she died. And I could wonder, as I look at you, There as I have you now, there as you are, Or nearly so as any skill of mine Has ever caught you in a bilious mirror,— Yes, I could wonder long, and with a reason, If all but everything achievable In me were not achieved and lost already, Like a fool's gold. But you there in the glass, And you there on the canvas, have a sort Of solemn doubt about it; and that's well For Rembrandt and for Titus. All that's left Of all that was is here; and all that's here Is one man who remembers, and one child Beginning to forget. One, two, and three, The others died, and then—then Saskia died; And then, so men believe, the painter died. So men believe. So it all comes at once. And here's a fellow painting in the dark,— A loon who cannot see that he is dead Before God lets him die. He paints away At the impossible, so Holland has it, For venom or for spite, or for defection, Or else for God knows what. Well, if God knows, COLLECTED POEMS And Rembrandt knows, it matters not so much What Holland knows or cares. If Holland wants Its heads all in a row, and all alike, There's Franz to do them and to do them well— Rat-catchers, archers, or apothecaries, And one as like a rabbit as another. Value received, and every Dutchman happy. All's one to Franz, and to the rest of them,— Their ways being theirs, are theirs.—But you, my friend, If I have made you something as you are, Will need those jaws and eyes and all the fight And fire that's in them, and a little more, To take you on and the world after you; For now you fare alone, without the fashion To sing you back and fling a flower or two At your accusing feet. Poor Saskia saw This coming that has come, and with a guile Of kindliness that covered half her doubts Would give me gold, and laugh . . . before she died. And if I see the road that you are going, You that are not so jaunty as aforetime, God knows if she were not appointed well To die. She might have wearied of it all Before the worst was over, or begun. A woman waiting on a man's avouch Of the invisible, may not wait always Without a word betweenwhiles, or a dash Of poison on his faith. Yes, even she. She might have come to see at last with others, And then to say with others, who say more, That you are groping on a phantom trail Determining a dusky way to nowhere; That errors unconfessed and obstinate Have teemed and cankered in you for so long REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT That even your eyes are sick, and you see light Only because you dare not see the dark That is around you and ahead of you. She might have come, by ruinous estimation Of old applause and outworn vanities, To clothe you over in a shroud of dreams, And so be nearer to the counterfeit Of her invention than aware of yours. She might, as well as any, by this time, Unwillingly and eagerly have bitten Another devil's-apple of unrest, And so, by some attendant artifice Or other, might anon have had you sharing A taste that would have tainted everything, And so had been for two, instead of one, The taste of death in life—which is the food Of art that has betrayed itself alive And is a food of hell. She might have heard Unhappily the temporary noise Of louder names than yours, and on frail urns That hardly will ensure a dwelling-place For even the dust that may be left of them, She might, and angrily, as like as not, Look soon to find your name, not finding it. She might, like many another born for joy And for sufficient fulness of the hour, Go famishing by now, and in the eyes Of pitying friends and dwindling satellites Be told of no uncertain dereliction Touching the cold offence of my decline. And even if this were so, and she were here Again to make a fact of all my fancy, How should I ask of her to see with me Through night where many a time I seem in vain To seek for new assurance of a gleam COLLECTED POEMS That comes at last, and then, so it appears, Only for you and me—and a few more, Perchance, albeit their faces are not many Among the ruins that are now around us. That was a fall, my friend, we had together— Or rather it was my house, mine alone, That fell, leaving you safe. Be glad for that. There's life in you that shall outlive my clay That's for a time alive and will in time Be nothing—but not yet. You that are there Where I have painted you are safe enough, Though I see dragons. Verily, that was a fall— A dislocating fall, a blinding fall, A fall indeed. But there are no bones broken; And even the teeth and eyes that I make out Among the shadows, intermittently, Show not so firm in their accoutrement Of terror-laden unreality As you in your neglect of their performance,— Though for their season we must humor them For what they are: devils undoubtedly, But not so parlous and implacable In their undoing of poor human triumph As easy fashion—or brief novelty That ails even while it grows, and like sick fruit Falls down anon to an indifferent earth To break with inward rot. I say all this, And I concede, in honor of your silence, A waste of innocent facility In tints of other colors than are mine. I cannot paint with words, but there's a time For most of us when words are all we have To serve our stricken souls. And here you say, "Be careful, or you may commit your soul Soon to the very devil of your denial." REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT I might have wagered on you to say that, Knowing that I believe in you too surely To spoil you with a kick or paint you over. No, my good friend, Mynheer Rembrandt van Ryn— Sometime a personage in Amsterdam, But now not much—I shall not give myself To be the sport of any dragon-spawn Of Holland, or elsewhere. Holland was hell Not long ago, and there were dragons then More to be fought than any of these we see That we may foster now. They are not real, But not for that the less to be regarded; For there are slimy tyrants born of nothing That harden slowly into seeming life And have the strength of madness. I confess, Accordingly, the wisdom of your care That I look out for them. Whether I would Or not, I must; and here we are as one With our necessity. For though you loom A little harsh in your respect of time And circumstance, and of ordained eclipse, We know together of a golden flood That with its overflow shall drown away The dikes that held it; and we know thereby That in its rising light there lives a fire No devils that are lodging here in Holland Shall put out wholly, or much agitate, Except in unofficial preparation They put out first the sun. It's well enough To think of them; wherefore I thank you, sir, Alike for your remembrance and attention. But there are demons that are longer-lived Than doubts that have a brief and evil term COLLECTED POEMS To congregate among the futile shards And architraves of eminent collapse. They are a many-favored family, All told, with not a misbegotten dwarf Among the rest that I can love so little As one occult abortion in especial Who perches on a picture (when it's done) And says, "What of it, Rembrandt, if you do?" This incubus would seem to be a sort Of chorus, indicating, for our good, The silence of the few friends that are left: "What of it, Rembrandt, even if you know?" It says again; "and you don't know for certain. What if in fifty or a hundred years They find you out? You may have gone meanwhile So greatly to the dogs that you'll not care Much what they find. If this be all you are— This unaccountable aspiring insect— You'll sleep as easy in oblivion As any sacred monk or parricide; And if, as you conceive, you are eternal, Your soul may laugh, remembering (if a soul Remembers) your befrenzied aspiration To smear with certain ochres and some oil A few more perishable ells of cloth, And once or twice, to square your vanity, Prove it was you alone that should achieve A mortal eye—that may, no less, tomorrow Show an immortal reason why today Men see no more. And what's a mortal eye More than a mortal herring, who has eyes As well as you? Why not paint herrings, Rembrandt? Or if not herrings, why not a split beef? Perceive it only in its unalloyed Integrity, and you may find in it REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT A beautified accomplishment no less Indigenous than one that appertains To gentlemen and ladies eating it. The same God planned and made you, beef and human; And one, but for His whim, might be the other." That's how he says it, Rembrandt, if you listen; He says it, and he goes. And then, sometimes, There comes another spirit in his place— One with a more engaging argument, And with a softer note for saying truth Not soft. Whether it be the truth or not, I name it so; for there's a string in me Somewhere that answers—which is natural, Since I am but a living instrument Played on by powers that are invisible. "You might go faster, if not quite so far," He says, "if in your vexed economy There lived a faculty for saying yes And meaning no, and then for doing neither; But since Apollo sees it otherwise, Your Dutchmen, who are swearing at you still For your pernicious filching of their florins, May likely curse you down their generation, Not having understood there was no malice Or grinning evil in a golden shadow That shall outshine their slight identities And hold their faces when their names are nothing. But this, as you discern, or should by now Surmise, for you is neither here nor there: You made your picture as your demon willed it; That's about all of that. Now make as many As may be to be made,—for so you will, Whatever the toll may be, and hold your light So that you see, without so much to blind you COLLECTED POEMS As even the cobweb-flash of a misgiving, Assured and certain that if you see right Others will have to see—albeit their seeing Shall irk them out of their serenity For such a time as umbrage may require. But there are many reptiles in the night That now is coming on, and they are hungry; And there's a Rembrandt to be satisfied Who never will be, howsoever much He be assured of an ascendency That has not yet a shadow's worth of sound Where Holland has its ears. And what of that? Have you the weary leisure or sick wit That breeds of its indifference a false envy That is the vermin on accomplishment? Are you inaugurating your new service With fasting for a food you would not eat? You are the servant, Rembrandt, not the master,— But you are not assigned with other slaves That in their freedom are the most in fear. One of the few that are so fortunate As to be told their task and to be given A skill to do it with a tool too keen For timid safety, bow your elected head Under the stars tonight, and whip your devils Each to his nest in hell. Forget your days, And so forgive the years that may not be So many as to be more than you may need For your particular consistency In your peculiar folly. You are counting Some fewer years than forty at your heels; And they have not pursued your gait so fast As your oblivion—which has beaten them, And rides now on your neck like an old man With iron shins and fingers. Let him ride REMBRANDT TO REMBRANDT (You haven't so much to say now about that), And in a proper season let him run. You may be dead then, even as you may now Anticipate some other mortal strokes Attending your felicity; and for that, Oblivion heretofore has done some running Away from graves, and will do more of it." That's how it is your wiser spirit speaks, Rembrandt. If you believe him, why complain? If not, why paint? And why, in any event, Look back for the old joy and the old roses, Or the old fame? They are all gone together, And Saskia with them; and with her left out, They would avail no more now than one strand Of Samson's hair wound round his little finger Before the temple fell. Nor more are you In any sudden danger to forget That in Apollo's house there are no clocks Or calendars to say for you in time How far you are away from Amsterdam, Or that the one same law that bids you see Where now you see alone forbids in turn Your light from Holland eyes till Holland ears Are told of it; for that way, my good fellow, Is one way more to death. If at the first Of your long turning, which may still be longer Than even your faith has measured it, you sigh For distant welcome that may not be seen, Or wayside shouting that will not be heard, You may as well accommodate your greatness To the convenience of an easy ditch, And, anchored there with all your widowed gold, Forget your darkness in the dark, and hear No longer the cold wash of Holland scorn.</field>
