      <field name="fulltext">The Original Journal of Sergeant Charles Floyd March 13–August 18, 1804 The ORIGINAL JOURNAL OF Sergeant CHARLES FLOYD1 1 The original of Floyd's Journal is the property of the Wisconsin Historical Society—its press-mark being, M6. It is contained in a weather-beaten blank book, bound in marble boards, now much faded. The writing is upon fifty-three pages, each 5 ? × 7 ? inches in size, and runs in coarse hand the length of the page; in addition to these pages, there are entries upon the inside covers and upon fly-leaves. The greater part was written by Floyd, but there are also entries by Clark and another person whose hand the Editor does not recognize. These entries are indicated by us, as they appear. See also vol. i, pp. liv, lv, ante. For facility in comparison, we have divided the journal into two chapters, according with the corresponding divisions in the journals of Lewis and Clark.—Ed.

      <field name="fulltext">The Original Journal of Private Joseph Whitehouse May 14, 1804–November 6, 1805 The ORIGINAL JOURNAL OF Private JOSEPH WHITEHOUSE1 1 This journal consists of three distinct note-books, the largest 6 × 8 ? inches in dimensions, which are crudely stitched together within a cover consisting of an irregular scrap of limp hide—possibly elk skin. The third and last book is incomplete, for at least three leaves have been torn therefrom at the end; as the journal closes with November 6, 1805, it is possible that the missing leaves carried the story forward until the arrival at the mouth of the Columbia. It is of much value as a supplement to the journals of the leaders of the expedition. The manuscript has been carelessly handled, and is much stained and faded, as well as frayed at the edges. While nearly all of the entries—which are mostly in the hand of Whitehouse, but occasionally in those of other persons, including one entry by Clark—are legible upon careful examination, we have found a few words undecipherable; also small portions torn off at the edges—for these latter, we indicate the conjectural reading in brackets. See also vol. i, pp. lv, lvi, ante. For facility in comparison, we have divided the journal into chapters, according, so far as is practicable, with Biddle's chaptering of the journals of Lewis and Clark.—Ed.

Marshall replied to Jefferson under date of December 12, to the effect that "I yesterday deliver'd the letter to Gen1 Clarke." The original of Marshall's letter is also in possession of the Wisconsin Historical Society.—Ed. [From original MS. in library of Wisconsin Historical Society—Draper MSS., 52J93.] Annapolis, Dec. 4. 1783. Dear Sir: I received here about a week ago your obliging letter of Oct. 12. 1783 with the shells &amp; seeds for which I return you many thanks. you are also so kind as to keep alive the hope of getting for me as many of the different species of bones, teeth &amp; tusks of the Mammoth as can now be found. this will be most acceptable. Pittsburg &amp; Philadelphia or Winchester will be the surest channel of conveyance: I find they have subscribed a very large sum of money in England for exploring the country from the Missisipi to California. they pretend it is only to promote knolege I am afraid they have thoughts of colonising into that quarter. some of us have been talking here in a feeble way of making the attempt to search that country. but I doubt whether we have enough of that kind of spirit to raise the money. how would you like to lead such a party? tho I am afraid our prospect is not worth asking the question. the definitive treaty of peace is at length arrived. it is not altered from the preliminaries. the cession of the territory West of Ohio to the United States has been at length accepted by Congress, with some small alterations of the conditions. we are in daily expectation of receiving it with the final approbation of Virginia. Congress have been lately agitated by questions where they should fix their residence. they first resolved on Trentown. the Southern states however contrived to get a vote that they would give half their time to Georgetown at the Falls of Patowmac. still we consider the matter as undecided between the Delaware &amp; Patowmac. we urge the latter as the only point of union which can cement us to our Western friends when they shall be formed into separate states.

II JOHN LEDYARD'S FRUSTRATED EXPEDITION, 1786 [From Jefferson's Autobiography, in Ford's Writings of Jefferson (N. Y., 1892–99), i, pp. 94–96.] In 1786 while at Paris I became acquainted with John Ledyard of Connecticut, a man of genius, of some science, and of fearless courage, &amp; enterprise. He had accompanied Capt Cook in his voyage to the Pacific, had distinguished himself on several occasions by an unrivalled intrepidity, and published an account of that voyage with details unfavorable to Cook's deportment towards the savages, and lessening our regrets at his fate. Ledyard had come to Paris in the hope of forming a company to engage in the fur trade of the Western coast of America. He was disappointed in this, and being out of business, and of a roaming, restless character, I suggested to him the enterprise of exploring the Western part of our continent, by passing thro St. Petersburg to Kamschatka, and procuring a passage thence in some of the Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, whence he might make his way across the continent to America; and I undertook to have the permission of the Empress of Russia solicited. He eagerly embraced the proposition, and M. de Sémoulin, the Russian Ambassador, and more particularly Baron Grimm the special correspondent of the Empress, solicited her permission for him to pass thro' her dominions to the Western coast of America. And here I must correct a material error which I have committed in another place to the prejudice of the Empress. In writing some Notes of the life of Capt Lewis, prefixed to his expedition to the Pacific, I stated that the Empress gave the permission asked, &amp; afterwards retracted it. This idea, after a lapse of 26 years, had so insinuated itself into my mind, that I committed it to paper without the least suspicion of error. Yet I find, on recurring to my letters of that date that the Empress refused permission at once, considering the enterprise as entirely chimerical. But Ledyard would not relinquish it, persuading himself that by proceeding to St. Petersburg he could satisfy the Empress of it's practicability and obtain her permission, He went accordingly, but she was absent on a visit to some distant part of her dominions, and he pursued his course to within 200 miles of Kamschatka, where he was overtaken by an arrest from the Empress, brought back to Poland, and there dismissed. I must therefore in justice acquit the Empress of ever having for a moment countenanced, even by the indulgence of an innocent passage thro' her territories this interesting enterprise. [Extract from letter of Jefferson to Ezra Stiles,1 1 President of Yale College, scientist and literary man. He was the first in New England to experiment with electricity.—Ed. dated Paris, Sept. 1, 1786.—Ford, iv, pp. 298, 299.] A countryman of yours, a Mr. Lediard, who was with Capt. Cook on his last voiage, proposes either to go to Kamschatka, cross from thence to the Western side of America, and penetrate through the Continent to our side of it, or to go to Kentucke, &amp; thence penetrate Westwardly to the South sea, the vent [he went] from hence lately to London, where if he finds a passage to Kamschatka or the Western coast of America, he would avail himself of it: otherwise he proposes to return to our side of America to attempt that route. I think him well educated for such an enterprise, &amp; wish he may undertake it. [Extract from letter of Jefferson to Charles Thomson,2 2 Secretary of Continental Congress.—Ed. dated Paris, Sept. 20, 1787.—Ford, iv, pp. 447, 448.] There is an American of the name of Ledyard, he who was with Captain Cook on his last voyage &amp; wrote an account of that voyage, who is go to St. Petersburg, from thence he was to go to Kamschatka, to cross over thence to the northwest coast of America, &amp; to penetrate through the main continent to our side of it. He is a person of ingenuity &amp; information. Unfortunately he has too much imagination. However, if he escapes safely, he will give us new, curious, &amp; useful information. I had a letter from him dated last March, when he was about to leave St. Petersburg on his way to Kamschatka. [Extract from letter of Jefferson to William Carmichael,3 3 Chargé d'affaires at Madrid.—Ed. dated Paris, March 4, 1789.— Ford, v, p. 75.] My last accounts from Lediard (another bold countryman of ours)4 4 The writer had just been referring to Admiral Paul Jones.—Ed. were from Grand Cairo. He was just then plunging into the unknown regions of Africa, probably never to emerge again. If he returns, he has promised me to go to America and penetrate from Kentucke to the Western side of the Continent. I do not know whether you are informed that in the years 1787–1788, he went from here bound for Kamschatka, to cross over thence to the Western coast of our continent &amp; pass through to the Eastern one. He was arrested par ordre superieure within two or three days journeys of Kamschatka, conveyed back to the confines of Poland, &amp; there turned adrift. He arrived here last June, &amp; immediately set out for Africa. III JOHN ARMSTRONG'S EXPEDITION, 1790 1 1 Captain John Armstrong, selected by General Harmar to conduct this expedition, was born in New Jersey. Having served with distinction as a commissioned officer in the Revolutionary War, he was continued in the regular service upon the Western frontier, where he won a wide reputation as woodsman and explorer. In 1784 he commanded at Wyoming, in 1785–86 at Fort Pitt, and 1786–1790 at the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville). From the letters here given, it would be inferred that although Armstrong was detailed for the expedition ordered by General Knox, the journey itself was not undertaken. It is stated, however, in an apparently careful biography of Armstrong, in Cist's Cincinnati Miscellany (1845), i, p. 40, that he started upon his tour in the spring of 1790, "and proceeded up the Missouri some distance above St. Louis, not with an army to deter the savages, nor yet an escort, but entirely alone! It was his intention to examine the country of the upper Missouri, and cross the Rocky Mountains—but, meeting with some French traders, was persuaded to return in consequence of the hostility of the Missouri bands to each other, as they were then at war, that he could not safely pass from one nation to another." This is confirmed by Harmar's letter to Knox, dated Fort Washington, March 24, 1790, (in Memoirs of Penna. Historical Society, vii, p. 454), wherein he says: "I have . . . detatched Lieutenant Armstrong to undertake the business recommended in your secret letters." On returning to Vincennes, Armstrong immediately thereafter, with an escort of two friendly Indians, carefully explored the Wabash and its communications with Lake Erie. Armstrong made other important military explorations, and resigned from the army in 1793. He served as treasurer of the Northwest Territory, and later as a local magistrate; dying in Clark County, Indiana, February 4, 1816. [Letter of General Henry Knox, secretary of war, to General Josiah Harmar, commanding on the Western frontier. From transcript by L.C. Draper, in library of Wisconsin Historical Society— Draper MSS., 2W133.] War Office, 20th Dec. 1789. (Secret) Dear Sir: The subject I about stating must be retained by you as a profound secret, and I depend on your honor not to communicate thereon now or hereafter, excepting with the Governor of the Western Territory2 2 General Arthur St. Clair. whom I shall refer to you. It is important that the official information of all the Western regions should be as precise and as extensive as the nature of things will admit. You will therefore exercise your mind in obtaining such information. Devise some practicable plan for exploring the branch of the Mississippi called the Messouri, up to its source and all its Southern branches, and tracing particularly the distance between the said branches and any of the navigable streams that run into the Great North River which empties itself into the Gulf of Mexico. In order that you may better comprehend my idea, I send you a map of the said river and its conjectural relation to the Messouri. You will easily see that this object cannot be undertaken with the sanction of public authority. An enterprising officer with a noncommissioned officer well acquainted with living in the woods, &amp; perfectly capable of describing rivers and countries, accompanied by four or five hardy Indians perfectly attached to the United States, would, in my opinion be the best mode of obtaining the information requested. Could you engage two such parties, and send them off at different periods of one or two months distance from each other, it is highly probable that one if not both would succeed &amp; return. I am not authorized to make any stipulations on this subject, but I pledge myself unequivocally that if the parties should succeed, that I will exert myself to the utmost that they shall not only be satisfactorily, but liberally rewarded, on their return. Endeavor therefore by all means to find suitable characters for this hardy enterprise, &amp; having found them despatch them as soon as possible. I say nothing about their equipments or the manner of their being furnished, leaving that to your &amp; the Governor's judgment, &amp; those to whom you may confide the direction of the enterprize. Pocket compasses would be necessary to their success, &amp; pencils &amp; paper to assist their remarks. Were it practicable to make the operation with canoes, it would be most satisfactory. I am, dear sir, with great esteem, Your most humble servant, Genl. Harmar. H. Knox. [Extract from Letter of Secretary Knox, dated War Office, 16th January, 1790, to General Harmar. From transcript by L. C. Draper, in library of Wisconsin Historical Society—Draper MSS., 2W177.] (Private) Sir: In addition to my letter to you on the subject of exploring the country &amp; waters on which you were to consult the Governor of the Western Territory, that the party employed on that business should be habited like Indians, in all respects, and on no pretence whatever discover any connection with the troops. Of course they will not take any written orders with them. [Letter of General Harmar to General Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory. From Smith's St. Clair Papers, ii, p. 133.] Fort Washington, February 20, 1790. Dear Sir: I have had the honor of receiving your letter from Fort Steuben, dated the 26th ult., and observe that your detention so long there was occasioned for want of provisions. We have been upon the point of starvation here ever since my arrival. I have no great opinion of Major Doughty's mission,1 1 Up the Tennessee River.—Ed. and another is on foot which I think to be really difficult and hazardous. The copy of the secret letter sent me from the War Office I do not think proper to commit to paper, for fear of accident, but Lieutenant Armstrong (whom I have ordered to undertake the tour, if possible) can fully inform you the nature of the business, as the contents of the letter have been communicated to him, and he has taken notes in such manner as to be able to give you an exact copy of it. I have written to the War Office that I wished very much to have your Excellency's opinion upon this subject before I ordered the officer to proceed. I must, therefore, beg that you will be pleased to give it. It seems very much depends on the too adventurous establishment. If your Excellency should be of opinion that it is advisable for him to undertake it, be so kind as to afford him your advice and assistance upon the occasion, as it is impossible for me, at this distance, to make the necessary arrangements for that purpose. This is the subject that the Secretary of War has written you that we were to consult about. Mrs. Harmar desires to be remembered most affectionately to you and Major Sargent. [Extract from letter of Governor St. Clair to Secretary of War Knox, dated Cahokia, May 1, 1790. From St. Clair Papers, 11, p. 138.] Mr. Armstrong has been here for some time, in consequence of your communications to General Harmar, who made me acquainted with them by him. It is, sir, I believe, at present, altogether impracticable. It is a point on which some people are feelingly alive all over, and all their jealousy awake. Indians to be confided in, there are none; and if there were, those who would be most proper, and others, are now at war; but I have explained myself to Captain Armstrong for General Harmar's imformation, who will communicate it to you from a place whence there is less risk of dispatches miscarrying. [Extract from letter of Governor St. Clair to General Harmar. From St. Clair Papers, ii, p. 144.] Cahokia, May [no date], 1790. Sir: I had the honor to receive your communications by Captain Armstrong, and have given him my opinion upon the subject; that it is, at present at least, impracticable, for the reasons which he will inform you of, as I think it best not to say any thing about it in writing. IV ANDRÉ MICHAUX'S PROPOSED EXPEDITION, 1793 Jefferson's Instructions to André Michaux for exploring the Western Boundary. [From Ford, vi, pp. 158–161.] [January, 1793] Sundry persons having subscribed certain sums of money for your encouragement to explore the country along the Missouri, and thence westwardly to the Pacific ocean, having submitted the plan of the enterprise to the directors of the American Philosophical society, and the society having accepted of the trust, they proceeded to give you the following instructions: They observe to you that the chief objects of your journey are to find the shortest and most convenient route of communication between the United States and the Pacific ocean, within the temperate latitudes, and to learn such particulars as can be obtained of the country through which it passes, its productions, inhabitants, and other interesting circumstances. As a channel of communication between these States and the Pacific ocean, the Missouri, so far as it extends, presents itself under circumstances of unquestioned preference. It has, therefore, been declared as a fundamental object of the subscription (not to be dispensed with) that this river shall be considered and explored as a part of the communication sought for. To the neighborhood of this river, therefore, that is to say, to the town of Kaskaskia, the society will procure you a conveyance in company with the Indians of that town now in Philadelphia. From thence you will cross the Mississippi and pass by land to the nearest part of the Missouri above the Spanish settlements, that you may avoid the risk of being stopped. You will then pursue such of the largest streams of that river as shall lead by the shortest way and the lowest latitudes to the Pacific ocean. When, pursuing those streams, you shall find yourself at the point from whence you may get by the shortest and most convenient route to some principal river of the Pacific ocean, you are to proceed to such river and pursue its course to the ocean. It would seem by the latest maps as if a river called Oregon, interlocked with the Missouri for a considerable distance, and entered the Pacific ocean not far southward of Nootka Sound. But the society are aware that these maps are not to be trusted so far as to be the ground of any positive instruction to you. They therefore only mention the fact, leaving to yourself to verify it, or to follow such other as you shall find to be the real truth. You will in the course of your journey, take notice of the country you pass through, its general face, soil, rivers, mountains, its productions —animal, vegetable, and mineral—so far as they may be new to us, and may also be useful or very curious; the latitude of places or material for calculating it by such simple methods as your situation may admit you to practice, the names, members, and dwellings of the inhabitants, and such particulars, as you can learn of their history, connection with each other, languages, manners, state of society, and of the arts and commerce among them. Under the head of animal history, that of the mammoth is particularly recommended to your inquiries, as it is also to learn whether the Lama or Paca of Peru, is found in those parts of this continent, or how far north they come. The method of preserving your observations is left to yourself according to the means which shall be in your power. It is only suggested that the noting them on the skin might be best for such as may be the most important, and that further details may be committed to the bark of the paper-birch, a substance which may not excite suspicions among the Indians, and little liable to injury from wet or other common accidents. By the means of the same substance you may perhaps find opportunities, from time to time of communicating to the society information of your progress, and of the particulars you shall have noted. When you shall have reached the Pacific ocean, if you find yourself within convenient distance of any settlement of Europeans, go to them, commit to writing a narrative of your journey and observations, and take the best measure you can for conveying it thence to the society by sea. Return by the same, or some other route, as you shall think likely to fulfil with most satisfaction and certainty the objects of your mission, furnishing yourself with the best proofs the nature of the case will admit of the reality and extent of your progress, whether this shall be by certificates from Europeans settled on the western coast of America, or by what other means, must depend on circumstances. Ignorance of the country through which you are to pass, and confidence in your judgement, zeal, and discretion, prevent the society from attempting more minute instructions, and even from exacting rigorous observance of those already given, except, indeed, what is the first of all objects, that you seek for and pursue that route which shall form the shortest and most convenient communication between the higher parts of the Missouri and the Pacific ocean. It is strongly recommended to you to expose yourself in no case to unnecessary dangers, whether such as might affect your health or your personal safety, and to consider this not merely as your personal concern, but as the injunction of science in general, which expects its enlargement from your inquiries, to whom your report will open new fields and subjects of commerce, intercourse, and observation. If you reach the Pacific ocean and return, the society assign to you all the benefits of the subscription before mentioned. If you reach the waters only that run into that ocean, the society reserve to themselves the apportionment of the reward according to the conditions expressed in the subscription. If you do not reach even those waters they refuse all reward, and reclaim the money you may have received here under the subscription. They will expect you to return to the city of Philadelphia to give in to them a full narrative of your journey and observations, and to answer the inquiries they shall make of you, still reserving to yourself the benefit arising from the publication of such parts of them as are in the said subscription reserved to you.

V PRESIDENT JEFFERSON'S SECRET MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, 1803 [From Richardson's Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789–1897 (Washington, 1896–99), i, pp. 352–354.] January 18, 1803. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: As the continuance of the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes will be under the consideration of the Legislature at its present session, I think it my duty to communicate the views which have guided me in the execution of that act, in order that you may decide on the policy of continuing it in the present or any other form, or discontinue it altogether if that shall, on the whole, seem most for the public good. The Indian tribes residing within the limits of the United States have for a considerable time been growing more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy, although effected by their own voluntary sales, and the policy has long been gaining strength with them of refusing absolutely all further sale on any conditions, insomuch that at this time it hazards their friendship and excites dangerous jealousies and perturbations in their minds to make any overture for the purchase of the smallest portions of their land. A very few tribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions. In order peaceable to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide an extension of territory which the rapid increase of our numbers will call for, two measures are deemed expedient. First. To encourage them to abandon hunting, to apply to the raising stock, to agriculture, and domestic manufacture, and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain them in this better than in their former mode of living. The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life will then become useless, and they will see advantage in exchanging them for the means of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic comforts. Secondly. To multiply trading houses among them, and place within their reach those things which will contribute more to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wilds. Experience and reflection will develop to them the wisdom of exchanging what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want. In leading them thus to agriculture, to manufactures, and civilization; in bringing together their and our sentiments, and in preparing them ultimately to participate in the benefits of our Government, I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good. At these trading houses we have pursued the principles of the act of Congress which directs that the commerce shall be carried on liberally, and requires only that the capital stock shall not be diminished. We consequently undersell private traders, foreign and domestic, drive them from the competition, and thus, with the good will of the Indians, rid ourselves of a description of men who are constantly endeavoring to excite in the Indian mind suspicions, fears, and irritations toward us. A letter now enclosed shows the effect of our competition on the operations of the traders, while the Indians, perceiving the advantage of purchasing from us, are soliciting generally our establishment of trading houses among them. In one quarter this is particularly interesting. The Legislature, reflecting on the late occurrences on the Mississippi, must be sensible how desirable it is to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river, from our southern limit to the Illinois, at least, so that we may present as firm a front on that as on our eastern border. We possess what is below the Yazoo, and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the Illinois and Wabash to the Ohio; but between the Ohio and Yazoo the country all belongs to the Chickasaws, the most friendly tribe within our limits, but the most decided against the alienation of lands. The portion of their country most important for us is exactly that which they do not inhabit. Their settlements are not on the Mississippi, but in the interior country. They have lately shown a desire to become agricultural, and this leads to the desire of buying implements and comforts. In the strengthening and gratifying of these wants I see the only prospect of planting on the Mississippi itself the means of its own safety. Duty has required me to submit these views to the judgement of the Legislature, but as their disclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect, they are committed to the special confidence of the two Houses. While the extension of the public commerce among the Indian tribes may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as are engaged in it, it might be worthy the attention of Congress in their care of individual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizens, as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public. The river Missouri and the Indians inhabiting it are not as well known as is rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi, and consequently with us. It is, however, understood that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation, carried on in a high latitude through an infinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice through a long season. The commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the Missouri, traversing a moderate climate, offering, according to the best accounts, a continued navigation from its source, and possibly with a single portage from the Western Ocean, and finding to the Atlantic a choice of channels through the Illinois or Wabash, the Lakes and Hudson, through the Ohio and Susquehanna, or Potomac or James rivers, and through the Tennessee and Savannah rivers. An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it, taken from our posts where they may be spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean, have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse, get admission among them for our traders as others are admitted, agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles, and return with the information acquired in the course of two summers. Their arms and accouterments, some instruments of observation, and light and cheap presents for the Indians would be all the apparatus they could carry, and with an expectation of a soldier's portion of land on their return would constitute the whole expense. Their pay would be going on whether here or there. While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery, and for other literary purposes, in various parts and directions, our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well as to its own interests, to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent, and so directly traversing our own part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress, and that it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent can not but be an additional gratification. The nation claiming the territory, regarding this as a literary pursuit, which it is in the habit of permitting within its dominions, would not be disposed to view it with jealousy, even if the expiring state of its interests there did not render it a matter of indifference. The appropriation of $2,500 "for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States," while understood and considered by the Executive as giving the legislative sanction, would cover the undertaking from notice and prevent the obstructions which interested individuals might otherwise previously prepare in its way.

[Extract—from Ford, viii, p. 219.] Washington, Feb. 28, 1803. Dear Sir: I wish to mention to you in confidence that I have obtained authority from Congress to undertake the long desired object of exploring the Missouri &amp; whatever river, heading with that, leads into the western ocean. About 10. chosen woodsmen headed by Capt. Lewis my secretary will set out on it immediately &amp; probably accomplish it in two seasons. Capt. Lewis is brave, prudent, habituated to the woods, &amp; familiar with Indian manners and character. He is not regularly educated, but he possesses a great mass of accurate observation on all the subjects of nature which present themselves here, &amp; will therefore readily select those only in his new route which shall be new. He has qualified himself for those observations of longitude &amp; latitude necessary to fix the points of the line he will go over. It would be very useful to state for him those objects on which it is most desirable he should bring us information. For this purpose I ask the favor of you to prepare some notes of such particulars as may occur in his journey &amp; which you think should draw his attention &amp; enquiry He will be in Philadelphia about 2. or 3. weeks hence &amp; will wait on you. VIII JEFFERSON TO DR. CASPAR WISTAR.1 1 A physician and scientist of Philadelphia, professor in the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania, and vice-president of the American Philosophical Society.—Ed. [Extract—from Ford, viii, p. 192.] Washington, Feb. 28, 1803. Dear Sir: The enclosed sheets may contain some details which perhaps may be thought interesting enough for the transactions of our society. They were forwarded to me by Mr. Dunbar with a couple of vocabularies which I retain to be added to my collection. What follows is to be perfectly confidential. I have at length succeeded in procuring an essay to be made of exploring the Missouri &amp; whatever river heading with that, runs into the western Ocean. Congress by a secret authority enables me to do it. A party of about 10. chosen men headed by an officer will immediately set out. We cannot in the U. S. find a person who to courage, prudence, habits &amp; health adapted to the woods, &amp; some familiarity with the Indian character, joins a perfect knowledge of botany, natural history, mineralogy &amp; astronomy, all of which would be desirable. To the first qualifications Captain Lewis my secretary adds a great mass of accurate observation made on the different subjects of the three kingdoms as existing in these states, not under their scientific forms, but so as that he will readily seize whatever is new in the country he passes thro', and give us accounts of new things only; and he has qualified himself for fixing the longitude &amp; latitude of the different points in the line he will go over. I have thought it would be useful to confine his attention to those objects only on which information is most deficient &amp; most desirable: &amp; therefore would thank you to make a note on paper of those which occur to you as most desirable for him to attend to. He will be in Philadelphia within two or three weeks &amp; will call on you. Any advice or hints you can give him will be thankfully received &amp; usefully applied. I presume he will compleate his tour there &amp; back in two seasons. Accept assurances of my sincere esteem &amp; high respect. IX LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 97.] Lancaster, Ap. 20th. 1803. With a view to forward as much as possible, the preparations which must necessarily be made in the Western country previous to my final departure, as also to prevent the delay, which would attatch to their being made after my arrival in that quarter, I have taken the following measures, which I hope will meet your approbation; they appear to me to be as complete as my present view of the subject will admit my making them, and I trust the result will prove as favorable as wished for. I have writen triplicates to Mr John Conner accepting his service as an Interpreter; he is the young man I recollect mentioning to you as having proffered his services to accompany me: to him I have communicated the real extent and objects of my mission, but with strict injunctions to secresy. He is directed to bring with him two Indians, provided he can engage such as perfectly answer the description given him. I have informed him of the military posts at which I shall touch on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and the probable time of my arrival at each, leaving it discretionary with himself to meet me at either; in these letters are inclosed triplicates addressed to the Commandants of those posts, recommending Mr. Conner to their good offices, and requesting for him every aid in their power to bestow, should he be in want of assistance to enable him to get forwad in due time. The circumstance of Mr. Conner's residence being at the Delleware Town on White river, and distant of course from any post office, induced me to give these letters different conveyances, which I did by inclosing them by different mails to three gentlemen of my acquaintance in that country, two of whom, Capts. McClelland &amp; Hamilton, live within twenty seven miles of the town; they are requested, and I am confident will find the means of conveying the letters to him; the other with a similar request was inclosed to Capt. Findley of Cincinnati, in whose exertions tho' more distant, I have equal confidence. I have also written to Majr. Mac Rea, the Commandant of South West Point, and to several officers of my acquaintance who constitute that garrison, stating to them that my destination was up the Mississippi for the purpose of accomplishing the objects which we agreed on as most proper to be declared publicly: the qualifications of the men are mentioned, and they are requested to took out in time for such volunteers as will answer that description; the inducements for those persons engaging in this service were also stated. The garrison of South West Point must form my first resource for the scelection of my party, which I shall afterwards change as circumstances may seem to recommend; and with a view to this change, I have written in a similar manner to the officers commanding the posts of Massac, Kaskaskais and Illinois, the posts at which I shall touch previous to ascending the Missourie, and subsequent to my departure from S. W. Point. the men in every instance are to be engaged conditionally, or subject to my approval or otherwise. I have also written to Dr. Dickson, at Nashville, and requested him to contract in my behalf with some confidential boat-builder at that place, to prepare a boat for me as soon as possible, and to purchase a large light wooden canoe; for this purpose I inclosed the Dr. 50 Dollars, which sum I did not concieve equal by any means to the purchase of the two vessels, but supposed it sufficient for the purchase of the canoe, and to answer also as a small advance to the boat-builder: a discription of these vessels was given. The objects of my mission are stated to him as beforementioned to the several officers. I have also written to Genl. Irwine of Philadelphia, requesting that he will have in a state of prepareation some articles which are necessary for me, and which will be most difficult to obtain, or may take the greatest length of time in their prepareation. My detention at Harper's Ferry was unavoidable for one month, a period much greater than could reasonably have been calculated on: my greatest difficulty was the frame of the canoe, which could not be completed without my personal attention to such portion of it as would enable the workmen to understand the design perfectly; other inducements seemed with equal force to urge my waiting the issue of a full experiment, arising as well from a wish to incur no expence unnecessarily, as from an unwillingness to risk any calculation on the advantages of this canoe in which hereafter I might possibly be deceived; experiment was necessary also to determine it's demensions; I therefore resolved to give it a fair trial, and accordingly prepared two sections of it with the same materials, of which they must of necessity be composed when completed for servise on my voyage; they were of two disciptions, the one curved, or in the shape necessary for the stem and stern, the other simicilindrical, or in the form of those sections which constitute the body of the canoe. The experiment and it's result wer as follows: Dementions Curved Section. F. I. Simicilindrical Section. F. I. Length of Keel from junction of section to commencement of curve 1 2 Length of Keel 4 6 Length of curve 4 5 Ditto Beam 4 10 Width of broad end 4 10 Debth of Hole 2 2 Debth of D° D° 2 2 Note.—The curve of the body of the canoe was formed by a suspended cord. Weight of the Materials. Curved section. lbs. Simicilindrical Section. lbs. Iron 22 Iron 22 Hide 25 Hide 30 Wood 10 Wood 12 Bark 21 Bark 25 Total 78 Total 89 Competent to a Burthen of 850 lbs. Burthen of 920 lbs. Necessary to be transported by land Iron and Hide of Curved Section 47 Iron and Hide of Simicilindrical section 52 99 lbs. Burthen of Curved Section 850 D° D° Simicilindrical Section 920 1,770 lbs. Thus the weight of this vessel competent to the burthen of 1,770 lbs. amounts to no more than 99 lbs. the bark and wood, when it becomes necessary to transport the vessel to any considerable distance, may be discarded; as those articles are readily obtained for the purposes of this canoe, at all seasons of the year, and in every quarter of the country, which is tolerably furnished with forest trees. When these sections were united they appeared to acquire an additional strength and firmness, and I am confident that in cases of emergency they would be competent to 150 lbs. more than the burthen already stated. Altho' the weight of the articles employed in the construction of a canoe on this plan, have considerably exceeded the estimate I had previously made, yet they do not weigh more than those which form a bark canoe of equal dementions, and in my opinion is much preferable to it in many respects: it is much stronger, will carry it's burthen with equal ease, and greater security; and when the Bark and wood are discarded, will be much lighter, and can be transported with more safety and ease. I was induced from the result of this experiment to direct the iron frame of the canoe to be completed. My Rifles, Tomahawks &amp; knives are preparing at Harper's Ferry, and are already in a state of forwardness that leaves me little doubt of their being in readiness in due time. I arrived at this place yesterday, called on Mr. Ellicot, and have this day commenced, under his direction, my observations &amp;c., to perfect myself in the use and application of the instruments. Mr Ellicot is extremely friendly and attentive, and I am confident is disposed to render me every aid in his power: he thinks it will be necessary I should remain here ten or twelve days. Being fully impressed with the necessity of seting out as early as possible, you may rest assured that not a moment shall be lost in making the necessary preparations. I still think it practicable to reach the mouth of the Missourie by the Ist. of August. I am Sir, with much esteem and regard Your Most Obt Servt. Meriwether Lewis. The President of the U. States. X JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 116.] Washington, Apr. 23, 1803. Dear Sir: I have not been able to hear anything of you since Mar. 7, till two or three days ago, Lieut. Wilson told me you would leave Frederic the 18th. inst. &amp; that you had been detained till then at Harper's ferry, where Capt. Murray also told me he had seen you. I have no doubt you have used every possible exertion to get off, and therefore we have only to lament what cannot be helped, as the delay of a month now may lose a year in the end. will you be so good as to call on Doctr Bollman with my complements &amp; pay him for some wine sent me? I suppose it will be about 12 Doll. but it must be whatever he says. I will also thank you to purchase for me a Leopard or tyger's skin, such as the covers of our saddles were cut out of. in North 3d. street &amp; North 4th. street a few doors only from Market street there used to be a considerable furrier's store in each. at one of these it was that I saw a robe of what they called the Peruvian sheep, and I took to be of the Lama or Vigogna. it was made up of several skins and was of the price of 12 D. If there be such a thing there now, you can either observe &amp; report it to me, or if you think it good (for I have almost forgot it) I would take it at once. Let me hear from you on your receipt of this, and inform me of your prospect of getting off. I have letters here from your friends in Albemarle. Accept my affectionate salutations. Th. Jefferson. Capt. M. Lewis. XI JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 111.] Washington, April 27, 1803. Dear Sir: Your's of the 20th. from Lancaster was recieved the night before last. not having heard from you since the time of my leaving Washington I had written to you on the 2d. and lodged it in Philadelphia. you will therefore probably receive that &amp; this together. I enclose you a copy of the rough draught of the instructions I have prepared for you, that you may have time to consider them &amp; to propose any modifications which may occur to yourself as useful. your destination being known to mr. Patterson, Doctts. Wister, Rush &amp; Barton,1 1 Prominent scientists, and members of the American Philosophical Society. Robert Patterson was an Irish physician, and professor of mathematics in the University of Pennsylvania. Lewis studied with him in preparation for his journey. Benjamin Smith Barton was a famous Philadelphia physician and naturalist, professor of botany and natural history at the College of Philadelphia. To him was entrusted the pubcation of the scientific results of the Lewis and Clark expedition, but he died before accomplishing this.—Ed. these instructions may be submitted to their perusal, a considerable portion of them being within the field of the Philosophical society, which once undertook the same mission,2 2 Having reference to the projected Michaux expedition (1792–93).—Ed. I think it my duty to consult some of it's members, limiting the communication by the necessity of secrecy in a good degree. these gentlemen will suggest any additions they will think useful, as has been before asked of them. we have received information that Connor cultivates in the first degree the patronage of the British government; to which he values ours as only secondary. as it is possible however that his passion for this expedition may overrule that for the British, and as I do not see that the British agents will necessarily be disposed to counterwork us, I think Connor's qualifications make it desireable to engage him, and that the communication to him will be as useful, as it was certainly proper under our former impression of him. the idea that you are going to explore the Missisipi has been generally given out; it satisfies public curosity and masks sufficiently the real destination. I shall be glad to hear from you, as soon after your arrival at Philadelphia as you can form an idea when you will leave, &amp; when be here. accept assurances of my constant &amp; sincere affection. Th. Jefferson. Capt. M. Lewis. XII JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 112.] I think we spoke together of your carrying some cast iron corn mills to give to the Indians or to trade with them, as well as for your own use. lest however I should be mistaken, I mention them now. I make no doubt you have consulted with mr Ellicot1 1 Andrew Ellicott, who instructed Lewis in scientific surveying and use of mathematical instruments, was a civil engineer of note in the early history of the United States. He made the first survey of the Niagara River in 1789, laid out the city of Washington, and in 1792 was appointed surveyor general of the United States. His most important work was surveying the boundary between the United States and Spain on the south, the results of which were published in 1803.—Ed. as to the best instruments to carry. I would wish that nothing that passed between us here should prevent your following his advice, which is certainly the best. Should a time-piece be requisite, it is possible mr. Arnold can furnish you one. neither Ellicot nor Garnet have given me their opinion on the substituting a meridian at land instead of observations of time, for ascertaining longitude by the lunar motions. I presume therefore it will not answer. accept my affectionate salutations. Washington, Apr. 30, 1803. XIII LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 98.] Philadelpia, May 14th. 1803. Dear Sir: In your instructions to me you mention that the instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations the geography of the country through which I shall pass, have been already provided: I shall not therefore purchase any articles of that discription until I hear further from you on this subject. Will you be so good as to inform me what instruments have been provided? and where they are? it may be possible that some instrument has been omitted, which Mr. Patterson, Mr. Ellicott and those gentlemen to whom you have referred me in this place, may deem necessary for me, and if so the deficiency can be supplyed in time. Mr. Patterson and Mr. Ellicott both disapprove of the Theodolite as applicable to my purposes; they think it a delicate instrument, difficult of transportation, and one that would be very liable to get out of order; they also state that in it's application to my observations for obtaining the Longitude, it would be liable to many objections, and to much more inacuracy than the Sextant. The instruments these gentlemen recommend, and which indeed they think indispensibly necessary, are, two Sextants, (one of which, must be constructed for the back observation), an artificial Horizon or two; a good Arnold's watch or Chronometer, a Surveyor's Compass with a ball and socket and two pole chain, and a set of plotting instruments. By means of the Sextant fixed for the back observations and an artificial Horizon also constructed for the purpose, the meridian altitude of the Sun may always be taken, altho it should even exceed eighty degrees: for this valuable problem I am indebted to Mr. Patterson. As a perfect knolege of the time will be of the first importance in all my Astronomical observations, it is necessary that the time-keeper intended for this expedition should be put in the best possible order, ir therefore Sir, one has been procured for me and you are not perfectly assured of her being in good order, it would be best perhaps to send her to me by some safe hand (should any such conveyance offer in time); Mr. Voit could then clean her, and Mr. Ellicott has promised to regulate her, which, I believe he has the means of doing just now, more perfectly than it can be done anywhere else in the U. States. I cannot yet say what day it will be in my power to leave this place. Your different orders have been attended to, and the result you shall have in a day or two. I am Sir, with every sentiment of gratitude and respect Your most Obt. &amp; very Humble Servt. Meriwether Lewis. The President of the U States. XIV JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 113.] Washington, May 16, 1803. Dear Sir: yours of the 14th. is this moment recieved &amp; I hasten to answer it by return of post, that no time may be lost. the copy of instructions sent you are only a rough draught for consideration.1 1 See post, document xviii.—Ed.. They will not be signed or dated till your departure. presuming you would procure all the necessary instruments at Philadelphia, which is a principal object of your journey there, the instructions say that the necessary instruments 'have been provided' which will be true when they receive their ultimate form, date &amp; signature, tho' nothing was provided at the time of writing the rough draught. this will serve to correct the impression which has been misunderstood and to let you know you are relied on to provide every thing for yourself. with respect to the theodolite, I wish you to be governed entirely by the advice of mr Patterson &amp; mr Ellicott: as also as to the time piece &amp; whatever else they think best. mr Garnett told us he had some good ones still on hand; which I remind you of, lest you should not be able to get one in Philadelphia. Accept my affectionate salutations. Th. Jefferson. Capt. Meriwether Lewis. XV LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 99.] Philadelphia, May 29th. 1803. Dear Sir: I have at length so far succeeded in making the necessary preparations for my intended journey as to be enabled to fix on the sixth or seventh of June as the probable time of my departue for Washington. All the article have been either procured; or are in such state of forwardness in the hands of the workmen as to induce me to hope that my stay here after that period will be unnecessary; indeed it is probable I might set out by the middle of this week, was it not for a wish to attend Mr. Patterson a few days longer; this Mr. Patterson recommends; he has been extreemly obliging to me since my arrival here, but his avocations for the last ten days have been such, as rendered it impossible for him to afford me the benefit of his instructions; in the meantime I have employed myself in attending more immediately to the objects of my equipment, and am now more at leasure to pursue with effect the subjects to which, he may think proper to direct my attention. Agreeably to your instructions the draught of your orders prepared for my government, has been submitted to Mr. Patterson, and to Drs. Rush Barton &amp; Wister; they approve of them very highly: Dr. Rush has favored me with some abstract queries under the several heads of Physical History, medicine, morals and religeon of the Indians, which I have no doubt will be servicable in directing my inquiries among that people. Drs. Barton and Wister have each pomised to contribute in like manner any thing, which may suggest itself to them as being of any importance in furthering the objects of this expedition. Dr. Barton has sometimes flattered me with the pleasure of his company as far as the Illinois; this event would be extreemly pleasing to me for many reasons; I fear the Dr. will not carry this design into effect; he tells me that his health has been pretty good latterly, and that he is determined to travel in some direction two or three months during the ensuing summer and autumn. I paid Mr. Dufief 74$ and Dr. Bolman 18$. I have also purchased a Vigogna blanket, of which I hope you will approve; it is about the size of a common three point Blanket, the skins appear to be two thin for rough service, tho' it is a very pretty thing; it is the best I could find, the price was 10$. The Tiger's skin you requested I have not been able to procure, those I have seen appear to be too small for your purpose, perhaps they may be had in Baltimore if so, I will get one at that place The 2 pole chain &amp; 2 pair of fleecy socks have also been procured. I recieved your watch this morning from Mr. Voigt, who tells me shee is well regulated and in perfect order. Mr. Whitney has not yet repared your sextant tho' it was put into his hands immediately on my arrival; he has promised however, after repeated applications, that it shall be ready tomorrow evening: he seemed unwilling to undertake the alteration you wished in the brass Sextant stand, I therefore declined having the alteration made: I was further induced to this resolution from the opinion of Mr. Ellicott, who thought that the ball and socket would be reather a disadvantage than otherwise, and that in every event he concieved the advantages of the ball and socket would not be equivalent to the expence attending the alteration. I have writen again to Dr. Dickson at Nashville, from whom I have not yet heard on the subject of my boat and canoe. I have recieved an answer from Majr. MacRea, Comdt. at S. W. Point; his report is reather unfavorable to my wishes: he tells me out of twenty men who have volunteered their services to accompany me, not more than three or four do by any means possess the necessary qualifications for this expedition, or who answer the discription which I had given him; this however I must endeavour to remedy by taking with me from that place a sufficient number of the best of them to man my boat, and if possible scelect others of a better discription as I pass the Garrisons of Massac, Kaskaskais &amp; Illinois. You will receive herewith inclosed some sketches taken from Vancouver's survey of the Western Coast of North America; they were taken in a hasty manner, but I believe they will be found sufficiently accurate to be of service in composing the map, which Mr. Gallatin was so good as to promise he would have projected and compleated for me will you be so obliging Sir, as to mention to Mr. Gallatin, that I have not been able to procure Danvill's map. The maps attatched to Vancouver's voyage cannot be procured seperately from that work, which is both too costly, and too weighty, for me either to purchase or carry. I have the honor to be with the most sincere esteem and attatchment Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis. The President of the U States. XVI LEWIS INVITES CLARK TO JOIN HIM [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Washington, June 19th, 1803. Dear Clark: Herewith inclosed you will receive the papers belonging to your brother Genl. Clark, which sometime since you requested me to procure and forward to you; pray excuse the delay which has taken place, it has really proceeded from causes which I could not control; Mr. Thompson Mason the gentleman in whose possession they were, is a member of the Virginia legislature, and was absent of course from his residence untill March, previous to his return I was compelled to leave this place on a matter of business, which has detained me in Lancaster &amp; Philadelphia untill the day before yesterday and since my return having possessed myself of the papers I seize the first moment to forward them to you: In this claim I wish you success most sincerely. From the long and uninterrupted friendship and confidence which has subsisted between us I feel no hesitation in making to you the following communication under the fulest impression that it will be held by you inviolably secret untill I see you, or you shall hear again from me. During the last session of Congress a law was passed in conformity to a private message of the President of the United States, intiled "An Act making an appropriation for extending the external commerce of the United States." The object of this Act as understood by its framers was to give the sanction of the government to exploreing the interior of the continent of North America, or that part of it bordering on the Missourie &amp; Columbia Rivers. This enterprise has been confided to me by the President, and in consequence since the begining of March I have been engaged in making the necessary preparations for the tour, these arrangements being now nearly completed, I shall set out for Pittsburgh (the intended point of embarcation) about the last of this month, and as soon after as from the state of the water you can reasonably expect me I shall be with you, say about the 10th of August. To aid me in this enterprise I have the most ample and hearty support that the government can give in every possible shape. I am armed with the authority of the Government of the U. States for my protection, so far as its authority or influence extends; in addition to which, the further aid has been given me of liberal pasports from the Ministers both of France and England: I am instructed to select from any corps in the army a number of noncommissioned officers and privates not exceeding 12, who may be disposed voluntarily to enter into this service; and am also authorized to engage any other men not soldiers that I may think usefull in promoting the objects or success of this expedition. I am likewise furnished with letters of credit, and authorized to draw on the government for any sum necessary for the comfort of myself or party. To all the persons engaged in this service I am authorized to offer the following rewards by way of inducement— 1st.. the bounty (if not a soldier) but in both cases six months pay in advance; 2dly.. to discharge them from the service if they wish it, immediately on their return from the expedition giving them their arrears of pay clothing &amp;c. &amp; 3dly.. to secure to them a portion of land equal to that given by the United States to the officers and soldiers who served in the revolutionary army. This is a short view of means with which I am intrusted to carry this plan of the Government into effect. I will now give you a short sketch of my plan of operation: I shall embark at Pittsburgh with a party of recruits eight or nine in number, intended only to manage the boat and are not calculated on as a permanent part of my detatcment; when descending the Ohio it shall be my duty by enquiry to find out and engage some good hunters, stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the woods, and capable of bearing bodily fatigue in a pretty considerable degree: should any young men answering this description be found in your neighborhood I would thank you to give information of them on my arivall at the falls of the Ohio; and if possible learn the probability of their engaging in this service, this may be done perhaps by holding out the idea that the direction of this expedition is up the Mississippi to its source, and thence to the lake of the Woods, stating the probable period of absence at about 18 months; if they would engage themselves in a service of this discription there would be but little doubt that they would engage in the real design when it became necessary to make it known to them, which I should take care to do before I finaly engaged them:—The soldiers that will most probably answer this expedition best will be found in some of the companies stationed at Massac, Kaskaskias &amp; Illinois: pardon this digression from the discription of my plan: it is to descend the Ohio in a keeled boat of about ten tons burthen, from Pittsburgh to it's mouth, thence up the Mississippi to the mouth of the Missourie, and up that river as far as it's navigation is practicable with a boat of this discription, there to prepare canoes of bark or raw-hides, and proceed to it's source, and if practicable pass over to the waters of the Columbia or Origan River and by descending it reach the Western Ocean; the mouth of this river lies about one hundred and forty miles South of Nootka-Sound, at which place there is a considerable European Tradeing establishment, and from which it will be easy to obtain a passage to the United States by way of the East-Indies in some of the trading vessels that visit Nootka Sound anually, provided it should be thought more expedient to do so, than to return by the rout I had pursued in my outward bound journey. The present season being already so far advanced, I do not calculate on geting further than two or three hundred miles up the Missourie before the commencement of the ensuing winter. At this point wherever it may be I shall make myself as comfortable as possible during the winter and resume my journey as early in the spring as the ice will permit:—should nothing take place to defeat my progress altogether I feel confident that my passage to the Western ocean can be effected by the end of the next Summer or the begining of Autumn. In order to subsist my party with some degree of comfort dureing the ensuing winter, I shall engage some French Traders at Illinois to attend me to my wintering ground with a sufficient quantity of flour, pork, &amp;c. to serve them plentifully during the winter, and thus be enabled to set out in the Spring with a healthy and vigorous part. So much for the great outlines of this scheem, permit me now to mention partially the objects which it has in view or those which it is desirable to effect through it's means, and then conclude this lengthy communication. You must know in the first place that very sanguine expectations are at this time formed by our Government that the whole of that immense country wartered by the Mississippi and It's tributary streams, Missourie inclusive, will be the property of the U. States in less than 12 Months from this date: but here let me again impress you with the necessity of keeping this matter a perfect secret.1 1 Authentic information having been received at Washington, that France had secured possession of Louisiana from Spain, by a secret clause in the Treaty of San Ildefonso (October 30, 1800), President Jefferson sent word to the United States minister at Paris, Robert Livingston, to enter into negotiations with the French government, with a view of securing New Orleans and the territory of Louisiana east of the Mississippi. Early in 1803 the President sent James Monroe to France as a special ambassador charged with this mission. April 11, 1803, Talleyrand, then minister of foreign affairs for the French Directory, asked Livingston what the United States would give for all of Louisiana. The latter replied that he had no authorization to treat for so vast a tract of territory; but that Monroe would soon arrive, and he would consult with him before making a definite reply. Monroe arrived the following day. April 13, Barbé-Marbois, French minister of finance, visited the American envoys, and opened negotiations for the cession of Louisiana. The treaty by which the province was transferred to the United States is dated April 30, 1803, although it was not actually signed until the second of May. The official letter of Monroe and Livingston to the Secretary of State, James Madison, was written May 13, and reached Washington on July 14. Rumors of the great purchase had, however, reached the United States at an earlier date, for June 30 the Boston Chronicle reported the cession as an accomplished fact. This private announcement made by Lewis to Clark, was, so far as our observation goes, the earliest mention of the Louisiana purchase in the United States, contained in any document or letter yet printed. Lewis was a confidential friend of the President's, having been his private secretary, and of course received his information from the latter; it was probable that he was the guest of the chief executive, at the time this letter was written. By June 25 Madison had received letters of as late a date as April 19, and, in a letter which has been preserved, considers the negotiations with France satisfactory—(Bureau of Rolls and Library, State Dept., Calendar of Correspondence of James Monroe, p. 143).—Ed. In such a state of things therefore as we have every reason to hope, you will readily concieve the importance to the U. States of an early friendly and intimate acquaintance with the tribes that inhabit that country, that they should be early impressed with a just idea of the rising importance of the U. States and of her friendly dispositions towards them, as also her desire to become usefull to them by furnishing them through her citizens with such articles by way of barter as may be desired by them or usefull to them. The other objects of this mission are scientific, and of course not less interesting to the U. States than to the world generally, such is the ascertaining by celestial observation the geography of the country through which I shall pass; the names of the nations who inhabit it, the extent and limitts of their several possessions, their relation with other tribes and nations; their language, traditions, and monuments; their ordinary occupations in fishing, hunting, war, arts, and the implements for their food, clothing and domestic accomodation; the diseases prevalent among them and the remidies they use; the articles of commerce they may need, or furnish, and to what extent; the soil and face of the country; it's growth and vegetable productions, its animals; the miniral productions of every discription; and in short to collect the best possible information relative to whatever the country may afford as a tribute to general science. My Instruments for celestial observation are an excellent set and my supply of Indian presents is sufficiently ample. Thus my friend you have so far as leasure will at this time permit me to give it you, a summary view of the plan, the means and the objects of this expedition, if therefore there is anything under those circumstances, in this enterprise, which would induce you to participate with me in it's fatiegues, it's dangers and it's honors, believe me there is no man on earth with whom I should feel equal pleasure in sharing them as with yourself; I make this communication to you with the privity of the President, who expresses an anxious wish that you would consent to join me in this enterprise; he has authorized me to say that in the event of your accepting this proposition he will grant you a Captain's commission which of course will intitle you to the pay and emoluments attached to that office and will equally with myself intitle you to such portion of land as was granted to offers of similar rank for their Revolutionary services; the commission with which he proposes to furnish you is not to be considered temporary but permanent if you wish it; your situation if joined with me in this mission will in all respects be precisely such as my own. Pray write to me on this subject as early as possible and direct to me at Pittsburgh. Should you feel disposed not to attatch yourself to this party in an official character, and at the same time feel a disposition to accompany me as a friend any part of the way up the Missourie I should be extremely happy in your company, and will furnish you with every aid for your return from any point you might wish it. With sincere and affectionate regard your friend &amp; Humbl.. sevt.. Meriwether Lewis. XVII DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE EQUIPMENT OF THE EXPEDITION May–June, 18031 1 Government expeditions were, a century ago, outfitted by the "purveyor of public supplies" at Philadelphia. Such of the records as now remain, concerning the Lewis and Clark equipment—so far as our knowledge goes—are kept at the Schuylkill Arsenal, which is commanded by a depot quartermaster of the U. S. army. In March, 1904, at the instance of Secretary H. C. Powers, of the Sioux City (Iowa) Academy of Sciences and Letters, and Prof. E. C. Stacey, of Washington, who were seeking primarily for information concerning Lewis and Clark camps, search was made in these records, with the result that the six documents here given were unearthed. In the transmission of copies, Maj. John T. Knight, Q. M., wrote (March 17): "The foregoing comprises copies of all the papers which have been found pertaining to the expedition, except the bills for the purchases made by the purveyor. The items on these bills except medical supplies, are shown on the statement made by Mr. Whelan (marked No. 2)." F. C. Ainsworth, chief of the Record and Pension Office of the U. S. War Department, wrote (March 2) in reply to inquiries from Professor Stacey relative to equipment: "Nothing has been found of record to show the character of the camping equipment taken by the Lewis and Clark Expedition up the Missouri River, or relative to the aid, if any, rendered the expedition by the Secretary of War, except that instructions were issued by the War Department July 2, 1803, to the end that the contractor's agent should put on Captain Lewis's boat proper provisions to carry him and his men to Massac, and that he be furnished with eighteen light axes."—Ed.

[Endorsed:] Mem: Capt Lewis. XVIII JEFFERSON'S INSTRUCTIONS TO LEWIS1 1 As will be seen by document xiv, ante, the "rough draft" of these instructions was sent to Lewis early in May. This is the finished document—Ed. [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 1, vol. 9, doc. 269.] To Meriwether Lewis, esquire, Captain of the Ist. regiment of infantry of the United States of America: Your situation as Secretary of the President of the United States has made you acquainted with the objects of my confidential message of Jan. 18, 1803, to the legislature. you have seen the act they passed, which, tho' expressed in general terms, was meant to sanction those objects, and you are appointed to carry them into execution. Instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations the geography of the country thro' which you will pass, have already been provided. light articles for barter, &amp; presents among the Indians, arms for your attendants, say for from 10 to 12 men, boats, tents, &amp; other travelling apparatus, with ammunition, medicine, surgical instruments &amp; provisions you will have prepared with such aids as the Secretary at War can yield in his department; &amp; from him also you will recieve authority to engage among our troops, by voluntary agreement, the number of attendants above mentioned, over whom you, as their commanding officer are invested with all the powers the laws give in such a case. As your movements while within the limits of the U. S. will be better directed by occasional communications, adapted to circumstances as they arise, they will not be noticed here. what follows will respect your proceedings after your departure from the U. S. Your mission has been communicated to the Ministers here from France, Spain &amp; Great Britain, and through them to their governments: and such assurances given them as to it's objects as we trust will satisfy them. the country of Louisiana having been ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from the Minister of France, the representative of the present sovereign of the country, will be a protection with all it's subjects: And that from the Minister of England will entitle you to the friendly aid of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen to meet. The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, &amp; such principal stream of it, as, by it's course &amp; communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, may offer the most direct &amp; practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce. Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take observations of latitude &amp; longitude, at all remarkable points on the river, &amp; especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands &amp; other places &amp; objects distinguished by such natural marks &amp; characters of a durable kind, as that they may with certainty be recognized hereafter. the courses of the river between these points of observation may be supplied by the compass, the log-line &amp; by time, corrected by the observations themselves. the variations of the compass too, in different places, should be noticed. The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri &amp; the water offering the best communication with the Pacific Ocean should also be fixed by observation, &amp; the course of that water to the ocean, in the same manner as that of the Missouri. Your observations are to be taken with great pains &amp; accuracy, to be entered distinctly, &amp; intelligibly for others as well as yourself, to comprehend all the elements necessary, with the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude and longitude of the places at which they were taken, &amp; are to be rendered to the war office, for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently by proper persons within the U. S. several copies of these, as well as your other notes, should be made at leisure times &amp; put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants, to guard by multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed. a further guard would be that one of these copies be written on the paper of the birch, as less liable to injury from damp than common paper. The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will pursue, renders a knolege of these people important. you will therefore endeavor to make yourself acquainted, as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit, with the names of the nations &amp; their numbers; the extent &amp; limits of their possessions; their relations with other tribes or nations; their language, traditions, monuments; their ordinary occupations in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, &amp; the implements for these; their food, clothing, &amp; domestic accomodations; the diseases prevalent among them, &amp; the remedies they use; moral &amp; physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we know; peculiarities in their laws, customs &amp; dispositions; and articles of commerce they may need or furnish, &amp; to what extent. And considering the interest which every nation has in extending &amp; strengthening the authority of reason &amp; justice among the people around them, it will be useful to acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality, religion &amp; information among them, as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize &amp; instruct them, to adapt their measures to the existing notions &amp; practises of those on whom they are to operate. Other object worthy of notice will be the soil &amp; face of the country, it's growth &amp; vegetable productions; especially those not of the U. S. the animals of the country generally, &amp; especially those not known in the U. S. the remains and accounts of any which may deemed rare or extinct; the mineral productions of every kind; but more particularly metals, limestone, pit coal &amp; saltpetre; salines &amp; mineral waters, noting the temperature of the last, &amp; such circumstances as may indicate their character. Volcanic appearances. climate as characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy &amp; clear days, by lightening, hail, snow, ice, by the access &amp; recess of frost, by the winds prevailing at different seasons, the dates at which particular plants put forth or lose their flowers, or leaf, times of appearance of particular birds, reptiles or insects. Altho' your route will be along the channel of the Missouri, yet you will endeavor to inform yourself, by inquiry, of the character &amp; extent of the country watered by it's branches, &amp; especially on it's Southern side. the North river or Rio Bravo which runs into the gulph of Mexico, and the North river, or Rio colorado, which runs into the gulph of California, are understood to be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the Missouri, and running Southwardly. whether the dividing grounds between the Missouri &amp; them are mountains or flatlands, what are their distance from the Missouri, the character of the intermediate country, &amp; the people inhabiting it, are worthy of particular enquiry. The Northern waters of the Missouri are less to be enquired after, because they have been ascertained to a considerable degree, and are still in a course of ascertainment by English traders &amp; travellers. but if you can learn anything certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi, &amp; of it's position relative to the lake of the woods, it will be interesting to us. some account too of the path of the Canadian traders from the Missisipi, at the mouth of the Ouisconsin river, to where it strikes the Missouri and of the soil &amp; rivers in it's course, is desireable. In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly &amp; conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey, satisfy them of it's innocence, make them acquainted with the position, extent, character, peaceable &amp; commercial dispositions of the U. S. of our wish to be neighborly, friendly &amp; useful to them, &amp; of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them; confer with them on the points most convenient as mutual emporiums, &amp; the articles of most desireable interchange for them &amp; us. if a few of their influential chiefs, within practicable distance, wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them, and furnish them with authority to call on our officers, on their entering the U. S. to have them conveyed to this place at public expence. if any of them should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us, &amp; taught such arts as may be useful to them, we will receive, instruct &amp; take care of them. such a mission, whether of influential chiefs, or of young people, would give some security to your own party. carry with you some matter of the kine-pox, inform those of them with whom you may be of it' efficacy as a preservative from the small-pox; and instruct &amp; incourage them in the use of it. this may be especially done wherever you winter. As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by those people, whether with hospitality or hostility, so is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your journey. we value too much the lives of citizens to offer them to probably destruction. your numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition of individuals, or of small parties: but if a superior force, authorised or not authorised. by a nation, should be arrayed against your further passage, &amp; inflexibly determined to arrest it, you must decline it's further pursuit, and return. in the loss of yourselves, we should lose also the information you will have acquired. by returning safely with that, you may enable us to renew the essay with better calculated means. to your own discretion therefore must be left the degree of danger you may risk, &amp; the point at which you should decline, only saying we wish you to err on the side of your safety, &amp; bring back your party safe, even if it be with less information. As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an intercourse will probably be found to exist between them and the Spanish posts at St. Louis, opposite Cahokia, or Ste. Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia. from still farther up the river, the traders may furnish a conveyance for letters. beyond that you may perhaps be able to engage Indians to bring letters for the government to Cahokia or Kaskaskia, on promising that they shall there receive such special compensation as you shall have stipulated with them. avail yourself of these means to communicate to us, at seasonable intervals, a copy of your journal, notes &amp; observations of every kind, putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed. Should you reach the Pacific ocean [One full line scratched out, indecipherable.—Ed.] inform yourself of the circumstances which may decide whether the furs of those parts may not be collected as advantageously at the head of the Missouri (convenient as is supposed to the waters of the Colorado &amp; Oregon or Columbia) as at Nootka sound or any other point of that coast; &amp; that trade be consequently conducted through the Missouri &amp; U. S. more beneficially than by the circumnavigation now practised. On your arrival on that coast endeavor to learn if there be any port within your reach frequented by the sea-vessels of any nation, and to send two of your trusty people back by sea, in such way as shall appear practicable, with a copy of your notes. and should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the way they went will be eminently dangerous, then ship the whole, &amp; return by sea by way of Cape Horn or the Cape of good Hope, as you shall be able. as you will be without money, clothes or provisions, you must endeavor to use the credit of the U. S. to obtain them; for which purpose open letters of credit shall be furnished you authorising you to draw on the Executive of the U. S. or any of its officers in any part of the world, on which drafts can be disposed of, and to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls, agents, merchants or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse, assuring them in our name that any aids they may furnish you, shall honorably repaid, and on demand. Our consuls Thomas Howes at Batavia in Java, William Buchanan of the isles of France and Bourbon, &amp; John Elmslie at the Cape of good hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us. Should you find it safe to return by the way you go, after sending two of your party round by sea, or with your whole party, if no conveyance by sea can be found, do so; making such observations on your return as may serve to supply, correct or confirm those made on your outward journey. In re-entering the U. S. and reaching a place of safety, discharge any of your attendants who may desire &amp; deserve it, procuring for them immediate paiment of all arrears of pay &amp; cloathing which may have incurred since their departure; &amp; assure them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature for the grant of a soldier's portion of land each, as proposed in my message to Congress &amp; repair yourself with your papers to the seat of government. To provide, on the accident of your death, against anarchy, dispersion &amp; the consequent danger to your party, and total failure of the enterprise, you are hereby authorised, by any instrument signed &amp; written in your hand, to name the person among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease, &amp; by like instruments to change the nomination from time to time, as further experience of the characters accompanying you shall point out superior fitness: and all the powers &amp; authorities given to yourself are, in the event of your death, transferred to &amp; vested in the successor so named, with further power to him, &amp; his successors in like manner to name each his successor, who, on the death of his predecessor, shall be invested with all the powers &amp; authorities given to yourself. Given under my hand at the city of Washington, this 20th. day of June 1803 Th. Jefferson Pr. U S. of America XIX JEFFERSON TO HENRY PEYROUX DE LA COUDRENAIRE1 1 Spanish commandant at Ste. Genevieve.—Ed. [Extract from Ford, viii. p. 199.] Washington, July 3, 1803. Dear Sir: Since I had the pleasure of your acquaintance in Philadelphia in 1791, I had supposed you were returned to Europe. I have lately however been told that you preside at present at Ste. Genevieve &amp; [St.] Louis. I cannot therefore omit the satisfaction of writing to you by Capt. Lewis, an officer in our army, &amp; for some time past my secretary. As our former acquaintance was a mixt one of science &amp; business so is the occasion of renewing it. You know that the geography of the Missouri and the most convenient water communication from the head of that to the Pacific ocean is a desideratum not yet satisfied. Since coming to the administration of the U. S. I have taken the earliest opportunity in my power to have that communication explored, and Capt. Lewis with a party of twelve or fifteen men is authorized to do it. His journey being merely literary, to inform us of the geography &amp; natural history of the country, I have procured a passport for him &amp; his party, from the minister of France here, it being agreed between him &amp; the Spanish minister, that the country having been ceded to France, her minister may most properly give authority for the journey. This was the state of things when the passport was given, which was some time since. But before Capt. Lewis's actual departure we learn through a channel of unquestionable information that France has ceded the whole country of Louisiana to the U. S. by a treaty concluded in the first days of May. But for an object as innocent &amp; useful as this I am sure you will not be scrupulous as to the authorities on which this journey is undertaken; &amp; that you will give all the protection you can to Capt. Lewis &amp; his party in going &amp; returning. I have no doubt you can be particularly useful to him, and it is to solicit your patronage that I trouble you with the present letter, praying you at the same time to accept my friendly salutations &amp; assurances of my high respect &amp; consideration. XX JEFFERSON'S LETTER OF CREDIT TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 1, vol. 9, doc. 94.]1 1 At least three copies of this letter of credit appear to have been made, all of them in Jefferson's handwriting. We follow, as stated, the manuscript in the Jefferson Papers—probably the original draft; another copy was found among the papers of Clark, and is now the property of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis, of New York City; another, "resurrected at Helena, Mont. . . . sere will age, misshapen with numerous foldings, and 'dog-eared' from the treatment of not quite a century," was published first in the Seattle (Wash.) Post-Intelligencer, and therefrom into Lewisiana (Guilford, Conn.) for September, 1895. The last-named is fac-similed in Wheeler, On the Trail of Lewis and Clark, i, p. 41, and may have been the copy carried by Lewis.—Ed Washington, U. S. of America, July 4, 1803. Dear Sir: In the journey which you are about to undertake2 2 Lewis left Washington for the West the following day (July 5).—Ed. for the discovery of the course and source of the Missouri, and of the most convenient water communication from thence to the Pacific ocean, your party being small, it is to be expected that you will encounter considerable dangers from the Indian inhabitants. should you escape those dangers and reach the Pacific ocean, you may find it imprudent to hazard a return the same way, and be forced to seek a passage round by sea, in such vessels as you may find on the Western coast. but you will be without money, without clothes, &amp; other necessaries; as a sufficient supply cannot be carried with you from hence. your resource in that case can only be in the credit of the U. S. for which purpose I hereby authorise you to draw on the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War &amp; of the Navy of the U S. according as you may find your draughts will be most negociable, for the purpose of obtaining money or necessaries for yourself &amp; your men; and I solemnly pledge the faith of the United States that these draughts shall be paid punctually at the date they are made payable. I also ask of the Consuls, agents, merchants &amp; citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse or amity to furnish you with those supplies which your necessities may call for, assuring them of honorable and prompt retribution. and our own Consuls in foreign parts where you may happen to be, are hereby instructed &amp; required to be aiding &amp; assisting you in whatsoever may be necessary for procuring your return back to the United States. And to give more entire satisfaction &amp; confidence to those who may be disposed to aid you, I Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States of America, have written this letter of general credit for you with my own hand, and signed it with my name. Th: Jefferson To Capt. Meriwether Lewis. XXI LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 108.] 12 O'Clock. Harper's Ferry, July 8th. 1803. Dear Sir: The waggon which was employed by Mr. Linnard 1 1 William Linnard of Pennsylvania was appointed military agent for the Middle Department of the U. S. Army, May 3, 1802. In the War of 1812–15 he was quartermaster-general.—Ed. (the Military Agent at Philadelphia) to transport the articles forming my outfit, passed this place on the 28th. Ult. the waggoner determined that his team was not sufficiently strong to take the whole of the articles that had been prepared for me at this place and therfore took none of them; of course it became necessary to provide some other means of geting them forward; for this purpose on the evening of the 5th. at Fredericktown I engaged a person with a light two horse-waggon who promised to set out with them this morning, in this however he has dissapointed me and I have been obliged to engage a second person who will be here this evening in time to load and will go on early in the morning: I shall set out myself in the course of an hour, taking the rout of Charlestown, Frankfort, Uniontown, and Redstone old fort2 2 Now Brownsville, Pa.—Ed to Pittsburgh, at which place I shall most probably arrive on the 15th. Yesterday I shot my guns and examined the several articles which had been manufactured for me at this place; they appear to be well executed. My complyments to Mr. Harvie, &amp; accept the assureance of my sincere wishes for your health and happiness. Your friend &amp; Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis. Mr. Jefferson, Presidt. of U S.

Washington, July 11, 03. XXIII JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 115.] Washington, July 15, 1803. Dear Sir: I dropped you a line on the 11th. inst. and last night recieved yours of the 8th. last night also we recieved the treaty from Paris ceding Louisiana according to the bounds to which France had a right. price 11 ¼ millions of Dollars, besides paying certain debts of France to our citizens which will be from 1, to 4, millions. I received also from Mr. La Cepede,1 1 Bernard Germain Etienne de Laville, Comte de Lacépède, a distinguished French naturalist. He had just published (1803) a history of butterflies, in five volumes.—Ed. at Paris, to whom I had mentioned your intended expedition a letter of which the following is an extract. "Mr Broughton, one of the companions of Mr. Vancouver went up Columbia River 100 miles, in December 1792. he stopped at a point which he named Vancouver, lat. 45° 27′, longitude 237° 50′ E. here the river Columbia is still a quarter of a mile wide &amp; from 12 to 36 feet deep. It is far then to it's head. from this point Mount Hood is seen 20 leagues distant, which is probably a dependence of the Stony mountains, of which mr Fiedler saw the beginning about lat 40° and the source of the Missouri river is probably in the Stony mountains. if your nation can establish an easy communication by rivers, canals &amp; short portages between N. York for example &amp; the city (they were building) or (to be built) (for the badness of the writing makes it uncertain which is meant, but probably the last) at the mouth of the Columbia, what a route for the commerce of Europe, Asia &amp; America." Accept my affectionate salutations. Th. Jefferson. Capt. M. Lewis. XXIV CLARK ACCEPTS LEWIS'S INVITATION [Rough draft, by Clark. From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Clarksville 17th July 1803 Dear Lewis: I received by yesterday's Mail your letter of the 19th ulto: the contents of which I received with much pleasure. The enterprise &amp; Mission is such as I have long anticipated &amp; am much pleased with and as my situation in life will admit of my absence the length of time necessary to accomplish such an undertaking, I will cheerfully join you in an "official character" as mentioned in your letter and partake of all the Dangers Difficulties &amp; fatigues, and I anticipate the honors &amp; rewards of the result of such an enterprise should we be successful in accomplishing it. This is an imense undertaking fraited with numerous dificulties, but my friend I can assure you that no man lives with whom I would prefer to undertake and share the Dificulties of such a trip than yourself. I reserve nothing from you that will add either to yr. profit or satisfaction and shall arrange my matters as well as I can against your arrival here. It may be necessary that you inform the president of my acceding to the proposals, so that I may be furnished with such credentials, as the nature of the Tour may require, which I suppose had best be forwarded to Louisville. The objects of this Plan of Government's are great and appear flattering the means with which we are furnished to carry it into effect, I think are sufficiently liberal. The plan of operation which you inform me you intended to pursue (with a small addition as to the outfit) I highly approve of. I shall endeavor to engage temporally such men as I think may answer our purpose but, holding out the Idea as stated in your letter— the subject of which has been mentioned in Louisville several weeks ago. Pray write to me by every post, I shall be exceedingly anxious to know where you are and how you proceed. With every assurance of sincerity in every respect, and with affn.. yr.. fd.. &amp; H. Srv W.C. XXV LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 100.] Pittsburgh, July 22d. 1803. Dear Sir: Yours of the 11th. &amp; 15th. Inst. were duly recieved, the former on the 18th. inst. the latter on this day. For my pocketbook I thank you: the dirk could not well come by post, nor is it of any moment to me, the knives that were made at Harper's ferry will answer my purpose equally as well and perhaps better; it can therefore be taken care of untill my return: the bridle is of no consequence at all. After the reciept of this letter I think it will be best to direct me at Louisville Kentuckey. The person who contracted to build my boat engaged to have it in readiness by the 20th. inst.; in this however he has failed; he pleads his having been disappointed in procuring timber, but says he has now supplyed himself with the necessary materials, and that she shall be completed by the last of this month; however in this I am by no means sanguine, nor do I believe from the progress he makes that she will be ready before the 5th. of August; I visit him every day, and endeavour by every means in my power to hasten the completion of the work: I have prevailed on him to engage more hands, and he tells me two others will join him in the morning, if so, he may probably finish the boat by the time he mentioned: I shall embark immediately the boat is in readiness, there being no other consideration which at this moment detains me. The Waggon from Harper's ferry arrived today, bringing everything with which she was charged in good order. The party of recruits that were ordered from Carlisle to this place with a view to descend the river with me, have arrived with the exception of one, who deserted on the march, his place however can be readily supplyed from the recruits at this place enlisted by Lieut. Hook. The current of the Ohio is extreemly low and continues to decline, this may impede my progress but shall not prevent my proceeding, being determined to get forward though I should not be able to make a greater distance than a mile pr day.— I am with the most sincere regard Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis. Thomas Jefferson President U. S. XXVI CLARK NOTIFIES JEFFERSON [Rough draft, on third page of the same sheet with Clark's letter to Lewis (doc. no. xxiv), evidently the scheme of a letter to the President. A partial duplicate of this memorandum appears again on the fourth page of the sheet, with date above it, "24th.. July."] I had the Honor of receiving thro' Cap. Lewis an assurance of your approbation and wish that I would join him in a N. W. Enterprise. Altho' a Tour of this kind is [two words illegible] dificulties and dangers I will chearfully join my F. Lewis in the accomplishment of them, and shall arrange my business so as to be in readiness to set out in a short time after he arrives here. May I request the favour of you to forward the inclosed letter to Cap. Lewis should he not be with you? May I have the pleasure of hering from you? I am with respt. XXVII CLARK REITERATES HIS ACCEPTANCE OF LEWIS'S OFFER [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Louisville 24th July 1803 Dear Lewis: I wrote you in answer to your letter of the 19th ulto: by the last Mail, the contents of which as I before informed you were truly pleasing to me and such as I heartily join you in. I am arranging my matters so as to detain but a short time after your arrival here, well convinced of the necessity of getting as far as possible up the—— this fall to accomplish the object as laid down by yourself and which I highly approve of. I have temporally engaged some men for the enterprise of a description calculated to work &amp; go thro' those labours &amp; fatigues which will be necessary. Several young men (gentlemen's sons) have applyed to accompany us. As they are not accustomed to labour and as that is a verry essential part of the services required of the party, I am cautious in giving them any encouragement. The newspaper accounts seem to confirm the report of war in Europe and the session of Louisiana to the United States and as I think it possible that a confirmation of the session of Louisiana may have detained you at the City longer than you expected, I have enclosed a letter to you under cover to Mr. Jefferson. Pray let me hear from you as often as possible. Yr. WC. [The following paragraph in the above rough draft was scratched out:] My friend I join you with hand &amp; Heart and anticipate advantages which will certainly arrive from the accomplishment of so vast, Hazidous &amp; fatiguing enterprise. You no doubt will inform the president of my determination to join you in an "official Character" as mentioned in your letter. The Credentials necessary for me to be furnished with had best be forwarded to this place, and if we set out before their arrival, to Kaskaskie. XXVIII LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 101.] Pittsburgh, July 26th. 1803. Dear Sir: I have recieved as yet no answer from Mr. Clark: in the event of Mr. Clark's declining to accompany me Lieut Hooke1 1 Moses Hooke, first lieutenant in the First Infantry, Lewis's old regiment.—Ed. of this place has engaged to do so, if permitted; and I think from his disposition and qualifications that I might safely calculate on being as ably assisted by him in the execution of the objects of my mission, as I could wish, or would be, by any other officer in the Army. Lieut. Hooke is about 26 years of age, endowed with a good constitution, possessing a sensible well informed mind, is industrious, prudent and persevering, and withall intrepid and enterprising: he has acted as Military Agent at this place for a few months past, and of course will have some public accounts to adjust, tho' he tells me he can settle those accounts, deliver the public stores to the person who may be directed to take charge of them, and prepare to go with me, at any time, within the course of a day or two. Should I recieve no answer from Mr. Clark previous to my leaving this place, or he decline going with me, I would be much gratifyed with being authorized to take Lieut. Hooke with me, first directing him to settle his public accounts, and make such disposition of the publick stores as the Secretary of War may think proper to direct. There is a Capt. Reed of the Artly. here, who will probably not leave this place untill an answer can be recieved, or if he should, Majr. Craig of Pittsburgh would take charge of the stores untill an officer could be ordered on for that purpose. It is probable that you will have left Washington before this letter can reach that place, and if so, knowing the delay incident to a communication between yourself and the Secretary of War at such a distance, and conceiving that it would be necessary that he should decide whether from the nature of his arrangements Lieut. Hooke could leave his present station with propriety or not, or his place be supplyed without injury to the public service, I have thought it best to inclose this letter to him unsealed, with the request that should you be absent, he would read it and give me an answer on the subject of it as early as possible. It is most probable that I shall leave Pittsburgh before an answer can be returned to this letter, I take the liberty therefore to suggest, that the answer to me had better be inclosed to Lieut Hooke, unsealed, with instructions to him that in the event of my absence, he should read it, and govern himself accordingly. If Lieut. Hooke sets out twenty days after me, by taking the rout of Limestone, Louisville and Vincennes he will reach the mouth of the Missourie as early as I shall. I am with the most sincere attatchment Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis. The President of the United States. XXIX LEWIS'S REPLY TO CLARK'S ACCEPTANCE [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Pittsburgh August 3rd 1803. Dear Clark: Yours of the 19th &amp; 24th U1t.. have been duly received, and be assured I feel myself much gratifyed with your decision; for I could neither hope, wish, or expect from a union with any man on earth, more perfect support or further aid in the discharge of the several duties of my mission, than that, which I am confident I shall derive from being associated with yourself. The articles of every description forming my outfit for this expedition have arrived in good order; my boat only detains me, she is not yet compleated tho' the workman who contracted to build her promises that she shall be in readiness by the last of the next week. The water is low, this may retard, but shall not totally obstruct my progress being determined to proceed tho' I should not be able to make greater speed than a boat's length pr day. I am pleased to heare that you have engaged some men for this service, your contract with them had better be with the condition of my approval, as by the time I shall arrive more will have offered themselves and a better scelection may of course be made; from the nature of this enterprise much must depend on a judicious scelection of our men; their qualifycations should be such as perfectly fit them for the service outherwise they will reather clog than further the objects in view; on this principle I am well pleased that you have not admitted or encouraged the young gentlemen you mention, we must set our faces against all such applications and get rid of them on the best terms we can, they will not answer our purposes: if a good hunter or two could be conditionally engaged I would think them an acquisition, they must however understand that they will not be employed for the purposes of hunting exclusively but must bear a portion of the labour in common with the party. Sometime in the month of February last a young man by the name of John Conner residing among the Delleware Indians on White River offered himself, by letter, to accompany me in the capacity of Interpreter; I wrote him in answer accepting his services and giving him some instructions relative to the points at which I wished him to join me as also to engage one or two Indian hunters for the service—of this letter I forwarded triplicates by different routs but have never received an answer: I am personally acquainted with this man and think that we could not get a person better qualifyed in every respect than he is, and that it will be advisable to spare no pains to get him. If you cannot learn that Conner has gone on to Massac Kaskaskia or Illinois, (which are the places I appointed for his joining me) I think it will be best for you to hire a man to go to the Delleware Town and enquire after him, you may offer him 300 dollars a year and find him provisions and clothing—should he be at the Deleware town and be willing to engage on these terms he had better come on immediately and join us at Louisville. He is a trader among the Indians and I think he told me he lived on White River at the nearest Dellaware town to Fort Hamilton and distant from that place about 24 miles. The session of Louisiana is now no [word illegible] on the 14th of July the President received the treaty from Paris, by which France has ceded to the U. States, Louisiana according to the bounds to which she had a wright, price 11 ¼ Millions of dollars, besides paying certain debts of France to our citizens which will be from one to four millions; the Western people may now estimate the value of their possessions. I have been detained much longer than I expected but shall be with you by the last of this month. Your sincere friend &amp; Obt.. Servt.. Note—Write &amp; direct to me at Cincinnatti XXX CLARK TO JOHN CONNOR [Rough draft of a letter by Clark. From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Mr. John Conner Sir: Some time in the month of February last you offered your self by letter to accompany Capt. Meriweather Lewis on n. Western expedition in the capacity of an Interpreter and informed him that you resided among the Delleware Indians on White River. Capt. Lewis wrote you in answer two letters &amp; sent them different routs accepting of your services and in his letter gave instructions in relation to the points at which he wished you to join him etc. He has never received an answer from you on this subject nor heard of your being at the points at which he wished you to join him. I am (one the official characters for the Enterprise) equally anxious with Captain Lewis that you should be one of our party &amp; in the event of your accompanying us as an Inteptr.. we will give you 300 dollars a year and find you provisions &amp; clothing. Should you be willing to engage on those terms you had best come on immediately &amp; join us at this place. Captain Floyd the gentleman who will hand you this letter has Promised to enquire particularly for you. He is a gentleman of great integrity in whom you may feel the most complete confidence. 20th August 1803 XXXI LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 102.] Wheeling, September 8th. 1803. Dear Sir: It was not untill 7 O'Clock on the morning of the 31st. Ultmo. that my boat was completed, she was instantly loaded, and at 10 A. M. on the same day I left Pittsburgh, where I had been moste shamefully detained by the unpardonable negligence of my boat builder. On my arrival at Pittsburgh, my calculation was that my boat would be in readiness by the 5th of August; this term however elapsed and the boat so far from being finished was only partially planked on one side; in this situation I had determined to abandon the boat, and to purchase two or three perogues and descend the river in them, and depend on purchasing a boat as I descended, there being none to be had at Pittsburgh; from this resolution I was dissuaded first by the representations of the best informed merchants of that place who assured me that the chances were much against my being able to procure a boat below; and secondly by the positive assureances given me by the boat-builder that she would be ready on the last of the then ensuing week (the 13th.): however a few days after, according to his usual custom he got drunk, quarrelled with his workmen, and several of them left him, nor could they be prevailed on to return: I threatened him with the penalty of his contract, and exacted a promise of greater sobriety in future which, he took care to perform with as little good faith, as he had his previous promises with regard to the boat, continuing to be constantly either drunk or sick. I spent most of my time with the workmen, alternately presuading and threatening, but neither threats, presuasion or any other means which I could devise were sufficient to procure the completion of the work sooner than the 31st of August; by which time the water was so low that those who pretended to be acquainted with the navigation of the river declared it impracticable to descend it; however in conformity to my previous determination I set out, having taken the precaution of sending a part of my baggage by a waggon to this place, and also to procure a good pilot. my days journey have averaged about 12 miles, but in some instances, with every exertion I could make was unable to exceed 4 1/2 &amp; 5 miles pr day. This place is one hundred miles distant from Pittsburgh by way of the river and about sixty five by land When the Ohio is in it's present state there are many obstructions to it's navigation formed by bars of small stones which in some instances are intermixed with, and partially cover large quntities of driftwood; these bars frequently extend themselves entirely across the bed of the river, over many of them I found it impossible to pass even with my emty boat, without geting into the water and lifting her over by hand; over others my force was even inadequate to enable me to pass in this manner, and I found myself compelled to hire horses or oxen from the neighbouring farmers and drag her over them; in this way I have passed as many as five of those bars, (or as they are here called riffles) in a day, and to unload as many or more times. The river is lower than it has ever been known by the oldest settler in this country. I shall leave this place tomorrow morning, and loose no time in getting on. I have been compelled to purchase a perogue at this place in order to transport the baggage which was sent by land from Pittsburgh, and also to lighten the boat as much as possible. On many bars the water in the deepest part dose not exceed six inches. I have the honour to be with the most perfect regard and sincere attatchment, Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st. U. S. Regt. Infty. Thomas Jefferson President of the U States XXXII LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 103.] On board my boat opposite Marietta, September 13th. 1803. Dear Sir: I arrived here at 7 P.M. and shall pursue my journey early tomorrow. This place is one hundred miles distant from Wheeling, from whence in descending the water is reather more abundant than it is between that place and Pittsburgh, insomuch that I have been enabled to get on without the necessity of employing oxen or horses to drag my boat over the riffles except in two instances; tho' I was obliged to cut a passage through four or five bars and by that means past them; this last operation is much more readily performed than you would imagin; the gravel of which many of these bars are formed, being small and lying in a loose state is readily removed with a spade, or even with a wooden shovel and when set in motion the current drives it a considerable distance before it subsides or again settles at the bottom; in this manner I have cut a passage for my boat of 50 yards in length in the course of an hour; this method however is impracticable when driftwood or clay in any quantity is intermixed with the gravel; in such cases Horses or oxen are the last resort; I find them the most efficient sailors in the present state of the navigation of this river, altho' they may be considered somewhat clumsey. I have the honour to be with much respect, Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st. U. S. Regt. Infty. Thomas Jefferson, President of the U States. XXXIII LEWIS TO CLARK [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Cincinnati, September 28 1803 Dear Clark: After a most tedious and laborious passage from Pittsburgh I have at length reached this place; it was not until the 31st of August that I was enabled to take my departure from that place owing to the unpardonable negligence and inattention of the boat builders who, unfortunately for me, were a set of most incorrigible drunkards, and with whom, neither threats, intreaties nor any other mode of treatment which I could devise had any effect; as an instance of their tardyness it may serfice to mention that they were 12 days in preparing my poles and oars. I here had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 21st of August &amp; the 11th of Septr.. I am much pleased with the measures you have taken relative to the engaging the men you mention, as men of that discription only will answer our purposes; I scarcely suppose that such as you have conceived not fully qualifyed for this service will by any means meet my approbation; your ideas in the subject of a judicious scelection of our party perfectly comport with my own. I have two young men with me whom I have taken on trial and have not yet engaged them, but conditionally only, tho' I think they will answer tolerably well; there are a party of soldiers, 6 or 8 in number, now at Massac waiting my arrival. They were scelected from the troops in the state of Tennessee by Majr.. MacRae, perhaps most of these will answer; I am also authorized to scelect by voluntary engagement any men from the Companys of Capts.. R &amp; D Bissel's and Stoddart's now occupying the posts of Massac &amp; Kaskaskias; from these I think we shall be enabled to form our party without much difficulty; 4 or five french water-men I conceive will be essential, this we can do I presume very readily at St. Louis. The amount of the monthly compensation (or 10$) which you have mention to the men is precisely what I have calculated on; I shall cloth and subsist the men I have with me, these will of course form a proper charge against the U. States and in addition to the monthly wages of a private will as estimated by the Secretary of War and myself amount to reather more than 10$ pr.. month. I do not much regret the loss of Mr. Connor for several reasons which I shall mention to you when we meet; he has deceived me very much. It is probable before the receipt of this letter that I shall be with you; I shall leave this the day after to-morrow. Adieu and believe me your very sincere friend and associate Meriwether Lewis XXXIV LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 104.] Cincinnati, October 3rd. 1803. Dear Sir: I reached this place on the 28th. Ult., it being necessary to take in a further supply of provisions here, and finding my men much fatiegued with the labour to which they had been subjected in descending the river, I determined to recruit them by giving them a short respite of a few days; having now obtained the distance of five hundred miles. on the evening of the 1st. inst. I again dispatched my boat with Orders to meet me at the Big Bone lick, to which place I shall pass by land it being distant from hence only seventeen miles while by water it is fifty three, a distance that will require my boat in the present state of the water near three days to attain. The late researches of Dr William Goforth1 1 Dr. William Goforth, a prominent physician, removed to Kentucky in 1788 and to Cincinnati in 1800. The explorations at Big Bone Lick were conducted at his own expense, and in the interests of science. He was later defrauded of the results of this effort by an Englishman who offered to place the remains of the mammoth in some European museum; but who sold and dispersed the fossils and then disappeared.—Ed. of this place at that Lick has made it a place of more interesting enquiry than formerly, I shall therefore seize the present moment to visit it, and set out early tomorrow morning for that purpose. Dr. Goforth in the begining of May last with a view to obtain a complete skeleton of the Mammoth, sunk a pitt 30 feet square and eleven feet in debth in a moist part of the Big Bone Lick, from which he obtained a large number of specimens of the bones of this anamal, tho' generally in a very imperfect and mutilated state; he also obtained from the same pitt several grinders of the anamal, generally supposed to be an Elephant from their affinity to the teeth of that anamal, these last are very perfect; a part of this collection of bones, the Dr. has in his possession at this place and has been so obliging as to favour me with an examinetion of them; the other part of the Drs. collection is yet at the Lick, these he informs me are much more perfect than those he shewed me particularly the upper portion of a head, and some other specimens which had been obtained from a small pitt, sunk in a dryer part of the Lick by a young [man] to whom, in his absence he had confided the prosecution of his researches; among these specimens the Dr. also mentioned a tusk of an immence size, the dementions of which he could not furnish me with, not having yet seen it, but from the information of his assistant, states it's weight at 180 lbs.; this tusk is said to be in a good state of preservation. The Dr. informed me that he had been interdicted by the Agent of Mr. David Ross of Virginia (the proprietor of the Lick) from removing these bones, as he was also from the further prosecution of his researches; he is much chagrined at this occurrence, and seems very anxious that some measures should be taken by which to induce Mr. Ross to suffer him to prosecute his enquiries. The Doctr. presented me with two handsome specimens, the one a grinder of the Elaphant, the other, that of the Mammoth, the former weighs ten and ? pounds, the latter I have not weighed, from the circumstances of its roots being attached to a lump of clay, without seperating from which, it's weight could not be accurately ascertained; I concluded it would be better to forward it in it's present state, as the clay will not only guard this part of the tooth from injury in transporting it, but will at the same time furnish a good specimen of the earth of which the lick is formed. Dr. Goforth was so good as to grant me his permission to take from those bones now at the Lick the large tusk before noticed, and any other bones that are to be found among his collection at that place: Capt. Findley who accompanys me to the Lick says he is well acquainted with the Agent of Mr. Ross, and thinks he can obtain his permission also for the same purpose; should I succeed you may expect to recieve through Mr. Trist,1 1 Hore Browse Trist was the son of a neighbor of Jefferson's at Charlottesville, who was at this time taking up his residence in Mississippi Territory, having been appointed collector for the port of Fort Adams. Jefferson did not fulfil his intention of making him collector for New Orleans as expressed in doc. lv, post, but made him collector of the district of Mississippi, Feb. 24, 1804.—Ed. this large tusk together with the two grinders before mentioned, and such other specimines as I may be enabled to procure, and which, I may think worthy your acceptance. All the bones, which I observed in the possession of Dr. Goforth appear to be those of the Mammoth, accept only the Elephant-like griners; the most remarkable among them was a portion of the lower or larger part of a tusk, measuring one foot ten inches in circumpherence and five feet eight inches in length, the Dr. informed me when he first obtained it, it was upwards of six feet in length and weighed one hundred pounds; the greates circumpherence of the tusks of Mr. Peale's skeleton I believe is not more than one foot six ? inches. As the anatomy of the Mammoth has already been so well ascertained by the skeleton in the possession of Mr. Peal (the upper portion of the head excepted) I confined my enquiries mearly to a search for this part of the skeleton, and for such specimens of the tusks as would enable me to deside a question which appears not yet fully to have been satisfyed (viz) Whether the flat or sythe-shaped tusks so frequently found in the same bed with the acknowledged tusks of the Mammoth are the tusks of that anamal, or a different one? With regard to the first of these enquiries I was unsuccessful, finding only one mutilated specimen of the upper portion of the head, the frontal bone of which was entirely decayed; I was therefore unable to form any just idea of it's shape; as to the second, I was more fortunate, obtaining many specimens of both the acknowledged Mammoth tusks, as well as those of the flat tusks, both in a sound and an imperfect state; these I compared with attention; but before I proceed to express an opinion with respect to the homogeniallogy of these tusks I will give a short description of these specimens, in order Sir, that you may from thence draw your own inferences, and make your own deductions. The tusks of the Mammoth were conical, much Curved and also spiral or twisted; the fragments of whatever portion of the tusk were homologus to the same part of a complete tusk; when by decay the end of a section of any large part of the tusk was observed, the ends of the broken lateral stratas of the lamina, formed a number of circular rings, each imbracing and inclosing the other from the center to the circumpherence of the tusk, these rings howver, were of unequal thicknesses; when perfect the lamina assumes a yellowish white or cream colour, in it's decayed state it resembles white chalk, both in colour and consistance (see No. 2 specm. inclosed); the surface of the tusk sometimes assumes partially a black colour which from it's resemblance to the Buffalo Horn might on a slite examineation be taken for a similar substance, but on a more minute investigation it appears to be ivory, or the common lamina of the tusk, which, has acquired that colour from some cause, most probably, from the properties of the clay in which they had been so long deposited, this black Ivory (No. 2) is rarely more than two lines in thickness, gradually loossing it's hue inwards, untill it becomes the common colour of the tusk. The flat or sythe-like tusks assumed a great variety of figures, tho' uniformily curved; one was flat on both sides, near the large end of the tusk, where it was connected with the head; this was rendered conspicuous from the conic concavity common to this part, as well of the Mammoth, as these tusks at the larger end; and so much was it flatened, that this end of the tusk was left in a forked shape, while the smaller end assumed the curved, and connic shape, and was also spiral, as is that of the Mammoth: several were flated unequally on both sides near the small extremity of the tusk, the larger end being conical, curved, and spiral; while others were flat on one side only throughout the whole extent of the tusk; the lamina of these tusks, whether perfect, decayed or assuming the horn-like appearance, is the same substance precisely of the Mammoth tusk; in every instance where the tusk is flatened the circular rings of lamina are perfect when the diameter of those rings do not exceed the thickness of the tusk, which last I found unequal in the different specimens; and when the rings of lamina exceed the thickness of the tusk they are broken, but still we find the corresponding parts of these broken rings, attatched to either side of the perfect one, and succeeding each other throughout the whole width of the tusk; thus presenting the exact figure of the Mammoth's tusk reduced to a flat surface on both sides by being grownd down. I also observed that several bones that were in a good state of preservation, appeared to have been woarn away in the same manner, or from the same cause, which had flattened the tusks, particularly a large grinder of the Mammoth which struck my attention, it was unconnected with the jawbone; one third of the volume, of this tooth seemed to have been woarn away, as if reduced on one side by being grown down to a plane surface; the enamel of the fractured edge appeared to have given way equally with the bone of the tooth and presented a smooth surface; no part of this tooth shewed any sharp fracture which, might induce a belief that it was reduced to it's present shape by a violent or sudden stroke. Finding that the upper part of a tusk was flattened which shape it could not have acquired during the existence of the living anamal, it being that part of the tusk which by bone or cartilage must have been united with the head; that in every case where the same specimen united both the character of the Mammoth and flat tusk, that portion resembleing the Mammoth tusk was in all respects it's prototipe; that the tusk of the Mammoth is well defined, and that it's characteristics strongly mark it; that the lamina of both the flat and the conic tusks, are invariably the same in similar states of preservation; and that in all instances where the tusk is flattened the lateral lamina shews evedent marks of violence, I can therefore have no remaining doubt of these flat or sythe-like tusks being the tusks of the Mammoth; and from the appearance of the flatten grinder of the Mammoth before noticed, I am strongly disposed to believe that these flat tusks of the Mammoth have acquired that shape in consequence of the sand and gravel passing over them for a great length of time caused by a runing stream or agitated water. The Elephants teeth which I saw in the possession of Dr. Goforth weigh from four to eleven pounds, and appear to me to precisely resemble a specimen of these teeth which I saw in the possession of Dr. Wister of Philadelphia and which if my recollection serves me, Dr. Wister informed me was found in S. Carolina: the Dr. has since assured me, that from a comparison of this specimen with the plates representing the teeth of the Asiatic Elephat contained in the late Vol. of the British philosophical transactions, that he is perfectly convinced that it is the tooth of the Asiatic Elephant or an anamal very much resembling it. Relative to these teeth it may not be unworthy of remark, that so far as I have been able to inform myself, they are never found adjacent to the bones of any anamal of their comparative size except those of the Mammoth; or such as from their affinity to that anamal have always been admitted to be the bones of the Mammoth. These teeth are never found attatched to the bones of the jaw; and notwithstanding the high state of preservation in which those Elephant's teeth are found, that no other pat of it's fraim should yet have been discovered is America. From the shape and termination of both extremities of these grinders they each appear to have completely filled it's respective jaw-bone. Not any of the bones or tusks which I saw were petrifyed, either preserving their primitive states of bone or ivory; or when decayed, the former desolving into earth, intermixed with scales of the harder of more indessoluble parts of the bone, while the latter assumed the appearance of pure white chalk. I would thank you to forward me some of the Vaxcine matter, as I have reason to believe from seeveral experiments made with what I have, that it has lost it's virtue. Conner, the interpretter I had calculated on engaging, has declined; however I do not feel much disappointment at this occurrence, being well assured that a suitable person of that description can be procured at St. Louis. So soon Sir, as you deem it expedient to promulge the late treaty, between the United States and France I would be much obliged by your directing an official copy of it to be furnished me, as I think it probable that the present inhabitants of Louisiana, from such an evidence of their having become the Citizens of the United States, would feel it their interest and would more readily yeald any information of which they may be possessed relative to the country than they would be disposed to do, while there is any doubt remaining on that subject. As this Session of Congress has commenced earlyer than usual, and as from a variety of incidental circumstances my progress has been unexpectedly delayed, and feeling as I do in the most anxious manner a wish to keep them in a good humour on the subject of the expedicion in which I am engaged, I have concluded to make a tour this winter on horseback of some hundred miles through the most interesting portion of the country adjoining my winter establishment; perhaps it may be up the Canceze River and towards Santafee, at all events it will bee on the South side of the Missouri. Should I find that Mr. Clark can with propiety also leave the party, I will prevail upon him also to undertake a similar excurtion through some other portion of the country; by this means I hope and am pursuaded that by the middle of February or 1st. of March I shall be enabled to procure and forward to you such information relative to that Country, which, if it dose not produce a conviction of the utility of this project, will at least procure the further toleration of the expedition. It will be better to forward all letters and papers for me in future to Cahokia. The water still continues lower in the Ohio than it was ever known. I am with every sentiment of gratitude and respect, Your, Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st. U. S. Regt. Infty.

XXXVI JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS, in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 1, vol. 9, doc. 305.] Washington, Nov. 16, 1803. Dear Sir: I have not written to you since the 11th. &amp; 18th. of July, since which yours of July 15, 22, 23, Sept. 8, 13, &amp; Oct. 3, have been recieved. The present has been long delayed by an expectation daily of getting the inclosed account of Louisiana through the press, the materials are recieved from different persons, of good authority. I enclose you also copies of the treaties for Louisiana, the act for taking possession, a letter from Dr. Wister, &amp; some information obtained by myself from Printeau's journal in Ms. all of which may be useful to you. the act for taking possession passes with only some small verbal variations from that inclosed, of no consequence. orders went from hence signed by the King of Spain &amp; the first Consul of France, so as to arrive at Natchez, yesterday evening and we expect the delivery of the province at New Orleans will take place about the close of the ensuing week, say about the 25th. inst. Govr. Claiborne is appointed to execute the powers of Commandant &amp; Intendant, until a regular government shall be organized here. at the moment of delivering over the posts in the vicinity of N. Orleans, orders will be dispatched from thence to those in Upper Louisiana to evacuate &amp; to deliver them immediately. you can judge better than I can when they may be expected to arrive at these posts, considering how much you have been detained by low waters, how late it will be before you can leave Cahokia, how little progress up the Missouri you can make before the freezing of the river; that your winter might be passed in gaining much information by making Cahokia or Kaskaskia your head quarters, &amp; going to St. Louis &amp; the other Spanish posts that your stores &amp;c. would thereby be spared for the winter, as your men would draw their military rations, all danger of Spanish opposition avoided, we are strongly of the opinion here that you had better not enter the Missouri until the spring, but as you have a view of all circumstances on the spot, we do not pretend to enjoin it, but leave it to your own judgment in which we have entire confidence. one thing however we are decided in: that you must not undertake the winter excursion which you propose in yours of Oct. 3. such an excursion will be more dangerous than the main expedition up the Missouri, &amp; would, by an accident to you, hazard our main object, which, since the acquisition of Louisiana, interests everybody in the highest degree. The object of your mission is single, the direct water communication from sea to sea formed by the bed of the Missouri &amp; perhaps the Oregon. By having mr. Clarke with you we consider the expedition double manned, &amp; therefore the less liable to failure, for which reason neither of you should be exposed to risques by going off of your line. I have proposed in conversation, &amp; it seems generally to be assented to, that Congress shall appropriate 10 or 12,000 D. for exploring the principal waters of the Missipi &amp; Missouri. in that case I should send a part of the Red river to its head, then to cross over to the head of the Arcansa, &amp; come down that. a 2d. party for the Pani &amp; Padouca rivers, &amp; a 3d. perhaps for the Moingona &amp; St. Peters. as the boundaries of interior Louisiana are the high lands enclosing all the waters which run into the Missipi or Missouri directly or indirectly, with a greater breadth on the Gulph of Mexico, it becomes interesting to fix with precision by celestial observations the longitude &amp; latitude of the sources of these rivers, and furnishing points in the contour of our new limits. this will be attempted distinctly from your mission, which we consider as of major importance, &amp; therefore not to be delayed or hazarded by any episodes whatever. The votes of both houses on ratifying and carrying the treaties into execution have been precisely party votes, except that Genl Dayton has separated from his friends on these questions &amp; voted for the treaties. I will direct the National Intelligencer to be forwarded to you for 6. months at Cahokia or Kaskaskia, on the presumption you will be there. our friends &amp; acquaintances here &amp; in Albermarle are all well as far as I have heard: and I recollect no other small news worth communicating; present my friendly salutations to mr. Clarke, &amp; accept them affectionately yourself. Th. Jefferson. Capt. Lewis.

In possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Cahokia December 17th 1803 Dear Captain: Drewyer arrived here last evening from Tennissee with eight men. I do not know how they may answer on experiment but I am a little disappointed, in finding them not possessed of more of the requisite qualifications; there is not a hunter among them. I send you by Drewyer your cloaths portmanteau and a letter which I received from St. Louis for you and which did not reach me untill an hour after Floyd had set out. Drewyer and myself have made no positive bargain, I have offered him 25$ pr. month so long as he may chuise to continue with us. Among the party from Tennissee is a blacksmith and House-joiner —these may be of service in our present situation. If two men could be spared from building the hutts would it not be better to set them at sawing of boards. Hennebury informed me that he would be at Morrison's farm to-day or To-morrow, and that he knew a person in the neighbourhood who had a whip-saw, and that he would go with any person you might send to this gentleman and prevail on him to let us have the uce of the saw. You can obtain corn for the horses by application to Hennebury or any person who has the care of Morrison's farm. I shall be obliged to go by St. Louis but will be with you as soon as possible. Adieu and believe sincerely your friend &amp; obt. servt. M. Lewis XXXIX LEWIS TO AUGUSTE CHOUTEAU [From Billon's Annals of St. Louis(St. Louis, 1886), pp. 384, 385.] St. Louis, Jan'y 4, 1804. Sir: I have taken the liberty to add to this, additional questions of a mixed nature relating to Upper Louisiana, your answers to which will be extremely gratifying, and very gratefully acknowledged. Your friend and Ob't Servant, Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st U. S. Regt. Infy. Mr. Aug's. Chouteau, Mixed questions relating to Upper Louisiana. 1.What is the present population? 2.What is the number of Emigrants from the United States into this country since the last year, ending Oct. 31, 1803, and what is the proportion of this kind of people, to the other free white population of Upper Louisiana? 3.What number of slaves and other people of colour? 4.What is the quantity of land granted, or which is claimed by individuals? The nature of the right, or pretensions by which the present possessors hold these lands? and the probable proportions of the whole amount which is separately held by these respective titles? 5.What is the condition of the inhabitants in general in regard to wealth? and what kind of property generally constitutes that wealth? 6.What is the situation and extent of the several settlements? and what is the prospect of each to become the most peopled? that is to say (allowing as a rule a family for each mile square) what proportion does the remaining population of each settlement bear to the remaining number of square miles she contains. 7.What is the condition of Agriculture? and what improvements, and to what extent, have been made on newly inhabited lands? 8.What is the probable amount in dollars of goods annually brought into Upper Louisiana? What proportion of them is intended for the consumption of her people, and what proportion for her Indian Trade? What proportion of all her entries arrives by way of Canada, New Orleans, or the United States? 9.What is the amount in dollars of the annual exports of Upper Louisiana? Of what articles do they consist in, and what proportion goes out by each of the routes, Canada, New Orleans, or the United States? 10.What are the names and nick-names of all the villages of Upper Louisiana? Where are they situated? When established, and the number of houses and people they contain at present? 11.What are your mines and minerals? Have you lead, iron, copper, pewter, gypsum, salts, salines, or other mineral waters, nitre, stone-coal, marble, lime-stone, or any other mineral substance? Where are they situated, and in what quantities found? 12.Which of those mines or salt springs are worked? and what quantity of metal or salt is annually produced? 13.What are the animals, birds and fish of Louisiana? and what their form, appearance, habits, dispositions, of those especially that are not abundant in the inhabited parts of the country? M. L. XL JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 1, vol. 10, doc. 1.] Washington, Jan. 13, 1804. Dear Sir: I wrote you last on the 16th. of Nov. since which I have recieved no letter from you. the newspapers inform us you left Kaskaskia about the 8th. of December. I hope you will have recieved my letter by that day, or very soon after; written in a belief it would be better that you should not enter the Missouri till the spring; yet not absolutly controuling your own judgment formed on the spot. we have not heard of the delivery of Louisiana to us as yet, tho' we have no doubt it took place about the 20th. of December, and that orders were at the same time expedited to evacuate the upper posts, troops of ours being in readiness &amp; under orders to take possession. the change will probably have taken place before you recieve this letter, and facilitate your proceeding. I now inclose you a map of the Missouri as far as the Mendans, 12 or 1500 miles I presume above it's mouth. it is said to be very accurate having been done by a mr Evans by order of the Spanish government, but whether he corrected by astronomical observation or not we are not informed. I hope this will reach you before your final departure. the acquisition of the country through which you are to pass has inspired the public generally with a great deal of interest in your enterprise. the enquiries are perpetual as to your progress. The Fed.[eralists] alone still treat it as philosophism and would rejoice in it's failure. their bitterness increases with the diminution of their numbers and despair of a resurrection. I hope you will take care of yourself, and be the living witness of their malice and folly. present my salutations to mr Clarke, assure all your party that we have our eyes turned on them with anxiety for their safety &amp; the success of their enterprise. accept yourself assurances of sincere esteem &amp; attachment. Th. Jefferson. Capt. Meriwether Lewis. XLI JEFFERSON TO LEWIS [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 1, vol.10, doc. 8.] Washington, Jan. 22, 1804. Dear Sir: My letters since your departure have been July 11 &amp; 15, Nov. 16, and Jan. 13, yours recieved are of July 8, 15, 22, 25, Sept. 25, 30, &amp; Oct. 3, since the date of the last we have no certain information of your movements, with mine of Nov. 16, I sent you some extracts made by myself from the journal of the agent of the trading company of St. Louis up the Missouri. I now inclose a translation of that journal in full for your information. in that of the 13t. inst. I inclosed you the map of a mr Evans, a Welshman, employed by the Spanish government for that purpose, but whose original object I believe had been to go in search of the Welsh Indians said to be up the Missouri. on this subject a mr Rees of the same nation established in the Western part of Pennsylvania, will write to you. N. Orleans was delivered to us on the 20th. of Dec. and our garrisons &amp; government established there. the order for the delivery of the Upper posts were to leave N. Orleans on the 28th. and we presume all those posts will be occupied by our troops by the last day of the present month. when your instructions were penned, this new position was not so authentically known as to effect the complection of your instructions. being now become sovereigns of the country, without however any diminution of the Indian rights of occupency we are authorised to propose to them in direct terms the institution of commerce with them. it will now be proper you should inform those through whose country you will pass, or whom you may meet, that their late fathers, the Spaniards have agreed to withdraw all their troops from all the waters &amp; country of the Missisipi and Missouri, that they have surrendered to us all their subjects Spanish and French settled there, and all their posts &amp; lands: that henceforward we become their fathers and friends, and that we shall endeavor that they shall have no cause to lament the change: that we have sent you to enquire into the nature of the country &amp; the nations inhabiting it, to know at what places and times we must establish stores of goods among them, to exchange for their peltries: that as soon as you return with the necessary information we shall prepare supplies of goods and persons to carry them and make the proper establishments: that in the meantime, the same traders who reside among or visit them, and who are now a part of us, will continue to supply them as usual: that we shall endeavor to become acquainted with them as soon as possible and that they will find in us faithful friends and protectors. although you will pass through no settlements of the Sioux (except seceders) yet you will probably meet with parties of them. on that nation we wish most particularly to make a friendly impression, because of their immense power, and because we learn they are very desirous of being on the most friendly terms with us. I inclose you a letter which I believe is from some one on the part of the Philosophical society. they have made you a member, and your diploma is lodged with me: but I suppose it safest to keep it here &amp; not to send it after you. mr Harvie departs tomorrow for France as the bearer of the Louisiana stock to Paris. Capt. William Trent takes his place with me. Congress will probably continue in session through the month of March. your friends here and in Albemarle as far as I recollect are well. Trist will be the Collector of N. Orleans, &amp; his family will go to him in the spring. Dr. Bache1 1 This was either Richard Bache, son-in-law of Benjamin Franklin, or one of his sons, possibly William Bache.—Ed. is now in Philadelphia &amp; probably will not return to N. Orleans.

In Possession of Mrs. John Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Camp at River Dubois Febr 18th 1804. My Dear Friend: Not anything of moment has occurred since you left us. My detention has been caused by a visitation on the 13th &amp; 14 inst. from a principal Chief of the Kickapoo nation, whom I have been anxious to see for some time past for several reasons, as also the arrival of the contractor with whom some little arrangements were necessary; being disappointed in geting down to the ball on the 14th and finding more to do when I began to look about me than I had previously thought of I determined it would be as well to go to work and postpone my visit to Cahokia &amp; St. Louis a few days. If Mr. Manuei [Lisa] will let us have the men you mention, pray engage them immediately, if you think from their appearance and characters they will answer the purpose. My complyments to Mr. C. Chouteau and inform him if you pleasce that nothing has given me more pleasure than the proposition he has made to you on the subject of the Osages—that as he wishes every circumstance in relation to this affair shall be kept a profount secret. I wish him not only to bring in some of those Chiefs (the number hereafter to be agreed on) but wish him to attend them to the seat of the Government of the U. States provided he can make it convenient to do so; I presume the Chiefs would come more readily provided Mr. Chouteau would make them a promise to that effect; I am as anxious as Mr. C. can be that he should set out on this mission as early as possible, and shall therefore be with you the day after tomorrow for the purpose of conscerting the necessary measures. My complyments to the Govr., Lassuse and Monsr.. Dabuke &amp; Mon rs- Gratiott and A. Chouteau—not foregetting my most profound respects to Meam Manuel. I am with the most sincere respect your friend M. Lewis Capt. etc. XLIII LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 106.] St. Louis, March 26th. 1804. Dear Sir: I send you herewith inclosed, some slips of the Osages Plum, and Apple. I fear the season is too far advanced for their success. had I earlyer learnt that these fruits were in the neighbourhood, they would have been forwarded at a more proper time. I would thank you to send a part of them to Messrs. John Mason, &amp; William Hamilton. should they not succeed, Mr. Charles Gratiot, a gentleman of this place, has promised me that he would with pleasure attend to the orders of yourself, or any of my acquaintancies, who may think proper to write him on the subject. Mr. Gratiot can obtain the young plants at the proper season, and send them very readily to Mr. Trist if requested to do so. I obtained the cuttings, now sent you, from the garden of Mr. Peter Choteau, who resided the greater portion of his time for many years with the Osage nation. it is from this gentleman, that I obtained the information I possess with respect to these fruits. The Osage's Plum appears to be a native of the country bo[r]dering on the vilages of that nation, situated on the Osage river, a south branch of the Missouri, about two hundred and sixty miles West from St. Louis. the shrub, which produces this fruit is remakably small, seldom rising to a greater hight than five feet; it is much branc[h]ed and the smaller boughs are armed with long thorn-like or pinated twigs; in their native state they grow very thickly together, and I think from their appearance. might with a little attention, be made to form an ornimental and usefull hedg. they produce their fruit every year, and generally in great abundance. the fruit is a large oval plum, of a pale yellow colour and exquisite flavor. with other fruits of this family it's matrix is comparitively small; it comes to maturity about the begining of July, and begins to ripen in succession on the same plant until the 20th. or last of that month. The Osage Apple is a native of the interior of the continent of North America, and is perhaps a nondiscript production, the information I have obtained with respect to it is not so minute as I could wish, nor such as will enable me to discribe it in a satisfactory manner. Mr. Peter Coteau, who first introduced this tree in the neighbourhood of St. Louis, about five years since, informed me, that he obtained the young plants at the great Osage vilage from an Indian of that nation, who said he procured them about three hundred miles west of that place. the general contour of this tree, is very much that of the black haw, common to most parts of the U States, with these diferences however, that the bark is of a lighter colour, less branced and arrives to a larger size, somtimes rising to the hight of thirty feet. it's smaller branches are armed with many single, long, &amp; sharp, pinated thorns. the particular form of the leaf or flower I have been unable to learn. so much do the savages esteem the wood of this tree, for the purpose of making their bows, that they travel many hundred miles in quest of it. The particulars with respect to the fruit, is taken principally from the Indian discription;—my informant never having seen but one specimen of it, which was not full ripe, and much shrivled and mutilated before he saw it. the Indians give an extravigant account of the exquisite odour of this fruit when it has obtained maturity, which takes place the latter end of summer, or the begining of Autumn. they state, that at this season they can always tell by the scent of the fruit when they arrive in the neighbourhod of the tree, and usually take advantage of this season to obtain the wood; as it appears not be a very abundant growth, even in the country where it is to be found an opinion prevails among the Osages, that the fruit is poisonous, tho' they acknowledge they have never tasted it. They say that many anamals feed on it, and among others, a large species of Hare,* * From the discription of this anamal, it is in point of colour, figure and habbits very much the same species with the European Hare, and is as large, if not larger than that anamal. this large hare of America, is found on the upper part of the Arkansas River, and in the country lying from thence South, and West, to the mountains which seperate us from New Mexico, it is said to be remarkably fleet, and hard to be overtaken on horseback even in their open plains.— which abounds in that country. This fruit is the size of the largest orange, of a globular form, and a fine orange colour. the pulp is contained in a number of conacal pustules, covered with a smooth membranous rind, having their smaller extremities attached to the matrix, from which they project in every direction, in such manner, as to form a compact figure. the form and consistancy of the matrix and germ, I have not been able to learn. the trees which are in the possession of Mr Choteau have as yet produced neither flowers nor fruit.— I have the honour to be with sincere esteem Your Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st. U. S. Regt. Infty. The President of the U' States. XLIV SERGEANT JOHN ORDWAY TO HIS PARENTS [Original MS. in possession of his grand-niece, Mrs. E. Ordway, whose transcript is here followed. Apparently the original has been closely adhered to.] Camp River Dubois April the 8th 1804 Honored Parents: I now embrace this oportunity of writing to you once more to let you know where I am and where I am going. I am well thank God and in high Spirits. I am now on an expedition to the westward, with Capt Lewis and Capt Clark, who are appointed by the President of the united States to go on an Expedition through the interior parts of North America, we are to ascend the Missouri River with a boat as far as it is navigable and then go by land to the western ocean, if nothing prevents. This party consists of 25 picked men of the armey and country likewise and I am so happy as to be one of them picked men from the armey and I and all the party are if we live to return to receive our discharge when ever we return again to the united States if we choose it. This place is on the Mississippi River opposite to the mouth of the Missouri River and we are to start in ten days up the Missouri River, this has been our winter quarters, we expect to be gone 18 months or two years, we are to receive a great reward for this expedition 15 dollars a month and at least 400 ackers of first rate land and if we make great discoveries as we expect the united States has promised to make us great rewards, more than we are promised, for fear of accidents I wish to inform you that [then follow personal matters].

XLV LEWIS TO CLARK [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] St. Louis May 2nd 1804 Dear Friend: I cannot hear of or find the hair pipes. The articles you sent by Sergt. Floyd wer duly received. The mail has not arrived. The Osages will set out about the 10th.. I return you the memorandum you inclosed me with remarks on several particulars therein contained. I send you 19 small flaggs, 16 musquetoe nets and our shirts—pray send down as soon as possible 13 Ells of the brown linin purchased of Morrison to replace that quantity borrowed of Mr. Gratiott, also the case with the maps, and the specimines of salt which you will find in my writing desk, on the shelves where our books are, or in the drawer of the instrument case. The pay of the men will commence from the dates of their last inlistments and will be made up to the last of November 1804 at the regular wages of soldiers &amp; Sergts. &amp;c—including the bounty of such as are intitled to it which is not the case with those whose former inlistments did not expire before the said 31st of November. Other receipt rolls will be made out for 5 dollars pr month as an advance on the score of Cloathing and provisions not furnished by the government —this to commence with those inlisted in Kentucky from the dates of their inlistments, all others from the 1st of January 1804. Mr. Choteau has procured seven engaged to go as far as the Mandanes—but they will not agree to go further, and I found it impossible to reduce them to any other engagement than that usually made with those people.

He married Lucy Clark, sister of William, and removing to Kentucky settled near Louisville on an estate known as "Locust Grove."—Ed. [From transcript furnished by Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, Oregon City, Oregon.] St. Charles, May 21, 1804. Dear Sir: By Captain Lewis who arrived from St. Louis today I had the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 2nd inst. and am happy to hear of the recovery of your family and my brother whom I was much concerned about. I am sorry to hear that the negroes of the estate of Wm. Thruston's hired so low, perhaps they may hire for more the next year. My friend Captain Lewis expressed some sorrow that you happened not to be at home at the time he passed down, but hopes to see you on his return to the United States. As to myself I have and shall always have that brotherly affection for you which you are well assured I always professed and hope in less than two years to see you and that family of yours whom I have every affection for, at your own home. My route is uncertain. I think it more than probable that Captain Lewis or myself will return by sea, the other by the same route we proceed. the time is uncertain, all the alterations which I did not inform you of have been made since I saw you and the law authorizing the president to explore the country &amp;c. has just come to my knowledge. I have been at this place five days waiting for Captain Lewis who has been detained at St. Louis to fix off the Osage chiefs. he has just arrived and we shall leave this village immediately and proceed on our journey. We have had a great deal of rain, thunder and lightning, with wind for several days, past which discommodes us a little in setting out. The politeness of the gentlemen of the place and about 12 or 15 who came from St. Louis to see us set out and are constantly with us prevents me giving you at this time a description of the country, river or the occurrences which have or may happen. Captain Lewis joins me in this most sincere wish for your, my sister and the families health and happiness for many years. With every sentiment, Your sincere friend, Wm. Clark. XLVIII INDIAN SPEECHES AND DATA [From original MSS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis. Loose sheets in Clark's handwriting, interesting as notes evidently taken during the progress of councils, and afterwards expanded in the text of the journals.] (Ricary) October the 11th Thursday 1804 we met in Council to hear what the Grand Chief Kakawissassa had to say in answer to the speech of yesterday.1 1 See our vol. i, pp. 185, 186, where the name of this chief and the substance of his speech are given. Clark evidently wrote out the words as reported to him by the interpreter.—Ed. The Grand Chief rose and spoke as follows i, e. My Fathers! My heart is glader than it ever was before to see my fathers, a repetition. If you want the road open no one can provent it It will always be open for you. Can you think any one Dare put their hands on your rope of your boat.2 2 Referring no doubt to the previous attempts of the Teton Sioux to stop the expedition. See our vol. i, pp. 165, 171.—Ed. No ! not one dar When you get to the Mandans we wish you to speak good words with that nation for us. We wish to be at peace with them. It gives us pain that we do not know how to work the Beaver. We will make Buffalow roabs the best we can. When you return if I am living you will see me again the same man. The Indian in the prarie know me and listen to my words, when you [come] they will meet to see you. We shall look at the river with impatience for your return. Finishd 2nd. Chief Ricarey3 3 The following speech was addressed to the explorers on Oct. 12, 1804. Clark gives the substance of it in his diary for that day; see our vol. i, p. 187.—Ed. My Father, I am glad to see this is a fine Day to here [hear] the good Councils &amp; talk good talk. I am glad to See you &amp; that your intentions are to open the road for all We See that our Grand [great] father has sent you to open the roads we See it Our Grand father by sending you means to take pity on us Our Grand father has sent you with tobacco to make peace with all nations, we think [we are] The first nation who has recommended the road to be clear and open.

(Finished) 3d. Chief of Ricares.2 2 For an account of the delivery of this speech, see vol. i, pp. 187, 188.—Ed. My father—I will see the Indians below &amp; see if they have the hart as they tell you. The nation below is the Mandan Maha &amp; Otteau but one nation, the Souix has not a good heart I always look at the 1t Chief &amp; the 2d where they go I will also follow ther example &amp; go on also.

I will Stay at home &amp; not go to War even if my people are struck We will believ your word but I fear the Indians above will not believe your word.

The original came into the possession of Roderic McKenzie, of Assiniboin; he sent a copy to Jason Chamberlain, of the University of Vermont, who in February, 1812, forwarded it to the editor of the Philadelphia Portfolio, in which it was published in May following—vol. vii, no. 5, pp. 448, 449. Obviously, the document as published has been editorially "improved "over the original.] Upper Mandane Village, Oct. 31, 1804. To Charles Chaboiller, Esq. of the N. W. Co. Sir: On our arrival at this Mandane Village, the 26th instant, we met with Mr. Hugh M'Crachen, who informed us that he was in some measure employed by you in behalf of the North West Company, to traffic with the natives of this quarter; the return of the man to your parts affords us the means of making, thus early, the present communication; the contents of which we would thank you to make known, as early as possible, to those engaged, and traders immediately under your direction, as also, if convenient, to the principal representatives of any other company of his Britannic Majesty's subjects, who may reside or trade in this quarter. We have been commissioned and sent by the government of the United States for the purpose of exploring the river Missouri, and the western parts of the continent of North America, with a view to the promotion of general science. Your government have been advised of the voyage and its objects, as the enclosed copy of a passport, granted by Mr. Edward Thornton, his Britannic Majesty's charge d'affaires to the United States, will evidence. The cold season having now nearly arrived, we have determined to fortify ourselves, and remain the ensuing winter, in the neighbourhood of this place. During our residence here, or future progress on our voyage, we calculate that the injunctions contained in the passport before mentioned will, with respect to ourselves, govern the conduct of such of his Brintannic Majesty's subjects as may be within communicative reach of us. As individuals, we feel every disposition to cultivate the friendship of all well-disposed persons; and all that we have at this moment to ask of them, is a mutual exchange of good offices. We shall, at all times, extend our protection as well to British subjects as American citizens, who may visit the Indians of our neighbourhood, provided they are well-disposed; this we are disposed to do, as well from the pleasure we feel in becoming serviceable to good men, as from a conviction that it is consonant with the liberal policy of our government, not only to admit within her territory the free egress and regress of all citizens and subjects of foreign powers with which she is in amity, but also to extend to them her protection, while within the limits of her jurisdiction. If, sir, in the course of the winter, you have it in your power to furnish us with any hints in relation to the geography of the country, its productions, either mineral, animal, or vegetable, or any other information which you might conceive of utility to mankind, or which might be serviceable to us in the prosecution of our voyage, we should feel ourselves extremely obliged by your furnishing us with it. We are, with much respect, Your ob't. serv'ts. Meriwether Lewis, Capt. 1st U. S. R [.egt.] Inf. William Clark, Capt. [2d. Lt. U. S. Artillerists] L LEWIS TO HIS MOTHER [Original MS. is in possession of the oldest living representative of Meriwether Lewis's family, C. Harper Anderson, of Ivy Depot, Virginia. The following is from his transcript thereof, which has evidently been modernized in several particulars.] Fort Mandan, 1609 miles above the entrance of the Missouri— March 31st., 1805. Dear Mother:—I arrived at this place on the 27th. of Oct. last, with party under my command destined to the Pacific Ocean, by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers. The near approach of winter, the low state of the water and the known scarcity of timber which exists on the Missouri for many hundred miles above the Mandans, together with many other considerations equally important, determined my friend and companion Capt. Clark and myself to fortify ourselves and remain for the winter in the neighborhood of the Mandans, Minetares and Ahwaharways, who are the most friendly and well disposed savages that we have yet met with. Accordingly we sought and found a convenient situation for our purposes a few miles below the villages of these people on the north side of the river in an extensive and well timbered bottom, where we commenced the erection of our houses on the 2d. of Nov. and completed them so far as to put ourselves under shelter on the 21st. of the same month, by which time the season wore the aspect of winter. Having completed our fortify [cation] early in Dec. we called it Fort Mandan, in honor of our friendly neighbors. So far we have experienced more difficulties from the navigation of the Missouri than danger from the savages. The difficulties which oppose themselves to the navigation of this immense river arise from the rapidity of its currents, its falling banks, sand bars and timber which remains wholly or partially concealed in its bed, usually called by the navigators of the Missouri, and the Mississippi "sawyer "or "planter," one of these difficulties the navigator never ceases to contend with from the entrance of the Missouri to this place; and in innumerable instances most of these obstructions are at the same instant combined to oppose his progress or threaten his destruction. To these we may also add a fifth, and not much less inconsiderable difficulty—the turbed quality of the water—which renders it impracticable to discover any obstruction, even to the depth of a single inch. Such is the velocity of the current at all seasons of the year, from the entrance of the Missouri to the mouth of the great river Platte, that it is impossible to resist its force by means of oars or poles in the main channel of the river; the eddies which therefore generally exist on one side or the other of the river, are sought by the navigators, but these are almost universally encumbered with concealed timber, or within reach of the falling banks, but notwithstanding, are usually preferable to that of passing along the edges of the sand bars, over which the water, tho' shallow, runs with such violence that if your vessel happens to touch the sand, or is by any accident turned sidewise to the current, it is driven on the bar and overset in an instant, generally destroyed, and always attented with the loss of the cargo. The base of the river banks being composed of a fine light sand, is easily removed by the water. It happens when this capricious and violent currents set against its banks, which are usually covered with heavy timber, it quickly undermines them, sometimes to the depth of 40 or 50 paces, and several miles in length. The banks being unable to support themselves longer tumble into the river with tremendous force, destroying everything within their reach. The timber thus precipitated into the water with large masses of earth about their roots are seen drifting with the stream, their points above the water, while the roots, more heavy, are dragged along the bottom until they become firmly fixed in the quick sand, which forms the bed of the river, where they remain for many years, forming an irregular tho' dangerous chevaux-de-frise to oppose the navigator. This immense river, so far as we have yet ascended, waters one of the fairest portions of the globe, nor do I believe there is in the universe a similar extent of country equally fertile, well watered, and intersected by such a number of navigable streams. The country as high up the river as the mouth of the river Platte, a distance of 630 miles, is generally well timbered. At some little distance above this river the open or prairie country commences. With respect to this open country, I have been agreeably disappointed. From previous information I had been led to believe that it was barren, sterile and sandy; but, on the contrary, I found it fertile in the extreme, the soil being from one to twenty feet in depth, consisting of a fine black loam, intermixed with a sufficient quantity of sand only to induce a luxuriant growth of grass and other vegetable productions, particularly such as are not liable to be much injured, or wholly destroyed by the ravages of the fire. It is also generally level, yet well watered, in short, there can exist no other objection to it, except that of the want of timber, which is truly a very serious one. This want of timber is by no means attributable to a deficiency in the soil to produce it, but owes its origin to the ravages of the fires, which the natives kindle in these plains at all seasons of the year. The country on both sides of the river, except some of its bottom lands, for an immense distance is one continued open plain, in which no timber is to be seen except a few detatched and scattered copse, and clumps of trees, which, from their moist situation, or the steep declivities of hills, are sheltered from the effects of fire. The general aspect of the country is level so far as the perception of the spectator will enable him to determine, but from the rapidity of the Missouri, it must be considerably elevated, as it passes to the N. West; it is broken only on the borders of the water courses. Game is very abundant, and seems to increase as we progress—our prospect of starving is therefore consequently small. On the lower portion of the Missouri, from its junction with the Mississippi to the entrance of the Osage river we met with some deer, bear and turkeys. From thence to the Kancez river the deer were more abundant. A great number of black bear, some turkeys, geese, swan and ducks. From thence to the mouth of the great river Platte an immense quantity of deer, some bear, elk, turkeys, geese, swan and ducks. From thence to the river S[ioux] some bear, a great number of elks, the bear disappeared almost entirely, some turkeys, geese, swan and ducks. From thence to the mouth of the White river vast herds of buffalo, elk and some deer, and a greater quantity of turkeys than we had before seen, a circumstance which I did not much expect in a country so destitute of timber. Hence to Fort Mandan the buffalo, elk and deer increase in quantity, with the addition of the cabie [cabra], as they are generally called by the French engages, which is a creature about the size of a small deer. Its flesh is deliciously flavored. The ice in the Missouri has now nearly disappeared. I shall set out on my voyage in the course of a few days. I can foresee no material obstruction to our progress and feel the most perfect confidence that we shall reach the Pacific ocean this summer. For myself, individually, I enjoy better health than I have since I commenced my voyage. The party are now in fine health and excellent spirits, are attached to the enterprise and anxious to proceed. Not a whisper of discontent or murmur is to be heard among them. With such men I feel every confidence necessary to insure success. The party, with Capt. Clark and myself, consists of thirty-one white persons, one negro man, and two Indians. The Indians in this neighborhood [assert] that the Missouri is navigable nearly to its source, and that from a navigable part of the river, at a distance not exceeding a half a days march, there is a large river running from south to north along the western base of the Rocky Mountains, but as their war excursions have not extended far beyond this point, they can give no account of the discharge or source of this river. We believe this stream to be the principal South Fork of the Columbia river, and if so, we shall probably find but little difficulty in passing to the ocean. We have subsisted this winter on meat principally, with which our guns have furnished us an ample supply, and have, by that means, reserved a sufficient stock of the provisions we brought with us from the Illinois to guard us against accidental want during the voyage of the present year. You may expect me in Albemarle about the last of next Sept.—twelve months. I request that you will give yourself no uneasiness with respect to my fate, for I assure you that I feel myself perfectly as safe as I should do in Albemarle, and the only difference between three or four thousand miles and 130 is that I can not have the pleasure of seeing you as often as I did while at Washington. I must request of you before I conclude this letter, to send John Marks1 1 Lewis's young step-brother.—Ed. to the college of Williamsburgh as soon as it shall be thought that his education has been sufficiently advanced to fit him for that seminary; for you may rest assured that as you regard his future prosperity you had better make any sacrifice of his property than suffer his education to remain neglected or incomplete. Give my love to my brothers and sisters and all my neighbors and friends, and rest assured yourself of the most devoted filial affection of yours, Meriwether Lewis. LI CLARK TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Fort Mandan, April 1st 1805 Sir—It being the wish of Capt. Lewis I take the liberty to send you for your own perusal the notes which I have taken in the form of a journal in their original state. You will readily perceive in reading over those notes that many parts are incorrect, owing to the variety information received at different times. I most sincerely wish that leasure had permited me to offer them in a more correct form. Receive I pray you my unfained acknowledgments for your friendly recollection of me in your letters to my friend and companion Capt. Lewis, and be assured of the sincere regard with which I have the honor to be your most Obt &amp; Humble Servt. [Endorsed:] Copy to the President. LII CLARK TO WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON [From the Baltimore Telegraphe and Daily Advertiser, July 25, 1805.]1 1 Communicated to the paper in a letter from Vincennes, Indiana Territory, under date of June 19. Obviously, either the correspondent or the editor of the paper has somewhat improved both the orthography and diction of the original.—Ed. Fort Mandan, 1609 miles up the Missouri, lat, 47 21 47, N. long. 101 25, W. April 2d, 1805. Dear Sir, By the return of a party which we send from this place with dispatches, I do myself the pleasure of giving you a summary view of the Missouri, &amp;c. In ascending as high as the Kanzas river, which is 334 miles up the Missouri on the S.W. side, we met a strong current, which runs from five to seven miles an hour, the bottoms extensive, and covered with timber; the high country is interspersed with rich handsome prairies; well watered, and abounds in dear and bear. In ascending as high as the river Plate, we met a current less rapid, not exceeding 6 miles an hour; in this distance we pass several small rivers on each side which water some fine diversified country principally prairie as between the Vincennes and Illinois, the bottomed continued wide, and covered with timber, this river is about 600 yards wide, at the mouth, not navigable, it heads the rocky mountains, with the North River, and Yellow Stone River, and passes through an open country; 15 leagues up this river the Ottoes, and thirty Missouries lives in one village, and can raise 200 men, 15 leagues h[i]gher up the Paneas and Penea republicans live in one village, and can raise 700 men; up the Wolf Fork of this river, the Pania Lousis live in one village, and can raise 280 men. The Indians have partial rupture frequently. River Plate is 630 miles up the Missouri, on the south west side: Here we find the antelope or goat. The next river of size ascending, is the Stone river, commonly called by the Indians, Little River Desioux: it takes its rise in lake Despice, 15 miles from the river Demoir, and is 64 yards wide. Here commences the Sioux country. The next river of note is the Big Sioux river, which heads with St. Peters and waters of lake Winnepic, in some high wooded country. About 90 miles higher up, the river Jaque falls on the same side, and about one hundred yards wide. This river heads with the waters of lake Winnepic, at no great distance east from this place. The head of the River Demon is in Pilican lake, between the Sioux rivers and the St. Peters. The country on both sides of the Missouri, from the river Plate to that place, has very much the same appearance: extensive fertile plains, with but very little timber, and that little principally confined to the river bottoms and streams. The country east of this place, and off from the Missouri as low as Stone river, contains a number of small lakes, many of which are said to be so much impregnated with glauber salts, as to produce all its effects; certain it is, that the water in the small streams from the hills below, on the south west side, possesses this quality. About the river Jacque, Bruffala county contains great quantities of mineral, cobalt, cinnebar, alum, copperas, and several other things; the stone coal which is on the Missouri is very indifferent. Ascending 52 miles above the Jacque, the river Quicum falls in on the south west side. This river is, 1026 miles up, 150 yards wide, not navigable; it heads in the black mountains, which run nearly parallel to the Missouri, from about the head of the Kanzas river, and end S. W. of this place. Quicum waters a broken country, 122 miles by water higher. White river falls in on the south west side, and is 300 yards wide, and navigable, as all the other streams are, which are not particularly mentioned. This river heads in some small lakes short of the black mountains. The Mahan and Poncan nations rove on the heads of this river and the Quicum and Can raise 250 men, they were very numerous a few years ago, but the small-pox and the Sioux have reduced them to their present state —the Sioux possess the south west of the Missouri, above White river; 132 miles higher, and on the west side.—Teton river falls into it, it is small, and heads in the open plains; here we met a large band of Sioux. and the second which we had seen called Tetons, those are great rascals, and may be justly termed the pirates of the Missouri; they made two attemps to stop us; they are subdivided and stretched on the river to near this place, having reduced the Ruaras and Mandans, and drove them from the country they now occupy, the Sioux bands rove in the country to the Mississippi. About 47 miles above the Teton river, the Chyenne river falls in from the south west, 400 yards wide, and navigable to the Black mountains, in which it takes its rise, in the 3d range. Several bands of Indians but little known, rove on the heads of this and the river Plate, and are stated to be as follows; Chayenne, 300 men, Staetan 100 men; Canenaviech, 400 men; Cavanwa and Wetabato, 200 men; Catoha, 70 men; Detain, 30 men: Memetoon, 50 men; Castah na, 1300 men; it is probable that some of these bands are the remains of the Paducar nation; at 1440 miles up the Missouri, (and a short distance above two handsome rivers which take their rise in the Black mountains) the Rickaras live in three villages, and are the remains of ten different tribes of Paneas, who have been reduced and drove from their country lower down, by the Sioux, their number is about 500 men, they raise corn, beans, &amp;c. and appear friendly and well disposed, they were at war with the nations of this neighborhood, we have brought about a peace between the Recars and this place, two rivers fall in on the south west, and one on the north east, not very long, and take their rise in the open country; this country abounds in a great variety of wild animals but a few of which the Indians take, many of those animals are uncommon in the U. States, such as white, red and grey bears, long ear'd male or black tailed deer, (black at the end of the tail only) large hare, antelope or goat, the red fox, the ground praire dog, (burrows in the ground) the braroca, which has a head like a dog, and the size of a small dog, the white brant, magpye, calumet eagle, &amp;c and many other are said to inhabit the rocky mountains. I have collected the following account of the rivers and country in advance of this, to wit: at two days march in advance of this the Little Missouri, falls in on the side and heads in at the north extremity of the Black mountains; six days further a large river joins the Missouri, affording as much water as the main river, this river is rapid, without a fall, and navagable to the Rocky mountains; its branches head with the waters of the river Plate; the country in advance is said to be broken. The trade of the nations at this place is from the N. W. and Hudsons bay establishments on the Assinneboin river, distant about 150 miles; those traders are nearly at open war with each other, and better calculated to destroy then promote the happiness of those nations to whom they have latterly extended their trade, and intend to form an establishment near this place in the course of this year.

Long. 101° 25′ W April the 2nd 1805. Dear Major: By the return of a party of Soldiars and french men who accompanied us to this place for the purpose of assisting in transporting provisions &amp;c. I have the pleasure of Sending you this hasty scrawl which will do little more than inform you where I am. My time being entirely taken up in preparing information for our government and attending to those duties which is absolutely necessary for the promotion of our enterprise and attending to Indians deprives me the Satisfaction of giveing you a Satisfactory detail of this Countrey. I must therefore take the liberty of refuring you to my brother to whome I have inclosed a Map and Some sketches relative to the Indians. Our party has enjoyed a great Share of health and are in high Spirits. We shall leave this place in two days on our journey Country and River above this is but little Known our information is altogether from Indians collected at different times and entitled to some credit. My return will not be So Soon as I expected, I fear not sooner than about June or July 1806 every exertion will be made to accomplish this enterprise in a Shorter period, please to present me most respectfully to my Sister Lucy &amp; the family and accept the assurance of my sincere affections &amp;c Wm. Clark I send my sister Croghan Some Seed of Several Kinds of Grapes. LIV LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Bureau of Rolls—Jefferson Papers, series 2, vol. 51, doc. 107. First printed, in revised form, in connection with Jefferson's message to Congress, Feb. 19, 1806; and later, in other places. It is generally misdated "April 17th" instead of 7th.] Fort Mandan, April 7th. 1805. Dear Sir: Herewith inclosed you will receive an invoice of certain articles, which I have forwarded to you from this place. among other articles, you will observe by reference to the invoice, 67. specimens of earths, salts and minerals; and 60 specimens of plants: these are accompanyed by their rispective labels expressing the days on which obtained, places where found, and also their virtues and properties when known. by means of these labels, reference may be made to the Chart of the Missouri forwarded to the Secretary at War, on which, the encampment of each day has been carefully marked; thus the places at which these specimens have been obtained may be easily pointed out, or again found, should any of them prove valuable to the community on further investegation. (these have been forwarded with a view of their being presented to the Philosophical society of Philadelphia, in order that they may under their direction be examined or analyzed. after examining these specimens yourself, I would thank you to have a copy of their labels made out, and retained untill my return. the other articles are intended particularly for yourself, to be retained, or disposed off as you may think proper.) You will also receive herewith inclosed a part of Capt. Clark's private journal, the other part you will find inclosed in a separate tin box. this journal (is in it's original state, and of course incorrect, but it) will serve to give you the daily detales of our progress, and transactions. (Capt. Clark dose not wish this journal exposed in it's present state, but has no objection, that one or more copies of it be made by some confidential person under your direction, correcting it's gramatical errors &amp;c. indeed it is the wish of both of us, that two of those copies should be made, if convenient, and retained untill our return; in this state there is no objection to your submitting them to the perusal of the heads of the departments, or such others as you may think proper. a copy of this journal will assist me in compiling my own for publication after my return.) I shall dispatch a canoe with three, perhaps four persons, from the extreem navigable point of the Missouri, or the portage betwen this river, and the Columbia river, as either may first happen; by the return of this canoe, I shal send you my journal, and some one or two of the best of those kept by my men. I have sent a journal kept by one of the Sergeants,1 1 Doubtless Floyd's Journal, pp. 3–26 in the present volume.—Ed. to Capt Stoddard, my agent at St. Louis, in order as much as possible to multiply the chances of saving something. we have encouraged our men to keep journals, and seven of them do so, to whom in this respect we give every assistance in our power. I have transmitted to the Secretary at War, every information relative to the geography of the country which we possess, together with a view of the Indian nations, containing information relative to them, on those points with which, I conceived it important that the government should be informed. (If it could be done with propriety and convenience, I should feel myself much obliged by your having a copy taken of my dispatches to the Secretary at War, on those subjects, retaining them for me untill my return.) By reference to the Muster-rolls forwarded to the War Department, you will see the state of the party; in addition to which, we have two Interpreters, one negroe man, servant to Capt. Clark, one Indian woman, wife to one of the interpreters, and a Mandan man, whom we take with a view to restore peace between the Snake Indians, and those in this neighborhood amounting in total with ourselves to 33 persons. by means of the Interpreters and Indians, we shall be enabled to converse with all the Indians that we shall probably meet with on the Missouri. I have forwarded to the Secretary at War, my public Accounts rendered up to the present day. they have been much longer delayed than I had any idea that they would have been, when we departed from the Illinois, but this delay, under the circumstances which I was compelled to act, has been unavoidable.2 2 No record has been found showing the items of the account rendered to the Secretary of War, referred to by Captain Lewis in his letter to President Jefferson dated at Fort Mandan, April 7, 1805.—F. C. Ainsworth, chief of Record and Pension Office, War Department. The provision peraque and her crew, could not have been dismissed in time to have returned to St. Louis last fall without evedently in my opinion, hazarding the fate of the enterprise in which I am engaged, and I therefore did not hesitate to prefer the sensure that I may have incurred by the detention of these papers, to that of risking in any degree the success of the expedition. to me, the detention of those papers have formed a serious source of disquiet and anxiety; and the recollection of your particular charge to me on this subject, has made it still more poignant. I am fully aware of the inconvenience which must have arrisen to the War Department, from the want of these vouchers previous to the last session of Congress, but how to divert1 1 This was amended in Jefferson's handwriting, "avert."—Ed. it was out of my power to devise.— From this plase we shall send the barge and crew early tomorrow morning with orders to proceed as expeditiously as possible to St. Louis, by her we send our dispatches, which I trust will get safe to hand. Her crew consists of ten ablebodied men well armed and provided with a sufficient stock of provision to last them to St. Louis. I have but little doubt but they will be fired on by the Siouxs; but they have pledged themselves to us that they will not yeald while there is a man of them living. Our baggage is all embarked on board six small canoes and two perogues; we shall set out at the same moment that we dispatch the barge. one or perhaps both of these perogues we shall leave at the falls of the Missouri, from whence we intend continuing our voyage in the canoes and a perogue of skins, the frame of which was prepared at Harper's ferry. this perogue is now in a situation which will enable us to prepare it in the course of a few hours. as our vessels are now small and the current of the river much more moderate, we calculate on traveling at the rate of 20 or 25 miles pr. day as far as the falls of the Missouri. beyond this point, or the first range of rocky Mountains situated about 100 miles further, any calculation with rispect to our daily progress, can be little more than bare conjecture. the circumstance of the Snake Indians possessing large quantities of horses, is much in our favour, as by means of horses, the transportation of our baggage will be rendered easy and expeditious over land, from the Missouri, to the Columbia river. should this river not prove navigable where we first meet with it, our present intention is, to continue our march by land down the river untill it becomes so, or to the Pacific Ocean. The map, which has been forwarded to the Secretary at War, will give you the idea we entertain of the connection of these rivers, which has been formed from the corresponding testimony of a number of Indians who have visited that country, and who have been seperately and carefully examined on that subject, and we therefore think it entitled to some degree of confidence. Since our arrival at this place we have subsisted principally on meat, with which our guns have supplyed us amply, and have thus been enabled to reserve the parched meal, portable Soup, and a considerable proportion of pork and flour, which we had intended for the more difficult parts of our voyage. if Indian information can be credited, the vast quantity of game with which the country abounds through which we are to pass leaves us but little to apprehend from the want of food. We do not calculate on completeing our voyage within the present year, but expect to reach the Pacific Ocean, and return, as far as the head of the Missouri, or perhaps to this place before winter. you may therefore expect me to meet you at Montochello in September 1806. On our return we shal probably pass down the yellow stone river, which from Indian informations, waters one of the fairest portions of this continent. I can foresee no material or probable obstruction to our progress, and entertain therefore the most sanguine hopes of complete success. As to myself individually I never enjoyed a more perfect state of good health, than I have since we commenced our voyage. my inestimable friend and companion Capt. Clark has also enjoyed good health generally. At this moment, every individual of the party are in good health, and excellent sperits; zealously attatched to the enterprise, and anxious to proceed; not a whisper of discontent or murmur is to be heard among them; but all in unison, act with the most perfect harmoney. with such men I have every thing to hope, and but little to fear. Be so good as to present my most affectionate regard to all my friends, and be assured of the sincere and unalterable attatchment of Your most Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis Capt. 1st. U' S. Regt.

LVI A NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT [From the Boston Centinel, July 13, 1805.] LOUISIANA Lexington, June 18, 1805. The party of discovery, under the command of Capt. Lewis and Clark, left the mouth of the Missouri on the 19th day of May, 1804. An express with dispatches from their winter quarters, which left them the 14th April, has returned to St. Louis. By the express, letters were received from Captain Clark to his correspondents in Kentucky. A gentleman from Jefferson county, has obligingly favored the Editor of the Kentucky Gazette with the following account, which he obtained from one of the men who returned with the express, and from letters from some of the party. They fortified themselves in November last, on the bank of the Missouri, 1609 miles from the mouth, by actual measurement, in latitude 47, 21, N; called then Fort Mandane, after a nation of Indians, who reside in the neighborhood, and who have been very friendly to them.—On their passage up, they were delighted with the beautiful appearance of the country for about 200 leagues, or to the mouth of the river La Plata, which comes in from the South; after which, to their winter quarters, it is described not to be so fertile. The person who brought the dispatches, speaks of the opening made by the river, being about one mile wide with high cliffs on each side.— The bed of the river occupies about a fourth part of it, the remainder of the bottom entirely composed of coarse sand, covered with cotton wood. This bottom is continually giving way either on one side or the other, and gaining on the opposite side.—The cliffs in some places are covered with red cedar, which, with the cotton and a few small black ash trees, is the only timber described to be in that country. From the height, there is not a tree or twig to be seen, as far as the sight can extend, or as they have explored. Out from the river the land goes off perfectly level, with but few exceptions—and their plains covered with grass. They passed the mouths of a number of streams, the most of which had names given by the French. One they have named Floyd's river, to perpetuate the name of a young man of their party, named Charles Floyd, who died much regretted on the 20th August. They represent the Indians to have been friendly, with but a few exceptions. The Soux are the most numerous, are organized in bands bearing different names, move about from place to place, from the banks of the river out to the plains, in pursuit of game and plunder having no fixed place of residence and in a continual state of warfare. These were the most troublesome Indians to the party of discovery, as they expressed a jealousy, least they would supply their enemies higher up with arms &amp;c.—The higher up they went, the more friendly they found the savages, and the better armed.—They have a more regular trade with the North West Company, and the Hudson bay company; which supplies come to them by the way of Lake Winnepeck. The Mandanes cultivate corn, which is of a small kind, from whom the party was supplied during the winter, and their hunters kept them in abundance of meat. Buffaloes are said to be in great numbers, and of a large size—two description of deer are described; those resembling the common kind of this country being larger, and the tails 18 inches long, and the hair much longer on their bodies; the other kind having a black tail. Elks and goats are numerous. The grouse, or praire hen are in plenty; and before the closing of the river in the fall, water fowls in abundance. Fish scarce, and those principally of the cat kind. Some of the white bear-skins, had been brought to the fort by visiting Indians from higher up; but the party had seen none of those animals. The Indians keep horses, which are used entirely for the chase, and in war. From such information as they have received of the country above there, it is about 600 miles to the great falls, which are made by a ledge of mountains, called Rocky Mountain, in which it is presumed the Missouri terminates. At their winter quarters the river is nearly a mile wide; is equally as muddy as at its mouth, and has continued its rapidity with very little alteration, as high as they have gone, though it has became considerably more shallow, so that they will not be able to take their large barge any higher. From what information they have obtained of the course of the upper part of the river, the most are at the northwardly part.—From where they wintered to the falls, is nearly a south course. The description given by McKenzie of the head waters of the river, is accurate. They have sent on to the President of the United States an accurate journal, with a map of the country through which they passed. Six of party were sent back—she party now consists of 28 men, exclusive of the two officers. They have enjoyed perfect health—not one having been sick, except the unfortunate young man before mentioned, and he was taken off in a few hours by the cramp in his stomach. The greatest friendship has existed with the party; and the men who have returned, speak in the highest terms of the humanity, and uncommon pains and attention of both Captains, Lewis and Clark, toward the whole of them; and that they left them in good spirits, fully convinced that they would winter on the Pacific Ocean. They were told of six nations of Indians they would have to pass, before they would arrive at the falls from only one of which they apprehended any difficulty—they are called the Snake tribe; and reside high up. Curiosities of different kinds, live beasts, birds, several boxes of minerals, a pair of uncommon ram's horns, from the rocky mountains, scions of a new discovered berry, called the buffaloe berry, &amp;c. have been brought on by the returned party, and deposited with the commanding officer at St. Louis, to be sent by him to the President. We expect in a few days further particulars relative to this interesting voyage. LVII JEFFERSON TO CONSTANTIN FRANÇOIS DE CHASSEBŒUF COMTE DE VOLNEY1 1 Count Volney was an illustrious French savant and writer, who visited the United States in 1797 and 1798, and was expelled from the country under the alien and sedition laws. His book on the climate and soil of the United States was published in 1803.—Ed. [Extract—Ford, viii, p. 419.] [Feb. 11, 1806] Our last news of Captn Lewis was that he had reached the upper part of the Missouri, &amp; had taken horses to cross the Highlands to the Columbia river.2 2 Nowhere in the journals are there any indications of messages having been sent to Washington from the expedition, between leaving the Mandans in the spring of 1805 and the arrival at St. Louis in September, 1806; nor was it practicable to send such messages. Moreover, in doc. lviii, below, Jefferson practically states, on February 19, that he had heard nothing from Lewis since April 8, 1805.—Ed. He passed the last winter among the Mandans 1610 miles above the mouth of the river. So far he had delineated it with as great accuracy as will probably be ever applied to it, as his courses &amp; distances by mensuration were corrected by almost daily observations of latitude and longitude. With his map he sent us specimens or information of the following animals not before known to the northern continent of America. 1. The horns of what is perhaps a species of Ovis Ammon. 2. A new variety of the deer having a black tail. 3. An antelope. 4. The badger, not before known out of Europe. 5. A new species of marmotte. 6. A white weasel. 7. The magpie. 8. The Prairie hen, said to resemble the Guinea hen (peintade). 9. A prickly lizard. To these are added a considerable collection of minerals, not yet analyzed. He wintered in Lat. 47° 20′ and found the maximum of cold 43° below the zero of Fahrenheit. We expect he has reached the Pacific, and is now wintering on the head of the Missouri, and will be here next autumn. LVIII PART OF PRESIDENT JEFFERSON'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, 1806 [From Richardson's Messages and Papers of the Presidents, i, p. 398.] Feb. 19, 1806. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: In pursuance of a measure proposed to Congress by a message of January 18, 1803, and sanctioned by their approbation for carrying it into execution. Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the First Regiment of infantry, was appointed, with a party of men, to explore the river Missouri from its mouth to its source, and, crossing the highlands by the shortest portage, to seek the best water communication thence to the Pacific Ocean; and Lieutenant Clarke was appointed second in command. They were to enter into conference with the Indian nations on their route with a view to the establishment of commerce with them. They entered the Missouri May 14, 1804, and on the 1st of November took up their winter quarters near the Mandan towns, 1,609 miles above the mouth of the river, in latitude 47° 21′ 47″ north and longitude 99° 24′ 45″ west from Greenwich. On the 8th of April, 1805, they proceeded up the river in pursuance of the objects prescribed to them. A letter of the preceding day, April 7th, from Captain Lewis is herewith communicated. During his stay among the Mandans he had been able to lay down the Missouri according to courses and distances taken on his passage up it, corrected by frequent observations of longitude and latitude, and to add to the actual survey of this portion of the river a general map of the country between the Mississippi and Pacific from the thirty-fourth to the fifty-fourth degree of latitude. These additions are from information collected from Indians with whom he had opportunities of communicating during his journey and residence with them. Copies of this map are now presented to both Houses of Congress. With these I communicate also a statistical view, procured and forwarded by him, of the Indian nations inhabiting the Territory of Louisiana and the countries adjacent to its northern and western borders, of their commerce, and of other interesting circumstances respecting them. LIX CLARK TO CHARBONNEAU [From original MS., probably the draft retained by Clark, in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] On Board the Perogue Near the Ricara Village August 20th 1806. Charbono Sir: Your present Situation with the Indians givs me Some concern— I wish now I had advised you to come on with me to the Illinois where it most probably would be in my power to put you in Some way to do Something for your Self—I was so engaged after the Big White had concluded to go down with Jessomme as his Interpreter, that I had not time to talk with you as much as I intended to have done. You have been a long time with me and have conducted your Self in Such a manner as to gain my friendship, your woman who accompanied you that long dangerous and fatigueing rout to the Pacific Ocean and back, diserved a greater reward for her attention and Services on that rout than we had in our power to give her at the Mandans. As to your little Son (my boy Pomp) you well know my fondness for him and my anxiety to take and raise him as my own child. I once more tell you if you will bring your son Baptiest to me I will educate him and treat him as my own child—I do not forget the promis which I made to you and Shall now repeet them that you may be certain—Charbono, if you wish to live with the white people, and will come to me I will give you a piece of land and furnish you with horses cows &amp; hogs—If you wish to visit your friends in Montreall I will let you have a horse, and your family Shall be taken care of untill your return—if you wish to return as an Interpreter for the Menetarras when the troops come up to form the establishment, you will be with me ready and I will procure you the place—or if you wish to return to, trade with the indians and will leave your little Son Pomp with me, I will assist you with merchendize for that purpose and become my self conserned with you in trade on a Small scale that is to say not exceeding a perogue load at one time—. If you are desposed to accept either of my offers to you and will bring down your Son your famn Janey had best come along with you to take care of the boy untill I get him—let me advise you to keep your Bill of Exchange and what furs and pelteries you have in possession, and get as much more as you can—, and get as many robes, and big horn and Cabbra Skins as you can collect in the course of this winter. and take them down to St. Louis as early as possible in the Spring—When you get to St Louis enquire of the Govorner of that place for a letter which I shall leave with him for you—in the letter which I shall leave with the governer I shall inform you what you had best do with your firs pelterees and robes &amp;c and derect you where to find me—If you should meet with any misfortune on the river &amp;c. when you get to St Louis write a letter to me by the post and let me know your Situation—If you do not intend to go down either this fall or in the Spring, write a letter to me by the first oppertunity and inform me what you intend to do that I may know if I may expect you or not. If you ever intend to come down this fall or the next Spring will be the best time—this fall would be best If you could get down before the winter—. I shall be found either in St. Louis or in Clarksville at the Falls of the Ohio. Wishing you and your family great suckcess &amp; with anxious expectations of seeing my little dancing boy Baptiest I shall remain your friend William Clark Keep this letter and let not more than one or 2 persons see it, and when you write to me Seal your letter. I think you best not determine which of my offers to accept untill you see me. Come prepared to accept of either which you may chuse after you get down. Mr Teousant Charbono, Menetarras Village. LX LEWIS TO JEFFERSON (A FRAGMENT) [From original incomplete MS. in Lewis and Clark journals—Codex S. Apparently the commencement of a draft of the "sketch of the Most prominent perigrinations since we left the Mandans," promised in the succeeding letter; but it does not appear to have been completed.] St. Louis September 21st, 1806. Sir: Having acquired information &amp; provisions of the Mandans On the evening of the 7th of Apl. 1805 we embarked with our baggage on board 2 large perogues and six small canoes at Fort Mandan on a Voyage of Discovery to the Pacific Ocean. The party consisted of the following persons my friend and Colleague Capt. Wm.. Clark, Interpreters George Drewyer and Touasant Charbono, Sergts. John Ordway, Nathanial Pryor, and Patric Gass, privates John Shields &amp;c a Shoshone Woman and child wife and Infant of Touts Charbono and York a black man servant to Capt. Clark making a total with myself of 33 persons. A Man of the Mandan nation also set out with us under promis to accompany us to the Rocky Mountains with a view to reestablish peace between the Minnetares &amp; Ahwahaways and the Shoshones and others at the head of the Missouri, but becoming very early tired of his mission he abandoned us on the 8th. and returned to his village. the river was full and the water excessively cold the ice which confined it from the [blank space in MS.]th of November 1804 had departed only within a few days previously in this navigating we employed the oar cord and sail the water being too high to permit the uce of the seting pole which in the latter part of summer and autumn may be employed to great advantage on a large proportion of every part of the Missouri, (and when the state of the river is such as to permit the uce of the pole it is always to be prefered to the oar in resisting the forse of it's currant). we ascended with as little difficulty as we had previously met with, found the river equally wide deep and navigable as below fort Mandan. it may not be amis to premise that the distances herein stated are those from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi from which you will recollect that Fort Mandan is 1609 miles distant. we have through the whole course of the voyage taken a chart of the several rivers which we have navigated on a large scale as well as delienated our several tracts by land marking our dayly encampments the entrance of watercourses points of celestial observation, and all other places and objects worthy of notice. at the distance of 1699 mile from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi we arrived on the 13th of Apl at the entrance of the little Missouri a handsom river of [blank space in MS.] yds. in width discharging itself on the S. side, navigable for canoes [blank space in MS.] Ms. here we remained untill the 15th on pursuing our rout we passed the entrance of the white earth river on the [blank space in MS.] Apr. at 1. Ms. this river discharged itself on the N. E. side is [blank space in MS.] yds in width and appears as if it might be navigated with small canoes many miles it's course is due north through an open level plain. a small party of white men, residing with the Mandans, had ascended the Missouri within [blank space in MS.] miles of the entrance of this river about 4 years before but we have no certain account of any white persons reaching its entrance previous to ourselves. from hence therefore our footsteps were on unkno[wn] ground. here the beaver become very abundant on the R. at the distance of 1888 miles we reached the entrance of the Yellow Rock river on the 27th of Apl. this noble branch of the Missouri discharges itself on the S.W. side. it is nearly as wide as the Missouri has from 6 to 8 feet water with an even gentle currant it discharges much more water than any other branch of the Missouri, at least twice as much at many seasons of the year as the great river Platte which has been hitherto considered the most conspicuous among the branches of the Missouri. we examined the country minutely in the vicinity of the entrance of the River Rochejone and found it possessed of every natural advantage necessary for an establishment, it's position in a geographical point of view has destined it for one of the most important establishments both as it reguards the fur trade and the government of the natives in that quarter of the continent. having made the necessary observations at this place we left it on the [blank space in MS.] of Apr. determining to explore this river on our return. still ascending we passed the entrances of two handsome rivers on the N.E. side the 1st at 1944 ms to which we gave the name of Marthy's river the 2d. at 53 miles further which we called Porcupine river, the 1st is 50 yds. wide and the 2ed. 112, both discharge considerable quantities of water; the latter we believe to be navigable many miles for canoes the latter not so far. on the [blank space in MS.] of May we arrived at the entrance of a bold river on the N. E. side 150 yds. wide which from the colour of it's water we called milk river. the currant is gentle stream deep and is probably navigable for large perogues or boats for 150 miles, that is judging from streams of similar size which like it pass through an open country. it's course as far as we could discover it from an eminence or about 30 ms. was due north and I am [MS. here ends.—Ed.] LXI LEWIS TO JEFFERSON [From original MS. in Lewis and Clark journals—Codex S, which consists of leaves cut from the regular note-books. Apparently the first draft of the document which is found in the Jefferson Papers (Bureau of Rolls), series 6, vol. II, doc. 103. We have, in the present publication, preferred to follow this draft.] St. Louis September 23rd.. 1806. Sir: It is with pleasure that I anounce to you the safe arrival of myself and party at this place on the [blank space in MS.] inst. with our papers and baggage. no accedent has deprived us of a single member of our party since I last wrote you from the Mandans in April 1804. In obedience to your orders we have penetrated the Continent of North America to the Pacific Ocean and suficiently explored the interior of the country to affirm that we have discovered the most practicable communication which dose exist across the continent by means of the navigable branches of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers; this is by way of the Missouri to the foot of the rapids five miles below the great falls of that river a distance of 2575 Miles, thence by land passing the Rocky mountains to the Kooskooske 340 and from thence by way of the Kooskooske, the S. E. branch of the Columbia and the latter river to the Ocean of 640 Miles making a total of 3555 Miles. the Missouri possesses sufficient debth of water as far as is specifyed for boats of 15 tons burthen, but those of smaller capacity are to be prefered, the navigation may be deemed safe and good. of 340 Miles land carriage 200 Miles is along a good road and 140 over tremendious mountains which for 60 Miles are covered with eternal snows. notwithstanding the Rocky Mountains thus present a most formidable barrier to this tract across the continent a passage is practicable from the last of June to the last of September, and the expence of transportation over land may be reduced to a mere trifle by means of horses which can be procured in immence numbers and for the most trivial considerations from the natives inhabiting the rocky Mountains and Plains of Columbia West of those Mountains. the Navigation of the Columbia and it's branches is good from the 1st. of April to the middle of August when their waters subside and leave their beds obstructed by a great number of difficult and dangerous shoals and rapids. the Columbia in every stage of it's water has three portages. the first in decending is a portage of 1200 paces at the great falls, a pitch of 37 feet 8 inches being 261 Miles from it's mouth, the second of 2 Miles at the long narrows 6 miles below the falls, and the third of 2 miles at the great rapids 65 miles still lower down. the tides flow within 7 miles of these rapids or 183 miles up the Columbia. thus far large sloops might ascend the river with safety and ships of 300 tons burthen might ascend 125 miles to the entrance of Multnomah river a large Southen branch of the Columbia which takes its rise on the confines of Mexico with the Collorado and Apostles R. from the head of tidewater to the foot of the long narrows the river would be most advantageously navigated in large batteauxs, and from thence upwards in light perogues we vew this passage across the continent as affording immence advantages to the fir trade but fear that advantages wich it offers as a communication for the productions of the East Indias to the United States and thence to Europe will never be found equal on an extensive scale to that by the way of the Cape of good hope. still we beleive that many articles not bulky brittle nor of a perishable nature may be conveyed to the U'. States by this rout with more facility and less expence than by that at present practiced. That portion of the Continent watered by the Missouri and all it's branches from the Cheyenne upwards is richer in beaver and Otter than any country on earth particularly that proportion of it's subsiduary streams lying within the Rocky mountains; the furs of all this immence tract of country including such as may be collected on the upper portion of the river St. Peters, the Assinniboin &amp; Red rivers may be conveyed to the mouth of the Columbia by the 1st of August in each year and from thence be shiped to and arrive at Canton earlier than the furs which are annually shiped from Montreal arrive in England. The N West Company of Canada were they permited by the U.S. might also convey their furs collected in the Athebaske on the Saskashawan and South and West of lake Winnipicque by that rout within the same period. in the infancy of this trade across the Continent or during the period that the trading establishments shall be confined to the branches of the Missouri the men employed in this trade will be compelled to convey the furs collected in that quarter as low on the Columbia as tide water in which case they could not return to the falls of the Missouri untill about the 1st. of October which would be so late in the season that there would be considerable danger of the river being obstructed by ice before they could reach St. Louis and the comodities of the East Indias thus detained untill the following spring. but this dificulty will vanish when establishments are made on the Columbia and a sufficient number of men employed at them to convey the East India commodities to the upper establishment on the Kooskooske and there exchanging them with the men of the Missouri for their furs in the begining of July. by these means the furs not only of the Missouri but those of the Columbia may be shiped to Canton by the season before mentioned and the comodit[i]es of the East Indias arrive at St. Louis by the last of September in each Year. altho' the Columbia dose not as much as the Missouri abound in beaver and Otter yet it is by no means despicable in this respect and would furnish a profitable fur trade, in addition to the otter and beaver considerable quantities of the finest bear of three species affording a great variety of colours, the Tyger catt, several species of fox, the Martin and Sea Otter might be procured beside the rackoon and some other animals of an inferior class of furs. If the government will only aid even on a limited scale the enterprize of her Citizens I am convinced that we shall soon derive the benifits of a most lucrative trade from this source. and in the course of 10 or 12 Years a tour across the Continent by this rout will be undertaken with as little concern as a voyage across the Atlantic is at present. The British N. West company of Canaday have for several years past carried on a partial trade with the Mandans Minnetares and Avahaways on the Missouri from their establishments on the Assinniboin near the entrance of Mouse R. at present I have every reason to believe that they intend forming an establishment very shortly on the Missouri near those nations with a view to ingroce the fir trade of that River. the known enterprize and resou[r]ces of this Company latterly stre[n]gthened by an union with its powerfull rival the X. Y. Company have rendered them formidable in that distant part of the continent to all other traders, and if we are to regard the trade of the missouri as an object of importance to the U. States the strides of this company towards that river cannot be too vigelently watched nor too firmly and spedily opposed by our government. the imbarrasment under which the navigation of the Missouri at present labours from the unfriendly dispositions of the Cancezs the several bands of Tetons, Assiniboins and those tribes that resort the British establishments on the Suskashawan is also a subject which requires the earliest attention of our government. as I shall shortly be with you I have deemed it unnecessary here to detail the several ideas which present themselves to my mind on those subjects more especially when I consider that a thorough knoledge of the geography of the country will be absolutely necessary to their being understood, and leasure has not yet permited us to make but one general Map of the country which I am unwilling to wrisk by the Mail. As a sketch of the Most prominent features of our perigrinations since we left the Mandans may not be uninteresting I shall indeavour to give it to you by way of letter from this place, where I shall necessarily be detained for some days in order to settle with and discharge the men who accompanied me on the voige as well as to prepare for my rout to Washington. (not sending a party from the falls) We left fort Clatsop where we wintered on the pacific Ocean the 27th of [Mar]ch last and arrived at the foot of the Rocky Mts. on the 10th of May here we were detained untill the 24th of June in consequence of the snow rendering those mountains impassable, had it not been for this detention I should have joined you at Montechello in this month agreeably to the promise made you previous to our departure from the Mandans. I have brought with me several skins of the Sea Otter 2 skins of the native Sheep of N. America. 5 skins and skelitons complete of the Bighorn or mountain ram, and a skin of the mule deer besides the skins of several other quadrupeds and birds natives of the country through which we have passed; I have also preserved a pretty extensive collection of pla[n]ts in Horteo have obtained 10 vocabularies. have also prevailed on the principal Chief of the Mandans to accompany me to washington, he is now with my worthy friend and Colleague Capt. C. and myself at this place, in good health and spirits. With rispect to the exertions and services rendered by this estimable man Capt. Wm. Clark on this expedicion I cannot say too much, if sir, any credit be due to the success of the arduous enterprize in which we have been engaged he is equally with myself entitled to the consideration of yourself and that of our common Country. The anxiety which I feel to return once more to the bosom of my friends is a sufficient guarantee that no time will be expended unnecessarily in this quarter. the rout by which I purpose travelling is from hence by Cahokia Vincennes LouisVill Kty. the Craborchard Abington Fincastle, Stanton and Charlotsville to Washington. any letters directed to me at Louisvill 10 days after the receipt of this will most proba[b]ly meet me at that place. I am very anxious to learn the state of my friends in Albemarle particular[l]y whether my mother is yet living. I am with every sentiment of esteem your most Obt. Servt. Meriwether Lewis.

LXII CLARK TO GEORGE ROGERS CLARK1 1 This was printed in a Frankfort (Ky.) paper, October 9, and copied in Eastern papers, among others the Philadelphia Aurora, November 3; Relf's Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, November 5; and Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, November 12. The original letter came into the hands of Mrs. A. J. Ballard, of Louisville. November 24, 1868, Lyman C. Draper copied it there, and his transcript (somewhat "improved" in orthographical and other particulars, as was his custom) now rests in the library of the Wisconsin Historical Society, its press-mark being, Draper MSS., 12J5. There was no superscription on this original, but Draper inferred that it was addressed to George Rogers Clark—a presumption verified by the discovery of William Clark's original draft, in the Voorhis collection. We follow the latter, in preference to either the modified Draper transcript or the still more freely-edited newspaper version.—Ed. [From original MS., apparently Clark's draft, in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] St. Louis September 24 1806 Dear Brother, We arrived at this place on the 23 inst. from the pacific Ocean where we remained during the last winter near the entrance of the Columbia river. this station we left on the 23rd. of March last and should have reached St. Louis early in August had we not been detained by the snow which bared our passage across the Rocky mountains untill the 24th. of June. in returning through those mountains we divided ourselves into several parties, digressing from the rout by which we went out in order the more effectually to explore the country and discover the most practicable rout which dose exist across the continent by way of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, in this we were completely successful and have therefore no hesitation in declaring that such as nature has permitted it we have discovered the best rout which dose exist across the Continent of North America in that direction —such is that by way of the Missouri to the foot of the rapids below the great falls of that River a distance of 2575 miles thence by land passing the Rocky Mountains to a navigable part of the Kooskee 340. and with the Kooskooskee 73 miles Lewis's river 154 miles and the Columbia 413 miles to the Pacific Ocean making the total distance from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi to the discharge of the columbia into the Pacific Ocean 3555. miles. the navigation of the Missouri may be deemed good; it's difficulties arise from its falling banks, timber embeded in the mud of it's channel, it's sandbars and steady rapidity of it's current all which may be overcome with a great degree of certainty by using the necessary precautions. the passage by land of 340 miles from the Missouri to the Kooskooskee is the most formidable part of the tract proposed across the continent. of this distance 200 miles is along a good road, and 140 over tremendious mountains which for 60 miles are covered with eternal snows. a passage over the mountains is however practicable from the latter part of June to the last of september and the cheep rate at which horses are to be obtained from the indians of the Rocky mountains and west of them reduces the expences of transportation over this portage to a mere trifle. the navigation of the Kooskooske Lewis's R and the Columbia is safe and good from the 1st. of april to the middle of August by making 3 portages on the latter river. the first of which in decending is 1200 paces at the falls of the Columbia, 261 mils up that river, a second of 2 miles at the long narrows 6 miles below the falls and then a third also of 2 ms. at the great rapids 65 miles still lower down. the tide flows up the Columbia 183 miles and within 7 miles of the great rapids. large sloops may with safety ascend as high as tide water and vessels of 300 tons burthen may reach the entrance of the Multnawah R. a large Southern branch of the Columbia which taking its rise on the confines of Mexico with the Callarado and Apostles rivers discharges itself into the Columbia 125 miles from its mouth.—I consider this tract across the continent of immense advantage to the fur trade, as all the furs collected in 9/10 parts of the most valuable fur country in America may be conveyed to the mouth of the Columbia and shiped thence to the East Indies by the 1st. of August in each year. and will of course reach Canton earlyer than the furs which are annually exported from Montreal arrive in great Britain.— In our outward bound voyage wee ascended to the foot of the rapids below the great falls of the Missouri where we arrived on the 14th. of June 1805. not having met with any of the natives of the Rocky mountains we were of course ignorant of the passes by land which existed through that country to the Columbia river, and had we even known the rout we were destitute of horses which would have been indispensibly necessary to enable us to transport the requisite quantity of amunition and other stores to ensure the success of the remaining part of our voyage down the Columbia; we therefore determined to navigate the Missouri as far as it was practicable or untill we met with some of the natives from whom we could obtain horses and information of the country. accordingly we undertook a most laborious portage at the falls of the Missouri of 18 miles which we effected with our canoes and baggage by the 3rd. of July. from hence ascending the Missouri we entered the Rocky mountains at the distance of 71 miles above the upper part of the portage and penetrated as far as the three forks of that river a distance of 181 miles further; here the Missouri divides itself into three nearly equal branches at the same point the two largest branches are so nearly of the same dignity that we did not conceive that either of them could with propryety retain the Name of the Missouri and therefore called these three streams Jefferson's Madisons and Gallitin's rivers. the confluence of these rivers is 2848 miles from the mouth of the Missouri by the meanders of that river. we arrived at the three forks of the Missouri 27th. of July. not having yet been so fortunate as to meet with the natives although I had previously made several excurtions for that purpose we were compelled still to continue our rout by water. the most Northwardly of the three forks, that to which we had given the name of Jefferson's river was deemed the most proper for our purposes and we accordingly ascended it 248 miles to the upper forks it's extreem navigable point, making the total distance to which we had navigated the waters of the Missouri 3096 miles of which 429 lay within the Rocky Mountains. on the morning of the 17th of August 1805 I arrived at the forks of Jefferson's river where I met Capt. Lewis who had previously penitrated with a party of three men to the waters of the Columbia discovered a band of Shashones and had found means to induce thirty five of them Chiefs and warriors to accompany him to that place. from these people we learned that the river on which they resided was not navigable and that a passage through the Mountains in that direction was impracticable; being unwilling to confide in the unfavourable account of the natives it was concerted between Capt. Lewis and myself that I should go forward immediately with a small party and explore the river while he in the interem would lay up the canoes at that place and engage the natives with their horses to assist in transporting our stores and baggage to their camp accordingly I set out the next day passed the dividing mountains between the waters of the Missouri and Columbia and descended the river which I have since called the East fork of Lewis's R. about 70 miles. finding that the Indian account of the country in the direction of this river was correct I returned and joined Capt. Lewis on the 29th. of August at the Shashone Camp excessively fatigued having been compelled to subsist on berries during the greater part of my rout. we now purchased 27 horses of these indians and hired a guide who assured us that he could in 15 days take us to a large river in an open country west of these mountains by a rout some distance to the North of the river on which they lived and that by which the nations west of the Mountains visited the plains of the Missouri for the purpose of hunting buffaloe. every preparation being made we set forward with our guide on the 31st. of August through those tremendious mountains. in which we continued until the 22nd. of September before we reached the level country beyond them; on our way we met with the Ootslashshoot a band of the Tushepahs from whom we obtained an accession of seven horses and exchanged eight or ten others this proved of infinite service to us as we were compelled to subsist on horse beef about eight days before we reached the Kooskooske. during our passage over these mountains we suffered everything which hunger cold and fatigue could impose; nor did our difficulties with rispect to provision cease on our arrival at the Kooskooske for although the Palletepallers a numerous nation inhabiting that country were extremly hospitable and for a few trifling articles furnished us with an abundance of roots and dryed salmon the food to which they were accustomed we found that we could not subsist on those articles and almost all of us grew sick on eating them we were obliged therefore to have resourse to the flesh of horses and dogs as food to supply the deficiency of our guns which produced but little meat as game was scarce in the vicinity of our camp on the Kooskooske where we were compelled to remain in order to construct our perogues to decend the river at this season the salmon are meagre and form but indifferent food. while we remained here I was myself sick for several days and my friend Capt. Lewis suffered a severe indisposition. Having completed 4 large perogues and a small canoe we gave our horses in charge to the Pallotepallers untill we returned and on the 7 of Octr. reimbarked for the Pacific Ocean. we decended by the rout which I have already mentioned. the water of the rivers being low at this season we experienced much difficulty in decending, we found them obstructed by a great number of difficult and dangerous rapids in passing of which our perogues several times filled and the men escaped narrowly with their lives. however this difficulty dose not exist in high water which happens within the period which I have previously mentioned. we found the natives extremly numerous and generally friendly though we have on several occasions owed our lives and the fate of the expedition to our number which consisted of 31 men. On the 17th. of November we reached the Ocean where various considerations induced us to spend the winter we therefore searched for an eligible situation for that purpose and selected a spot on the S. side of a little river called by the natives the Natul which discharges itself into a small bay on the S. E. side of the Columbia. 14 miles within point Adams. here we constructed some log houses and defended them with a common stoccade work; this place we called Fort Clatsop after a nation of that name who were our nearest neighbours in this country we found an abundance of Elk on which we subsisted principally during the last winter. on our homeward bound voyage being much better acquainted with the country we were enabled to take such precautions as have in a great measure secured us from the want of provision at any time, and greatly lessened our fatigues when compared with those to which we were compelled to submit in our outward bound journey. We left Fort Clatsop on the 23rd. of March we have not lost a man since we left the Mandans a circumstance which I assure you is a pleasing consideration to me. As I shall shortly be with you I deem it unnecessary to here to attempt minutely to detail the occurrances of the last eighteen months—Adieu &amp;c.

I recieved, my dear Sir, with unspeakable joy your letter of Sep. 23 announcing the return of yourself, Capt Clarke &amp; your party in good health to St. Louis. The unknown scenes in which you were engaged &amp; the length of time without hearing of you had begun to be felt awfully. Your letter having been 31 [27?] days coming, this cannot find you at Louisville, &amp; I therefore think it safest to lodge it at Charlottesville, it's only object is to assure you of what you already know, my constant affection for you &amp; the joy with which all your friends here will receive you, tell my friend of Mandane also that I have already opened my arms to recieve him. Perhaps, while in our neighborhood, it may be gratifying to him, &amp; not otherwise to yourself to take a ride to Monticello and see in what manner I have arranged the tokens of friendship I have received from his country particularly, as well as from other Indian friends: that in fact I am preparing a kind of Indian hall. mr Dinsmore, my principal workman will shew everything there. had you not better bring him [Mandan] by Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Alexandria? he will thus, see what none of the others have visited, &amp; and the convenience of the public stages will facilitate your taking that route. I salute you with sincere affection. Th. Jefferson. Capt. M. Lewis. LXVI PART OF JEFFERSON'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS, DEC. 2, 1806 [From Ford, viii, p. 492.] The expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, for exploring the river Missouri, and the best communication from that to the Pacific Ocean, has had all the success which could have been expected. They have traced the Missouri nearly to its source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication across our continent, learned the character of the country, of its commerce, and inhabitants; and it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave companions, have by this arduous service deserved well of their country. LXVII CONTEMPORARY NEWSPAPER NOTICES The first newspaper notices of the return of the expedition appear to have been based on letters from residents of St. Louis, or others who were personally interested in the affair. The following are excerpts from and summaries of the most important of these notices: Extract from letter to editors of the Baltimore Federal Gazette, under date of St. Louis, September 23, 1806:1 1 This was copied in Relf's Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, October 27; in Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, October 28; and abridged in the Boston Centinel, November 5.—Ed. Concerning the safe arrival of Messrs. Lewis and Clark, who went 2 years and 4 months ago to explore the Missouri, to be anxiously wished for by everyone, I have the pleasure to mention that they arrived here about one hour ago, in good health, with only the loss of one man who died. They visited the Pacific Ocean, which they left on the 27th of March last. They would have been here about the 1st of August, but for the detention they met with from snow and frost in crossing mountains on which are eternal snows. Their journal will no doubt be not only importantly interesting to us all, but a fortune for the worthy and laudable adventurers. When they arrived 3 cheers were fired. They really have the appearance of Robinson Crusoes—dressed entirely in buckskins. We shall know all very soon—I have had no particulars yet. Letter in the Philadelphia Register for October 28, 1806, taken from "a Kentucky paper" of October 4:2 2 This was copied in the Philadelphia Aurora, October 29; and in Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, October 29.—Ed. St. Louis, Sept. 23, 1806 Dear Sir—Captains Lewis and Clark are just arrived, all in good health. They left the Pacific Ocean the 23d of March last—they wintered there. They arrived there in last November; there was some American vessels there just before their arrival. They had to pack one hundred and sixty miles from the head of the Missouri to Columbia river.—One of the hands, an intelligent man, tells me that Indians are as numerous on Columbia as the whites are in any part of the U States—They brought but one family of Indians, of the Mandan nation. They have brought several curiosities with them from the ocean. The Indians are represented as being very peaceable. The winter was very mild on the Pacific. I am your's &amp;c John Mullanphy P. S. They left St. Charles May 20th, 1804, and returned there September 21st, 1806. J. M. Extract from "a letter from a gentleman at St. Charles, to a gentleman in this town, dated 23d September, 1806," in the Frankfort (Ky.) Palladium for October 9, 1806:1 1 This was copied in the Washington National Intelligencer, November 3, 1806, with words "this town" changed to "Washington City." From the Intelligencer it was copied in Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, November 7; in the Vermont Centinel, Burlington, November 20; and in the Connecticut Courant, Hartford, November 19. The heading in the latter was "More Wonders. Rocky Mountain Sheep beats the horned frog all hollow."—Ed. I have the pleasure to inform you of the arrival of Captains Lewis and Clark. They were the first white people that ever visited that country. By the best accounts they could get there are about ninety or one hundred thousand inhabitants, (Indians) on the west side of the Rocky mountains; horses without number. It Is thought to be a very poor Indian that did not own 300 horses. Not an iron tool among them.—They erected a fort on the sea shore and engraved their names. They have a number of curiosities; among which is a wild sheep; its head and horns weigh about 80 or 90 pounds. He was caught on the Rocky Mountains. Summary of official report, in the National Intelligencer for October 27, 1806:2 2 This was copied in numerous papers; among others, Poulson's American Daily Advertiser, Philadelphia, October 30; the Connecticut Witness, Hartford, November 5; Relf's Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, October 29; the Philadelphia Aurora, October 30. This article is based on Lewis's letter to the president; see document lxi, ante.—Ed. It is a pleasure to announce the arrival of Captain Lewis with his exploring party at St. Louis. They wintered near the mouth of the Columbia river; leaving thence Mar. 27, were detained by snows in the mountains until June 24. He found it 2575 miles from the mouth of Missouri to the great falls; thence by land over the Rocky mountains 340 miles, of which 200 would admit a good road, the rest over tremendous mountains. Then 73 miles down the Kooskooske into a south eastwardly branch of the Columbia, 154 miles down that to the Columbia, and then 413 miles to the Pacific; 3555 miles in all. Speaks of the whole country furnishing valuable furs. Says it was fortunate he sent no men back, since they owed their lives more than once to their numbers. Captain Lewis will remain a few days in St. Louis, and then proceed to Washington accompanied by the Mandan chief. He speaks of his colleague Captain Clark in the most affectionate terms, and ascribes to him an equal share in the success of this enterprise. Summary of article from the New York Gazette:1 1 Copied in Relf's Philadelphia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, November 26; and the Philadelphia Aurora, November 29.—Ed. Have lately been told that Mr. Lewis and party passed last winter near mouth of Columbia, this is in lat. 46, 19′ N. and long. 123°, 38′ W. from London; it was named by Captain Gray in 1791 or '92, for his ship, and the southern cape for the late president Adams. The bay is some miles broad and 20 or 30 long; the tide rises 12 feet at the mouth of the river, but the current is so strong it does not run up it more than 60 miles. The river and its tributary streams abound in salmon. The timber is pine, maple, ash, poplar, and oak. The natives are badly armed, though some have copper swords. The head of Columbia river lies south of the 45th degree; the distance from the mouth of the Missouri to that of the Columbia is 1440 miles in a direct course, which will probably never be travelled. Letter in the Philadelphia Aurora, December 22, 1806: Frankfort, (Kentucky), Nov. 20 Captain Lewis arrived at this place on Thursday last, and on Saturday morning proceeded on his journey to the city of Washington, by way of the old wilderness road. He was accompanied by the chief of the Mandane Indians; and a party of the Osages. Mr. Choteau, with the latter, took their route through Lexington. Note in the Philadelphia Aurora, December 24, 1806: Mr. Choteau with a party of the Osage Indians has arrived in Washington. Captain Lewis, accompanied by the Mandane chief is also expected every day. Note in Relf's Philadephia Gazette and Daily Advertiser, January 5, 1807: Captain Lewis and the Indians who came with him on his return from the Pacific, were, it is said, at the President's levee day. LXVIII AN ADDRESS FROM CITIZENS OF FINCASTLE AND VICINITY, AND CLARK'S REPLY THERETO [From original MSS. in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] [I. THE ADDRESS] An address from the Citizens of Fincastle &amp; its vicinity to Captains Meriwether Lewis &amp; William Clarke—8th of January 1807 Gentlemen: Sentiments of esteem and gratitude induce us to offer you our sincere congratulations, upon your safe return to the bosom of your country. During your absence upon a perilous &amp; laborious service, we have reflected with the deepest solicitude, on the dangers which you must necessarily encounter. Our anxiety for your safety, and that of the party under your command, is now happily terminated. Your prudence, courage and good conduct have afforded us an oppertunety of yielding, without restraint to those emotions of Joy so natural to the mind, after having experienced a painful suspence. To those, who have acted so distinguished &amp; honorable apart on the theatre of human affairs, future life cannot but afford the most soothing recollections. In whatever situation it may hereafter please the Supreme Being to place you, it will be a source of unmixed gratification to remember that in order to meet the just expectations, which your appointment by Government had excited, you have navigated bold &amp; unknown rivers, traversed Mountains, which had never before been impressed with the footsteps of civilized man, and surmounted every obstacle, which climate, Nature, or ferocious savages could throw in your way. You have the further satisfaction to reflect that, you have extended the knowledge of the Geography of your country; in other respects enriched Science; and opened to the United States a source of inexhaustable wealth, no event, which occurred during the expedition, can, in the smallest degree, impair the force of those solacing reflections. You have uniformly respected the rights of humanity, actuated by principles of genuine philanthropy, you have not sprinkled your path with the blood of unoffending savages. Your fame will be as pure and unsullied, as of that great man to whom Europe is indebted for a knowledge of our continent; the extent and importance of which, it has been reserved for you to disclose to the world. We concieve it to be a signal proof of the wisdom and attention with which you have conducted the expedition, that but one man has been lost to your country. This fact will afford to future travellers the most salutary instruction. It will teach them, that, discoveries (apparently the most difficult) may be effected without the effusion of human blood. You will, Gentlemen, indulge us in declaring it as our opinion, that the rewards, which a grateful country may think proper to bestow, ought not to be apportioned to common merit or services; but that the recompence to yourselves and to each individual under your command should be such as, in some measure, to atone for past Perils, difficulties and Privations. With great respect we are Gentn. your Humble Servts. Pat Lockhart, Chairman, By order &amp; on behalf of the Citizens of Fincastle &amp;c. Captains Lewis &amp; Clarke. [II. CLARK'S REPLY THERETO] Gentlemen: Those sentiments of esteem and solicitude for our personal safety expressed in your affectionate address has excited in me the livelyest sencibility.—To meet with the approbation of our country for the attempt which has been made to render services to the government by Capt. Lewis Myself and the party that accompanied us, is a source of the highest gratification. It will be a pleasing reflection in future life to find that the expedition has been productive of those advantages to our Country, Geography, and science that you are willing to imagine. To respect the rights of humanity has and ever will be the leading principal of my life, and no reflection is more pleasing to me than that of effecting the object we had in view with the effusion of so small a portion of human blood. Gentlemen we ought to assign the general safety of the party to a singular interposition of providence, and not to the wisdom of those who commanded the expedition. Your anxiety that our country should reward our services with liberality, produces in me those emmotions natural to the mind, at the same time acknowledging our uniform confidence not only in the justice but the liberality of our Country. The friendly attention manifested towards us by many of our fellow citizens is highly flattering, but the distinguished attention shewn to me by the Citizens of Fincastle &amp; its vicinity produces those emmotions which I am unable to discribe. I will do my self the Honor to hand Capt. Lewis and make known to the faithfull party that accompanied us your friendly address, which I will undertake to say for them will be justly appreciated. You will please Gentlemen except of the best wishes of your most obedient Humble Servant W. Clarke To the Citizens of Fincastle and its vicinity LXIX GRATUITIES TO THE OFFICERS AND MEN IN THE EXPEDITION TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER LEWIS AND CLARK [From American State Papers, Military Affairs, i, no. 68, pp. 207–209.] Communicated to the House of Representatives, January 23, 1807. Committee Room, January 12, 1807. Sir: The committee to whom has been referred a resolution of the House of Representatives, to inquire what compensation ought to be made to Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave companions, for their late service in exploring the Western waters, have instructed me to request that you will furnish them with such information, in the possession of the Department of War, as you may deem necessary to guide the committee in establishing their rate of compensation; also a list of the names of the officers, and their respective grades, and the names of the soldiers under their command. From your most obedient servant, Willis Alston, Jun. Secretary of War. War. Department, January 14, 1807. Sir: Agreeably to the request of the committee, as expressed in your letter of the 12th inst., I herewith transmit a list of the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, who formed the party recently returned from an enterprise, which they commenced and prosecuted with a degree of boldness, perseverance, judgment, and success, that has rarely, if ever, occurred, in this or any other country. The officers and soldiers will receive their usual compensations from this Department, up to the time of their return to St. Louis. The quantum of gratuity, either in land or money, or in both, to which such meritorious and unusual services may be entitled, on the score of national justice, or on the principles of sound policy and national liberality, being principally a matter of opinion, it is with diffidence I take the liberty of proposing, for the consideration of the committee, a grant to each non-commissioned officer and private, of 320 acres of land; to Lieut. Clarke, of 1000; and to Captain Lewis, of 1,500; with the addition of double pay to each while engaged in the enterprise; and that each one should have permission to locate his grant on any lands that have been surveyed, and are now for sale by the United States. It may be proper for me to remark, that, in a conversation with Captain Lewis, he observed, that whatever grant of land Congress might think proper to make, to himself and Lieutenant Clarke, it was his wish there should be no distinction of rank so noticed as to make a difference in the quantity granted to each; and that he would prefer an equal division of whatever quantity might be granted to them. I also transmit, herewith, the letter from Captain Lewis to the Secretary of War, which accompanied said list. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant, H. Dearborn. Hon. Willis Alston, Chairman, &amp;c. City Of Washington, January 15, 1807. Sir: Herewith enclosed I transmit you the roll of the men who accompanied me on my late tour to the Pacific Ocean, through the interior of the continent of North America. In addition to the men whose names are entered on this roll, there are two others who have some claims to a gratuity, as connected with the expedition; but as I cannot consider them, in all respects, as of the permanent party, I have thought their pretensions more properly the subjects of this detached communication, than of the roll which accompanies it. Richard Warfington was a corporal in the infantry of the United States' army, whom I had occasion to take with me on my voyage as far as the Mandan nation. His term of service expired on the 4th of August, 1804, nearly three months previous to my arrival at that place. Knowing that it would become necessary for me to send back my boat in the spring of 1805, with a party of soldiers, whose terms of service had not expired; that it was of some importance that the Government should receive, in safety, the despatches which I was about to transmit from thence; that there was not one of the party, destined to be returned from thence, in whom I could place the least confidence, except himself; and that, if he was discharged at the moment of the expiration of his term of service, he would necessarily lose his military standing, and thereby lessen the efficiency of his command among the soldiery; I was induced, under these considerations, to make an arrangement with him, by which it was agreed between us, that he should not receive his discharge from the military service until his return to St. Louis, and that he should, in the interim, retain his rank, and receive only for his services the accustomed compensation. Accordingly, he remained with me during the winter, and was, the next spring, in conformity to my plan, placed in command of the boat, and charged with my despatches to the Government. The duties assigned him on this occasion, were performed with a punctuality which uniformly marked his conduct while under my command. Taking into view the cheerfulness with which he continued in the service after every obligation had ceased to exist from his enlistment; the fatigues, labor, and dangers, incident to that service; and, above all, the fidelity with which he discharged his duty; it would seem, that when rewards were about to be distributed among those of the party who were engaged in this enterprise, that his claim to something more than his pay of seven dollars per month, as corporal, cannot be considered unreasonable. John Newman was a private in the infantry of the United States' army, who joined me as a volunteer, and entered into an enlistment, in common with others, by which he was held and mustered as one of the permanent party. In the course of the expedition, or shortly before we arrived at the Mandan village, he committed himself by using certain mutinous expressions, which caused me to arrest him, and to have him tried by a court martial, formed of his peers: they, finding him guilty, sentenced him to receive seventy-five lashes, and to be discharged from the permanent party. This sentence was confirmed by me, and the punishment took place. The conduct of this man, previous to this period, had been generally correct; and the zeal he afterwards displayed for the benefit of the service, was highly meritorious. In the course of the winter, while at Fort Mandan, from an ardent wish to atone for the crime which he had committed at an unguarded moment, he exerted himself, on every occasion, to become useful. This disposition induced him to expose himself too much to the intense cold of that climate, and on a hunting excursion, he had his hands and feet severely frozen, with which he suffered extreme pain, for some weeks. Having recovered from this accident by the 1st of April, 1805, he asked forgiveness for what had passed, and begged that I would permit him to continue with me through the voyage; but deeming it impolitic to relax from the sentence, although he stood acquitted in my mind, I determined to send him back, which was accordingly done. Since my return I have been informed that he was extremely serviceable as a hunter, on the voyage to St. Louis, and that the boat, on several occasions, owed her safety, in a great measure, to his personal exertions, being a man of uncommon activity and bodily strength. If, under these circumstances, it should be thought proper to give Newman the remaining third which will be deducted from the gratuity awarded Baptiste Le Page, who occupied his station in the after part of the voyage, I should feel myself much gratified. I have the honor to be, with due consideration, and much respect, your obedient servant, Meriwether Lewis, Captain, 1st U. S. Reg't Infantry. Gen. H. Dearborn, Secretary of War. A Roll of the men who accompanied Captains Lewis and Clarke on their late tour to the Pacific Ocean, through the interior of the continent of North America, showing their rank, with some remarks on their respective merits and services. No. Names. Rank. Remarks. 1 John Ordway, Sergeant. 2 Nathaniel Pryor, Do. 3 Charles Floyd, Do. {Deceased the 20th of August, 1804. A young man of much merit. His father, who now resides in Kentucky, is a man much respected, though possessed of but moderate wealth. As the son has lost his life whilst on this service, I consider his father entitled to some gratuity, in consideration of his loss; and also, that the deceased being noticed in this way, will be a tribute but justly due to his merit. 4 Patrick Gass, Do. {Promoted to sergeant, 20th of August, 1804, in the place of Charles Floyd, deceased; in which capacity he continued until discharged at St. Louis, November 10, 1806. 5 William Bratton, Private, 6 John Collins, Do. 7 John Colter, Do. 8 Pierre Cruzatte, Do. 9 Joseph Field, Do. {Two of the most active and enterprising young men who accompanied us.

Howard, Do. 15 Hugh Hall, Do. 16 Francis Labuiche, Do. {He has received the pay only of a private, though, besides the duties performed as such, he has rendered me very essential services as a French and English interpreter; therefore, I should think it only just that some small addition to his pay, as a private, should be added, though no such addition has, at any time, been promised by me. 17 Hugh M'Neal, Do. 18 John Sheilds, Do. {Has received the pay only of a private. Nothing was more peculiarly useful to us, in various situations, than the skill and ingenuity of this man as an artist, in repairing our guns, accoutrements, &amp;c. and should it be thought proper to allow him something as an artificer, he has well deserved it. 19 George Shannon, Do. 20 John Potts, Do. 21 John Baptiste Le Page, Do. {Entitled to no peculiar merit: was enlisted at Fort Mandan, on the 2d of November, 1804, in order to supply the deficiency in my permanent party, occasioned by the discharge of John Newman. He performed the tour to the Pacific Ocean, and returned to St. Louis, where he was discharged, in common with others, on the 10th of November last. As he did not perform the labors incident to the summer of 1804, it would be proper to give him the gratuity only of two-thirds as much as is given to others of his rank. 22 John B. Thompson, Do. 23 William Werner, Do. 24 Richard Windsor, Do. 25 Peter Wiser, Do. 26 Alexander Willard, Do. 27 Joseph Whitehouse, Do. 28 George Drulyard, Interpreter. {A man of much merit; he has been peculiarly useful from his knowledge of the common language of gesticulation, and his uncommon skill as a hunter and woodsman; those several duties he performed in good faith, and with an ardor which deserves the highest commendation. It was his fate also to have encountered, on various occasions, with either Captain Clarke or myself, all the most dangerous and trying scenes of the voyage, in which he uniformly acquitted himself with honor. He has served the complete term of the whole tour, and received only 25 dollars per month, and one ration per day, while I am informed that it is not unusual for individuals, in similar employments, to receive 30 dollars per month. 29 Touisant Charbono, Interpreter. {A man of no peculiar merit; was useful as an interpreter only, in which capacity he discharged his duties with good faith, from the moment of our departure from the Mandans, on the 7th of April, 1805, until our return to that place in August last, and received, as a compensation, 25 dollars per month, while in service. General Remark. With respect to all those persons whose names are entered on this roll, I feel a peculiar pleasure in declaring, that the ample support which they gave me under every difficulty; the manly firmness which they evinced on every necessary occasion; and the patience and fortitude with which they submitted to, and bore, the fatigues and painful sufferings incident to my late tour to the Pacific Ocean, entitles them to my warmest approbation and thanks; nor will 1 suppress the expression of a hope, that the recollection of services, thus faithfully performed, will meet a just reward, in an ample remuneration on the part of our Government.

[Endorsed:] Major Edmund Clark near Louisville Kentucky LXXII LEWIS'S PROSPECTUS, 18071 1 The prospectus was issued in two forms, octavo and folio. The only copies known to be extant—one of the former and two of the latter—are in the possession of Mrs. and Miss Voorhis. They were evidently the personal copies retained by Lewis, and, together with accompanying letters, bear the names of the following subscribers: Luther Robbins, Benjamin Alden, John Cole, and William Gilbert, of Greene, Me., subscribed jointly for the three volumes; while John Chancellor, of Monmouth, Me., Peter Norton, of Readfield, Me., and Mel. Amoureux, of New Madrid, La. T., subscribed for the first two volumes only. On one of the scraps of paper folded among these documents are inscribed the following memoranda in Lewis's hand, evidently appertaining to his preparations for this venture: "enquire what has been done by G.L. with Calulations—engraving Printing Botany The papers relitive—Samples, " if a man can be got to go to St Louis with me to write the journal &amp; price "The price of engraving animals Inds &amp; maps Paper &amp; other expences " Get some one to write the scientific part &amp; natural history—Botany, Mineralogy &amp; Zoology. "Praries—Muddiness of the Missouri, Volcanic apper' Natural Phenomena— 23 vocabularies &amp; plates &amp; engraving" This receipt also appears, showing that he had thus early obtained assistance in the map-making: "Red of Governor Lewis the Sum of Forty Dollar for two Drawings water falls in full "July 14 1807 John James Burraht." [From original broadside in possession of Mrs. Julia Clark Voorhis and Miss Eleanor Glasgow Voorhis.] Prospectus of Lewis and Clark's Tour to the Pacific Ocean Through the Interior of the Continent of North America, performed by order of the government of the United States, during the years 1804, 1805, &amp; 1806. This work will be prepared by Captain Meriwether Lewis, and will be divided into two parts, the whole comprised in three volumes octavo, the first containing at least seven hundred pages, the second and third from four to five hundred each, printed on good paper, and a fair Pica type. The several volumes in succession will be put to press at as early periods as the avocations of the author will permit him to prepare them for publication. Part the First: in two volumes. Will contain a narrative of the voyage, with a description of some of the most remarkable places in those hitherto unknown wilds of America, accompanied by a map of good size, a large chart of the entrance of the Columbia river, embracing the adjacent country, coast and harbours, and embellished with views of two beautiful cataracts of the Missouri; the plan, on a large scale, of the connected falls of that river, as also of those of the falls, narrows, and great rapids of the Columbia, with their several portages. For the information of future voyagers, there will be added in the sequel of this volume, some observations and remarks on the navigation of the Missouri and Columbia rivers, pointing out the precautions which must necessarily be taken, in order to ensure success, together with an itinerary of the most direct and practicable route across the continent of North America, from the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers to the discharge of the Columbia into the Pacific Ocean. Volume Second. Whatever properly appertains to geography, embracing a description of the rivers, mountains, climate, soil and face of the country; a view of the Indian nations distributed over that vast region, showing their traditions, habits, manners, customs, national characters, stature, complexions, dress, dwelling, arms, and domestic utensils, with many other interesting particulars in relation to them: also observations and reflections on the subjects of civilizing, governing and maintaining a friendly intercourse with those nations. A view of the fur trade of North America, setting forth a plan for its extension, and showing the immense advantages which would accrue to the mercantile interests of the United States, by combining the same with a direct trade to the East Indies through the continent of North America. This volume will be embellished with twenty plates illustrative of the dress and general appearance of such Indian nations as differ materially from each other; of their habitations; their weapons and habiliments used in war; their hunting and fishing apparatus, domestic utensils, &amp;c. In an appendix there will also be given a diary of the weather, kept with great attention throughout the whole of the voyage, showing also the daily rise and fall of the principal water-courses which were navigated in the course of the same. Part the Second: in one volume. This part of the work will be confined exclusively to scientific research, and principally to the natural history of those hitherto unknown regions. It will contain a full dissertation on such subjects as have fallen within the notice of the author, and which may properly be distributed under the heads of Botany, Mineralogy, and Zoology, together with some strictures on the origin of Prairies, the cause of the muddiness of the Missouri, of volcanic appearances, and other natural phenomena, which were met with in the course of this interesting tour. This volume will also contain a comparative view of twenty three vocabularies of distinct Indian languages, procured by Captains Lewis and Clark on the voyage, and will be ornamented and embellished with a much greater number of plates than will be bestowed on the first part of the work, as it is intended that every subject of natural history which is entirely new, and of which there are a considerable number, shall be accompanied by an appropriate engraving illustrative of it.

Dear Majr: I must acknowledge myself remiss in not writing you in answer to several friendly epistles which I have received from you since my return from the Pacific Ocean. continued occupation in the immediate discharge of the duties of a public station will I trust in some measure plead my apology. I am now on my way to the city of Washington and had contemplated taking Fort Adams and Orlianes in my rout, but my indisposition has induced me to change my rout and shall now pass through Tennessee and Virginia, the protest of some bills which I have lately drawn on public account form the principal inducement for my going forward at this moment. an explanation is all that is necessary I am sensible to put all matters right, in the mean time the protest of a draught however just has drawn upon me at one moment all my private debts which have excessively embarrassed me. I hope you will therefore pardon me for asking you to remit as soon as is convenient the sum of $200 which you have informed me you hold for me I calculated on having the pleasure to see you at Fort Adams as I passed, but am Informed by Capt Russel the commanding officer of this place that you are stationed on the West side of the Mississippi. You will direct to me at the City of Washington untill the last of December after which I expect I shall be on my return to St. Louis. Your sincere friend, &amp; Obt servant Meriwether Lewis.

LXXV LEWIS'S OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS ON UPPER LOUISIANA, 1809 [Appendix to Biddle version (1814), ii, pp. 435–461.] Observations and reflections on the present and future state of Upper Louisiana, in relation to the government of the Indian nations inhabiting that country, and the trade and intercourse with the same. By captain Lewis. With a view to a more complete development of this subject, I have deemed it expedient in the outset, to state the leading measures pursued by the provincial government of Spain, in relation to this subject; the evils which flowed from those measures, as well to the Indians as to the whites, in order that we may profit by their errors, and be ourselves the better enabled to apply the necessary correctives to the remnant of evils which their practice introduced. From the commencement of the Spanish provincial government in Louisiana, whether by the permission of the crown, or originating in the pecuniary rapacity of their governors general, this officer assumed to himself exclusively the right of trading with all the Indian nations in Louisiana; and therefore proceeded to dispose of this privilege to individuals, for certain specific sums: his example was imitated by the governors of Upper Louisiana, who made a further exaction. Those exclusive permissions to individuals varied as to the extent of country or nations they embraced, and the period for which granted; but in all cases the exclusive licenses were offered to the highest bidder, and, consequently, the sums paid by the individuals purchasing, were quite as much as the profits of the trade would bear, and in many instances, from a spirit of opposition between contending applicants, much more was given than ever the profits of the traffic would justify. The individual, of course, became bankrupt. This, however, was among the least of the evils flowing from this system to the Indian; it produced the evil of compelling him to pay such enormous sums for the articles he purchased, that his greatest exertions would not enable him to obtain as much as he had previously been in the habit of consuming, and which he therefore conceived necessary to him; for as this system progressed the demands of the governors became more exorbitant, and the trader, to meet his engagements, exacted higher prices from the Indians, though the game became scarcer in their country. The morals of the Indian were corrupted by placing before him the articles which he viewed as of the first necessity to him, at such prices, that he had it not in his power to purchase; he was therefore induced, in many instances, to take by force that which he had not the means of paying for; consoling himself with the idea, that the trader was compelled of necessity to possess himself of the peltries and furs, in order to meet his engagements with those from whom he had purchased his merchandise, as well as those who had assisted him in their transportation. He consequently could not withdraw himself from their trade, without inevitable ruin. The prevalence of this sentiment among the Indians, was strongly impressed on my mind by an anecdote related to me by a gentleman, who had for several years enjoyed, under the Spanish government, the exclusive privilege of trading with the Little Osages. It happened, that after he had bartered with them for all their peltries and furs which they had on hand, that they seized forcibly on a number of guns and a quantity of ammunition which he had still remaining; he remonstrated with them against this act of violence, and finally concluded by declaring that he would never return among them again, nor would he suffer any person to bring them merchandise thereafter. They heard him out very patiently, when one of their leaders pertly asked him; if he did not return the next season to obtain their peltries and furs, how he intended to pay the persons from; whom he had purchased the merchandise they had then taken from him? The Indians believed that these traders were the most powerful persons in the nation; nor did they doubt their ability to withhold merchandise from them; but the great thirst displayed by the traders for the possession of their peltries and furs, added to the belief that they were compelled to continue their traffic, was considered by the Indians a sufficient guarantee for the continuance of their intercourse, and therefore felt themselves at liberty to practise aggressions on the traders with impunity: thus they governed the trader by what they conceived his necessities to possess their furs and peltries, rather than governing themselves by their own anxiety to obtain merchandise, as they may most effectually be by a well regulated system. It is immaterial to the Indians how they obtain merchandise; in possession of a supply they feel independent. The Indians found by a few experiments of aggression on the traders, that as it respected themselves, it had a salutary effect; and although they had mistaken the legitimate cause of action on the part of the trader, the result being favourable to themselves, they continued their practice. The fact is, that the trader was compelled to continue his trade under every disadvantage, in order to make good his engagements to the governors; for having secured their protection, they were safe, both in person and property from their other creditors, who were, for the most part, the merchants of Montreal. The first effect of these depredations of the Indians, was the introduction of a ruinous custom among the traders, of extending to them a credit. The traders, who visited the Indians on the Missouri, arrived at their wintering stations from the latter end of September to the middle of October: here they carried on their traffic until the latter end of March or beginning of April. In the course of the season they had possessed themselves of every skin the Indians had procured, of course there was an end of trade; but previous to their return, the Indians insist upon a credit being given on the faith of payment when he returned the next season. The trader understands his situation, and knowing this credit was nothing less than the price of his passport, or the privilege of departing in safety to his home, of course narrowed down the amount of this credit, by concealing, as far as he could, to avoid the suspicions of the Indians, the remnant of his merchandise. But the amount to be offered must always be such as they had been accustomed to receive; and which, in every case, bore a considerable proportion to their whole trade; say the full amount of their summer or redskin hunt. The Indians well knew that the traders were in their power, and the servile motives which induced them to extend their liberality to them, and Were therefore the less solicitous to meet their engagements on the day of payment; to this indifference they were further urged by the traders distributing among them, on those occasions, many articles of the last necessity to them. The consequence was, that when the traders returned the ensuing fall, if they obtained only one half of their credits they were well satisfied, as this covered their real expenditure. Again: if it so happen, in the course of the winter's traffic, that the losses of the trader, growing out of the indolence of the Indians, and their exorbitant exactions under the appellation of credit, should so reduce his stock in trade that he could not pay the governor the price stipulated for his license, and procure a further supply of goods in order to prosecute his trade, the license was immediately granted to some other individual, who, with an ample assortment of merchandise, visits the place of rendezvous of his predecessor, without the interpolation of a single season. It did not unfrequently happen, that the individuals engaged in this commerce, finding one of their number failing from the rapacity of the Indian nation, with which he had been permitted to trade, were not so anxious to possess themselves of the privilege of trading with that nation; the governor, of course, rather than lose all advantages, would abate of his demands considerably. The new trader thus relieved of a considerable proportion of the tax borne by his predecessor, and being disposed to make a favourable impression on the minds of the Indians, to whom he was about to introduce himself, would, for the first season at least, dispose of his goods to those Indians on more moderate terms than his predecessor had done. The Indians now find that the aggressions they have practised on their former trader, so far from proving detrimental to them, has procured not only their exoneration from the payment of the last credit given them by their former trader, but that the present trader furnished them goods on better terms than they had been accustomed to receive them. Thus encouraged by the effects of this rapacious policy, it was not to be expected that they would alter their plan of operation as it respected their new trader; or that they should appreciate the character of the whites in general in any other manner, than as expressed in a prevailing sentiment on this subject, now common among several nations on the Missouri, to wit: "that the white man are like dogs, the more you beat them and plunder them, the more goods they will bring you and the cheaper they will sell them." This sentiment constitutes, at present, the rule of action among the Kanzas, Sioux, and others; and if it be not broken down by the adoption of some efficient measures, it needs not the aid of any deep calculation to determine the sum of advantages which will result to the American people from the trade of the Missouri. These aggressions on the part of the Indians, were encouraged by the pusillanimity of the engagees, who declared that they were not engaged to fight. The evils which flowed from this system of exclusive trade, were sensibly felt by the inhabitants of Louisiana. The governor, regardless of the safety of the community, sold to an individual the right of vending among the Indians every species of merchandise; thus bartering, in effect, his only efficient check on the Indians. The trader, allured by the hope of gain, neither shackled with discretion, nor consulting the public good, proceeded to supply the Indians, on whom he was dependent, with arms, ammunition, and all other articles they might require. The Indian, thus independent, acknowledging no authority but his own, will proceed without compunction of conscience or fear of punishment, to wage war on the defenceless inhabitants of the frontier, whose lives and property, in many instances, were thus sacrificed at the shrine of an inordinate thirst for wealth in their governors, which in reality occasioned all those evils. Although the governors could not have been ignorant that the misfortunes of the people were caused by the independence of the Indians, to which they were accessary, still they were the more unwilling to apply the corrective; because the very system which gave them wealth in the outset, in the course of its progress, afforded them many plausible pretexts to put their hands into the treasury of the king their master. For example; the Indians attack the frontier, kill some of the inhabitants, plunder many others, and agreeably to their custom of warfare, retire instantly to their villages with their booty. The governor informed of this transaction, promptly calls on the inhabitants to aid and assist in repelling the invasion. Accordingly a party assemble under their officers, some three or four days after the mischief had been done, and the Indians, one hundred, or one hundred and fifty miles from them, they pursue them, as they usually did, at no rapid pace, three or four days, and returned without overtaking the enemy, as they might have well known before they set out. On their return the men were dismissed, but ordered to hold themselves in readiness at a moment's warning. When at the end of some two or three months, the governor chose to consider the danger blown over, he causes receipts to be made out for the full pay of two or three months service, to which the signatures of the individuals are affixed; but as those persons were only absent from their homes ten or twelve days, all that was really paid them, did not amount to more than one fourth or one fifth of what they receipted for, and the balance of course was taken by the governor, as the reward for his faithful guardianship of the lives and property of his majesty's subjects. The Spaniards holding the entrance of the Missouri, could regulate as they thought proper the intercourse with the Indians through that channel; but from what has been said, it will be readily perceived, that their traders, shackled with the pecuniary impositions of their governors, could never become the successful rivals of the British merchants on the west side of the Mississippi, which, from its proximity to the United States, the latter could enter without the necessity of a Spanish passport, or the fear of being detected by them. The consequence was that the trade of the rivers Demoin, St. Peter's, and all the country west of the Mississippi nearly to the Missouri, was exclusively enjoyed by the British merchants. The Spanish governors, stimulated by their own sordid views, declared that the honour of his majesty was grossly compromitted by the liberty that those adventurers took in trading with the natives within his territory, without their permission, and therefore took the liberty of expending his majesty's money by equipping and manning several galleys to cruise in the channels of the Mississippi in order to intercept those traders of the St. Peter's and Demoin rivers, in their passage to and from the entrance of the Oisconsing river; but after several unsuccessful cruises, and finding the Indians so hostile to them in this quarter, that they dare not land nor remain long in the channel without being attacked, they therefore retired and gave over the project. The Indians were friendly to the British merchants, and unfriendly to the Spanish, for the plain reason that the former sold them goods at a lower rate. The Ayaways, Sacks, Foxes, and Yanktons of the river Demoin, who occasionally visited the Missouri, had it in their power to compare the rates at which the Spanish merchant in that quarter, and the British merchant on the Mississippi sold their goods; this was always much in favour of the latter; it therefore availed the Spaniards but little, when they inculcated the doctrine of their being their only legitimate fathers and friends, and that the British merchants were mere intruders, and had no other object in view but their own aggrandizement. The Indians, deaf to this doctrine, estimated the friendship of both by the rates at which they respectively sold their merchandise; and of course remained the firm friends of the British. In this situation it is not difficult for those to conceive who have felt the force of their machinations, that the British merchants would, in order to extend their own trade, endeavour to break down that of their neighbors on the Missouri. The attachments of the Indians to them, afforded a formidable weapon with which to effect their purposes, nor did they suffer it to remain unemployed. The merchants of the Dog prairie, rivers Demoin and Ayaway, stimulated the nations just mentioned to the commission of acts of rapacity on the merchants of the Missouri, nor was Mr. Cameron and others, merchants of the river St. Peter's, less active with respect to the Cissitons, Yanktons of the plains, Tetons, &amp;c. who resort the Missouri occasionally still higher up. War parties of those nations were consequently found lying in wait on the Missouri, to intercept the boats of the merchants of that river at the seasons they were expected to pass, and depredations were frequently committed, particularly by the Ayaways, who have been known in several instances to capture boats on the Missouri, in their descent to St. Louis, and compelled the crews to load themselves with heavy burdens of their best furs across the country to their towns, where they disposed of them to the British merchants. In those cases they always destroyed the periogues, and such of the peltries and furs as they could not carry off. It may be urged, that the British merchants knowing that the United States, at present, through mere courtesy, permit them to extend their trade to the west side of the Mississippi; or rather that they are mere tenants at will, and that the United States possess the means of ejecting them at pleasure; that they will, under these circumstances, be induced to act differently towards us than they did in relation to the Spanish government; but what assurance have we that this will be the effect of the mere change of governments without change of measures in relation to them. Suffer me to ask what solid grounds there are to hope that their gratitude for our tolerance and liberality on this subject, will induce them to hold a different policy towards us. None, in my opinion, unless we stimulate their gratitude by placing before their eyes the instruments of our power in the form of one or two garrisons on the upper part of the Mississippi. Even admit that the people were actuated by the most friendly regard towards the interests of the United States, and at this moment made a common cause with us to induce the Indians to demean themselves in an orderly manner towards our government, and to treat our traders of the Missouri with respect and friendship, yet, without some efficient check on the Indians, I should not think our citizens nor our traders secure; because the Indians, who have for ten years and upwards, derived advantages from practice on lessons of rapacity taught them by those traders, cannot at a moment be brought back to a state of primitive innocence, by the united persuasions of all the British traders. I hold it an axiom, incontrovertible, that it is more easy to introduce vice into all states of society than it is to eradicate it; and that this is still more strictly true, when applied to man in savage than in his civilized state. If, therefore, we wish, within some short period, to devest ourselves of the evils which flowed from the inculcation of those doctrines of vice, we must employ some more active agent than the influence of the same teachers who first introduced them. Such an agent, in my opinion, is the power of withholding their merchandise from them at pleasure; and to accomplish this, we must first provide the means of controlling the merchants. If we permit the British merchants to supply the Indians in Louisiana as formerly, the influence of our government over those Indians is lost. For the Indian in possession of his merchandise, feels himself independent of every government, and will proceed to commit the same depredations which they did when rendered independent by the Spanish system. The traders give themselves but little trouble at any time to inculcate among the Indians a respect for governments; but are usually content with proclaiming their own importance. When the British merchants give themselves trouble to speak of governments, it is but fair to presume that they will teach the natives to respect the power of their own. And at all events, we know from experience that no regard for the blood of our frontier inhabitants will influence them at any time to withhold arms and ammunitions from the Indians, provided they are to profit by furnishing them. Having now stated, as they have occurred to my mind, the several evils which flowed from that system of intercourse with the Indians, pursued by the Spanish government, I shall next endeavour to point out the defects of our own, and show its incompetency to produce the wished for reform; then, with some remarks on the Indian character, conclude by submitting for the consideration of our government, the outlines of a plan which has been dictated as well by a sentiment of philanthropy towards the aborigines of America, as a just regard to the protection of the lives and property of our citizens; and with the further view also of securing to the people of the United States, exclusively, the advantages which ought of right to accrue to them from the possession of Louisiana. We now permit the British merchants of Canada, indiscriminately with our own, to enter the Missouri, and trade with the nations in that quarter. Although the government of the U. States has not yielded the point that, as a matter of right, the British merchants have the privilege of trading in this quarter; yet from what has been said to them, they are now acting under a belief, that it will be some time before any prohibitory measures will be taken with respect to them; and are therefore making rapid strides to secure themselves in the affection of the Indians, and to break down, as soon as possible, the American adventurers, by underselling them, and thus monopolize that trade: this they will effect to an absolute certainty in the course of a few years. The old Northwest company of Canada have, within the last two years, formed a union with the Newyork company, who had previously been the only important rivals in the fur trade; this company, with the great accession of capital brought them by the Newyork company, have, with a view to the particular monopoly of the Missouri, formed a connexion with a British house in Newyork, another at New Orleans, and have sent their particular agent, by the name of Jacob Mires, to take his station at St. Louis. It may be readily conceived that the union of the Northwest and Newyork companies, who have previously extended their trade in opposition to each other, and to the exclusion of all unassociated merchants on the upper portion of the Mississippi, the waters of lake Winnipec, and the Athebaskey country, would, after their late union, have a surplus of capital and a surplus of men, which they could readily employ in some other quarter: such was the Missouri, which, from the lenity of our government, they saw was opened to them; and I do believe, could the fact be ascertained that the hope of future gain from the fur trade of that river, was one of the principal causes of the union between those two great rivals in the fur trade of North America. That this trade will be nurtured and protected by the British government, I have no doubt, for many reasons, which it strikes me could be offered, but which, not falling immediately within the purview of these observations on the fur trade of Louisiana, I shall forbear to mention. As the Missouri forms only one of four large branches of the commerce of this united, or as it is still called, the Northwest company, they will have it in their power, not only to break down all single adventurers on the Missouri, but in the course of a few years to effect the same thing with a company of merchants of the United States, who might enter into a competition with them in this single branch of their trade. Nor is it probable that our merchants, knowing this fact, will form a company for the purpose of carrying on this trade, while they see the Northwest company permitted by our government to trade on the Missouri, and on the west side of the Mississippi: therefore, the Northwest company, on the present plan, having driven the adventurers of small capitals from these portions of our territory, will most probably never afterwards have a rival in any company of our own merchants. By their continuance they will acquire strength, and having secured the wished for monopoly, they will then trade with the Indians on their own terms; and being possessed, of the trade, both on the Mississippi and Missouri, they can make the price of their goods in both quarters similar, and though they may be excessively high, yet being the same they will run no risk of disaffecting the Indians by a comparison of the prices at which they receive their goods at those places. If then it appears, that the longer we extend the privilege to the Northwest company of continuing their trade within our territory, the difficulty of excluding them will increase: can we begin the work of exclusion too soon ? For my own part I see not the necessity to admit, that our own merchants are not at this moment competent to supply the Indians of the Missouri with such quantities of goods as will, at least in the acceptation of the Indians themselves, be deemed satisfactory and sufficient for their necessities. All their ideas relative to their necessities are only comparative, and may be tested by a scale of the quantities they have been in the habit of receiving. Such a scale I transmitted to the government from fort Mandan. From a regard to the happiness of the Indians, it would give me much pleasure to see this scale liberally increased; yet I am clearly of opinion, that this effect should be caused by the regular progression of the trade of our own merchants, under the patronage and protection of our own government. This will afford additional security to the tranquillity of our much extended frontier, while it will give wealth to our merchants. We know that the change of government in Louisiana, from Spain to that of the United States, has withdrawn no part of that capital formerly employed in the trade of the Missouri; the same persons still remain, and continue to prosecute their trade. To these there has been an accession of several enterprising American merchants, and several others since my return have signified their intention to embark in that trade, within the present year; and the whole of those merchants are now unembarrassed by the exactions of Spanish governors. Under those circumstances is it fair for us to presume that the Indians are not now supplied by our own merchants, with quite as large an amount in merchandise as they had been formerly accustomed to receive? Should the quantity thus supplied not fully meet our wishes on liberal views, towards the Indians, is it not sounder policy to wait the certain progress of our own trade, than in order to supply this momentary deficiency, to admit the aid of the Northwest company, at the expense of the total loss of that trade; thereby giving them a carte blanch on which to write in future their own terms of traffic with the Indians, and thus throwing them into their hands, permit them to be formed into a rod of iron, with which, for Great Britain, to scourge our frontier at pleasure. If the British merchants were prohibited from trading in upper Louisiana, the American merchants, with the aid of the profits arising from the trade of the lower portion of the Missouri, and the western branches of the Mississippi, would be enabled most probably to become the successful rivals of the Northwest company in the more distant parts of the continent; to which we might look, in such case, with a well-founded hope of enjoying great advantages from the fur trade; but if this prohibition does not shortly take place, I will venture to predict that no such attempts will ever be made, and, consequently, that we shall for several generations be taxed with the defence of a country, which to us would be no more than a barren waste. About the beginning of August last, two of the wintering partners of the Northwest company, visited the Mandan and Minnetarees villages on the Missouri, and fixed on a scite for a fortified establishment. This project once carried into effect, we have no right to hope for the trade of the upper portion of the Missouri, until our government shall think proper to dislodge them. This season there has been sent up the Missouri, for the Indian trade, more than treble the quantity of merchandise that has ever been previously embarked in that trade at any one period. Of this quantity, as far as I could judge from the best information I could collect, two-thirds was the property of British merchants, and directly or indirectly that of the Northwest company. Not any of this merchandise was destined for a higher point on the Missouri than the mouth of the Vermillion river, or the neighbourhood of the Yanktons of the river Demoin; of course, there will be a greater excess of goods beyond what the Indians can purchase, unless they sell at one-third their customary price, which the American merchant certainly cannot do without sacrificing his capital. On my return this fall, I met on the Missouri an American merchant by the name of Robert M'Clellan, formerly a distinguished partisan in the army under general Wayne: in a conversation with this gentleman, I learned that during the last winter, in his trade with the Mahas, he had a competitor by the name of Joseph La Croix (believed to be employed by the Northwest company, but now is an avowed British merchant)— that the prices at which La Croix sold his goods, compelled him to reduce the rates of his own goods so much as to cause him to sink upwards of two thousand dollars of his capital, in the course of his trade, that season; but that as he had embarked in this trade for two years past, and had formed a favourable acquaintance with the Mahas and others, he should still continue it a few seasons more, even at a loss of his time and capital, in the hope that government seeing the error would correct it, and that he might then regain his losses, from the circumstance of his general acquaintance with the Indians. I also met in my way to St. Louis, another merchant, by the same name, a captain M'Clellan, formerly of the United States' corps of artillerists. This gentlemen informed me that he was connected with one of the principal houses in Baltimore, which I do not how recollect, but can readily ascertain the name and standing of the firm, if it is considered of any importance; he said he had brought with him a small but well assorted adventure, calculated for the Indian trade, by way of experiment; that the majority of his goods were of the fine high-priced kind, calculated for the trade with the Spanish province of New Mexico, which he intended to carry on within the territory of the United States, near the border of that province; that connected with this object, the house with which he was concerned was ready to embark largely in the fur trade of the Missouri, provided it should appear to him to offer advantages to them. That since he had arrived in Louisiana, which was last autumn, he had endeavoured to inform himself of the state of this trade, and that from his inquiries, he had been so fully impressed with the disadvantages it laboured under from the free admission of the British merchants, he had written to his house in Baltimore, advising that they should not embark in this trade, unless these merchants were prohibited from entering the river. I have mentioned these two as cases in point, and which have fallen immediately under my own observation: the first shows the disadvantages under which the trade of our own merchants is now actually labouring; and the second, that no other merchants will probably engage in this trade, while the British fur traders are permitted by our government to continue their traffic in Upper Louisiana. With this view of the subject, it is submitted to the government, with whom it alone rests to decide whether the admission or non-admission of those merchants is at this moment most expedient. The custom of giving credits to the Indians, which grew out of the Spanish system, still exists, and agreeably to our present plan of intercourse with these people, is likely to produce more pernicious consequences than it did formerly. The Indians of the Missouri, who have been in the habit of considering these credits rather as a present, or the price of their permission for the trader to depart in peace, still continue to view it in the same light, and will therefore give up their expectations on that point with some reluctance; nor can the merchants well refuse to acquiesce, while they are compelled to be absent from the nations with which they trade five or six months in the year. The Indians are yet too vicious to permit them in safety to leave goods at their trading houses, during their absence, in the care of one or two persons; the merchant, therefore, would rather suffer the loss by giving the credit, than incur the expense of a competent guard, or doubling the quantity of his engagees, for it requires as many men to take the peltries and furs to market as it does to bring the goods to the trading establishment, and the number usually employed are not found at any time, more than sufficient to give a tolerable security against the Indians. I presume that it will not be denied, that it is our best policy, and will be our practice to admit, under the restrictions of our laws on this subject, a fair competition among all our merchants in the Indian trade. This being the case then, it will happen, as it has already happened, that one merchant having trade with any nation, at the usual season gives them a credit and departs: a second knowing that such advance has been made, hurries his outfit and arrives at that nation, perhaps a month earlier in the fall than the merchant who had made this advance to the Indians: he immediately assembles the nation and offers his goods in exchange for their redskin hunt; the good faith of the Indians, with respect to the absent merchant, will not bind them to refuse; an exchange, of course, takes place; and when the merchant to whom they are indebted arrives, they have no peltry, either to barter or to pay him for the goods which they have already received: the consequences are, that the merchant who has sustained the loss becomes frantic; he abuses the Indians, bestows on them the epithets of liars and dogs, and says a thousand things only calculated to sour their minds, and disaffect them to the whites: the rival trader he accuses of having robbed him of his credits (for they never give this species of artifice among themselves a milder term) and calls him many opprobrious names; a combat frequently ensues, in which the principals are not only the actors, for their men will, of course, sympathise with their respective employers. The Indians are the spectators of those riotous transactions, which are well calculated to give them a contempt for the character of the whites, and to inspire them with a belief of the importance of their peltries and furs. The British traders have even gone further in the northwest, and even offered bribes to induce the Indians to destroy each other; nor have I any reason to doubt but what the same thing will happen on the Missouri, unless some disinterested person, armed with authority by government, be placed in such a situation as will enable him to prevent such controversies. I look to this custom of extending credits to the Indians, as one of the great causes of all those individual contentions, which will most probably arise in the course of this trade, as well between the Indians and whites, as between the whites themselves; and that our agents and officers will be always harrassed with settling these disputes, which they never can do in such a manner as to restore a perfect good understanding between the parties. I think it would be best in the outset, for the government to let it be understood by the merchants, that if they think proper to extend credits to the Indians, it shall be at their own risk, dependent on the good faith of the Indians for voluntary payment; that the failure of the Indians to comply with their contracts, shall not be considered any justification for their maltreatment of holding abusive language to them, and that no assistance shall be given them in any shape by the public functionaries to aid them in collecting their credits. If the government interfere in behalf of the traders by any regulation, then it will be the interest of every trader individually to get the Indians indebted to him, and to keep them so in order to secure in future their peltries and furs exclusively to himself. Thus, the Indians would be compelled to exchange without choice of either goods or their prices, and the government would have pledged itself to make the Indians pay for goods, of which they cannot regulate the prices. I presume the government will not undertake to regulate the merchant in this respect by law. The difficulties which have arisen, and which must arise under existing circumstances, may be readily corrected by establishing a few posts, where there shall be a sufficient guard to protect the property of the merchants in their absence, though it may be left with only a single clerk: to those common marts, all traders and Indians should be compelled to resort for the purposes of traffic. The plan proposed guards against all difficulties, and provides for a fair exchange, without the necessity of credit: when the Indian appears with his peltry and fur, the competition between the merchants will always insure him his goods on the lowest possible terms, and the exchange taking place at once, there can be no cause of controversy between the Indian and the merchant, and no fear of loss on the part of the latter, unless he is disposed to make a voluntary sacrifice, through a spirit of competition with others, by selling his goods at an under value. Some of the stipulations contained in the licenses usually granted our Indian traders, are totally incompatible with the local situations, and existing customs and habits of almost all the Indian nations in Upper Louisiana. I allude more particularly to that clause in the license, which compels them to trade at Indian towns only. It will be seen by referrence to my statistical view of the Indian nations of Upper Louisiana, that the great body of those people are roving bands, who have no villages, or stationary residence. The next principal division of them, embracing the Panias, Ottoes, Kanzas, &amp;c. have not their villages on the Missouri, and they even pass the greater portion of the year at a distance from their villages, in the same roving manner. The third, and only portion of those Indians, who can with propriety be considered as possessed of such stationary villages as seems to have been contemplated by this clause of the license, is confined to the Ayaways, Sioux, and Foxes of the Mississippi, and the Ricaras, Mandans, Minnetarees, and Ahwahaways of the Missouri. The consequence is, that until some further provision be made, that all the traders who have intercourse with any nations except those of the last class, will form their establishments at the several points on the Missouri, where it will be most convenient to meet the several nations with whom they wish to carry on commerce. This is their practice at the present moment, and their houses are scattered on various parts of the Missouri. In this detached situation, it cannot be expected that they will comply with any of the stipulations of their licenses. The superintendant of St. Louis, distant eight hundred or a thousand miles, cannot learn whether they have forfeited the penalty of their licenses or not: they may, therefore, vend ardent spirits, compromit the government, or the character of the whites, in the estimation of the Indians, or practice any other crimes in relation to those people, without the fear of detection or punishment. The government cannot with propriety, say to those traders, that they shall trade at villages, when in reality they do not exist; nor can they for a moment, I presume, think of incurring the expense of sending an Indian agent with each trader, to see that he commit no breach the stipulations of his license. These traders must of course be brought together, at some general points, where it will be convenient for several nations to trade with them, and where they can be placed under the eye of an Indian agent, whose duty it should be to see that they comply with the regulations laid down for their government. There are crimes which may be committed without a breach of our present laws, and which make it necessary that some further restrictions than those contained in the present licenses of our traders, should either be added under penalties in those licenses, or punished by way of a discretionary power, lodged in the superintendent, extending to the exclusion of such individuals from the Indian trade. Of this description I shall here enumerate three: First, That of holding conversation with the Indians, tending to bring our government into disrepute among them, and to alienate their affections from the same. Second, That of practising any means to induce the Indians to maltreat or plunder other merchants. Third, That of stimulating or exciting by bribes or otherwise, any nations or bands of Indians, to wage war against other nations or bands; or against the citizens of the United States, or against citizens or subjects of any power at peace with the same. These appear to me to be crimes fraught with more real evil to the community, and to the Indians themselves, than vending ardent spirits, or visiting their hunting camps for the purpose of trade; yet there are no powers vested in the superintendents, or agents of the United States, to prevent their repeated commission; nor restrictions or fines imposed by our laws, to punish such offences. It is well known to me that we have several persons engaged in the trade of the Missouri, who have, within the last three years, been adopted as citizens of the United States, and who are now hostile to our government. It is not reasonable to expect, that such persons will act with good faith towards us. Hence, the necessity of assigning metes and bounds to their transactions among the Indians. On my way to St. Louis, last fall, I received satisfactory evidence that a Mr. Robideau, an inhabitant of St. Louis, had, the preceding winter, during his intercourse with the Ottoes and Missouris, been guilty of the most flagrant breaches of the first of those misdemeanors above mentioned. On my arrival at St. Louis, I reported the case to Mr. Broom, the acting superintendent, and recommended his prohibiting that person from the trade of the Missouri, unless he would give satisfactory assurances of a disposition to hold a different language to the Indians. Mr. Broom informed me, that the laws and regulations of the United States on this subject, gave him no such powers; and Mr. Robideau and sons still prosecute their trade. The uncontrolled liberty which our citizens take of hunting on Indian lands, has always been a source of serious difficulty, on every part of our frontier, and is evidently destined to become quite as much so in upper Louisiana, unless it be restrained and limited within consistent bounds. When the Indians have been taught, by commerce, duly to appreciate the furs and peltries of their country, they feel excessive chagrin at seeing the whites, by their superior skill in hunting, fast diminishing those productions, to which they have been accustomed to look as the only means of acquiring merchandise; and nine-tenths of the causes of war are attributable to this practice. The Indians, although well disposed to maintain a peace on any other terms, I am convinced will never yield this point; nor do I consider it as of any importance to us that they should; for with what consistency of precept and practice can we say to the Indians, whom we wish to civilize, that agriculture and the arts are more productive of ease, wealth, and comfort, than the occupation of hunting, while they see distributed over their forests a number of white men, engaged in the very occupation which our doctrine would teach them to abandon. Under such circumstances, it cannot be considered irrational in the Indians, to conclude, that our recommendations to agriculture are interested, and flow from a wish on our part to derive the whole emolument arising from the peltries and furs of their country, by taking them to ourselves. These observations, however, are intended to apply only to such Indian nations as have had, and still maintain a commercial intercourse with the whites: such we may say are those inhabiting the western branches of the Mississippi, the eastern branches of the Missouri, and near the main body of the latter, as far up as the Mandans and Minnetarees. Here it is, therefore, that it appears to me expedient we should draw a line; and temporarily change our policy. I presume it is not less the wish of our government, that the Indians on the extreme branches of the Missouri to the west, and within the Rocky mountains, should obtain supplies of merchandise equally with those more immediately in their vicinity. To effect this, the government must either become the merchant themselves, or present no obstacles to their citizens, which may prevent their becoming so with those distant nations; but as the former cannot be adopted (though I really think it would be best for a time) then it becomes the more necessary to encourage the latter. Policy further dictates such encouragement being given, in order to contravene the machinations preparing by the Northwest company for practice in that quarter. If the hunters are not permitted in those distant regions, the merchants will not be at the expense of transporting their merchandise thither, when they know that the natives do not possess the art of taking the furs of their country. The use of the trap, by which those furs are taken, is an art which must be learned before it can be practised to advantage. If the American merchant does not adventure, the field is at once abandoned to the Northwest company, who will permit the hunter to go, and the merchant will most probably be with him in the outset; the abundance of rich furs in that country, hold out sufficient inducement for them to lose no time in pressing forward their adventures. Thus those distant Indians will soon be supplied with merchandise; and while they are taught the art of taking the furs of their country, they will learn the value, and until they have learnt its value, we shall run no risk of displeasing them by taking it. When the period shall arrive that the distant nations shall have learned the art of taking their furs, and know how to appreciate its value, then the hunter becomes no longer absolutely necessary to the merchant, and may be withdrawn; but in the outset, he seems to form a very necessary link in that chain which is to unite these nations and ourselves in a state of commercial intercourse. The liberty to our merchants of hunting, for the purpose of procuring food, in ascending and descending the navigable water-courses, as well as while stationary at their commercial posts, is a privilege which should not be denied them; but as the unlimited extent of such a privilege would produce much evil, it should certainly be looked on as a subject of primary importance: it should, therefore, enter into all those compacts which we may think proper to form with the Indians in that country, and be so shaped as to leave them no solid grounds of discontent. The time to which licenses shall extend. A view of the Indian character, so far as it is necessary it should be known, for the purposes of governing them, or maintaining a friendly commercial intercourse with them, may be comprised within the limits of a few general remarks. The love of gain is the Indians' ruling passion, and the fear of punishment must form the corrective; to this passion we are to ascribe their inordinate thirst for the possession of merchandise, their unwillingness to accede to any terms, or enter into any stipulations, except such as appear to promise them commercial advantages, and the want of good faith, which they always evince by not complying with any regulations, which in practice do not produce to them those expected or promised advantages. The native justice of the Indian mind, will always give way to his impatience for the possession of the goods of the defenceless merchant, and he will plunder him, unless prevented by the fear of punishment; nor can punishment assume a more terrific shape to them, than that of withholding every description of merchandise from them. This species of punishment, while it is one of the most efficient in governing the Indians, is certainly the most humane, as it enforces a compliance with our will, without the necessity of bloodshed. But in order to compass the exercise of this weapon, our government must first provide the means of controlling their traders. No government will be respected by the Indians, until they are made to feel the effects of its power, or see it practised on others: and the surest guarantee of savage fidelity to any government, is a thorough conviction in their minds, that they do possess the power of punishing promptly, every act of aggresion, which they may commit on the persons or property of their citizens. If both traders and Indians throughout Upper Louisiana, were compelled to resort to regulated commercial posts, then the trader would be less liable to be pillaged, and the Indians deterred from practising aggresion; for when the Indians once become convinced, that in consequence of their having practised violence upon the persons or property of the traders, that they have been cut off from all intercourse with those posts, and that they cannot resort to any other places to obtain merchandise, then they will make any sacrifice to regain the privilege they had previously enjoyed; and I am confident, that in order to regain our favour in such cases, they would sacrifice any individual who may be the object of our displeasure, even should he be their favorite chief; for their thirst of merchandise is paramount to every other consideration; and the leading individuals among them, well knowing this trait in the character of their own people, will not venture to encourage or excite aggresions on the whites, when they know they are themselves to become the victims of its consequences. But if, on the other hand, these commercial establishments are not general, and we suffer detached and insulated merchants, either British or American, to exercise their own discretion, in setting down where they may think proper, on the western branches of the Mississippi, for the purposes of trading with the Indians; then, although these commercial establishments may be so extended as to embrace the Missouri, quite to the Mandans, still they will lose a great part of their effects; because the roving bands of Tetons, and the most dissolute of the Siouxs being denied the permission to trade on the Missouri at any rate, would resort to those establishments on the Mississippi, and thus become independent of the trade of the Missouri, as they have hitherto been. To correct this, we have three alternatives: First, to establish two commercial posts in this quarter. Secondly, to prohibit all intercourse with the Sisitons, and other bands of Siouxs, on the river St. Peter's and the Raven's-wing river, informing those Indians that such prohibition has been the consequence of the malconduct of the Tetons, and thus leave it to them to correct them; or, Thirdly, to make an appeal to arms in order to correct the Tetons ourselves. Impressed with a belief unalloyed with doubts, that the ardent wish of our government has ever been to conciliate the esteem, and secure the friendship of all the savage nations within their territory, by the exercise of every consistent and pacific measure in their power, applying those of coertion only in the last resort, I here proceed with a due deference to their better judgment, to develop a scheme which has suggested itself to my mind, as the most expedient that I can devise for the successful consummation of their philanthropic views towards those wretched people of America, as well as to secure to the citizens of the United States, all those advantages, which ought of right exclusively to accrue to them, from the possession of Upper Louisiana. The situation of the Indian trade on the Missouri and its waters, while under the Spanish government. The exclusive permission to trade with nations. The giving by those exclusions, the right to individuals to furnish supplies, which rendered the Indians independent of the government. The times of sending goods to the Indians, and of returning to St. Louis—the necessity of giving credits; therefore the disadvantages of. The evils which grew out of the method pursued by the Spaniards, as well to themselves as to the Indians. The independence of individuals of their own government. The dependence of the Indians on those individuals, and their consequent contempt for the government, and for all other citizens whom they plundered and murdered at pleasure. The present rapacity of the Indians, owing to this cause, aided also by the system of giving credits to the Indians, which caused contentions among the traders, which terminated by giving the Indians a contempt for the character of the whites. The permission to persons to hunt on Indian lands, productive of many evils, the most frequent causes of war, hostile to the views of civilizing, and of governing the Indians. The first principle of governing the Indians is to govern the whites— the impossibility of doing this without establishments, and some guards at those posts. The Sisitons may be made a check on the Tetons by withholding their trade on the Mississippi. Having stated the several evils which flowed from the Spanish system, I now state the Indian character, the evils which still exist, and what they will probably terminate in, if not redressed—the plan recommended to be pursued and the benefits which may be expected to result therefrom, conclude thus, it may be pretty confidently believed that it is not competent to produce the wished for reform among the Indians. Hunters permitted in the Indian country pernicious—frequent cause of war between us. Some of the stipulations of the licenses granted the traders, in application to the state of the Indians on the Missouri, of course not attended to. The incompetency of the Indian agents to see that any of the stipulations are complied with. Whiskey, or ardent spirits may, therefore, be introduced, and other corruptions practised without our knowledge. There is not at present allowed by law to the superintendant of Indian affairs, any discretionary powers, by which he can pro hibit our newly acquired citizens of Louisiana, who may be disaffected to our government, from trading with the Indians: the law says, that any citizen of the United States, who can give sufficient security for the sum of five hundred dollars, for the faithful compliance with the stipulation of his license, shall be permitted so trade. An instance has happened in Mr. Robideau, &amp;c. [Article incomplete.

Dear Sir: I am sorry to inform you of the death of Governor Meriwether Lewis, which took place on the Morning of the 11th instance at the House of a Mr. Grender about seventy five miles from here on the Natchez Road. it is reported that he arrived there the evening before—the man of the house was from home—the governor went to bed in a room alone. about three o'clock the woman of the house who slept in a house near the other heard two pistols fire—she awoke the servants, and they rushed into the Room, and found the unfortunate Governor weltering in his blood; he had shot himself in the head and just below his breast—he died in about three hours; in a few hours Major Neeley Agent to the Chickasaws came up, who had remained behind to hunt two horses which they had lost the night before—he had him intered and took into his care &amp; possession two trunks said to contain his valuable papers, amongst which is said to be his Journal to the pacific ocean, &amp; perhaps some vouchers which he was taking on for settlement—Majr Neeley has his pistols, Rifle, Watch, &amp;c—his servant John Parney will proceed on early in the morning with letters to Mr. Jefferson from Majr Neeley communicating to him the particulars of the unhappy affair.

Clark LXXVIII AN EDITORIAL COMMENT [From the Monthly Anthology and Boston Review (April, 1810), viii, p. 283.] The publick are likely to be for a long time without the expected account of the journey of Capt. Lewis to the Pacifick ocean, which has excited more curiosity in Europe than it has in this country. It has been said, that the indifference of the publick, and the very small number of subscribers it has obtained, operated strongly on his mind, and was one of the causes that led to his unfortunate death. His papers are said to have been left in a very confused imperfect state; but such as they were, they have been sent to his patron, Mr. Jefferson, who it is presumed will employ his leisure hours in preparing them for the press. LXXIX JEFFERSON TO BARON VON HUMBOLDT1 1 Friedrich Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt, the celebrated German geographer and scientist, whose extensive travels is South America and Mexico were so widely useful.—Ed. [Extract—Ford, ix, p. 433.] [Dec. 6, 1813.] You will find it inconceivable that Lewis's journey to the Pacific should not yet have appeared; nor is it in my power to tell you the reason. The measures taken by his surviving companion, Clarke, for the publication, have not answered our wishes in point of despatch. I think, however, from what I have heard, that the mere journal will be out within a few weeks in two volumes 8vo. These I will take care to send you with the tobacco seed you desired, if it be possible for them to escape the thousand ships of our enemies spread over the ocean. The botanical and zoological discoveries of Lewis will probably experience greater delay, and become known to the world through other channels before that volume will be ready. The Atlas, I believe, waits on the leisure of the engraver.

[Extract—Ford, ix, p. 439.] [Dec. 8, 1813.] Lewis's journey across our continent to the Pacific has added a number of new plants to our former stock. Some of them are curious, some ornamental, some useful, and some may by culture be made acceptable to our tables. I have growing, which I destine for you, a very handsome little shrub of the size of a currant bush. Its beauty consists in a great produce of berries of the size of currants, and literally as white as snow, which remain on the bush through the winter, after its leaves have fallen, and make it an object as singular as it is beautiful. We call it the snow-berry bush, no botanical name being yet given to it, but I do not know why we might not call it Chionicoccos, or Kallicoccos. All Lewis's plants are growing in the garden of Mr. McMahon, a gardener of Philadelphia, to whom I consigned them, and from whom I shall have great pleasure, when peace is restored, in ordering for you any of these or of our other indigenous plants.

[Original MS. in possession of American Philosophical Society. We follow a transcript furnished by Secretary I. Minis Hays.] Poplar Forest, April 26, 16. Dear Sir: Your favor of Mar. 29. was recieved just as I was setting out for this place. I brought it with me to be answered hence. Since you are so kind as to interest yourself for Capt. Lewis's papers, I will give you a full statement of them. 1.ten or twelve such pocket volumes, Morocco bound, as that you describe, in which, in his own hand writing, he had journalised all occurrences, day by day, as he travelled. they were small 8vos. and opened at the end for more convenient writing. every one had been put into a separate tin case, cemented to prevent injury from wet. but on his return the cases, I presume, had been taken from them, as he delivered me the books uncased. there were in them the figures of some animals drawn with the pen while on his journey. the gentlemen who published his travels must have had these Ms. volumes, and perhaps now have them, or can give some account of them. 2.Descriptions of animals and plants. I do not recollect whether there was such a book or collection of papers, distinct from his journal; altho' I am inclined to think there was one: because his travels as published, do not contain all the new animals of which he had either descriptions or specimens. mr Peale, I think, must know something of this, as he drew figures of some of the animals for engraving, and some were actually engraved. perhaps Conrad, his bookseller, who was to have published the work, can give an account of these. 3.Vocabularies. I had myself made a collection of about 40 vocabularies of the Indians on this side the Missisipi, and Capt. Lewis was instructed to take those of every tribe beyond, which he possibly could: the intention was to publish the whole, and leave the world to search for affinities between these and the languages of Europe and Asia. he was furnished with a number of printed vocabularies of the same words and form I had used, with blank spaces for the Indian words. he was very attentive to this instruction, never missing an opportunity of taking a vocabulary. after his return, he asked me if I should have any objection to the printing his separately, as mine were not yet arranged as I intended. I assured him I had not the least; and I am certain he contemplated their publication. but whether he had put the papers out of his own hand or not, I do not know. I imagine he had not: and it is probable that Doctr. Barton, who was particularly curious on this subject, and published on it occasionally, would willingly recieve and take care of these papers after Capt Lewis's death, and that they are now among his papers. 4.his observations of longitude and latitude. he was instructed to send these to the war-office, that measures might be taken to have the calculations made. whether he delivered them to the war-office, or to Dr. Patterson, I do not know; but I think he communicated with Dr. Patterson concerning them. these are all-important: because altho', having with him the Nautical almanacs, he could &amp; did calculate some of his latitudes, yet the longitudes were taken merely from estimates by the log-line, time and course. So that it is only as to latitudes that his map may be considered as tolerably correct; not as to its longitudes. 5.his Map. this was drawn on sheets of paper, not put together, but so marked that they could be joined together with the utmost accuracy; not as one great square map, but ramifying with the courses of the rivers. the scale was very large, and the sheets numerous, but in perfect preservation. this was to await publication, until corrected by the calculations of longitude and latitude. I examined these sheets myself minutely, as spread on a floor, and the originals must be in existence, as the Map published with his travels must have been taken from them. These constitute the whole. they are the property of the government, the fruits of the expedition undertaken at such expence of money and risk of valuable lives. they contain exactly the whole of the information which it was our object to obtain for the benefit of our own country and of the world. but we were willing to give to Lewis and Clarke whatever pecuniary benefits might be derived from the publication, and therefore left the papers in their hands, taking for granted that their interests would produce a speedy publication, which would be better if done under their direction. but the death of Capt. Lewis, the distance and occupations of General Clarke, and the bankruptcy of their bookseller, have retarded the publication, and rendered necessary that the government should attend to the reclamation &amp; security of the papers. their recovery is now become an imperious duty. their safest deposit as fast as they can be collected, will be the Philosophical Society, who no doubt will be so kind as to receive and preserve them, subject to the orders of government; and their publication, once effected in any way, the originals will probably be left in the same deposit. as soon as I can learn their present situation, I will lay the matter before the government to take such order as they think proper. As to any claims of individuals to these papers, it is to be observed that, as being the property of the public, we are certain neither Lewis nor Clarke would undertake to convey away the right to them, and that they could not convey them, had they been capable of intending it. yet no interest of that kind is meant to be disturbed, if the individual can give satisfactory assurance that he will promptly &amp; properly publish them. otherwise they must be restored to the government; &amp; the claimant left to settle with those on whom he has any claim. my interference will, I trust, be excused, not only from the portion which every citizen has in whatever is public, but from the peculiar part I have had in the design and execution of this expedition. To you, my friend, apology is due for involving you in the trouble of this inquiry. it must be found in the interest you take in whatever belongs to science, and in your own kind offers to me of aid in this research. be assured always of my affectionate friendship and respect. Th: Jefferson LXXXII CLARK TO JEFFERSON [Original MS. in possession of American Philosophical Society. We follow a transcript furnished by Secretary Hays.] Saint–Louis October 10th. 1816 Dear Sir: I had the honor of receiving your letter of the 8th.. of Septr., by the Mail, and with much pleasure comply with the contents. It has ever been my wish, that the Travelling journal of Gove. Lewis &amp; myself, the astronomical Observations, the Geographical Charts, the Indian Vocabularies and all Subjects of Natural history should be given to the public in the best possible manner, and agreeably to the Original intention—. and for that purpose I have been twice to phila.. and have used all the means which have been in my power without the success contemplated. The Naritive has been published, but I have not been so fortunate as to precure a single volume, as yet. after the death of my friend Gove Lewis, finding the arrangements he had made relative to the publication had failed, and the greater part of the astronomical observations with the plates and drawings which he had directed to be made, were not to [be] found. a new contract was made with Messrs Bradford &amp; Inskep, to print &amp; publish that part, and the cientific part also, which was to have been (by contract) prepared in Six months from the time by Doctr. Barton. in their arrangements I have been also disappointed. Since the failure of Bradford &amp; Inskep, and the death of Doctr. Barton my agent Mr. Nicholas Biddle has been requested to collect all the Books, papers, specimens &amp;c. previously to my making the last arrangement, I had conversation with the then Secretary of War on the subject of publishing Lewis &amp; Clarks Journal Map &amp;c., he thought it important, but could promis no assistance at that time. It is with pleasure that I inclose you an Order on my friend Mr. Biddle for the papers in his possession, relating to the Astronomical Observations, the Geographical Charts, the Indian Vocabularies, and other papers not comprehended in the journal of Lewis &amp; Clarks Travels laterly published, and the Specimins which were left in the possession of Doctr. Barton—also the Traveling pocket Journals. From the mortification of not haveing succeeded in giving to the world all the results of that expedition, I feel Relief &amp; greatitude for the interest which you are willing to take, in effecting what has not been in my power to accomplish. Some time ago, I requested Mr. Biddle to deliver to Mrs.. Markes's Order, the half of all the Books he may have received in my behalf. The Map from which the plate was made, is in my possession at this place; it is rough and has not been corrected and comprehends the Connection of Country from Lat. 34?. to 50? N. If you think it adviseable? I will make a new Map of the same size of the one I have, corrected by such materials as I have precured since the last was made; otherwise I shall take the liberty of sending the one I have to you. The Missouri River on which there is such emence tracts of fine country calculated for rich &amp; populous settlements, and watering an emence space in which there is much welth in furs, Peltres, minerals, dies &amp;c. is tolerably well understood but not in sufficient use. The Lands on the lower portion of that river is settling fast, the middle portion (or as high up as the Big Bend or White river) is Crowded with Traders, but the upper and richer portion has had no American Citizen since the falur of the Missouri Co. 1811 and I am under great apprehentions that the British will take possession of that rich Tract by the way of Assinniboin &amp; Saskassion rivers. as they have done at the mouth of Columbia, and on Lewis &amp; Clark's Rivers—: If a large and over bearing company cannot be formed of American Citizens with sufficient Capital to keep them out: I think such a Co. could be formed with some Countrimen and a little aid from the government. The present population of this Territory would most probably amount to about 35 or 40.000 Soles since peace was made with the Indians on the Mississippi the emogration has been emence bending their course to the Missouri principally. Landed property has risen which has inrichened the old inhabitants and reconsiled them to our government much more than formerly. In the exurcise of Govt.. of this Territory I have succeeded in the worst of times with more approbation than I had expected. laterly a small and disappointed party has Sprung up deturmined to vex &amp; Teaze the execution. I am happy to have it in my power to say to you that I succeed in keeping the Indians of this Territory (exceept those high up the Mississippi, in peace, The Torments of this frontier was produced by the Traders East of the Missippi &amp; high up that River.

[Original MS. in possession of American Philosophical Society. We follow a transcript furnished by Secretary Hays.] Monticello June 28. 17. Dear Sir: Your two letters of the 2d. and 18th. have been recieved in due time. mine of the 7th. had partly anticipated your requests of the 2d. I thank you for the advance to Mr. Birard, and now inclose 70. D. to cover it in bills of the Virginia bank which I understand pass with you. the duplicates you advise for Cathalan &amp; Debures, I had sent thro' the Secretary of State's office. I shall be glad to subscribe for the volume of transactions now in the press, and ask the favor of you to have my name placed on the subscription paper. but I have nothing to offer for insertion in it. in earlier life when I should from inclination have devoted myself to pursuits analogous to those of our society, my time was all engrossed by public duties, and now without either books or memory I could offer nothing which would do credit either to the society or myself. you enquire for the Indian vocabularies of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke. all their papers are at present under a kind of embargo. they consist of 1. Lewis', Ms. pocket journals of the journey. 2. his Indian Vocabularies. 3. his astronomical observations, particularly for the longitudes. 4. his map, and drawings. a part of these papers were deposited with Dr. Barton; some with Mr Biddle, others I know not where. of the pocket journals Mr. Correa got 4. out of 11. or 12. from Mr?s Barton &amp; sent them to me. he informed me that Mr? Biddle would not think himself authorised to deliver the portion of the papers he recieved from Genl. Clarke without his order; whereon I wrote to Genl. Clarke, &amp; recieved his order for the whole some time ago. but I have held it up until a Secretary at War was is appointed, that office having some rights to these papers. as soon as that appointment is made, I shall endeavor to collect the whole, to deposite the Ms. journals &amp; Vocabularies with the Philosophical Society, adding a collection of some vocabularies made by myself, and to get the Secy. at War to employ some person to whom I may deliver the astronomical papers for calculation, and the geographical ones for the correct execution of a map; for in that published with his journal, altho' the latitudes may be correct, the longitudes cannot be. I wait therefore only for this appointment to begin my endeavors for a compleat collection and destribution of these papers. the historical committee were so kind as to send me Colo. Byrd's MS. journal of the survey of the boundary between N. Carolina &amp; Virginia. I am in negociation with the family to obtain his private journal of the same expedition containing much matter not in the public one, equally curious, and equally worthy of being printed. as soon as I obtain a difinitive answer I shall return them theirs, and the other also if I can obtain leave. Accept my friendly and respectful salutations. Th: Jefferson. LXXXIV JEFFERSON TO PETER S. DUPONCEAU1 1 Peter Stephen Duponceau was a French jurist and linguist, who came to the United States to assist in the Revolutionary War, and was a member of Stephen's staff. Becoming a citizen of the United States in 1781, he settled in Philadelphia, and studied law. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society, at one time being its corresponding secretary. Under the auspices of this Society he published a work on the structure of Indian languages.—Ed. [Original MS. in possession of American Philosophical Society. We follow a transcript furnished by Secretary Hays.] Monticello. Nov. 7. 17 Dear Sir: a part of the information of which the expedition of Lewis and Clarke was the object has been communicated to the world by the publication of their journal; but much &amp; valuable matter remains yet uncommunicated. the correction of the longitudes of their map is essential to it's value; to which purpose their observations of the lunar distances are to be calculated &amp; applied. the new subjects they discovred in the vegetable, animal &amp; mineral departments are to be digested and made known. the numerous vocabularies they obtained of the Indian languages are to be collated and published. altho' the whole expense of the expedition was furnished by the public, and the information to be derived from it was theirs also, yet on the return of Messrs. Lewis &amp; Clarke the government thought it just to leave to them any pecuniary benefit which might result from a publication of the papers, and supposed indeed that this would secure the best form of publication. but the property in these papers still remained in the government for the benefit of their constituents. with the measures taken by Govr. Lewis for their publication, I was never acquainted. after his death Govr. Clarke put them, in the first instance, into the hands of the late Dr. Barton, from whom some of them passed to mr? Biddle, and some again, I believe, from him to mr?. Allen. while the Ms. books of journals were in the hands of Dr. Barton, I wrote to him on behalf of Govr. Lewis's family requesting earnestly, that, as soon as these should be published, the originals might be returned, as the family wished to have them preserved. he promised in his answer that it should be faithfully done. after his death, I obtained, thro' the kind agency of mr.. Correa, from mr.. Barton, three of those books, of which I knew there had been 10. or 12. having myself read them. these were all she could find. the rest therefore, I presume are in the hands of the other gentlemen. after the agency I had had, in effecting this expedition, I thought myself authorised, and indeed that it would be expected of me that I should follow up the subject, and endeavor to obtain it's fruits for the public. I wrote to Genl. Clarke therefore for authority to recieve the original papers. he gave it in the letters to mr. Biddle and to myself, which I now inclose, as the custody of these papers belonged properly to the War-office, and that was vacant at the time, I have waited several months for it's being filled. but the office still remaining vacant, and my distance rendering any effectual measures by myself, impracticable, I ask the agency of your committee, within whose province I propose to place the matter, by making it the depository of the papers generally. I therefore now forward to them the 3. volumes of MS. journals in my possession, and authorise them, under Genl. Clarke's letters, to enquire for and to recieve the rest. so also the astronomical and geographical papers, those relating to zoological, botanical, and mineral subjects, with the Indian vocabularies, and statistical tables relative to the Indians. of the astronomical and geographical papers, if the Comm?e will be so good as to give me a statement, I will, as soon as a Secretary at war is appointed, propose to him to have made, at the public expence, the requisite calculations, to have the map corrected in its longitudes and latitudes, engraved and published on a proper scale: and I will ask from Genl. Clarke the one he offers, with his corrections. with respect to the zoological, vegetable &amp; mineralogical papers &amp; subjects, it would perhaps be agreeable to the Philosophical society to have a digest of them made, and published in their transactions or otherwise. and if it should be within the views of the historical committee to have the Indian vocabularies digested and published, I would add to them the remains of my collection. I had thro' the course of my life availed myself of every opportunity of procuring vocabularies of the languages of every tribe which either myself or my friends could have access to. they amounted to about 40 more or less perfect. but in their passage from Washington to this place, the trunk in which they were was stolen and plundered, and some fragments only of the vocabularies were recovered. Still however they were such as would be worth incorporation with a larger work, and shall be at the service of the historical committee, if they can make any use of them. permit me to request the return of Genl. Clarke's letter and to add assurances of my high respect &amp; esteem Th: Jefferson P.S. with the volumes of MS. journal, mrs Barton delivered one by mistake I suppose, which seems to have been the journal of some botanist. I presume it was the property of Dr. Barton, &amp; therefore forward it to you to be returned to mrs Barton. LXXXV THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY ACCEPTS THE TRUST [Extract furnished by Secretary Hays, from the minutes of the Historical and Literary Committee of the Society.] Nov. 19. 1817. Present Dr. Wistar, N. Biddle, Rawle, Norris, Du Ponceau, Vaughan, Tilghman Mr. Jefferson under date of 7 Nov. relative to papers of Lewis and Clark. Also a letter from Gen'l Clark 10 Oct. 1816 to Mr. Jefferson desiring his agent Mr. Nicholas Biddle to give up all the papers to the Historical Committee under direction of Mr. Jefferson. Mr. Jefferson in his letter desires Mr. Biddle to deliver them and says that he will endeavor to procure from the Government all they may possess. Also a letter from Gov. Clark to Mr. Biddle desiring him to deliver the Papers to Mr. Jefferson's order. Also a letter 26 April 1816 from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Correa corroborating the above and stating that he thought the astronomical papers were mentioned by Clark to Dr. Patterson. Mr. Biddle stated that the vocabularies were on separate printed sheets—as stated by Mr. Jefferson and with blanks to fill up the vocabularies—accompanied by some in handwriting of Mr. Jefferson. These were handed by him to Dr. Barton. The manuscript journals of Mr. Clark are still in Mr. Biddle's hands and also a Journal of a sergeant which Mr. Clark bought. J. Vaughan reported that the astronomical papers had been in the hands of Mr. Hassler1 1 Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler, a Swiss mathematician and surveyor born in 1770, emigrated to the United States early in the 19th century. Gallatin secured him a position as professor of mathematics at West Point. Later he was connected with the Coast Survey and chief of bureau of weights and measures.—Ed. who had given up the calculations in despair.

In 1824 he was elected president of the American Philosophical Society, of which he had long been an active member.—Ed. [Qriginal MS. in possession of American Philosophical Society. We follow a transcript furnished by Secretary Hays.] Philada. April 6. 1818 Dear Sir: I have the pleasure of depositing with the Historical Committee the papers &amp; books which accompany this letter, in compliance with the request of Governor Clark in his letter to me of the 10th of October 1816 transmitted by Mr. Jefferson. It may perhaps be useful to add such notices of other objects connected with them, as may enable the Committee to extend its researches. It was in the Spring of 1810 that I received from Governor Clark in Virginia, &amp; brought to Philadelphia the papers &amp; documents deemed necessary for the publication of the Travels. They consisted of, 1.A large map of the country between the Mississipi &amp; the Pacific illustrating the course of the journey 2.A map for Mr Hassler who was in the state of New York and engaged in some astronomical calculations for the work. 3.Some documents for Dr Barton 4.The manuscript journal of Serjeant Ordway, one of the party 5.The pocket Journals of the expedition Of these, 1.The map after the draft was made from it for the engraver was delivered by the draftsman, Mr Lewis, to Governor Clark when last in Phila. about the year 1813. 2.The other map was forwarded by Mr Vaughan to Mr Hassler, who in his letter dated Augt. 12. 1810 at Schenectady mentions the receipt of it VOCABULARY Fire a man monax tooth water a woman beaver tongue earth belly raccoon ear air back opossum neck wind side to-day arm sky bubby to-morrow wrist sun nipple a day hand moon thigh a month finger star leg a year moose light foot spring bear darkness toe summer wolf day skin autumn panther night nails winter wild-cat heat bone a man pole-cat cold blood a woman fox smoak life a boy monax cloud death a girl beaver fog food a child raccoon rain meat father opossum snow fat mother hare hail lean brother squirrel ice bread sister flying-squirrel frost Indian-corn husband ground-squirrel dew milk wife mole rain-bow egg son a bird thunder a house daughter an eagle lightning the mammoth the body hawk yesterday buffalo the head owl to-day elk the hair turkey to-morrow deer the beard swan a day moose the face wild-goose a month bear an eye duck a year wolf the nose turkey-buzzard spring panther the cheek raven summer wild-cat chin crow autumn pole-cat lip black-bird winter fox mouth crane pigeon ninety to jump three dove a hundred to fall four pheasant two hundred to break nine hundred partridge three hundred to bend a thousand mocking-bird four hundred yes white red-bird five hundred no black snake six hundred gold green lizzard seven hundred silver blue butterfly eight hundred copper yellow fly ugly a stone red fish sick wood good frog brave gum bad mulberry cowardly a mountain large a vine wise hill small tobacco foolish valley high joy I sea low sorrow you lake broad one he pond narrow two she river old three they creek young four this a spring new five that grass hard six to eat a tree soft seven to drink pine sweet eight to sleep cedar sour nine to laugh sycamore bitter ten to cry poplar hot eleven to sing ash cold twelve to whistle elm dry thirteen to smell beech wet fourteen to hear birch strong fifteen to see maple weak sixteen to speak oak pretty seventeen to walk chesnut ugly eighteen to run hiccory sick nineteen to stand walnut brave twenty to sit locust cowardly twenty-one to lie down mulberry wise thirty to smoke a pipe a vine foolish forty to love tobacco I fifty to hate joy you sixty to strike sorrow he seventy to kill one eighty to dance two 3.The documents for Dr Barton, were delivered to him immediately after my arrival in Phila. Not having received any list of them from Govr Clark I of course took none from Dr Barton, and as I was merely the bearer of them, my recollection is not as accurate as it would have been had they fallen more immediately under my examination. My impression however is that the packet for Dr Barton consisted of small manuscript books &amp; some papers. The books were chiefly extracts relative to objects of natural history taken from the original Journal now deposited with the Committee. The papers were Indian vocabularies, collected during the journey. They formed, I think a bundle of loose sheets each sheet containing a printed vocabulary in English with the corresponding Indian name in manuscript. There was also another collection of Indian vocabularies, which, if I am not mistaken, was in the handwriting of Mr Jefferson.1 1 Several copies of the Indian vocabulary blank, apparently prepared by Jefferson, are in the possession of the American Philosophical Society, having been presented by him in October, 1820. It consists of a sheet 7 ¾ × 19 ¼″, printed on both sides—although there are some which were printed on but one side of a sheet twice this width, the two pages standing side by side. Those filled out, represent, among others, the Miami, Micmac, Shawnee, Chippewa, and Lenâpe languages; while several are still blank. In the collection are none which emanated from the Lewis and Clark expedition. We present herewith a facsimile of one of the unfilled blanks.—Ed. I have turned to my letter to Governor Clark dated July 7. 1810, the first to him after my arrival at Phila, in hopes of finding some further particulars, but the letter merely states in general terms "I need not say that I arrived safe at this place / that the map was immediately forwarded to Mr Hassler, and that Dr Barton received all his papers "In the preface to the printed travels which, being published in Phila whilst Dr Barton was there, must be presumed to have been correct it is stated that "those parts of the work which relate to the various objects of natural history observed or collected during the journey, as well as the alphabets of the Indian languages are in the hands of Professor Barton, and will it is understood, shortly appear." This was in 1814. I have mentioned these particulars so minutely because the description may perhaps enable some of the Committe to recognize the vocabularies, which I incline to think were the only things delivered by me to Dr Barton not included in the volumes now deposited. 4.The journal of Serjeant Ordway was I believe a private purchase from that person. Governor Clark in his letter to me of the 24 Jany. 1818 desires me to send it to him. 5.The Journals of Mefsrs' Lewis &amp; Clark from the beginning to the end of the journey are contained in the 14 volumes, all of which are now deposited. There is besides one volume of astronomical observations &amp; other matter by Captain Lewis, a small copy book containing some notes by Captain Lewis / the rough draft of his letter to the President from St Louis announcing his return / and two statistical tables of the various tribes of Indians west of the Mississipi made by Governor Clark. These are all the observations which occur to me as promising to be useful to the Committee, Very respectfully yrs Nicholas Biddle Honble William Tilghman Chairman of the Historical Committee of the Philosl Society.

LXXXVII ELLIOTT COUES'S1 1 In December, 1892, the Society loaned these MSS. to Dr. Coues while he was preparing his annotated edition of the Biddle version; hence this report upon them. The lines of asterisks represent details by Dr. Coues, not essential to the present publication, therefore omitted by us. In connection with this list, the reader should also consult our vol. i, pp. l–liv, ante, for an account of the Clark-Voorhis collection.—Ed. DESCRIPTION OF THE ORIGINAL JOURNALS OF LEWIS AND CLARK, NOW IN POSSESSION OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY IN PHILADELPHIA [Condensation of paper read before the American Philosophical Society, January 20, 1893, and published in Proceedings of the Society, vol. xxxi, No. 140, pp. 17–33.] It is well known that the History of Lewis and Clark's Expedition was written by Mr. Nicholas Biddle, of Philadelphia, and first published there in 1814, in two octavo volumes, by Bradford and Inskeep. It is also common report that the manuscripts of the famous explorers, upon which Mr. Biddle worked, are extant. But what these are, and where they are kept, few could have told. All the journals and notebooks, in the handwritings respectively of Lewis and of Clark, upon which Mr. Biddle based his work, were deposited by him with the Philosophical Society in April, 1818. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Diligent and minute examination of these manuscripts satisfies me that their character should be made known, as a matter of great historic interest. Accordingly the present description is offered. I will first describe the bound books and loose papers, just as I found them, in general terms; next, in terms of their several deposits—for there are more of them than Mr. Biddle deposited; and then I will give an account of them in detail, as I have arranged them in a series of codices, which I call alphabetically Codex A, etc., to T. I. The Books and Papers as Found. Of four sorts: (1), (2), (3), three different styles of bound field notebooks and journals; (4), several lots of loose papers, mainly belonging with one of the styles of the bound volumes. 1.Thirteen (13) bound volumes, all alike, forming the most conspicuous part of the collection, and known since Biddle's time as "the red books." These are journals and notebooks of Lewis and of Clark, respectively, all in the handwriting of one or the other of the explorers. Eleven (11) of these are a part of the Biddle deposit; one (1) was deposited by Mr. Jefferson; one (1) is an unrecorded deposit. All are in remarkably good order, clean and sound inside and out; form oblong; back along short diameter, and as the pages were written on both sides, up and down, across the same diameter, the books open to and from the reader, not right and left; covers smooth bright red morocco, gilt-tooled edges, marbled inside, fastened at the fore end with brass clasps (now gone from eight of the volumes, intact on five of them)1 1 Not at present on any of them.—Ed. ; size of covers 8 ? × 5 ? inches (very nearly same size and shape as the leaves of the printed Philadelphia edition of 1814); paper about one quarter inch smaller each way than cover, or 7 ? × 4 ?, rather thin, rough and tough, white (now with a slight brownish tinge), unruled; gathering supposed to be 76 folios or 152 pages in each book, exclusive of a pair of flyleaves marbled one side like inside of cover; but the number of leaves varies a little, and in several cases some leaves have been intentionally torn out —nowhere breaking the text, but to write something else on, or for another purpose. These books, as a whole, are written almost entirely full. Lewis's hand is particularly fine, fair and even; Clark's is larger, stronger and less regular; both are so good, and the pages are so perfectly preserved, that there is perhaps not a word, possibly not a letter, in the whole of these manuscripts not now distinctly legible. Seven (7) of these thirteen books are by Lewis alone; six (6) are by Clark alone. Eleven (11) are "journals"—i.e., narratives of the progress of the Expedition day by day, entered under consecutive dates. Two (2) are "Notebooks"—i.e., miscellaneous entries, of various dates or none, of astronomical, geographical, ethnological, zoölogical, botanical, etc., items. In my arrangement these thirteen books become Codices D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P (see further on). With them belong more or less intimately certain parcels of loose sheets (see on). 2.One (1) bound volume, the "brown" book, standing alone. This is almost exactly the size, shape, etc., of the foregoing, but quite unlike them in appearance. It is bound in rough brown leather, sides and edges alike, not marbled inside; it is thicker than any of the other volumes, the paper being heavier and coarser; the leaves are 137, pages 274. This is mainly a journal, and mainly in Clark's hand, but with some entries by Lewis, and some by another hand. It includes the whole of the wintering of the expedition at Fort Mandan, and various other matters. For contents see beyond, Codex C, which this volume now forms. 3.Four (4) bound volumes, which may be called the "marble" books, from the style of their covers. Form oblong, like that of all the foregoing; size of covers 6 ¾ × 4 inches, leaves 6 ? × 3 ¾; paper rough, whitish, unruled; covers pasteboard, overlaid with marbled paper, back and corners of thin, smooth, brown leather. All in good order but one, which is worn and shabby; all written full, and perfectly legible throughout. The gathering of these four books is supposed to be 92 leaves or 184 pages; in one I find but 164 pages, though without any break in the text that I can discover. Two of these books are Clark's journals, from the starting of the Expedition to October 3, 1804; the other two are notebooks, chiefly natural history notes, by both Lewis and Clark. The four now form my Codices A, B and Q, R (see beyond). 4.Several parcels of loose sheets of manuscript, some in Lewis' hand, some in Clark's. Most of these papers are of the same size, shape and quality as the leaves of the red books, having been, in fact, taken from some of the latter, as may be seen by fitting the torn ends to the stubs remaining in the volumes. Those parcels which thus obviously belong to certain of the red books, or with the red books as a set, I have arranged as Codices Fa, Fb, Fc, Fd, Fe, La, Lb. One of the parcels is a different fragment, imperfect, once part of a notebook, not found, like the small marble books; this is now Codex Ia. Two of the parcels belong with the small marble books, and thus become Codices Aa, Ba. Two remaining parcels, not directly connected with any of the bound volumes, are now Codices S, T. These manuscripts were all loose; as arranged they make twelve (12) parcels and as many codices, for the particular description of which see beyond. The above are all the books and papers in my hands which are actual manuscripts of Lewis or of Clark. They are accompanied by Mr. Biddle's letter of deposit, and several memoranda concerning them, in Biddle's or another hand. II. The Books and Papers as Deposited. I do not find quite all of the Biddle deposit, as itemized in the receipt given him by the Society; for example, no vocabularies and no maps. The "Meteorological Register" he specifies is simply certain leaves detached from the red books, and thus already accounted for. All the loose manuscript above specified is supposed to be included in the Biddle deposit. But I find four books from other sources remaining to be accounted for.1 1 Coues is mistaken in his description of the Biddle deposit. It consisted of the fourteen volumes of the journals (Coues's codices A to N); a book of astronomical observations (Codex O); a small copy-book containing some notes by Lewis (a book he had previously used while paymaster in the army in 1800, and in which he entered his weather diary from January, 1804, to April, 1805); two statistical tables of Indian tribes (for description, see Ethnological Data); and a rough draught of his letter to the president announcing his return (Codex S). Biddle expressly says that the vocabularies and maps had passed from his hands; and the "Meteorological Register" is not detached leaves, but the small copy-book containing the weather diary.—Ed. As to their deposits, therefore, the Lewis and Clark manuscripts fall into the following arrangement: 1.The Biddle deposit, fourteen bound volumes, viz.: Two of the four small marble books; the one brown book; and eleven of the thirteen red books. With these belong all the loose papers, as above said. 2.The Jefferson deposit, consisting of three bound volumes. Two of these are small marble books, matching the other two deposited by Biddle. Each is by both Lewis and Clark, and each consists of miscellaneous field notes, mainly on zoölogy and botany. They now form Codices Q, R. The third volume is one of the red books. It is a Clark, and contains miscellaneous notes, chiefly on natural history. It is now Codex P. These three were deposited by Mr. Jefferson in November,2 2 These were received by Jefferson from Mrs. Barton. See letter of November 7, 1817.—Ed. 1817, as appears by memorandum in each of them, in Biddle's hand. 3.Unknown deposit: One of the thirteen red books without record of source whence obtained. This is a Lewis, and consists of certain astronomical observations and geographical notes. It is now Codex O.3 3 This was a part of the Biddle deposit. See previous note.—Ed. III. The Books and Papers as Arranged. I have gone very carefully through these precious manuscripts, and arranged them in what appears to be their natural sequence or logical order. All the red books, making the bulk of the collection, fall easily together, preceded by two of the small marble books and by the brown book, followed by the other two small marble books, and the set of bound volumes is interspersed with the twelve parcels of unbound manuscripts which I have made up from the loose sheets, securely fastened in stiff paper covers, and for the most part interleaved with onion-skin writing paper. I have also paginated the whole of the manuscripts, which can now be cited by codex and page throughout, as if by volume and page of a published work. There are in all upward of 2,000 pages. Description in detail of the now thirty (30) codices here follows: Codex A.One of the four small marbled cover books. Biddle deposit No. 1. Clark's original No. 1. In good order. Folios 92, pages 184. Being Clark's journal, complete, from May 13, 1804, to Aug. 14, 1804. This takes the expedition from the 1803–4 winter camp on Du Bois or Wood River up the Missouri to the creek on which the Omahas resided (to p. 44, vol. i, of the printed text). *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex A a.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number; collate with Clark Codex A. In good order. Folios 4, loose, torn from a book like one of the red books; 5 ? pages written. Being Lewis's journal, of dates May 20 and 15, 1804, covering starting of the expedition, which Lewis joined at St. Charles on the 20th. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex B.One of the small marbled cover books. Biddle deposit No. 2. Clark's original No. 2. In good order. Folios 90, pages 180, counting front flyleaf; one leaf and the flyleaf gone at end, but no break in the MS., which continues on from p. 180 to inside of cover. Being Clark's journal, complete, from Aug. 15, 1804, to Oct. 3, 1804. This takes the expedition from the creek on which the Omahas resided to next day beyond Caution Island (pp. 44–97 of vol. i, of the printed text). *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex B a.Fragment, torn from a book like one of the red books. Biddle deposit. No number; collate with Clark Codex B. In fair order; some corners gone; loose folios 4, pages 7 ? written. Being Lewis's journal, Sept. 16 and 17, 1804, when the expedition was at Corvus Creek. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex C.The brown leather cover book above described, and which may be also known as "The Mandan Codex." Biddle deposit No. 3. Clark's No. 3. Biddle's No. 3. In perfect order. Folios 137, pages 274, and inside of both covers written over. Being Clark's journal, complete, traversing dates Oct. 1–3, 1804, from Codex B, then of dates Oct. 4, 1804, to April 7, 1805, when the expedition left Fort Mandan; Lewis enters Feb. 3–13, 1805, when Clark was away on a hunt; another hand invoices, etc. This journal covers route from Cheyenne River to the Mandans, and residence there. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex D.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 4. In perfect order. Cover clean and scarcely warped. Folios 70, pages 140, besides two flyleaves marbled one side like inside of covers; there should be folios 76, pages 152, but several leaves are torn out at end (these are preserved, being now part of Codex Fe, which see). This is Lewis's journal, complete, April 7, 1805, to May 23, 1805, from the Mandans to a little above Musselshell River, and corresponding with dates to Biddle's pp. 177–226 of vol. i; but the printed text follows mainly a Clark journal I have not found.1 1 One of Clark's journals is now in the possession of his son, Mr. Jefferson K. Clark, of St. Louis. I am not informed of the dates covered by this volume, nor of the nature of its contents.—Coues. As will be seen upon reference to vol. i, of our series, pp. l–liii, the present Editor was led by the above note to institute a search for the Ordway journal. This quest led to the discovery of the remarkable collection of Clark MSS. in the possession of his heirs in New York city, whither the family papers had been removed from St. Louis; but the Ordway journal is still missing.—Ed. Codex E.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 5. In perfect order inside, brass clasp gone, covers clean, one of them creased crosswise. Folios 78, pages 156, and both marbled flyleaves written over one side. Being Lewis's journal, complete, pp. 1–156, and both flies, May 24, 1805, to July 16, 1805, carrying the expedition from North Mountain Creek to the Gates of the Rocky Mountains, followed in the Biddle text, mainly, pp. 226–303 of vol. i. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex F.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 6. In perfect order inside and out, except brass clasp gone. Folios 76, pages 152, and one side of both marbled flyleaves written over ? pages 154; p. 153, on back fly, continued as p. 154 on front fly. Being Lewis's journal, complete and intact, July 17, 1805, to Aug. 22, 1805 (except Aug. 1–4), carrying the expedition from the Gates to the Three Forks of the Missouri, thence up Jefferson River and over the Rocky Mountains to the Shoshone village; corresponding to pp. 303–398 of vol. i, of the Biddle text. Codex F a.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 4, pages 8, loose sheets, written over 6 ? pages, same paper as one of the red books. Being Lewis's journal, Aug. 1–4, 1805, but merely another narrative of those days, already fully written up at pp. 52–66 of Codex F, with which collate. Codex F b.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 13, pages 26, written 25 ¼, loose sheets, same paper as the red books. Lewis's journal, Aug. 23–26, 1805, therefore in direct continuation of Codex F. Text mainly the account of the Shoshone Indians as given in Biddle's chap. xvi, vol. i. The dates are included in Clark's journal, Codex G. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex F c.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 2, pages 4, full. Loose sheets, paper of the red books. Lewis's journal, Sept. 9 and 10, 1805, at and near Traveler's Rest Creek. This codex comes after Codex Fb, but not connectedly. The dates are covered by Clark, Codex G. Codex F d.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 4, pages 8, full. Loose sheets, paper of the red books. Lewis's journal, Sept. 18–22, 1805, Hungry Creek, Chopunnish Indians, etc. Follows Codex Fc, but not connectedly. Dates covered by Clark, Codex G. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex F e.Two fragments. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 5 + 3 = 8, pages 10 + 6 = 16. Paper like that of the red book, from two of which these fragments have been torn. Lewis's weather diary for April, May and June, 1805, and for July, Aug. and Sept., 1805. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—This codex is the basis of Biddle's meteorological tables, April 1 to Sept. 30, 1805, in Vol. ii, pp. 484–488, and of the "Remarks and Reflections" pertaining to these dates, 503–508. By dates Codex Fe is to be collated with Codices D, E, F, G. Codex G.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Clark's No. 5. Biddle's No. 7. In perfect order inside and out; brass clasp intact. Folios 76, pp. 152, besides the marbled flyleaves, one of which is written on. Clark's journal, complete, July 1, 1805, to Oct. 10, 1805, covering the whole of the route from White Bear islands, at the head of the Great Falls of the Missouri, to mouth of the Kooskooskee or Clearwater River. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex H.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit No. 8. No Clark number. In perfect order, inside and out; brass clasp intact. Folios 76, pages 152, besides back and front marbled flyleaves. Clark's journal, complete, Oct. 11, 1805, to Nov. 19, 1805, going down "Lewis'" River and the Columbia to the mouth of the latter. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—Codex H is main basis of Biddle, vol. ii, pp. 1–81. Codex I.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit No. 9. No Clark number. In perfect order, inside and out; only brass clasp gone. Folios 78, pages 156, besides the two marbled flyleaves. Clark's journal, complete, Nov. 19, 1805 (directly continued from same date in Codex H) to Jan. 29, 1806, at and about the mouth of the Columbia and residence in Fort Clatsop, with various other matter, for which see contents following. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—Codex I is the main basis of Biddle's printed text, vol. ii, pp. 80– 146, though of course with collation of Lewis's parallel narrative. The list of traders is on Biddle's p. 145. Biddle also uses the weather diary in one part, for the months not taken from Lewis. The sketch map forms the third of the copper plates of Biddle's Vol. ii. But the most important special matter in this Code is the "Estimate of the Western Indians," an original basis of Biddle's pp. 471– 476. The printed pages, however, do not follow this Clark Codex I, but are from some revised manuscript furnished by Clark. Codex I a.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In perfect order. Folios 5, pages written 8; small paper like that of one of the small marble cover books. Lewis's journal, Nov. 29–Dec. 1, 1805, when he explored by himself a place on the S. W. side of the Columbia. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex J.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. No. 10. In Perfect order inside and out, only clasp gone. Folios 76, pages 152, besides marbled flyleaves. Lewis's journal, complete, Jan. 1, 1806, to March 20, 1806, thus covering the residence of the party in Fort Clatsop. The manuscript is very close, clear and clean, and illustrated with numerous pen and ink sketches of Indian implements and utensils, birds, fishes, etc. There is a well-drawn head of the California condor, the white-fronted goose, and some full-length fishes, size of the page. We will specify this as "The Clatsop Codex." *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex K.One of the thirteen red morocco books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 10. In perfect order inside and out, only brass clasp gone. Folios 76, pages 152, and two marbled flyleaves. Lewis's journal, complete, March 21, 1806, to May 23, 1806, in direct continuation of Codex J, covering voyage up the Columbia, and journey over the Bitter-root Mountains. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—The Journal of this codex, so far as it is utilized, makes Biddle's pp. 205–299, of vol. ii. Codex L.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 12. In good order inside and out, brass clasp intact. Total folios 75, pages 150, inclusive of three folios I have fastened in where they belong, exclusive of the two marbled flyleaves, both written on one side. Lewis's journal, not complete, May 24, 1806, to Aug. 8, 1806, excepting July 5–14, which is Codex La, completing the Journal between dates said. This Codex L, together with La, covers the making of "Lewis and Clark's Pass," Lewis's exploration of Maria's River, and his Indian fight. It is continued by Lb, which see. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—This codex, with its important belongings La and Lb, is the sole basis of Biddle's vol. ii, pp. 332–365, relating to Lewis's party, at the said dates separated from Clark's. Codex L a.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In poor order; one sheet in bad order. Sheets 4 ?, folios 9, pages 18, of a folded notepaper, not matching paper from any of the bound books, and one sheet not matching the rest. Lewis's journal, July 3–15, 1806, the making of "Lewis and Clark's Pass." We will call it "The Pass Codex." Note.—This is by far the most important of all the fragments, and unhappily in the worst order of all the manuscripts. Sheet 1, folios 2, pages 4, is larger than the rest, thin and now very brittle. Having been handled and packed with smaller sheets, the edges are ragged, especially at bottom. The last line on each of the four pages was probably going in Biddle's time, for he has interlined some words that were then in danger of becoming illegible. Others that were only made out with difficulty when I got the manuscript I have interlined to like purpose; and certainly every word is saved. The top was in the same state, but has no lines so near the edge, and I have trimmed it smooth. This sheet is badly stained, also, perhaps from getting wet when Lewis forded a river with it in his pocket. The Pass is made July 7, at the bottom of p. 7 of this fragment. The MS. ends illegibly near the bottom of p. 18. Two other hands make a memorandum across the blank space, to the effect that this fragment belongs to Biddle's No. 12, my Codex L, where 10 folios were left blank by Lewis for its insertion, and where it should be carefully copied into the clean book. Codex L b.Fragment. Biddle deposit. No number. In good order. Folios 4, pages 7 written ? 1 blank, paper like that of the red books. Lewis's journal, Aug. 9–12, 1806, and last; includes his being shot by Cruzatte. Note.—Sole basis of Biddle's pp. 363–365, vol. ii. Codex M.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 13. In perfect order inside and out. Folios 76, but pages 154, including one side of each marbled flyleaf. Clark's journal, complete, June 7, 1806, to Aug. 14, 1806. Parallel narrative with Lewis's to July 3, when the party separated, then Clark's sole narrative of the journey from Traveler's Rest Creek to the Jefferson River, making "Clark's Pass," thence down the Jefferson, up the Gallatin, over to the Yellowstone, and down this to its mouth, below which the separated parties reunited; also weather diary, June to Aug., 1806. This may be known as "The Yellowstone Codex." *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—A sketch map therein, is that mentioned in Biddle, as drawn by Chopunnish Indians and copied on paper by Clark. It was never engraved. With Lewis's parallel narrative to July 3, this codex is the basis of Biddle, vol. ii, pp. 309–332: then it is sole basis of pp. 366–404. Codex N.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. Biddle deposit. Biddle's No. 14, and last. In perfect order inside and out, only brass clasp gone. Folios 76, but pages 154, one side of both flyleaves being written over. Clark's journal, complete, Aug. 15 to Sept. 26, 1806, and his last, bringing the reunited party down the Missouri to St. Louis; also various other matter. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—An important codex. As Lewis kept no journal after Aug. 12, 1806, when he had been shot, the remainder of Biddle vol. ii is based on this codex, as far as p. 433, end of the history. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex O.One of the thirteen red morocco books. No Biddle number. Not deposited by Biddle; perhaps by Jefferson; by whom unknown; not one of the regular series of journals1 1 See previous note on the deposit of Codex O.—Ed. . In perfect order inside and out. Folios 64 only, pages 128 only, exclusive of the two flyleaves, probably up to the usual 72 folios, cut out of end. Text as far as it goes perfect and signed "Mcriwether Lewis," showing end there. Whole MS. is in Lewis's hand. The gone leaves were probably taken to be used for other writing, and their absence in no way affects what is in the book. Contains description of the Missouri and other rivers, etc., from the mouth of the Missouri to the Mandans, according to the observations of the expedition, and beyond the Mandans upon Indian and other information, pp. 69–128. This is a connected general account, the original draft of which was doubtless written at Fort Mandan, winter of 1804–5, as text to accompany the map which was sent thence to President Jefferson, April 7, 1805. Hence I infer that the substance of this codex was among the papers dispatched to the President at that date; but I have no record of how or when it came into the possession of the Philosophical Society. It does not seem to have been known to Biddle, or at any rate was not used by him in writing the history of the expedition. Codex P.One of the thirteen red morocco cover books. No Biddle number. Not one of the regular journals. Jefferson deposit, Nov., 1817. In perfect order inside and out; only brass clasp gone. Folios only 68, pages 136, exclusive of two flyleaves written on; 4 folios = 8 pages gone, but no break in the manuscript. Clark's natural history notes, etc., April 9, 1805, to Feb. 17, 1806. Note.—This codex is important as containing numerous and various zoölogical and botanical notes which are the main though not the sole basis of Biddle's natural history chapter vii, in vol. ii. Some of this chapter is almost literally from this codex, but zoölogical and botanical matter from various other codices is there compiled. I may here give the simple explanation of the extreme meagreness and paucity of the natural history notes in Lewis and Clark, with the sole exception of what is in chap. vii, vol. ii. It was intended that Dr. B. S. Barton should work up the natural history in both branches, as stated by Biddle in the Preface. The codices (journals) are everywhere rich in such materials—often giving elaborate descriptions of animals and plants which the printed text barely mentions. These manuscripts will doubtless suffice for the scientific identification of the objects described, in nearly all cases. But these passages are almost always cancelled in red ink by Biddle or by Clark, with the remark, "Dr. Barton," "Copy for Dr. Barton," "Copied for Dr. Barton," etc., showing that the editor designedly passed them by for the purpose thus indicated. But Dr. Barton never did anything with this wealth of new material; his death occurred soon after the volumes were published, and nothing that I know of bearing on the zoölogy and botany of Lewis and Clark was ever found among his papers. Thus the whole intention miscarried; what little zoölogy was ever made out of the expedition was done by Wilson, Ord and Rafinesque, mainly, and what little botany, I think, by Pursh. In 1876 I worked out the mammals and birds as well as I could from the printed text of chap. vii, vol. ii. Codex Q.One of the four small marbled cover books. No Biddle number. Jefferson deposit. In good order. Folios 92, pages 184. Lewis and Clark's miscellaneous notes, chiefly on natural history, 1804–1806. A mate to Codex R (see contents). *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Note.—This and R are the only codices of the whole series of which Lewis and Clark are joint authors—though Lewis has a few entries in Clark Codex C. I observe no marks by Biddle in the MS., and probably he did not use this codex at all. It has some valuable descriptions, found nowhere else, but on the whole is of much less importance to the naturalist than Codex P. Codex R.One of the four small marbled cover books. No Biddle number. Jefferson deposit. Cover most worn of any of the books, and very shabby; inside sound and clean, except a torn flyleaf. Folios 82, pages 164. Lewis and Clark's miscellaneous notes, chiefly on botany and zoölogy, May, 1804, to March, 1806. A mate to Codex Q. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Codex S.Fragment. Biddle deposit. Loose sheets 4 = folios 8 = pages 16, of notepaper, unlike the paper of any of the bound codices. In good order. Lewis, Two letters of. (1) letter to President Jefferson, dated St. Louis, Sept. 23, 1806, announcing the return of the expedition. This is the rough original, full of interlineations and erasures, from which a fair copy was doubtless made and mailed to the President, Lewis retaining the present MS. It is of great historic interest as a curiosity, but of no special value otherwise. It is complete, with official signature and address; it makes 5 ? folios, or 11 pages, the second letter being on the same sheets as the first one, occupying the remaining 2 ? folios, or 5 pages. (2) A letter, fragmentary, without signature or address, presumably intended for the President, in Lewis's hand, misdated St. Louis, Sept. 21 (probably meant for 24), 1806, and proceeding to give a general account of the expedition, till it breaks off in the middle of a sentence at bottom of p. 16. It announces the discovery of the Yellow Rock or "Roghejone" river—that is, of the Yellowstone or Roche jaune. Codex T.Fragment. No record or identification. One folio, 2 pages, apparently Clark's hand, but "Capt. Clark" spoken of in the third person. It is a half sheet of notepaper, not from any one of the bound books, and a mere excerpt, without proper beginning or end, speaking of some geographical and other matters of no special consequence. Note to Codices A–T.—The four small marble cover codices, and the brown codex, were actually penned in the field, day by day, as the Expedition proceeded. So were some of the fragmentary codices, notably the "Pass Codex." But this cannot have been the case with the red books, nor with those of the fragmentary codices which are on paper of the same size, shape and quality as that of the red books. The covers are too fresh and bright, the paper too clean and sound, for these books to have ever been through the wear and tear of such a journey. The handwritings are too good, and too uniform, for either of the explorers to have executed them in the vicissitudes of the camp. The red books were certainly written after the return of the expedition, and before Lewis's death in October, 1809—that is, in 1806–9. They were certainly put in Mr. Biddle's hands very early in 1810, and were probably written at St. Louis. I suppose the explorers bought a stock of these blank books, and proceeded to copy into them their journals and notes, from rough field-books like the marble ones and the brown one. They appear to have agreed upon a fair division of the work of authorship—each to write certain portions of the narrative, each in the first person singular speaking of the other in the third person, and each drawing what he wished from the rough field-books of both. They evidently intended to become the joint authors of their own Travels, though each should write certain portions himself. This design was frustrated by Lewis's untimely and tragic death; upon which Clark at once secured Mr. Biddle's invaluable services as editor and virtual author. But in making this explanation concerning the red books, I must not be misread as saying that they are not "original" manuscripts of Lewis and of Clark; simply that they are not books which were written in the field. Every word of them all is in the handwriting of one or the other of the explorers; they are original, they are genuine, and they are authentic.1 1 But see on this point Jefferson's letter to Correa de Serra, April 26, 1816, ante, in which he declares that the morocco-bound books were actually carried in the field.—Ed. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * If the actual texts of Lewis and Clark are ever published, they should be printed word for word, letter for letter, and point for point. This would make a wonderful book, and I am inclined to think it should be done. *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * The only serious criticism of Mr. Biddle's most admirable performance, which examination of the original manuscripts induces me to venture, concerns the exclusion of all tabular matter from the body of his text. The manuscripts of both the explorers, and of Clark especially, are replete with astronomical observations for latitude and longitude, tabulated courses by points of the compass, bearings of prominent landmarks by the same, formally estimated distances, etc. These are of great intrinsic interest in meandering the Missouri and other rivers, and invaluable in tracking the routes of the explorers across the mountains. It is true that such things do not make easy reading, and perhaps the publisher objected; but the benefit to the student of Lewis and Clark that would have resulted from the publication of these data is simply incalculable.1 1 All of this matter is included in the present edition.—Ed.</field>
