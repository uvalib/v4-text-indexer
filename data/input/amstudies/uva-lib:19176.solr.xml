      <field name="fulltext">The ORIGINAL JOURNALS OF LEWIS AND CLARK Chapter XVI SEARCHING FOR NAVIGABLE WATERS Lewis's Journal, August 21–26, 1805 Clark's Journal, August 21–26 [Lewis:] Wednesday August 21st. 1805. THIS morning was very cold, the ice ¼ of an inch thick on the water which stood in the vessels exposed to the air. some wet deerskins that had been spread on the grass last evening are stiffly frozen. the ink f[r]eizes in my pen. the bottoms are perfectly covered with frost, insomuch that they appear to be covered with snow. This morning early I dispatched two hunters to kill some meat if possible before the Indians arrive; Drewyer I sent with the horse into the cove for that purpose. The party pursued their several occupations as yesterday. by evening I had all the baggage, saddles, and harness completely ready for a march. after dark, I made the men take the baggage to the cash and deposit it. I beleve we have been unperceived by the Indians in this movement. notwithstanding the coldness of the last night the day has proved excessively warm. neither of the hunters returned this evening and I was obliged to issue pork and corn. The mockersons of both sexes are usually the same and are made of deer Elk or buffaloe skin dressed without the hair. sometimes in the winter they make them of buffaloe skin dressed with the hair on and turn the hair inwards as the Mandans Minetares and most of the nations do who inhabit the buffaloe country. the mockerson is formed with one seem on the outer edge of the foot is cut open at the instep to admit the foot and sewed up behind. in this rispect they are the same with the Mandans. they sometimes ornament their mockersons with various figures wrought with the quills of the Porcupine. some of the dressey young men orniment the tops of their mockersons with the skins of polecats and trale the tail of that animal on the ground at their heels as they walk. the robe of the woman is generally smaller than that of the man but is woarn in the same manner over the sholders. the Chemise is roomy and comes down below the middle of the leg the upper part of this garment is formed much like the shirt of the men except the sholder strap which is never used with the Chemise. in women who give suck, they are left open at the sides nearly as low as the waist, in others, close as high as the sleeve. the sleeve underneath as low as the elbow is open, that part being left very full. the sides tail and upper part of the sleeves are deeply fringed and sometimes ornimented in a similar manner with the shirts of the men with the addition of little patches of red cloth about the tail edged around with beads. the breast is usually ornament[e]d with various figures of party colours rought with the quills of the Porcupine. it is on this part of the garment that they appear to exert their greatest engenuity. a girdle of dressed leather confines the Chemise around the waist. when either the man or the woman wish to disengage their arm from the sleeve they draw it out by means of the opening underneath the arm and throw the sleeve behind the body.1 1 The dresses of the women are a kind of shifts made of the skins of these goats and mountain sheep, which come down to the middle of the leg. Some of them have robes, but others none. Some of the men have shirts, and some are without any. Some also have robes made of beaver and buffaloe skins; but there are few of the former. I saw one made of ground[-]hog skins.—Gass (p. 179). the legings of the women reach as high as the knee and are confined with a garter below. the mockerson covers and confins it's lower extremity. they are neither fringed nor ornamented. these legings are made of the skins of the antelope and the Chemise usually of those of the large deer Bighorn and the smallest elk. They seldom wear the beads they possess about their necks; at least I have never seen a grown person of either sex wear them on this part; some [of] their children are seen with them in this way. the men and women were [wear] them suspen[ded] from the ear in little bunches or intermixed with triangular peices of the shells of the perl oister. the men also were them attached in a similar manner to the hare of the fore part of the crown of the head; to which they sometimes make the addition of the wings and tails of birds. the nose in neither sex is pierced nor do they wear any ornament in it. they have a variety of small sea shells of which they form collars woarn indiscriminately by both sexes. these as well as the shell of the perl oister they value very highly and inform us that they obtain them from their friends and relations who live beyond the barren plain towards the Ocean in a S. Westerly direction. these friends of theirs they say inhabit a good country abounding with Elk, deer, bear, and Antelope, and possess a much greater number of horses and mules than they do themselves; or using their own figure that their horses and mules are as numerous as the grass of the plains. the warriors or such as esteem themselves brave men wear collars made of the claws of the brown bear which are also esteemed of great value and are preserved with great care. these claws are ornamented with beads about the thick end near which they are peirced through their sides and strung on a throng of dressed leather and tyed about the neck commonly with the upper edge of the tallon next the breast or neck but sometimes are reversed. it is esteemed by them an act of equal celebrity the killing one of these bear or an enimy, and with the means they have of killing this animal it must really be a serious undertaking. the sweet sented grass which grows very abundant on this river is either twisted or plaited and woarn around the neck in ether sex, but most commonly by the men. they have a collar also woarn by either sex. it [is] generally round and about the size of a man's finger; formed of leather or silk-grass twisted or firmly rolled and covered with the quills of the porcupine of different colours. the tusks of the Elk are pierced strung on a throng and woarn as an orniment for the neck, and is most generally woarn by the women and children.1 1 This custom still prevails among some tribes. An illustrated article in the Chicago Record-Herald of Aug. 25, 1901, states that the writer visited an Indian village in southern Montana where it was estimated that 20,000 elk-teeth were in the possession of its inhabitants. On a mother and child were counted 600 of these ornaments, and another woman had the estimated number of 1,500 on her garments. They were highly valued by the Indians, who would seldom part with them. Three photographs of persons thus adorned were used to illustrate the article; the negatives are in the possession of L. E. Cavalier, of St. Paul.—Ed. the men frequently wear the skin of a fox or a broad strip of that of the otter around the forehead and head in form of a bando. they are also fond of the feathers of the tail of the beautifull eagle or callumet bird with which they ornament their own hair and the tails and mains of their horses. also a collar of round bones which look like the joints of a fishes back The dress of these people is quite as desent and convenient as that of any nation of Indians I ever saw. This morning early Capt. C. resumed his march; at the distance of five miles he arrived at some brush lodges of the Shoshones inhabited by about seven families. here he halted and was very friendly received by these people, who gave himself and party as much boiled salmon as they could eat; they also gave him several dryed salmon and a considerable quantity of dryed chokecherries. after smoking with them he visited their fish wear [weir] which was abut 200 yds. distant. he found the wear extended across four channels of the river which was here divided by three small islands. three of these channels were narrow, and were stoped by means of trees fallen across, supported by which stakes of willow were driven down sufficiently near each other to prevent the salmon from passing. about the center of each a cilindric basket of eighteen or 20 feet in length terminating in a conic shape at it's lower extremity, formed of willows, was opposed to a small apperture in the wear with it's mouth up stream to receive the fish. the main channel of the water was conducted to this basket, which was so narrow at it's lower extremity that the fish when once in could not turn itself about, and were taken out by untying the small ends of the longitudinal willows, which form the hull of the basket. the wear in the main channel was somewhat differently contrived. there were two distinct wears formed of poles and willow sticks, quite across the river, at no great distance from each other. each of these, were furnished with two baskets; the one wear to take them ascending and the other in decending. in constructing these wears, poles were first tyed together in parcels of three near the smaller extremity; these were set on end, and spread in a triangular form at the base, in such manner, that two of the three poles ranged in the direction of the intended work, and the third down the stream. two ranges of horizontal poles were next lashed with willow bark and wythes to the ranging poles, and on these willow sticks were placed perpendicularly, reaching from the bottom of the river to about 3 or four feet above it's surface; and placed so near each other, as not to permit the passage of the fish, and even so thick in some parts, as with the help of gravel and stone to give a direction to the water which they wished. the baskets were the same in form of the others. this is the form of the work, and disposition of the baskets. After examining the wears Capt. C. returned to the lodges, and shortly continued his rout and passed the river to the Lard side a little distance below the wears. he sent Collins with an Indian down the Lard. side of the river to the forks 5 M. in surch of Cruzatte who was left at the upper camp yesterday to purchase a horse and had followed on today and passed them by another road while they were at the lodges and had gone on to the forks. while Capt. Clark was at these lodges an Indian brought him a tomehawk which he said he found in the grass near the lodge where I had staid at the upper camp when I was first with his nation. the tommahawk was Drewyer's he missed it in the morning before we had set out and surched for it but it was not to be found I beleive the young fellow stole it, but if he did it is the only article they have pilfered and this was now returned. Capt. C. after traveling about 20 miles through the valley with the course of the river nearly N.W. encamped on the Stard. side in a small bottom under a high Clift of rocks. on his way one of the party killed a very large Salmon in a creek which they passed at the distance of 14 Ms. he was joined this evening by Cruzatte and Collins who brought with them five fresh salmon which had been given them by the Indians at the forks. the forks of this river is famous as a gig fishery and is much resorted [to] by the natives. They killed one deer today. The Guide apeared to be a very friendly intelligent old man, Capt. C. is much pleased with him.

Frost last night proceeded on with the Indians I met about 5 miles to there Camp, I entered a lodge and after smokeing with all who Came about me I went to see the place those people take the fish, a wear across the Creek in which there is Stuk baskets Set in different derections So as to take the fish either decending or assending on my return to the Camp which was 200 yards only the different lodges (which is only bushes) brought in to the lodge I was introduced into, Sammon boiled, and dried Choke Chers. Sufficent for all my party. one man brought me a tomahawk which we expected they had Stolen from a man of Cap Lewis's party, this man informed me he found the tomak. in the grass near the place the man Slept. Crossed the River and went over a point of high land &amp; Struck it again near a Bluff on the right Side; the man I left to get a horse at the upper Camp missed me &amp; went to the forks which is about five miles below the last Camp. I sent one man by the forks with derections to join me to night with the one now at that place, those two men joined me at my Camp on the right Side below the 1st. Clift with 5 Sammon which the Indians gave them at the forks, the place they gig fish at this season. Their method of takeing fish with a gig or bone is with a long pole, about a foot from one End is a Strong String attached to the pole, this String is a little more than a foot long and is tied to the middle of a bone from 4 to 6 inches long, one end Sharp the other with a whole to fasten on the end of the pole with a beard [i. e., barb] to the large end, the[y] fasten this bone on one end &amp; with the other, feel for the fish &amp; turn and Strike them So hard that the bone passes through and Catches on the opposit Side, Slips off the End of the pole and holds the Center of the bone Those Indians are mild in their disposition, appear Sincere in their friendship, punctial, and decided. kind with what they have, to spare. They are excessive pore, nothing but horses there Enemies which are noumerous on account of there horses &amp; Defenceless Situation, have deprived them of tents and all the Small Conveniances of life. They have only a few indifferent Knives, no ax, make use of Elk's horn Sharpened to Sp[l]it ther wood, no clothes except a Short Legins &amp; robes of different animals, Beaver, Bear, Buffalow, wolf Panther, Ibex (Sheep), Deer, but most commonly the antilope Skins which they ware loosely about them. Their ornements are Orter Skin d[e]curated with See Shells &amp; the Skins &amp; tales of the white weasel, Sea Shels of different size hung to their Ears hair and breast of their Shirts, beeds of Shells platted Grass, and Small strings of otter Skin dressed, they are fond of our trinkets, and give us those ornements as the most valueable of their possession. The women are held more sacred among them than any nation we have seen and appear to have an equal Shere in all conversation, which is not the Case in any other nation I have seen. their boys &amp; girls are also admited to speak except in Councels, the women doe all the drugery except fishing and takeing care of the horses, which the men apr. to take upon themselves. The men ware the hair loose flowing over ther Sholders &amp; face, the women Cut Short, ornements of the back bones of fish Strung, plated grass grains of Corn Strung Feathers and orniments of Birds Claws of the Bear encurcling their necks the most sacred of all the orniments of this nation is the Sea Shells of various Sizes and Shapes and colours, of the bassterd perl kind, which they inform us they get from the Indians to the South on the other Side of a large fork of this river in passing to which they have to pass thro: Sandy &amp; barren open plains without water to which place they can travel in 15 or 20 days. The men who passed by the forks informed me that the S W. fork was double the Size of the one I came down, and I observed that it was a handsom river at my camp I shall in justice to Capt. Lewis who was the first white man ever on this fork of the Columbia Call this Louis's [Lewis's] river. one Deer killed this morning, and a Sammon in the last Creek 2 ? feet long The Westerley fork of the Columbia River is double the Size of the Easterley fork &amp; below those forks the river is about the Size [of] Jeffersons River near its mouth or 100 yards wide, it is verry rapid &amp; Sholey water Clear, but little timber. This Clift is of a redish brown Colour, the rocks which fall from it is a dark brown flint tinged with that Colour. Some Gullies of white Sand Stone and Sand fine &amp; a[s] white as Snow.

[Lewis:] Thursday August 22ed. 1805. This morning early I sent a couple of men to complete the covering of the cash which could not be done well last night in the dark, they soon accomplished their work and returned. late last night Drewyer returned with a fawn he had killed and a considerable quantity of Indian plunder. the anecdote with rispect to the latter is perhaps worthy of relation. he informed me that while hunting in the Cove yesterday about 12 OCk. he came suddonly upon an Indian Camp, at which there were a young man an Old man and a boy and three women, that they seemed but little supprised at seeing him and he rode up to them and dismounted turning [his] horse out to graize. these people had just finished their repast on some roots, he entered into conversation with them by signs, and after about 20 minutes one of the women spoke to the others of the party and they all went immediately and collected their horses brought them to camp and saddled them at this moment he thought he would also set out and continue his hunt, and accorgingly walked to catch his horse at some little distance and neglected to take up his gun which he left at camp, the Indians perceiving him at the distance of fifty paces immediately mounted their horses, the young man took the gun, and the whole of them left their baggage and laid whip to their horses directing their course to the pass of the mountains. finding himself deprived of his gun he immediately mounted his horse and pursued; after runing them about 10 miles the horses of two of the women nearly gave out and the young fellow with the gun from their frequent crys slackened his pace and being on a very fleet horse road around the women at a little distance at length Drewer overtook the women and by signs convinced them that he did not wish to hirt them they then halted and the young fellow approached still nearer, he asked him for his gun but the only part of the answer which he could understand was pahkee which he knew to be the name by which they called their enimies. watching his opportunity when the fellow was off his guard he suddonly rode along side of him seized his gun and wrest[ed] her out of his hands. the fellow finding Drewyer too strong for him and discovering that he must yeald the gun had p[r]esents of mind to open the pan and cast the priming before he let the gun escape from his hands; now finding himself devested of the gun he turned his horse about and laid whip leaving the women to follow him as well as they could. Drewyer now returned to the place they had left their baggage and brought it with him to my camp. it consisted of several dressed and undressed skins; a couple of bags wove with the fingers of the bark of the silk-grass containing each about a bushel of dryed service burries some ch[ok]echerry cakes and about a bushel of roots of three different kinds dryed and prepared for uce which were foalded in as many parchment hides of buffaloe. some flint and the instrument of bone for manufactureing the flint into arrow points. some of this flint was as transparent as the common black glass and much of the same colour, easily broken, and flaked of[f] much like glass leaving a very sharp edge.1 1 This "black glass flint" was undoubtedly obsidian, or natural volcanic glass. This is found in various parts of the West, the large and noted Obsidian Cliff in Yellowstone Park being the best known. The tribes formerly had a quarry there, and the spawls and arrowheads and spear-points thus obtained were bartered from tribe to tribe, as were red pipestone calumets.—O. D. Wheeler. one speceis of the roots were fusiform abo[u]t six inches long and about the size of a man's finger at the larger end tapering to a small point. the radicles larger than in most fusiform roots. the rind was white and thin. the body or consistence of the root was white mealy and easily reduced by pounding to a substance resembleing flour which thickens with boiling water something like flour and is agreeably flavored. this rout is frequently eaten by the Indians either green or in it's dryed state without the preparation of boiling. another speceis was much mutilated but appeared to be fibrous; the parts were brittle, hard, of the size of a small quill, cilindric and as white as snow throughout, except some small parts of the hard black rind which they had not seperated in the preperation. this the Indians with me informed were always boiled for use. I made the exp[e]riment, found that they became perfectly soft by boiling, but had a very bitter taste, which was naucious to my pallate, and I transfered them to the Indians who had eat them heartily. a third speceis were about the size of a nutmeg, and of an irregularly rounded form, something like the smallest of the Jarusalem artichoke, which they also resemble in every other appearance. they had become very hard by being dryed, these I also boiled agreeably to the instruction of the Indians and found them very agreeable. they resemble the Jerusalem Artichoke very much in their flavor and I thought them preferable, however there is some allowance to be made for the length of time I have now been without vegitable food to which I was always much attatched. these are certainly the best root[s] I have yet seen in uce among the Indians. I asked the Indians to shew me the plant of which these roots formed a part but they informed me that neither of them grew near this place.1 1 It is not easy to identify these roots fully, as Lewis could describe only the dried tuber, without seeing the plant. The first named was probably that of dill (Carum, or Anethum), called by the Shoshoni Indians yampah. The third was probably the wild artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus). Coues thinks that the other is Lewisia rediviva (Fr. racine amère, "bitter root"—giving name to the Bitter Root Mountains). See Edward Palmer's "Food Products of the North American Indians," in Report of U. S. Commissioner of Agriculture, 1871, pp. 404–428.—Ed. I had set most of the men at work today to dress the deerskin belonging to those who had gone on command with Capt. Clark. at II.A.M. Charbono, the Indian Woman, Cameahwait and about 50 men with a number of women and children arrived. they encamped near us. after they had turned out their horses and arranged their camp I called the Cheifs and warriors together and addressed them a second time; gave them some further presents, particularly the second and third Cheifs who it appeared had agreeably to their promise exerted themselves in my favour, having no fresh meat and these poor devils half starved I had previously prepared a good meal for them all of boiled corn and beans which I gave them as soon as the council was over and I had distributed the presents. this was thankfully received by them. the Cheif wished that his nation could live in a country where they could provide such food. I told him that it would not be many years before the white-men would put it in the power of his nation to live in the country below the mountains where they might cultivate corn beans and squashes. he appeared much pleased with the information. I gave him a few dryed squashes which we had brought from the Mandans he had them boiled and declared them to be the best thing he had ever tasted except sugar, a small lump of which it seems his sister Sah-cah-gar Wea had given him. late in the evening I made the men form a bush drag, and with it in about 2 hours they caught 528 very good fish, most of them large trout. among them I now for the first time saw ten or a douzen of a white speceis of trout. they are of a silvery colour except on the back and head, where they are of a bluish cast. the scales are much larger than the speckled trout, but in their form position of their fins teeth mouth &amp;c they are precisely like them. they are not generally quite as large but equally well flavored.1 1 Probably the common blue-backed salmon of the Columbia (Oncorhyncus nerka.)—Ed. I distributed much the greater portion of the fish among the Indians. I purchased five good horses of them very reasonably, or at least for about the value of six dollars a peice in merchandize. the Indians are very orderly and do not croud about our camp nor attempt to disterb any article they see lying about. they borrow knives kettles &amp;c from the men and always carefully return them. Capt Clark says, "we set out early and passed a small creek at one mile, also the points of four mountains which were high steep and rocky. the mountains are so steep that it is almost incredible to mention that horses had passed them. our road in many places lay over the sharp fragments of rocks which had fallen from the mountains and lay in confused heaps for miles together; yet notwithstanding our horsed[s] traveled barefoot [i.e., unshod] over them as fast as we could and did not detain us. passed two bold runing streams, and arrived at the entrance of a small river where some Indian families resided. they had some scaffoalds of fish and burries exposed to dry. they were not acquainted with the circumstance of any whitemen being in their country and were therefore much allarmed on our approach several of the women and children fled in the woods for shelter. the guide was behind and the wood thick in which their lodges were situated we came on them before they had the least notice of us. those who remained offered us every thing they had, which was but little; they offered us collars of elks tusks which their children woar, Salmon beries &amp;c we eat some of their fish and buries but returned them the other articles they had offered with a present of some small articles which seemed to add much to their pacification. The guide who had by this time arrived explained to them who we were and our object in visiting them; but still there were some of the women and Children inconsoleable, they continued to cry during our stay, which was about an hour. a road passes up this river which my guide informed me led over the mountains to the Missouri. from this place I continued my rout along the steep side of a mountain for about 3 miles and arrived at the river near a small Island on the lower point of which we encamped. in the evening we attempted to gig fish but were unsuccessfull only obtaining one small salmon. in the course of the day we had passed several women and children geathering burries who were very liberal in bestoing us a part of their collections. the river is very rapid and shoaly; many rocks lie in various derections scattered throughout it's bed. There are some few small pine scattered through the bottoms, of which I only saw one which appeared as if it would answer for a canoe and that was but small. the tops of the mountains on the Lard. side are covered with pine and some also scattered on the sides of all the mountains. I saw today a speceis of woodpecker, which fed on the seeds of the pine. it's beak and tail were white, it's wings were black, and every other part of a dark brown. it was about the size of a robin.1 1 This bird is now known as the American nutcracker (Picicorvus columbianus). Here ends Codex F.—Ed. ["] [Clark:] August 22d. Thursday 1805. We Set out early passed a Small Creek on the right at 1 mile and the points of four mountains verry Steup high &amp; rockey, the assent of three was So Steup that it is incredeable to describe the rocks in maney places loose &amp; Sliped from those mountains and is a Solid bed of rugid loose white and dark brown loose rock for miles. the Indian horses pass over those Clifts hills beds &amp; rocks as fast as a man, the three horses with me do not detain me any on account of those dificulties, passed two bold rung. Streams on the right and a Small river2 2 Now the north fork of Salmon River.—Ed. [Fisher. also on the right] at the mouth of which Several families of Indians were encamped and had Several Scaffolds of fish &amp; buries drying we allarmed them verry much as they knew nothing of a white man being in their Countrey, and at the time we approached their lodges which was in a thick place of bushes my guides were behind. They offered every thing they possessed (which was verry little) to us, Some run off and hid in the bushes The first offer of theirs were Elks tushes from around their childrens necks, Sammon &amp;c. my guide attempted [to] passify those people and they Set before me berri[e]s, &amp; fish to eate,3 3 Those of the natives who are detached in small parties appear to live better, and to have a larger supply of provisions, than those who live in large villages. The people of these three lodges have gathered a quantity of sun-flower seed, and also of the lambs-quarter [Chenopodium], which they pound and mix with service-berries, and make of the composition a kind of bread, which appears capable of sustaining life for some time. On this bread and the fish they take out of the river, these people, who appear to be the most wretched of the human species, chiefly subsist.—Gass (pp. 177, 178; cf. 183). I gave a fiew Small articles to those fritened people which added verry much to their pasification but not entirely as some of the women &amp; Childn. Cried dureing my Stay of an hour at this place, I proceeded on the Side of a verry Steep &amp; rockey mountain for 3 miles and Encamped on the lower pt. of an Island we attempted to gig fish without Suckcess caught but one Small one. The last Creek or Small river is on the right Side and "a road passes up it &amp; over to the Missouri" (to Wisdom) (From Several of these Streams roads go across to Wisdom River) in this day passed Several womin and Children gathering and drying buries of which they were very kind and gave us a part. the river rapid and Sholey maney Stones Scattered through it in different directions. I saw to day [a] Bird of the woodpecker kind which fed on Pine burs its Bill and tale white the wings black every other part of a light brown, and about the Size of a robin. Some fiew Pine scattered in the bottoms &amp; Sides of the Mountains (the Top of the Mtn. to the left Covered &amp; inaxcessable) I saw one which would make a Small Canoe. [Lewis:]1 1 Lewis's entries for August 23–26 are made on a few loose sheets, designated by Coues as Codex Fb.—Ed. Friday August 23rd. 1805. This morning I arrose very early and despatched two hunters on horseback with orders to extend their hunt to a greater distance up the S. E. fork than they had done heretofore, in order if possible to obtain some meet for ourselves as well as the Indians who appeared to depend on us for food and our store of provision is growing too low to indulge them with much more corn or flour. I wished to have set out this morning but the cheif requested that I would wait untill another party of his nation arrived which he expected today, to this I consented from necessity, and therefore sent out the hunters as I have mentioned. I also laid up the canoes this morning in a pond near the forks; sunk them in the water and weighted them down with stone, after taking out the plugs of the gage holes in their bottoms; hoping by this means to guard against both the effects of high water, and that of the fire which is frequently kindled in these plains by the natives. the Indians have promised to do them no intentional injury and [I] beleive they are too laizy at any rate to give themselves the trouble to raise them from their present situation in order to cut or birn them. I reminded the chief of the low state of our stores of provision and advised him to send his young men to hunt, which he immediately recommended to them and most of them turned out. I wished to have purchased some more horses of them but they objected against disposing of any more of them untill we reach their camp beyond the mountains. the Indians pursued a mule buck1 1 Meaning a buck of the mule, or black-tailed, deer (Cariacus macrotis).—Ed. near our camp I saw this chase for about 4 miles it was really entertaining, there were about twelve of them in pursuit of it on horseback, they finally rode it down and killed it. the[y] all came in about 1. P. M. having killed 2 mule deer and three goats. this mule buck was the largest deer of any kind I had ever seen. it was nearly as large as a doe Elk. I observed that there was but little division or distribution of the meat they had taken among themselves. some familes had a large stock and others none. this is not custumary among the nations of Indians with whom I have hitherto been acquainted. I asked Cameahwait the reason why the hunters did not divide the meat among themselves; he said that meat was so scarce with them that the men who killed it reserved it for themselves and their own families. my hunters arrived about 2 in the evening with two mule deer and three common deer. I distributed three of the deer among those families who appeared to have nothing to eat. at three P. M. the expected party of Indians arrived, about 50 men women and children. I now learnt that most of them were thus far on their way down the valley towards the buffaloe country, and observed that there was a good deel of anxiety on the part of some of those who had promised to assist me over the mountains to accompany this party; I felt some uneasiness on this subject but as they still said they would return with me as they had promised I said nothing to them but resolved to set out in the morning as early as possible. I dispatched two hunters this evening into the cove to hunt and leave the meat they might kill on the rout we shall pass tomorrow. The metal which we found in possession of these people consi[s]ted of a few indifferent knives, a few brass kettles some arm bands of iron and brass, a few buttons, woarn as ornaments in their hair, a spear or two of a foot in length and some iron and brass arrow points which they informed me they obtained in exchange for horses from the Crow or Rocky Mountain Indians on the yellowstone River. the bridlebits and stirreps they obtained from the Spaniards, tho these were but few. many of them made use of flint for knives, and with this instrument, skined the animals they killed, dressed their fish and made their arrows; in short they used it for every purpose to which the knife is applyed. this flint is of no regular form, and if they can only obtain a part of it, an inch or two in length that will cut they are satisfyed. they renew the edge by flecking off the flint by means of the point of an Elk's or deer's horn. with the point of a deer or Elk's horn they also form their arrow points of the flint, with a quickness and neatness that is really astonishing. we found no axes nor hatchets among them; what wood they cut was done either with stone or Elk's horn. the latter they use always to rive or split their wood. their culinary eutensils exclusive of the brass kettle before mentioned consist of pots in the form of a jar made either of earth, or of a white soft stone which becomes black and very hard by birning, and is found in the hills near the three forks of the Missouri betwen Madison's and Gallitin's rivers.1 1 These people make willow baskets so close, and to such perfection, as to hold water, for which purpose they make use of them.—Gass (p. 183). they have also spoons made of the Buffaloe's horn and those of the Bighorn. Their bows are made of ceader or pine and have nothing remarkable about them. the back of the bow is covered with sinues and glue and is about 2 ? feet long. much the shape of those used by the Siouxs Mandans Minnetares &amp;c. their arrows are more slender generally than those used by the nations just mentioned but much the same in construction. Their sheild is formed of buffaloe hide, perfectly arrow proof, and is a circle of 2 feet 4 I. or 2 F. 6 I. in diameter. this is frequently painted with varios figures and ornamented around the edges with feather[s] and a fringe of dressed leather. they sometimes make bows of the Elk's horn and those also of the bighorn. those of the Elk's horn are made of a single peice and covered on the back with glue and sinues like those made of wood, and are frequently ornamented with a stran[d] wrought [of] porcupine quills and sinues raped around them for some distance at both extremities. the bows of the bighorn are formed of small peices laid flat and cemented with gleue, and rolled with siniws, after which, they are also covered on the back with sinews and glew, and highly ornamented as they are much prized. forming the sheild is a cerimony of great importance among them, this implement would in their minds be devested of much of its protecting power were it not inspired with those virtues by their old men and jugglers. their method of preparing it is thus, an entire skin of a bull buffaloe two years old is first provided; a feast is next prepared and all the warriors old men and jugglers invited to partake. a hole is sunk in the ground about the same in diameter with the intended sheild and about 18 inches deep. a parcel of stones are now made red hot and thrown into the hole water is next thrown in and the hot stones cause it to emit a very strong hot steem, over this they spread the green skin which must not have been suffered to dry after taken off the beast. the flesh side is laid next to the groround and as many of the workmen as can reach it take hold on it's edges and extend it in every direction. as the skin becomes heated, the hair seperates and is taken of[f] with the fingers, and the skin continues to contract untill the who[l]e is drawn within the compas designed for the shield, it is then taken off and laid on a parchment hide where they pound it with their heels when barefoot. this operation of pounding continues for several days or as long as the feast lasts when it is delivered to the propryeter and declared by the jugglers and old men to be a sufficient defence against the arrows of their enimies or even bullets if [the] feast has been a satisfactory one. many of them beleive implisitly that a ball cannot penitrate their sheilds, in consequence of certain superna[t]ural powers with which they have been inspired by their jugglers. The Pog?gâmog?gon is an instrument with a handle of wood covered with dressed leather about the size of a whip handle and 22 inches long; a round stone of 2 pounds weight is also covered with leather and strongly united to the leather of the handle by a throng of 2 inches long; a loop of leather united to the handle passes arond the wrist. a very heavy blow may be given with this instrument. They have also a kind of armor which they form with many foalds of dressed a[n]telope's skin, unite with glue and sand. with this they cover their own bodies and those of their horses. these are sufficient against the effects of the arrow. the quiver which contains their arrows and implements for making fire is formed of various skins. that of the Otter seems to be prefered. they are but narrow, of a length sufficent to protect the arrow from the weather, and are woarn on the back by means of a strap which passes over the left sholder and under the wright arm. their impliments for making fire is nothing more than a blunt arrow and a peice of well seasoned soft spongey wood such as the willow or cottonwood. the point of this arrow they apply to this dry stick so near one edge of it that the particles of wood which are seperated from it by the friction of the arrow falls down by it's side in a little pile. the arrow is held between the palms of the hand with the fingers extended, and being pressed as much as possible against the peice is briskly rolled between the palms of the hands backwards and forwards by pressing the arrow downwards the hands of course in rolling [the] arrow also decend; they bring them back with a quick motion and repeat the operation till the dust by the friction takes fire; the peice and arrow are then removed and some dry grass or dooted [rotted] wood is added. it astonished me to see in what little time these people would kindle fire in this way. in less than a minute they will produce fire.1 1 Cf. the account by Gass (pp. 182, 183). For aboriginal methods and implements used in fire-making, see Ies. Relations, vi, p. 217; xii, 117, 272; xxii, 267, 319; and Hough's "Fire-making apparatus," in U. S. Nat. Mus. Rep., 1887–88, pp. 531–587.—Ed. Capt. Clark set out this morning very early and poroceeded but slowly in consequence of the difficulty of his road which lay along the steep side of a mountain over large irregular and broken masses of rocks which had tumbled from the upper part of the mountain. it was with much wrisk and pain that the horses could get on. at the distance of four miles he arrived at the river and the rocks were here so steep and juted into the river [in] such manner that there was no other alternative but passing through the river, this he attempted with success tho' water was so deep for a short distance as to swim the horses and was very rapid; he continued his rout one mile along the edge of the river under this steep Clift to a little bottom, below which the whole current of the river beat against the Stard. shore on which he was, and which was formed of a solid rock perfectly inaccessible to horses. here also the little track which he had been pursuing, terminated. he therefore determined to leave the horses and the majority of the party here and with his guide and three men to continue his rout down the river still further, in order more fully to satisfy himself as to it's practicability. accordingly he directed the men to hunt and fish at this place untill his return. they had not killed anything today but one goose, and the ballance of the little provision they had brought with them, as well as the five salmon they had procured yesterday were consumed last evening; there was of cour[s]e no inducement for his halting any time, at this place; after a few minutes he continued his rout clambering over immence rocks and along the sides of lofty precepices on the border of the river to the distance of 12 miles, at which place a large creek discharged itself on the No[r]th side 12 yds. wide and deep. a short distance above the entrance of this creek there is a narrow bottom which is the first that he had found on the river from that in which he left the horses and party. a plain indian road led up this creek which the guide informed him led to a large river that ran to the North, and was frequented by another nation who occasionally visited this river for the purpose of taking fish. at this place he saw some late appearance of Indians having been encamped and the tracks of a number of horses. Capt. C. halted here about 2 hours, caught some small fish, on which, with the addition of some berries, they dined. the river from the place at which he left the party to his present station was one continued rapid, in which there were five shoals neither of which could be passed with loaded canoes nor even run with empty ones. at those several places therefore it would be necessary to unload and transport the baggage for a considerable distance over steep and almost inaccessable rocks where there was no possibility of employing horses for the releif of the men; the canoes would next have to be let down by cords and even with this precaution Capt. C. conceived there would be much wrisk of both canoes and men. at one of those shoals the lofty perpendicular rocks which from [form] the bases of the mountains approach the river so nearly on each side, as to prevent the possibility of a portage, or passage for the canoes without expending much labour in removing rocks and cuting away the earth in some places. to surmount These difficulties, precautions must be observed which in their execution must necessarily consume much time and provision, neither of which we can command. the season is now [too] far advanced to remain in these mountains as the Indians inform us we shall shortly have snow; the salmon have so far declined that they are themselves haistening from the country and not an animal of any discription is to be seen in this difficult part of the river larger than a pheasant or a squirrel and they not abundant; add to this that our stock of provision is now so low that it would not support us more than ten days. the bends of the river are short and the currant beats from side to side against the rocks with great violence. the river is about 100 yds. wide and so deep that it cannot be foarded but in a few places; and the rocks approach the river so near in most places that there is no possibility of passing between them and the water; a passage therefore with horses along the river is also impracticable. The sides of these mountains present generally one barren surface of confused and broken masses of stone. above these are white or brown and towards the base of a grey colour and so hard that when struck with a steel, yeald fire like flint. those he had just past were scarcely releived by the appearance of a tree; but those below the entrance of the creek were better covered with timber, and there were also some tall pine near the river. The sides of the mountains are very steep, and the torrents of water which roll down their sides at certain seasons appear to carry with them vast quantities of the loose stone into the river. after dinner Capt. C. continued his rout down the river and at ? a mile pased another creek not so large as that just mentioned, or about 5 yards wide. here his guide informed him that by ascending this creek some distance they would have a better road and would cut off a considerable bend which the river made to the south; accordingly he pursued a well beaten Indian track which led up this creek about six miles, then leaving the creek on the wright he passed over a ridge, and at the distance of a mile arrived at the river where it passes through a well timbered bottom of about eighty acres of land; they passed this bottom and asscended a steep and elivated point of a mountain, from whence the guide shewed him the brake of the river through the mountains for about 20 miles further. this view was terminated by one of the most lofty mountains, Capt. C. informed me, he had ever seen which was perfectly covered with snow. the river directed it's course immediately to this stupendous mountain at the bace of which the gu[i]de informed him those difficulties of which himself and nation had spoken, commenced. that after the river reached this mountain it continued it's rout to the North for many miles between high and perpendicular rocks, roling foaming and beating against innumerable rocks which crouded it's channel; that then it penetrated the mountain through a narrow gap leaving a perpendicular rock on either side as high as the top of the mountain which he beheld. that the river here making a bend they could not see through the mountain, and as it was impossible to decend the river or clamber over that vast mountain covered with eternal snow neither himself nor any of his nation had ever been lower in this direction, than in view of the place at which the river entered this mountain; that if Capt. C. wished him to do so, he would conduct him to that place, where he thought they could probably arrive by the next evening. Capt. C. being now perfictly satisfyed as to the impracticability of this rout either by land or water, informed the old man, that he was convinced of the varacity of his assertions and would now return to the village from whence they had set out where he expected to meet myself and party. they now returned to the upper part of the last creek he had passed, and encamped. it was an hour after dark before he reached this place. a small river falls into this fork of the Columbia just above the high mountain through which it passes on the south side. [Clark:] August 23rd.. Friday 1805. We Set out early proceed on with great dificuelty as the rocks were So sharp large and unsettled and the hill sides Steep that the horses could with the greatest risque and dificulty get on, no provisions as the 5 Sammon given us yesterday by the Indians were eaten last night, one goose killed this morning; at 4 miles we came to a place the horses Could not pass without going into the river, we passed one mile to a verry bad riffle the water confined in a narrow Channel &amp; beeting against the left Shore, as we have no parth further and the Mounts. jut So close as to prevent the possibility of horses proceeding down, I Deturmined to delay the party here and with my guide and three men proceed on down to examine if the river continued bad or was practi[c]able, I set out with three men directing those left to hunt and fish until my return. I proceeded on. Sometimes in a Small wolf parth &amp; at other times Climing over the rocks for 12 miles to a large Creek on the right Side above the mouth of this Creek for a Short distance is a narrow bottom &amp; the first, below the place I left my party. a road passes down this Creek which I understood passed to the water of a River which run to the North &amp; was the ground of another nation, Some fresh Sign about this Creek of horse[s] and Camps. I delayd. 2 hours to fish, Cought Some Small fish on which we dined. The River from the place I left my party to this Creek is almost one continued rapid, five verry considerable rapids the passage of either with Canoes is entirely impossible, as the water is Confined between huge Rocks &amp; the Current beeting from one against another for Some distance below &amp;c. &amp;c. at one of those rapids the mountains close so Clost as to prevent a possibility of a portage with [out] great labour in cutting down the Side of the hill removeing large rocks &amp;c. &amp;c. all the others may be passed by takeing every thing over slipery rocks, and the Smaller ones Passed by letting down the Canoes empty with Cords, as running them would certainly be productive of the loss of Some Canoes, those dificulties and necessary precautions would delay us an emence time in which provisions would be necessary. (we have but little and nothing to be procured in this quarter except Choke Cheres &amp; red haws not an animal of any kind to be Seen and only the track of a Bear) below this Creek the lofty Pine is thick in the bottom hill Sides on the mountains &amp; up the runs. The river has much the resemblance of that above bends Shorter and no passing after a few miles between the river &amp; the mountains &amp; the Current so Strong that [it] is dangerous crossing the river, and to proceed down it would rend. it necessary to Cross almost at every bend this river is about 100 yards wide and can be forded but in a few places. below my guide and maney other Indians tell me that the Mountains Close and is a perpendicular Clift on each Side, and Continues for a great distance and that the water runs with great violence from one rock to the other on each Side foaming &amp; roreing thro rocks in every direction, So as to render the passage of any thing impossible. those rapids which I had Seen he said was Small &amp; trifleing in comparrison to the rocks &amp; rapids below, at no great distance &amp; The Hills or mountains were not like those I had Seen but like the Side of a tree Streight up. Those Mountains which I had passed were Steep Contain a white, a brown, &amp; low down a Grey hard stone which would make fire, those Stone were of different Sizes all Sharp and are continuly Slipping down, and in maney places one bed of those Stones inclined from the river bottom to the top of the mountains. The Torrents of water which come down after a rain carries with it emence numbers of those Stone[s] into the river1 1 The rest of this paragraph was evidently written at a later time—probably when Clark and Biddle were preparing the MSS. for publication.—Ed. about ? a mile below the last mentioned Creek another Creek falls in, my guide informed me that our rout was up this Creek by which rout we would Save a considerable bend of the river to the South. we proceeded on a well beeten Indian parth up this creak (Berry Creek) about 6 miles and passed over a ridge 1 mile to the river in a Small vally through which we passed and assended a Spur of the Mountain from which place my guide Shew[ed] me the river for about 20 miles lower &amp; pointed out the dificulties1 1 This point was on the Salmon River, 52 miles below its confluence with the Lemhi. Finding it impossible to go further by this route, the expedition was compelled to march northward through the mountains over nearly two degrees of latitude, to a point almost west of the Missouri "gates of the Rockies," before it could again strike for the waters of the Columbia.—Ed. we returned to the last creek &amp; camped about one hour after dark. (There my guide Shewed me a road from the N Which came into the one I was in which he Said went to a large river which run to the north on which was a nation he called Tushapaws,2 2 Who having no salmon in their river, came by these roads to the fish weirs on Lewis's river. He had himself been among these Tushepaws, and having once accompanied them on a fishing party to another river he had there seen Indians who had come across the rocky mountains.—Biddle (i, p. 402). This tribe (named Tussapa by Gass, and Tut-seé-wâs in Lewis's "Statistical View") belonged to the Salishan family, which includes numerous tribes, commonly known as Flatheads; their habitat extended from western Montana to the Pacific coast, and north to the 53rd parallel. At present, about one-third of them live on reservations in Washington, the rest in British Columbia. See Powell's account of them in U. S. Bur. Ethnol. Rep., 1885–86, pp. 104–105.—Ed. — he made a map of it.) [Lewis:] Saturday August 24th.. 1805. As the Indians who were on their way down the Missouri had a number of spare ho[r]ses with them I thought it probable that I could obtain some of them and therefore desired the Cheif to speak to them and inform me whether they would trade. they gave no positive answer but requested to see the goods which I was willing to give in exchange. I now produced some battle axes which I had made at Fort Mandan with which they were much pleased. knives also seemed in great demand among them. I soon purchased three horses and a mule. for each horse I gave an ax a knife handkercheif and a little paint; &amp; for the mule the addition of a knife a shirt handkercheif and a pair of legings; at this price which was quite double that given for the horses, the fellow who sold him made a merit of having bestoed [on] me one of his mules. I consider this mule a great acquisition. these Indians soon told me that they had no more horses for sale and I directed the party to prepare to set out. I had now nine horses and a mule, and two which I had hired made twelve these I had loaded and the Indian women took the ballance of the baggage. I had given the Interpreter some articles with which to purchase a horse for the woman which he had obtained. at twelve Oclock we set out and passed the river below the forks, directing our rout towards the cove along the track formerly mentioned. most of the horses were heavily laden, and it appears to me that it will require at least 25 horses to convey our baggage along such roads as I expect we shall be obliged to pass in the mountains. I had now the inexpressible satisfaction to find myself once more under way with all my baggage and party. an Indian had the politeness to offer me one of his horses to ride which I accepted with cheerfullness as it enabled me to attend better to the march of the party. I had reached the lower part of the cove when an Indian rode up and informed me that one of my men was very sick and unable to come on. I directed the party to halt at a small run which falls into the creek on Lard. at the lower part of the Cove and rode back about 2 Miles where I found Wiser very ill with a fit of the cholic. I sent Sergt. Ordway who had remained with him for some water and gave him a doze of the essence of Peppermint and laudinum which in the course of half an hour so far recovered him that he was enabled to ride my horse and I proceeded on foot and rejoined the party. the sun was yet an hour high but the Indians who had for some time impatiently waited my return at length unloaded and turned out their horses and my party had followed there example. as it was so late and the Indians had prepared their camp for the night I thought it best to acquiess and determined also to remain. we had traveled only about six miles. after we encamped we had a slight shower of rain. Goodrich who is our principal fisherman caught several fine trout. Drewyer came to us late in the evening and had not killed anything. I gave the Indians who were absolutely engaged in transporting the baggage, a little corn as they had nothing to eat. I told Cameahwait that my stock of provision was too small to indulge all his people with provision and recommended it to him to advise such as were not assisting us with our baggage to go on to their camp to morrow and wait our arrival; which he did accordingly. Cameahwait literally translated is one who never walks. he told me that his nation had also given him another name by which he was signalized as a warrior which was Too-et?-te-ca?-e or Black gun. these people have many names in the course of their lives, particularly if they become distinguished characters. for it seems that every important event by which they happen to distinguish themselves intitles them to claim another name which is generally scelected by themselves and confirmed by the nation. those distinguishing acts are the killing and scalping an enemy, the killing a white bear, leading a party to war who happen to be successfull either in destroying their enemies or robing them of their horses, or individually stealing the horses of an enemy. these are considered acts of equal heroism among them, and that of killing an enemy without scalping him is considered of no importance; in fact the whole honour seems to be founded in the act of scalping, for if a man happens to slay a dozen of his enemies in action and others get the scalps or first lay their hand on the dead person the honor is lost to him who killed them and devolves on those who scalp or first touch them. Among the Shoshones, as well as all the Indians of America, bravery is esteemed the primary virtue; nor can any one become eminent among them who has not at some period of his life given proofs of his possessing this virtue. with them there can be no preferment without some warlike achievement, and so completely interwoven is this principle with the earliest Elements of thought that it will in my opinion prove a serious obstruction to the restoration of a general peace among the nations of the Missouri. while at Fort Mandan I was one day addressing some cheifs of the Minetares w[h]o visited us and pointing out to them the advantages of a state of peace with their neighbours over that of war in which they were engaged. the Chiefs who had already geathered their ha[r]vest of larals [laurels], and having forceably felt in many instances some of those inconveniences attending a state of war which I pointed out, readily agreed with me in opin[i]on. a young fellow under the full impression of the Idea I have just suggested asked me if they were in a state of peace with all their neighbours what the nation would do for Cheifs:? and added that the cheifs were now oald and must shortly die and that the nation could not exist without cheifs. taking as granted that there could be no other mode devised for making Cheifs but that which custom had established through the medium of warlike ac[h]ievements. The few guns which the Shoshones have1 1 They have but four guns in the nation.—Gass (p. 179 are reserved for war almost exclusively and the bow and arrows are used in hunting. I have seen a few skins among these people which have almost every appearance of the common sheep. they inform me that they finde this animal on the high mountains to the West and S. W. of them. it is about the size of the common sheep, the wool is reather shorter and more intermixed with long hairs particularly on the upper part of the neck. these skins have been so much woarn that I could not form a just Idea of the animal or it's colour. the Indians however inform me that it is white and that it's horns are lunated comprest twisted and bent backward as those of the common sheep. the texture of the skin appears to be that of the sheep. I am now perfectly convinced that the sheep as well as the Bighorn exist in these mountains. (Capt. C saw one at a distance to day) The usual caparison of the Shoshone horse is a halter and saddle. the 1st. consists either of a round plated or twisted cord of six or seven strands of buffaloe's hair, or a throng of raw hide made pliant by pounding and rubing. these cords of bufaloe's hair are about the size of a man's finger and remarkably strong. this is the kind of halter which is prefered by them. the halter of whatever it may be composed is always of great length and is never taken from the neck of the horse which they commonly use at any time. it is first attatched at one end about the neck of the horse with a knot that will not slip, it is then brought down to his under jaw and being passed through the mouth imb[r]aces the under jaw and tonge in a simple noose formed by crossing the rope inderneath the jaw of the horse. this when mounted he draws up on the near side of the horse's neck and holds in the left hand, suffering it to trail at a great distance behind him—sometimes the halter is attatched so far from the end that while the shorter end serves him to govern his horse, the other trails on the grond as before mentioned. they put their horses to their full speed with those cords trailing on the ground. when they turn out the horse to graze the noose is mearly loosed from his mouth. the saddle is made of wood and covered with raw hide which holds the parts very firmly together. it is made like the pack saddles in uce among the French and Spaniords. it consists of two flat thin boards which fit the sides of the horses back, and are held firm by two peices which are united to them behind and before on the outer side and which rise to a considerable hight terminating sometimes in flat horizontal points extending outwards, and alwas in an accute angle or short bend underneath the upper part of these peices. a peice of buffaloe's skin with the hair on, is usually put underneath the saddle; and very seldom any covering on the saddle (but when they ride they throw on a piece of skin). stirrups when used are made of wood and covered with leather. these are generally used by the elderly men and women; the young men scarcely ever use anything more than a small pad of dressed leather stuffed with hair, which is confined with a leather thong passing around the body of the horse in the manner of a girth. they frequently paint their favorite horses, and cut their ears in various shapes. they also decorate their mains and tails, which they never draw or trim, with the feathers of birds, and sometimes suspend at the breast of the horse the finest ornaments they possess. the Spanish bridle is prefered by them when they can obtain them, but they never dispence with the cord about the neck of the horse, which serves them to take him with more ease when he is runing at large. They are excellent horsemen and extreemly expert in casting the cord about the neck of a horse, (make a noose &amp; catch him running &amp;c.) the horses that have been habituated to be taken with the cord in this way, however wild they may appear at first, surrender the moment they feel the cord about their necks. There are no horses in this quarter which can with propriety be termed wild. there are some few which have been left by the indians at large for so great a length of time that they have become shye, but they all shew marks of having been in possession of man. such is that one which Capt. Clark saw just below the three forks of the Missouri, and one other which I saw on the Missouri below the entrance of the Mussle shell river. Capt. Clark set out very early this morning on his return, he traveled down the creek to it's entrance by the same Indian track he had ascended it; at the river he marked his name on a pine tree, then ascended to the bottom above the second creek, and brekfasted on burries, which occupyed them about one hour. he now retraced his former track and joined the party where he had left them at 4 P. M. on his way Capt. C. fell from a rock and injured one of his legs very much. the party during his absence had killed a few pheasants and caught a few small fish on which together with haws and Serviceburies they had subsisted. they had also killed one cock of the mountain. Capt. Clark now wrote me a discription of the river and country, and stated our prospects by this rout as they have been heretofore mentioned (related the information of his gu[i]de &amp; recomd to me to purchase horses &amp;c he had learned from his guid[e] that he had been on the river to the N. where he saw people from the other side [of] the mountains and there was a road, the route he shewed in the sand, which gave me hope of finding a route across the m.[ountains] in that direction) and dispatched Colter on horseback with orders to loose no time reaching me. he set out late with the party continued his rout about two miles and encamped. Capt Clark had seen some trees which would make small canoes but all of them some distance below the Indian Ca[m]ps which he passed at the entrance of fish Creek. [Clark:] August 24th Satturday. 1805. Set out verry early this morning on my return passed down the [Berry] Creek at the Mouth Marked my name on a pine Tree, proceed[ed] on to the bottom above the Creek &amp; Brackfast on buries &amp; delayed 1 hour, then proceeded on up the river by the Same rout we decended to the place I left my party where we arrived at 4 oClock, (I sliped &amp; bruised my leg verry much on a rock) the party had killed several phesents and cought a fiew Small fish on which they had Subsisted in my absence. also a heath hen, near the size of a Small turkey. I wrote a letter to Capt Lewis informing him of the prospects before us and information rec[ei]ved of my guide which I thought favourable &amp;c. &amp; Stating two plans one of which for us to pursue &amp;c. and despatched one man &amp; horse and directed the party to get ready to march back, every man appeared disheartened from the prospects of the river, and nothing to eate, I Set out late and Camped 2 miles above, nothing to eate but Choke Cherries &amp; red haws, which act in different ways So as to make us Sick, dew verry heavy, my beding wet in passing around a rock the horses were obliged to go deep into the water. The plan I stated to Capt Lewis if he agrees with me we shall adopt is. to procure as many horses (one for each man) if possible and to hire my present guide who I sent on to him to interigate thro' the Intptr. and proceed on by land to Some navagable part of the Columbia River, or to the Ocean, depending on what provisions we can procure by the gun aded to the Small Stock we have on hand depending on our horses as the last resort. a second plan to divide the party one part to attempt this deficuelte river with what provisions we had, and the remainde[r] to pass by Land on ho[r]se back Depending on our gun &amp;c. for Provisions &amp;c. and come together occasionally on the river.1 1 In the Ms. is written, then crossed out, the following: "A third to devide. one party to attempt to pass the mountains by turns, and the other to return to the Missouri collect provisions &amp; go up Medeson river &amp;c."—Ed. the 1st. of which I would be most pleased with &amp;c. I saw Several trees which would make Small Canoes and by putting 2 together would make a Siseable one, all below the last Indian Camp Several miles [Lewis:] Sunday August 25th. 1805. This morning loaded our horses and set out a little after sunrise; a few only of the Indians unengaged in assisting us went on as I had yesterday proposed to the cheif. the others flanked us on each side and started some Antelope which they pursued for several hours but killed none of them. we proceeded within 2 Ms. of the narrow pass or seven miles from our camp of last evening and halted for dinner. Our hunters joined us at noon with three deer the greater part of which I gave the indians. sometime after we had halted, Charbono mentioned to me with apparent unconcern that he expected to meet all the Indians from the camp on the Columbia tomorrow on their way to the Missouri. allarmed at this information I asked why he expected to meet them. he then informed me that the 1st. Cheif had dispatched some of his young men this morning to this camp requesting the Indians to meet them tomorrow and that himself and those with him would go on with them down the Missouri, and consequently leave me and my baggage on the mountain or thereabouts. I was out of patience with the folly of Charbono who had not sufficient sagacity to see the consequencies which would inevitably flow from such a movement of the indians, and altho' he had been in possession of this information since early in the morning when it had been communicated to him by his Indian woman yet he never mentioned it untill the after noon. I could not forbear speaking to him with some degree of asperity on this occasion. I saw that there was no time to be lost in having those orders countermanded, or that we should not in all probability obtain any more horses or even get my baggage to the waters of the Columbia. I therefore Called the three Cheifs together and having smoked a pipe with them, I asked them if they were men of their words, and whether I could depent on the promises they had made me; they readily answered in the affermative; I then asked them if they had not promised to assist me with my baggage to their camp on the other side of the mountains, or to the place at which Capt. Clark might build the canoes, should I wish it. they acknowledged that they had. I then asked them why they had requested their people on the other side of the mountain to meet them tomorrow on the mountain where there would be no possibility of our remaining together for the purpose of trading for their horses as they had also promised. that if they had not promised to have given me their assistance in transporting my baggage to the waters on the other side of the mountain that I should not have attempted to pass the mountains but would have returned down the river and that in that case they would never have seen anymore white men in their country. that if they wished the white men to be their friends and to assist them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms and keeping their enemies from attacking them that they must never promis us anything which they did not mean to perform. that when I had first seen them they had doubted what I told them about the arrival of the party of whitemen in canoes, that they had been convinced that what I told them on that occasion was true, why then would they doubt what I said on any other point. I told them that they had witnessed my liberality in dividing the meat which my hunters killed with them; and that I should continue to give such of them as assisted me a part of whatever we had ourselves to eat. and finally concluded by telling them if they intended to keep the promises they had made me to dispatch one of their young men immediately with orders to their people to remain where they were untill our arrival. the two inferior cheifs said that they wished to assist me and be as good as their word, and that they had not sent for their people, that it was the first Chief who had done so, and they did not approve of the measure. Cameahwait remained silent for some time, at length he told me that he knew he had done wrong but that he had been induced to that measure from seeing all his people hungry, but as he had promised to give me his assistance he would not in future be worse than his word. I then desired him to send immediately and countermand his orders; accordingly a young man was sent for this purpose and I gave him a handkerchief to engage him in my interest. this matter being arranged to my satisfaction I called all the women and men together who had been assisting me in the transportation of the baggage and gave them a billet for each horse which they had imployed in that service and informed them when we arrived at the plaice where we should finally halt on the river I would take the billet back and give them merchandize for it. every one appeared now satisfyed and when I ordered the horses loaded for our departure the Indians were more than usually allert. we continued our march untill late in the evening and encamped at the upper part of the cove where the creek enters the mountains; here our hunters joined us with another deer which they had killed, this I gave to the women and Children, and for my own part remained supperless. I observed considerable quantities of wild onions in the bottom lands of this cove. I also saw several large hares and many of the cock of the plains. Capt. Clark set out early this morning and continued his rout to the indian camp at the entrance of fish Creek; here he halted about an hour; the indians gave himself and party some boiled salmon and berries (tho' not half Sufficient &amp;c). these people appeared extreemly hospitable tho' poor and dirty in the extreem. he still pursued the track up the river by which he had decended and in the evening arrived at the bluff on the river where he had encamped on the 21st. Inst. it was late in the evening before he reached this place. they formed their camp, and Capt. C. sent them in different directions to hunt and fish. some little time after they halted a party of Indians passed by on their way down the river, consisting of a man a woman and several boys; from these people the guide obtained 2 salmon which together with some small fish they caught and a beaver which Shannon killed furnished them with a plentifull supper. the pine grows pretty abundantly high up on the sides of the mountains on the opposite side of the river. one of the hunters saw a large herd of Elk on the opposite side of the river in the edge of the timbered land. Winsor was taken very sick today and detained Capt. C. very much on his march. three hunters whom he had sent on before him this morning joined him in the evening having killed nothing; they saw only one deer. The courses and distances, of Capt. Clark's rout down this branch of the Columbia below this bluff, commencing opposite to an Island, are as follow. N. 30°. W. 2 To the top of a mountain the river 1 m. on the left. N. 45°. W. 10. With the general cou[r]se of the river; passing over the spurs of four mountains, almost inaccessible, and two small runs from the wright, to some Indian lodges at the entrance of fish creek which discharges itself on the N.

W. 1. to the river at a small bottom, passing a gap in the mountain from the top of which can be seen the break of the river through the mountains for 20 miles to a very high mountain on the South, at which place the guide informed Capt. C. that the Miles 39    impassable part of the river commenced, and was in[fi]nitely worse than any part he had yet seen. This morning while passing through the Shoshone cove Frazier fired his musquet at some ducks in a little pond at the distance of about 60 yards from me; the ball rebounded from the water and pased within a very few feet of me. near the upper part of this cove the Shoshonees suffered a very severe defeat by the Minnetares about six years since. this part of the cove on the N. E. side of the Creek has lately been birned by the Indians as a signal on some occasion. [Clark:] August 25th.. Sunday 1805.

This morning was excessively cold; there was ice on the vessels of water which stood exposed to the air nearly a quarter of an inch thick. we collected our horses and set out at sunrise. we soon arrived at the extreem source of the Missouri; here I halted a few minutes, the men drank of the water and consoled themselves with the idea of having at length arrived at this long wished for point. from hence we proceeded to a fine spring on the side of the mountain where I had lain the evening before I first arrived at the Shoshone Camp. here I halted to dine and graize our horses, there being fine green grass on that part of the hillside which was moistened by the water of the spring while the grass on the other parts was perfectly dry and parched with the sun. I directed a pint of corn to be given each Indian who was engaged in transporting our baggage and about the same quantity to each of the men which they parched pounded and made into supe. one of the women who had been assisting in the transportation of the baggage halted at a little run about a mile behind us, and sent on the two pack horses which she had been conducting by one of her female friends. I enquired of Cameahwait the cause of her detention, and was informed by him in an unconcerned manner that she had halted to bring fourth a child and would soon overtake us; in about an hour the woman arrived with her newborn babe and passed us on her way to the camp apparently as well as she ever was. It appears to me that the facility and ease with which the women of the aborigines of North America bring fourth their children is reather a gift of nature than depending as some have supposed on the habitude of carrying heavy burthens on their backs while in a state of pregnacy. if a pure and dry air, an elivated and cold country is unfavourable to childbirth, we might expect every difficult incident to that operation of nature in this part of the continent; again as the snake Indians possess an abundance of horses, their women are seldom compelled like those in other parts of the continent to carry burthens on their backs, yet they have their children with equal convenience, and it is a rare occurrence for any of them to experience difficulty in childbirth. I have been several times informed by those who were conversent with the fact, that the indian women who are pregnant by whitemen experience more difficulty in childbirth than when pregnant by an Indian. if this be true it would go far in suport of the opinion I have advanced. the tops of the high and irregular mountains which present themselves to our view on the opposite side of this branch of the Columbia are yet perfectly covered with snow; the air which proceeds from those mountains has an agreeable coolness and renders these parched and South hillsides much more supportable at this time of the day it being now about noon. I observe the indian women collecting the root of a speceis of fennel1 1 The dill (Carum), called "yamp" or "yampah" by the Indians (see p. 13, note 1, ante).—Ed. which grows in the moist grounds and feeding their poor starved children; it is really distressing to witness the situation of those poor wretches the radix of this plant is of the knob kind, of a long ovate form terminating in a single radicle, the whole being about 3 or four inches in length and the thickest part about the size of a man's little finger. it is white firm and crisp in it's present state, when dryed and pounded it makes a fine white meal; the flavor of this root is not unlike that of annis seed but not so pungent; the stem rises to the hight of 3 or four feet is jointed smooth and cilindric; from 1 to 4 of those knobed roots are attatched to the base of this stem. the leaf is sheathing, sessile, and pultipartite,1 1 Probably intended for "multipartite"—Biddle gives it as "polipartite."—Ed. the divisions long and narrow; the whole is of a deep green. it is now in blume; the flowers are numerous, small, petals white, and are of the umbellaferous kind. several small peduncles put forth from the main stock one at each joint above the sheathing leaf. it has no root leaves. the root of the present year declines when the seeds have been matured and the succeeding spring other roots of a similar kind put fourth from the little knot which unites the roots and stem and grow and decline with the stem as before mentioned. The sunflower is very abundant near the watercourses the seeds of this plant are now rip[e] and the natives collect them in considerable quantities and reduce them to meal by pounding and rubing them between smooth stones. this meal is a favorite food their manner of using it has been beforementioned. after dinner we continued our rout towards the village. on our near approach we were met by a number of young men on horseback. Cameahwait requested that we would discharge our guns when we arrived in sight of the Village, accordingly when I arrived on an eminence above the village in the plain I drew up the party at open order in a single rank and gave them a runing fire discharging two rounds. they appeared much gratifyed with this exhibition. we then proceeded to the village or encampment of brush lodges 32 in number. we were conducted to a large lodge which had been prepared for me in the center of their encampment which was situated in a beautifull level smooth and extensive bottom near the river about 3 miles above the place I had first found them encamped. here we arrived at 6 in the evening arranged our baggage near my tent and placed those of the men on either side of the baggage facing outwards. I found Colter here who had just arrived with a letter from Capt. Clark in which Capt. C. had given me an account of his perigrination and the description of the river and country as before detailed [advised the purchase of horses and the pursute of a rout he had learned from his guide who had promised to pilot ous to a road, to the North &amp;c.2 2 These bracketed emendations are in Clark's handwriting.—Ed. ] from this view of the subject I found it a folly to think of attemp[t]ing to decend this river in canoes and therefore determined to commence the purchase of horses in the morning from the indians in order to carry into execution the design we had formed of [Capt. C had recomended in] passing the rocky Mountains. I now informed Cameahwait of my intended expedition overland to the great river which lay in the plains beyond the mountains and told him that I wished to purchase 20 horses of himself and his people to convey our baggage. he observed that the Minnetares had stolen a great number of their horses this spring but hoped his people would spear me the number I wished. I also asked a (another) guide, he observed that he had no doubt but the old man who was with Capt. C. would accompany us if we wished him and that he was better informed of the country than any of them. matters being thus far arranged I directed the fiddle to be played and the party danced very merily much to the amusement and gratification of the natives, though I must confess that the state of my own mind at this moment did not well accord with the prevailing mirth as I somewhat feared that the caprice of the indians might suddenly induce them to withhold their horses from us without which my hopes of prosicuting my voyage to advantage was lost; however I determined to keep the indians in a good humour if possible, and to loose no time in obtaining the necessary number of horses. I directed the hunters to turn out early in the morning and indeavor to obtain some meat. I had nothing but a little parched corn to eat this evening. This morning Capt. C. and party1 1 Here follow two memoranda, both apparently in Clark's writing, but in different inks: "This Comes into No 7 betwen the 23rd. and 26 August 1805," and "This has been Copied from W. C.

This, I think, brought them out on the head of a branch of Camp Creek, instead of on the main stream, and to the northwest of the latter's head. The camp of the Indians and of the explorers from Sept. 4 to Sept. 6 was unquestionably on Camp Creek, and not on Ross's Fork. I think that the last course-reading of Clark on Sept. 4, which he gives as "N. 35° W. 3m. down this run," should probably read" N. 35.

Monday September 9th. 1805. Set out at 7 A.M. this morning and proceeded down the Flathead river leaving it on our left, the country in the valley of this river is generally a prarie and from five to 6 miles wide the growth is almost altogether pine principally of the long-leafed kind, with some spruce and a kind of furr resembleing the scotch furr. near the wartercourses we find a small proportion of the narrow leafed cottonwood; some redwood honeysuckle and rosebushes form the scant proportion of underbrush to be seen. at 12 we halted on a small branch which falls into the river on the E. side, where we breakfasted on a scant proportion of meat which we had reserved from the hunt of yesterday added to three geese which one of our hunters killed this morning. two of our hunters have arrived, one of them brought with him a redheaded woodpecker of the large kind common to the U States. this is the first of the kind I have seen since I left the Illinois. just as we were seting out Drewyer arrived with two deer. we continued our rout down the valley about 4 miles and crossed the river; it is hear a handsome stream about 100 yards wide and affords a considerable quantity of very clear water, the banks are low and it's bed entirely gravel. the stream appears navigable, but from the circumstance of their being no sammon in it I believe that there must be a considerable fall in it below. our guide could not inform us where this river discharged itself into the columbia river, he informed us that it continues it's course along the mountains to the N. as far as he knew it and that not very distant from where we then were it formed a junction with a stream nearly as large as itself which took it's rise in the mountains near the Missouri to the East of us and passed through an extensive valley generally open prarie which forms an excellent pass to the Missouri.1 1 The Hellgate River.—Ed. the point of the Missouri where this Indian pass intersects it, is about 30 miles above the gates of the rocky Mountain, or the place where the valley of the Missouri first widens into an extensive plain after entering the rockey Mountains. the guide informed us that a man might pass to the missouri from hence by that rout in four days. we continued our rout down the W. side of the river about 5 miles further and encamped on a large creek which falls in on the West. as our guide inform [ed] me that we should leave the river at this place and the weather appearing settled and fair I determined to halt the next day rest our horses and take some scelestial Observations. we called this Creek Travellers rest.2 2 Now called the Lo Lo (or Lou Lou) fork of the Bitter Root River; at its mouth is a town of the same name.—Ed. it is about 20 yards wide a fine bould clear runing stream the land through which we passed is but indifferent a could white gravley soil. we estimate our journey of this day at 19.

The Vallie near the mouth of this fork is about 7 or 8 miles wide leavel &amp; open, but little timber on this fork in Sight. [Lewis:] Tuesday September 10th. 1805. The morning being fair I sent out all the hunters, and directed two of them to precede down the river as far as it's junction with the Eastern fork which heads near the missouri, and return this evening. this fork of the river we determined to name the Valley plain river. (we called the Eastern fork of Clarkes river.) I think it most probable that this river continues it's course along the rocky Mts. Northwardly as far or perhaps beyond the scources of Medecine river and then turning to the West falls into the Tacootchetessee.1 1 This "eastern fork" was Hellgate River. The name Tacootchetessee evidently refers to the Columbia River, although it was really applied to the river afterward called Fraser's; see Alexander Mackenzie's Voyages through N. America (London, 1801), at the end of which is a map showing the "Tacoutche Tesse or Columbia River," its lower course hypothetically traced by a dotted line—indicating that he supposed Fraser's (which he had seen only in its upper reaches) to end in the Columbia. —Ed. The Minetares informed us that there wass a large river west of, and at no great distance from the sources of Medicine river, which passed along the Rocky Mountains from S. to N. this evening one of our hunters returned accompanyed by three men of the Flathead nation whom he had met in his excurtion up travellers rest Creek. on first meeting him the Indians were alarmed and prepared for battle with their bows and arrows, but he soon relieved their fears by laying down his gun and advancing towards them. the Indians were mounted on very fine horses of which the Flatheads have a great abundance; that is, each man in the nation possesses from 20 to a hundred head. our guide could not speake the language of these people but soon engaged them in conversation by signs or jesticulation, the common language of all the Aborigines of North America, it is one understood by all of them and appears to be sufficiently copious to convey with a degree of certainty the outlines of what they wish to communicate. in this manner we learnt from these people that two men which they supposed to be of the Snake nation had stolen 23 horses from them and that they were in pursuit of the theaves. they told us they were in great hast, we gave them some boiled venison, of which the[y] eat sparingly, the sun was now set, two of them departed after receiving a few small articles which we gave them, and the third remained, having agreed to continue with us as a guide, and to introduce us to his relations whom he informed us were numerous and resided in the plain below the mountains on the columbia river, from whence he said the water was good and capable of being navigated to the sea; that some of his relation[s] were at the sea last fall and saw an old whiteman who resided there by himself and who had given them some handkerchiefs such as he saw in our possession. he said it would require five sleeps1 1 Five sleeps, or days' journey.—Biddle (i. p. 446). [Clark:] September 10th.. Tuesday 1805. A fair morning Concluded to Delay to day and make Some observations, as at this place the rout which we are to prosue will pass up the Travelers rest Creek, The day proved fair and we took equal altitudes &amp; some luner observations. The Latd 46° – 48′ – 28″ as the guide report[s] that no game is to be found on our rout for a long ways, ads an addition to the cause of our delay to precure Some meat, despatched all our hunters in different directions, to hunt the Deer which is the only large game to be found they killed 4 deer a Beaver &amp; 3 Grouse which was divided, one of the hunters Colter, met with 3 flatheads [Tushapaw] Indians who were in pursuit of 2 Snake Indians that hade taken from ther Camps on the Columbia [head of Kooskooske] River 21 horses, Those Indians came with Colter to our Camp &amp; informed by Signs of their misfortune &amp; the rout to their villages &amp;c. &amp;c. one of them Concluded to return with us. I (we) gave them a ring fish hook &amp; tied a pece of ribin in the hare of each, which appeared to please them verry much, Cap Lewis gave them a Steel &amp; a little Powder to make fire, after eating 2 of them proceeded on in pursute of their horses. men all much engaged preparing mockersons &amp;c. &amp;c. The Countrey about this place is already described in that above. [Clark:] September 11th Wednesday 1805. A fair morning wind from the NW we set out at 3 oClock and proceeded on up the Travelers rest Creek accompanied by the Flat head (or Tushapaws) Indian about 7 miles below this Creek a large fork comes in from the right and heads up against the waters of the Missouri below the three forks, this river has extensive Vallies of open leavel land, "and passes in its Whole Course thro' a Valie" they call it Valie Plain River (Chicarlusket we call it the east fork of Clark's river) our guide tels us a fine large roade passes up this river to the Missouri. The loss of 2 of our horses detained us unl. 3 oClock. P.M. our Flat head Indian being restless thought proper to leave us and proceed on alone, Sent out the hunters to hunt in advance as usial. (we have Selected 4 of the best hunters to go in advance to hunt for the party. This arrangement has been made long since) we proceeded on up the Creek [Travelers rest] on the right [hand] Side [left bank] thro a narrow valie and good road for 7 miles and Encamped at Some old Indian Lodges, nothing killed this evening hills on the right high &amp; ruged, the mountains on the left high &amp; Covered with Snow.

Less than two miles above the explorers' camp of the 12th, Traveler's Rest Creek forks, the northern branch bearing the name of Granite Creek—on which, just above the forks, among a maze of huge granite boulders, the Granite Hot Springs pour forth. On the other fork, Traveler's Rest or Lolo Creek proper,—half a mile, perhaps, by the trails across the hill, and somewhat farther by the creek,—are what are known as Boyle's Springs, and these are they to which the narrative refers—its description agreeing well with the present appearance of the latter springs. There is now (1903) a good road up Lolo Creek to both springs, and a daily stage-coach to and from Missoula.— O. D. Wheeler. as Several roads led from these Springs in different derections, my guide took a wrong road and took us out of our rout 3 miles through intolerable rout, after falling into the right road I proceeded on thro [a] tolerable rout for abt. 4 or 5 miles and halted to let our horses graze as well as wate for Capt Lewis who has not yet come up, The pine Countrey falling timber &amp;c. &amp;c. Continue. This Creek is verry much damed up with the beaver, but we can see none, dispatched two men back to hunt Capt Lewis horse, after he came up, and we proceeded over a mountain to the head of the Creek which we left to our left and at 6 miles from the place I nooned it, we fell on a Small Creek from the left which Passed through open glades Some of which [were] ? a mile wide; we proceeded down this Creek about 2 miles to where the mountains Closed on either Side crossing the Creek Several times &amp; Encamped.2 2 The expedition at this point crossed the divide between the waters of Clark's Fork (Lolo Creek) and those of the Lewis (Snake) River. Glade Creek is one of the sources of the Clearwater (or Kooskooskee) River, whose waters Lewis and Clark follow in the main to its junction with Lewis River at Lewiston, Idaho. The pass is that known as the Lolo or Northern Nez Percé trail, and follows a ridge north of the Clearwater valley through the northern portion of the Bitter Root Forest Reserve. This trail was explored in 1854 by Lieut. John Mullan, and his account is given in Stevens's report, vol. xii of Explorations and Surveys for R. R. to Pacific Ocean (Washington, 1860). General O. O. Howard made a military trail through this region in 1876–77, during the Nez Percé War. This followed the Indian trail, save where cut-offs made the route more practicable. The details of Lewis and Clark's route have been much discussed. The best modern map and description is that of John B. Leiberg, "The Bitterroot Forest Reserve," in the United States Geological Survey, Report, 1898–99, vol. v, pp. 317–410. The recently discovered map made by Clark (see our Atlas volume) will serve to decide many topographical puzzles.—Ed.

This trail is used still by Indians and by trappers on the upper Lochsa. The trail down the Lochsa is good and probably always has been as the timber is open. We were easily able to locate the camp "opposit a Small Island at the mouth of a branch on the right side of the river." Just before reaching this branch is a small prairie of about five acres on which we may suppose the horses grazed, if indeed the camp itself were not there. —C. V.

These mounds were there when Lewis and Clark passed, but they probably did not see them, owing to the peculiarity of the trail. On the return journey they mention one such mound farther to the west.—O. D. Wheeler.

Cap Clark set out this morning to go a head with six hunters, there being no game in these mountains we concluded it would be better for one of us to take the hunters and hurry on to the leavel country a head and there hunt and provide some provisions while the other remained with and brought on the party. the latter of these was my part; accordingly I directed the horses to be gotten up early being determined to force my march as much as the abilities of our horses would permit. the negligence of one of the party (Willard) who had a spare horse, in not attending to him and bringing him up last evening was the cause of our detention this morning untill ? after 8 A. M. when we set out. I sent willard back to serch for his horse, and proceeded on with the party at four in the evening he overtook us without the horse, we marched 18 miles this day and encamped on the side of a steep mountain; we suffered for water this day passing one rivulet only; we wer[e] fortunate in finding water in a steep raviene about ? maile from our camp, this morning we finished the remainder of our last coult. we dined &amp; suped on a skant proportion of portable soupe, a few canesters of which, a little bears oil and about 20 lbs. of candles2 2 Bear's oil, instead of candles, according to Biddle.—Ed. form our stock of provision, the only recources being our guns &amp; packhorses. the first is but a poor dependance in our present situation where there is nothing upon earth ex[c]ept ourselves and a few small pheasants, small grey Squirrels, and a blue bird of the vulter kind about the size of a turtle dove or jay bird. our rout lay along the ridge of a high mountain course S. 20.

Set out this morning a little after sun rise and continued our rout about the same course of yesterday or S. 20. W. for 6 miles when the ridge terminated and we to our inexpressable joy discovered a large tract of Prairie country lying to the S. W. and widening as it appeared to extend to the W. through that plain the Indian informed us that the Columbia river, (in which we were in surch) run. this plain appeared to be about 60 Miles distant, but our guide assured us that we should reach it's borders tomorrow the appearance of this country, our only hope for subsistance greately revived the sperits of the party already reduced and much weakened for the want of food.1 1 The plain to the southwest was not the Weippe Country, but the now well-known Kamas prairie plateau beyond the Kooskooskee or Clearwater.—O. D. Wheeler. the country is thickly covered with a very heavy growth of pine of which I have ennumerated 8 distinct species. after leaving the ridge we asscended and decended several steep mountains in the distance of 6 miles further when we struck a Creek about 15 yards wide, our course being S. 35. W. we continued our rout 6 miles along the side of this creek upwards passing 2 of it's branches which flowed in from the N. 1st.. at the place we struck the creek and the other 3 miles further. the road was excessively dangerous along this creek being a narrow rockey path generally on the side of [a] steep precipice, from which in many places if e[i]ther man or horse were precipitated they would inevitably be dashed in pieces. Fraziers horse fell from this road in the evening, and roled with his load near a hundred yards into the Creek. we all expected that the horse was killed but to our astonishment when the load was taken off him he arose to his feet &amp; appeared to be but little injured, in 20 minutes he proceeded with his load. this was the most wonderfull escape I ever witnessed, the hill down which he roled was almost perpendicular and broken by large irregular and broken rocks. the course of this Creek upwards due W. we encamped on the Stard. side of it in a little raviene, having traveled 18 miles over a very bad road. we took a small quantity of portable soup, and retired to rest much fatiegued. several of the men are unwell of the disentary. brakings out, or irruptions of the Skin, have also been common with us for some time. [Clark:] Tuesday (Thursday) 19th Septr. 1805. Set out early proceeded on up the [Hungry] Creek passing through a Small glade at 6 miles at which place we found a horse.

Lewis and proceeded on in the time the one half of the party was skining cooking &amp;c. the others were hunting, without seeing a track of any animal. The road up this creek is much wors than any other part as the hills sides are steep and at maney places obliged for several yds. to pass on the sides of rocks where one false step of a horse would be certain destruction. Crossed over a mountain and the heads of a branch of hungary Creek over ridges and much falling timber, and a 2d. high mountain of like description to a large creek running west for 4 miles then turned South.

This morning my attention was called to a species of bird which I had never seen before. (Copy for Dr. Barton) It was reather larger than a robbin, tho' much it's form and action. the colours were a blueish brown on the back the wings and tale black, as wass a stripe above the croop ¾ of an inch wide in front of the neck, and two others of the same colour passed from it's eyes back along the sides of the head. the top of the head, neck brest and belley and butts of the wing were of a fine yellowish brick reed [red]. it was feeding on the buries of a species of shoemake or ash which grows common in [this] country &amp; which I first observed on 2d. of this month. I have also observed two birds of a blue colour both of which I believe to be of the haulk or vulter kind. the one of a blue shining colour with a very high tuft of feathers on the head a long tale, it feeds on flesh the beak and feet black. it's note is ch?-?h, ch?-?h. it is about the size of a pigeon, and in shape and action resembles the jay bird. another bird of very similar genus, the note resembling the mewing of the cat, with a white head and a light blue colour is also common, as are a black species of woodpecker about the size of the lark woodpecker. Three species of Phesants, a large black species, with some white feathers irregularly scattered on the brest neck and belley—a smaller kind of a dark uniform colour with a red stripe above the eye, and a brown and yellow species that a gooddeel resembles the phesant common to the Atlantic States. we were detained this morning untill ten oclock in consequence of not being enabled to collect our horses. we had proceeded about 2 Miles when we found the greater part of a horse which Capt. Clark had met with and killed for us. he informed me by note that he should proceed as fast as possible to the leavel country which lay to the S. W. of us, which we discovered from the hights of the mountains on the 19th. there he intended to hunt untill our arrival. at one oclock we halted on a small branch runing to the left and made a hearty meal on our horse beef much to the comfort of our hungry stomachs. here I larnt that one of the Packhorses with his load was missing and immediately dispatched Baptiest Lapage who had charge of him, to surch for him. he returned at 3 OC. without the horse. The load of the horse was of considerable value consisting of merchandize and all my stock of winter cloathing. I therefore dispatched two of my best woodsmen in surch of him, and proceeded with the party. Our rout lay through a thick forrest of large pine the general course being S. 25. W. and distance about 15. miles. our road was much obstructed by fallen timber particularly in the evening. we encamped on a ridge where ther was but little grass for our horses, and at a distance from water. however we obtained as much as served our culinary purposes and suped on our beef. the soil as you leave the hights of the mountains becomes gradually more fertile. the land through which we passed this evening is of an excellent quality tho' very broken, it is a dark grey soil. a grey free stone appearing in large masses above the earth in many places. (Copy for Dr. Barton) saw the hucklebury, honeysuckle, and alder common to the Atlantic states, also a kind of honeysuckle which bears a white bury and rises about 4 feet high not common but to the western side of the rockey mountains. a growth which resembles the choke cherry bears a black bury with a single stone of a sweetish taste, it rises to the hight of 8 or 10 feet and grows in thick clumps. the Arborvita is also common and grows to an immence size, being from 2 to 6 feet in diameter.1 1 The huckleberry here mentioned (Vaccinium membraceum) was met again in this region June 16, 1806. The honeysuckle (Louicera ciliosa Poir.) is often mentioned as the "vining honeysuckle;" the white-berried honeysuckle is Symphoricarpus raceinosus L. The choke-cherry is Prunus demissa Nutt.; and the arbor vitae, Thuya plicata Don. (T. gigantea Nutt.). The alder is not the same as the black alder referred to Nov. 6, 1805, and other times, but Alnus sinuata Rydt.—C. V. Piper. [Clark:] Wednesday (Friday) 20th.. September 1805. I set out early and proceeded on through a Countrey as ruged as usial passed over a low mountain into the forks of a large Creek which I kept down 2 miles and assended a high Steep mountain leaveing the Creek to our left hand passed the head of several dreans on a divideing ridge, and at 12 miles decended the mountain to a leavel pine Countrey proceeded on through a butifull Countrey for three miles to a Small Plain2 2 Captain Clark's route this day was, apparently, down Lolo, or the north branch of Collins Creek, to the junction with the eastern branch, then down the creek and across to the headwaters of Musselshell and Brown creeks, but not as the trail of to-day runs. From here he followed through the more open country, and came out into the wide and beautiful prairie country.—O. D.

It is the bulbous root of a liliaceous plant (Camassia—of two species, esculenta and leuchlini; also named quamasia quamash, Coville) which grows in moist places from California to Montana and British Columbia; it is dug in June and July, and may be eaten raw or cooked. It is agreeable to the taste, nutritious, and when cooked and dried can be kept for a year or more. Granville Stuart says—Montana as it Is (N. Y., 1865), pp. 28, 58—that its Shoshoni name "pah′-see′-go," means "water seego," as distinguished from the "seego" that grows on high lands; and that the same name is applied to dried apples or peaches.

The Nez Percés were always friendly to the whites until 1877, when the so-called "Chief Joseph's war" occurred—a revolt of the "non-treaty" members of the tribe; they were subdued by United States troops, and the remnant of the band placed on a reservation. See O. O. Howard's account of this war, in his Nez Percé Joseph (Boston, 1881); he says of this tribe, "There are few Indians in America superior to the Nez Percés."—Ed.

We were detained this morning untill 11 OCk. in consequence of not being able to collect our horses. we then set out and proceeded along the ridge on which we had encamped, leaving which at 1-? we passed a large creek [Collins—Ed.] runing to the left just above it's junction with another which run parrallel with and on the left of our road before we struck the creek; through the level wide and heavy timbered bottom of this creek we proceeded about 2-? miles when bearing to the right we passed a broken country heavily timbered great quantities of which had fallen and so obstructed our road that it was almost impracticable to proceed in many places. th[r]ough these hills we proceeded about 5.Ms. when we passed a small creek on which Capt. Clark encamped on the 19th. passing this creek we continued our rout 5.Ms. thro' a similar country when we struck a large creek at the forks, passed the Northern branch and continued down it on the West side 1 mile and encamped in a small open bottom where there was tolerable food for our horses. I directed the horses to be hubbled to prevent delay in the morning being determined to make a forced march tomorrow in order to reach if possible the open country, we killed a few Pheasants, and I killed a prarie woolf which together with the ballance of our horse beef and some crawfish which we obtained in the creek enabled us to make one more hearty meal, not knowing where the next was to be found. (Copy for Dr. Barton) the Arborvita increases in quantity and size. I saw several sticks today large enough to form eligant perogues of at least 45 feet in length.

Septr. 1805 A fine Morning Sent out all the hunters in different directions to hunt deer, I my self delayed with the Chief to prevent Suspission and to Collect by Signs as much information as possible about the river and Countrey in advance. The Chief drew me a kind of chart of the river, and informed me that a greater Chief than himself was fishing at the river half a days march from his Village called the twisted hare [hair], and that the river forked a little below his Camp and at a long distance below &amp; below 2 large forks one from the left &amp; the other from the right the river passed thro' the mountains at which place was a great fall of the Water passing through the rocks, at those falls white people lived from whome they precured the white Beeds &amp; Brass &amp;c. which the womin wore; a Chief of another band visit[ed] me to day and Smoked a pipe, I gave my handkerchief &amp; a Silver Cord with a little Tobacco to those Chiefs, The hunters all return without any thing, I purchased as much Provisions as I could with what fiew things I chan[c]ed to have in my Pockets, Such a[s] Salmon Bread roots &amp; berries, &amp; Sent one man R Fields with an Indian to meet Capt Lewis, and at 4 oClock P.M.

Notwithstanding my positive directions to hubble the horses last evening one of the men neglected to comply. he plead[ed] ignorance of the order. this neglect however detained us untill ? after eleven OCk. at which time we renewed our march, our course being about west. we had proceeded about two and a half miles when we met Reubin Fields one of our hunters, whom Capt. Clark had dispatched to meet us with some dryed fish and roots that he had procured from a band of Indians, whose lodges were about eight miles in advance. I ordered the party to halt for the purpose of taking some refreshment. I divided the fish roots and buries, and was happy to find a sufficiency to satisfy compleatly all our appetites. Fields also killed a crow after refreshing ourselves we proceeded to the village—due West 7-? Miles where we arrived at 5 OCk in the afternoon our rout was through lands heavily timbered, the larger wood entirely pine. the country except the last 3 miles was broken and decending. the pleasure I now felt in having tryumphed over the rockey Mountains and decending once more to a level and fertile country where there was every rational hope of finding a comfortable subsistence for myself and party can be more readily conceived than expressed, nor was the flattering prospect of the final success of the expedition less pleasing. on our approach to the village which consisted of eighteen lodges most of the women fled to the neighbouring woods on horseback with their children, a circumstance I did not expect as Capt. Clark had previously been with them and informed them of our pacific intentions towards them and also the time at which we should most probably arrive.1 1 There is a tradition among the Nez Percé Indians that when Lewis and Clark first visited the Chopunnish, the latter were inclined to kill the white men,—a catastrophe which was averted by the influence of a woman in that tribe. She had been captured by hostile Indians, and carried into Manitoba, where some white people enabled her to escape; and finally she returned to her own tribe, although nearly dead from fatigue and privations. Hearing her people talk of killing the explorers, she urged them to do no harm to the white men, but to treat them with kindness and hospitality—counsel which they followed.—O. D. Wheeler. the men seemed but little concerned, and several of them came to meet us at a short distance from their lodges unarmed.2 2 The following memoranda appear at the end of this fragment (Codex Fd): "(This a part of Book No. 7. to be referred to and examined after the 9th.

The planes appeared covered with Spectators viewing the white men and the articles which we had, our party weakened and much reduced in flesh as well as Strength, The horse I left hung up they receved at a time they were in great want, and the Supply I Sent by R. Fields proved timely and gave great encouragement to the party with Captn. Lewis. he lost 3 horses one of which belonged to our guide. Those Indians Stole out of R.F.

At dark one of the squaws, who keep about us, took a crazy fit, and cut her arms from the wrists to the shoulders, with a flint; and the natives had great trouble and difficulty in getting her pacified.—Gass (p. 209). we requested the Chief to Send a horseman after our old guide to come back and receive his pay &amp;c. which he advised us not to do as his nation would take his things from him before he passed their camps.

The military post was discontinued about 1886, and its buildings used for the schools, etc., of the Indian agency there. The first settlement at this place was made (about 1836) by a missionary, Dr. Spalding; he had a printing-office, and printed the New Testament in the Nez Percé language; his press is preserved in the State Library at Salem, Ore. This mission was abandoned in 1847. The town of Spalding, Idaho, now stands at the mouth of Lapwai Creek.—Ed. on the Lard. with wide cotton willow bottoms haveing passed an Island and a rapid an Indian Camp of three Lodges below the Creek at 8 ? miles lower we arrived at the heade of a verry bad riffle at which place we landed near 8 Lodges of Indians (Choponnesh) on the Lard Side to view the riffle, haveing passed two Islands &amp; Six rapids Several of them verry bad after viewg. this riffle two Canoes were taken over verry well; the third stuck on a rock which took us an hour to get her off which was effected without her receving a greater injurey than a Small Split in her Side which was repaired in a Short time, we purchased fish &amp; dogs2 2 We have some Frenchmen, who prefer dog-flesh to fish; and they here got two or three dogs from the Indians.—Gass (ut supra). of those people, dined and proceeded on. here we met with an Indian from the falls at which place he Sais he saw white people, and expressd an inclination to accompany us,3 3 An offer which, however, we declined.—Biddle (i, p. 466). we passd. a few miles above this riffle 2 Lodges and an Indian batheing in a hot bath made by hot stones thrown into a pon[d] of water. at this riffle which we Call ragid rapid took Meridian altitude of the Suns upper Limb with Sext. 74°. 26′ 0″ Latd. produced [blank space in MS.] North at five miles lower and Sixty miles below the forks arived at a large southerly fork which is the one we were on with the Snake or So-So-nee nation (haveing passed 5 rapids) This South fork or Lewis's River4 4 At this point the expedition reaches the junction of the Clearwater (or Kooskooskee) River with the Snake River. The stream which Clark first reached on the Pacific slope was the Lemhi, a tributary of the Salmon, and this latter of the Snake. It was the Salmon to which he gave the name Lewis's River, but intended it to apply to the entire stream as far as its junction with the Columbia. The camping place of the explorers for this night was near the site of the present city of Lewiston, Idaho. O. D. Wheeler cites a letter of George E. Cole of Spokane, Wash., at one time governor of Washington Territory, as follows: "Col. Lyle, Capt. Ainsworth, Lawrence Co., Vic Trevett, and myself selected the location and named the place Lewiston, in the latter part of May or the first part of June, in 1861, in honor of Capt. Lewis of the Lewis and Clark expedition." In recent years, Clark has been similarly honored in the name of Clarkston a young city of Washington, on the Lewis River opposite Lewiston.—Ed. which has two forks which fall into it on the South the 1st Small the upper large and about 2 days march up imediately parrelal to the first villages we Came to and is called by those Indians Pâr-nash-te1 1 The first of these, the southern, is the Grande Ronde River; the second (P?r-nash-te), the Salmon River.—Ed. on this fork a little above its mouth resides a Chief who as the Indian say has more horses than he can count and further sayeth that Louises River is navagable about 60 miles up with maney rapids at which places the Indians have fishing Camps and Lodges built of an oblong form with flat ruffs. below the 1st. river on the South Side there is ten established fishing places on the 1st. fork which fall[s] in on the South Side is one fishing place, between that and the Par-nashte River, five fishing places, above two; and one on that river all of the Cho-pun-nish or Pierced nose Nation many other Indians reside high up those rivers The Countrey about the forks is an open Plain on either Side. I can observe at a distance on the lower Lard. Side a high ridge of Thinly timbered Countrey the water of the South fork is a greenish blue, the north as clear as cristial Imediately in the point is an Indian Cabin &amp; in the South fork a Small Island, we came to on the Stard. Side below with a view to make some luner observations, the night proved cloudy and we were disapointed. The Indians Came down all the Cou[r]ses of this river on each side on horses to view us as we were decending. The man whome we saw at the ruged rapid and expressed an inclination to accompany us to the great rapids, came up with his son in a Small Canoe and procisted in his intentions, worthey of remark that not one stick of timber on the river near the forks and but a fiew trees for a great distance up the River we decended I think Lewis's [Snake] River is about 250 yards wide, the Koos koos ke1 1 The natives call this eastern branch Koos-koos-ke, and the western Ki-mo-ee-nem. —Gass (p. 210).

Thursday 1805 A fair morning made the above observations during which time the principal Chief came down with Several of his principal men and smoked with us; Several men and woman offered Dogs and fish to Sell, we purchased all the dogs we could, the fish being out of season and dieing in great numbers in the river, we did not think proper to use them, send out Hunters to shute the Prarie Cock a large fowl which I have only Seen on this river, several of which I have killed, they are the size of a Small turkey, of the pheasant kind, one I killed on the water [s] edge to day measured from the Beak to the end of the toe 2 feet 6 &amp; ¾ Inches; from the extremities of its wings 3 feet 6 inches; the tale feathers is 13 inches long: they feed on grasshoppers and the Seed of the wild plant which is also peculiar to this river and the upper parts of the Missoury somewhat resembling the whins. Capt. Lewis took a Vocabelary of the Language of those people who call themselves Sokulk, and also one of the language of a nation resideing on a Westerly fork of the Columbia which mouthes a fiew miles above this place who Call themselves Chim-nâ-pum Some fiew of this nation reside with the Sokulks nation. Their language differ but little from either the Sokulks or the Chô-pun-nish (or pierced nose) nation which inhabit the Koskoskea river and Lewis's R below.1 1 This would indicate that the tribes here named were of the Shahaptian family. The river on which the Chim-nâ-pum lived is the Yakima, also mentioned below as the Tâpetêtt (in Biddle text, Tapteal and Tapteet).—Ed. I took two men in a Small canoe and assended the Columbia river 10 miles to an Island near the Stard. Shore on which two large Mat Lodges of Indians were drying Salmon, (as they informed me by Signs for the purpose of food and fuel, &amp; I do not think [it] at all improbable that those people make use of Dried fish as fuel, The number of dead Salmon on the Shores &amp; floating in the river is incrediable to say—and at this Season they have only to collect the fish Split them open and dry them on their Scaffolds on which they have great numbers, how far they have to raft their timber they make their scaffolds of I could not lern; but there is no timber of any sort except Small willow bushes in sight in any direction. from this Island the natives showed me the enterance of a large Westerly fork which they Call Tâpetêtt at about 8 miles distant, the evening being late I deturmined to return to the forks, at which place I reached at Dark.1 1 At the confluence of the Columbia and Snake is the town of Ainsworth. Clark visited the Indians where now the river is spanned by the Northern Pacific Railway bridge between the towns of Pasco and Kennewick.—Ed. from the point up the Columbia River is N. 83°. W. 6 miles to the lower point of an Island near the Lard. Side, passed a Island in the middle of the river at 5 miles at the head of which is a rapid, not dangerous on the Lard. Side opposit to this rapid is a fishing place 3 Mat Lodges, and great quants. of Salmon on scaffolds drying. Saw great numbers of Dead Salmon on the Shores and floating in the water, great numbers of Indians on the banks viewing me and 18 canoes accompanied me from the point. The waters of this river is clear, and a Salmon may be seen at the deabth of 15 or 20 feet. West 4 miles to the lower point of a large Island near the Stard. Side at 2 Lodges, passed three large lodges on the Stard. Side near which great number of Salmon was drying on scaffolds one of those Mat lodges I entered found it crouded with men women and children and near the enterance of those houses I saw maney squars engaged [in] splitting and drying Salmon. I was furnished with a mat to set on, and one man set about prepareing me something to eate, first he brought in a piece of a Drift log of pine and with a wedge of the elks horn, and a malet of Stone curioesly carved he Split the log into Small pieces and lay'd it open on the fire on which he put round Stones, a woman handed him a basket of water and a large Salmon about half Dried, when the Stones were hot he put them into the basket of water with the fish which was soon sufficently boiled for use it was then taken out put on a platter of rushes neetly made, and set before me they boiled a Salmon for each of the men with me, dureing those preparations, I smoked, with those about me who chose to smoke which was but fiew, this being a custom those people are but little accustomed to and only Smok thro: form. after eateing the boiled fish which was delicious, I set out &amp; halted or come too on the Island at the two Lodges, Several fish was given to me, in return for Which I gave Small pieces of ribbond from those Lodges the natives Showed me the mouth of Tap teel River about 8 miles above on the West Side this western fork appears to beare nearly West, the main Columbia river N.

I can proceive a range of mountains to the East which appears to bare N. &amp; South distant about 50 or 60 miles. no wood to be Seen in any derection, on my return I was followd. by 3 canoes in which there was 20 Indians I shot a large Prairie Cock Several grouse, Ducks and fish. on my return found Great numbs. of the nativs with Capt. Lewis, men all employ[e]d in dressing ther skins mending their clothes and putting their arms in the best order the latter being always a matter of attention with us. The Dress of those natives differ but little from those on the Koskoskia and Lewis's rivers, except the women who dress verry different, in as much as those above ware long leather Shirts which [are] highly ornimented with beeds shells &amp;c. &amp;c. and those on the main Columbia river only ware a truss or pece of leather tied around them at their hips and drawn tite between ther legs and fastened before So as bar[e]ly to hide those parts which are so sacredly hid &amp; s[e]cured by our women. Those women are more inclined to Co[r]pulency than any we have yet Seen, with low Stature broad faces, heads flatened and the foward [forehead] compressed so as to form a Streight line from the nose to the Crown of the head, their eyes are of a Duskey black, their hair of a corse black without orniments of any kind braded as above The orniments of each Sects are Similar, Such as large blue &amp; white beeds, either pendant from their ears or incircling their necks, wrists &amp; arms. they also ware bracelets of Brass, Copper &amp; horn, and trinkets of Shells, fish bones and curious feathers. Their garments consists of a short shirt of leather and a roabe of the Skins of Deer or the antilope, but fiew of them ware Shirts all have Short robes. Those people appears to live in a State of comparitive happiness: they take a great[er] share [in the] labor of the woman, than is common among Savage tribes, and as I am informed [are] content with one wife (as also those on the Ki moo e nim river) Those people respect the aged with Veneration. I observed an old woman in one of the Lodges which I entered, She was entirely blind as I was informed by signs, had lived more than 100 winters, She occupied the best position in the house, and when She Spoke great attention was paid to what she Said. Those people as also those of the flat heads which we had passed on the Koskoske and Lewis's rivers are subject to sore eyes, and many are blind of one and Some of both eyes. this misfortune must be owing to the reflections of the sun &amp;c. on the waters in which they are continually fishing during the Spring Summer &amp; fall, &amp; the snows dureing the, winter Seasons, in this open countrey where the eye has no rest. I have observed amongst those, as well in all other tribes which I have passed on these waters who live on fish maney of different sectes who have lost their teeth about middle age, Some have their teeth worn to the gums, perticelar[ly] those of the upper jaw, and the tribes generally have bad teeth the cause of it I cannot account [for], sand attachd. to the roots &amp; the method they have of useing the dried Salmon, which is mearly worming it and eating the rine &amp; scales with the flesh of the fish, no doubt contributes to it. The Houses or Lodges of the tribes of the main Columbia river is of large Mats made of rushes, those houses are from 15 to 60 feet in length generally of an Oblong squar form, Suported by poles on forks in the in[n]er Side, Six feet high, the top is covered also with mats leaveing a Seperation in the whole length of about 12 or 15 inches wide, left for the purpose of admitting light and for the Smok of the fire to pass which is made in the middle of the house. The roughfs are nearly flat, which proves to me that rains are not common in this open Countrey. Those people appeare of a mild disposition and friendly disposed. They have in their huts independant of their nets gigs &amp; fishing tackling each bows &amp; large quivers of arrows on which they use flint Spikes. Their ammusements are similar to those of the Missouri. they are not beggerley, and receive what is given them with much joy. I saw but fiew horses they appeared [to] make but little use of those animals principally useing Canoes for their uses of procuring food &amp;c. [Clark, first draft:] October 18th.

The fish being very bad those which was offerd to us we had every reason to believe was taken up on the shore dead we thought proper not to purchase any, we purchased forty dogs for which we gave articles of little value, such as beeds, bells &amp; thimbles, of which they appeared verry fond, at 4 oClock we set out down the Great Columbia accompanied by our two old Chiefs, one young man wished to accompany us, but we had no room for more, &amp; he could be of no service to us.

Several canoes of Indians came down and joined those with us, we had a council with those in which we informed of our friendly intentions towards them and all other of our red children, of our wish to make a piece between all of our red Children in this quarter &amp;c. &amp;c. this was conveyed by signs thro: our 2 Chiefs who accompanied us, and was understood, we made a 2d. Chief and gave Strings of wompom to them all in remembrance of what we Said. four men in a Canoe came up from a large encampment on an Island in the River about 8 miles below, they delayed but a fiew minits and returned, without Speaking a word to us. The Great Chief and one of the Chim-nâ-pum nation drew me a sketch of the Columbia above and the tribes of his nation, living on the bank[s], and its waters, and the Tâpe-tett river which falls in 18 miles above on the westerly side See sketch below for the number of villages and nations &amp;c. &amp;c.1 1 They drew it with a piece of coal on a robe, and as we afterwards transferred to paper, it exhibited a valuable specimen of Indian delineation.—Biddle (ii, p. 17). [In the fire of 1895] was burned a map of Oregon presented by the Indians to Lewis and Clark. It was on dressed skin, and showed, by the number of snowshoes, the relative population of the villages, etc., in that section.—P. B. Boninger (University of Virginia). we thought it necessary to lay in a Store of Provisions for our voyage, and the fish being out of Season, we purchased forty dogs for which we gave articles of little value, such as bells, thimbles, knitting pins, brass wire and a few beeds [with] all of which they appeared well Satisfied and pleased. every thing being arranged we took in our Two Chiefs, and set out on the great Columbia river, haveing left our guide and the two young men two of them enclined not to proceed on any further, and the 3d. could be of no service to us as he did not know the river below Took our leave of the Chiefs and all those about us and proceeded on down the great Columbia river passed a large Junction of Columbia and Lewis's Rivers, sketch-map by Clark.

Side is nine large Lodges of Indians Drying fish on scaffolds as above at this place we were called to to land, as it was near night, and no appearance of wood, we proceeded on about 2 miles lower to Some Willows, at which place we observed a drift log formed a camp on the Lard. Side under a high hill nearly opposit to five Lodges of Indians; Soon after we landed, our old Chiefs informed us that the large camp above "was the Camp of the 1st. Chief of all the tribes in this quarter, and that he had called to us to land and Stay all night with him, that he had plenty of wood for us &amp;c." This would have been agreeable to us if it had have been understood perticelarly as we were compelled to use drid willows for fuel for the purpose of cooking, we requested the old Chiefs to walk up on the Side we had landed and call to the chief to come down and Stay with us all night which they did, late at night the Chief came down accompanied by 20 men, and formed a camp a short distance above, the chief brought with him a large basket of mashed berries which he left at our Lodge as a present. I saw on the main land opposit those Lodges a number of horses feeding, we made 21 miles to day. [Clark, first draft:] October 19th. Saturday. The Great Chief 2d.

I gave a string of Wampom to the Principal man, we dined on dryed salmon &amp; set out. I am confident that I could have tomahawked every Indian here. The Language is the same as those above, those Lodges can turn out 350 men. I shot a Crain &amp; 2 Ducks and opposit to a Lodge on the Stard. Side, one mile below a rapid. a high Mountain S.

Crusat played on the violin which pleased and astonished those [w]reches who are badly clad, ¾ with robes not half large enough to cover them, they are homeley high cheeks, and but fiew orniments. I suped on the crane which I killed to day. October 19th. Saturday 1805 The great chief Yel-lep-pit two other chiefs, and a chief of [a] Band below presented themselves to us verry early this morning. we Smoked with them, enformed them as we had all others above as well as we could by signs of our friendly intentions towards our red children perticelar those who opened their ears to our Councils. we gave a Medal, a Handkercheif &amp; a String Wompom to Yelleppit and a String of wompom to each of the others. Yelleppit is a bold handsom Indian, with a dignified countenance about 35 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high and well perpotiond. he requested us to delay untill the Middle of the day, that his people might come down and see us, we excused our Selves and promised to stay with him one or 2 days on our return which appeared to Satisfy him; great numbers of Indians came down in Canoes to view us before we Set out which was not untill 9 oClock A. M. we proceeded on passed a Island, close under the Lard. Side about six miles in length opposit to the lower point of which two Isds. are situated on one of which five Lodges vacent &amp; S[c]affolds [of] dryed fish at the upper point of this Island Swift water. a Short distance below passed two Islands, one near the middle of the river on which is Seven lodges of Indians drying fish, at our approach they hid themselves in their Lodges and not one was to be seen untill we passed, they then came out, in greater numbers than is common in Lodges of their Size, it is probable that the inhabitants of the 5 Lodges above had in a fright left their lodges and decended to this place to defend themselves if attackted there being a bad rapid opposit the Island thro which we had to pass prevented our landing on this Island and passifying those people, about four miles below this fritened Island we arrived at the head of a verry bad rapid,1 1 The Umatilla Rapid, near the mouth of the river of that name.—Ed. we came too on the Lardd. Side to view the rapid before we would venter to run it, as the Chanel appeared to be close under the oppd. Shore, and it would be necessary to liten our canoe, I deturmined to walk down on the Lard.

Side to the foot of the rapid which was about 2 miles in length I sent on the Indian chief &amp;c. down. and I assended a high clift about 200 feet above the water from the top of which is a leavel plain extending up the river and off for a great extent, at this place the countrey becoms low on each Side of the river, and affords a pros[pect] of the river and countrey below for great extent both to the right and left; from this place I descovered a high mountain of emence hight covered with Snow, this must be one of the mountains laid down by Vancouver, as seen from the mouth of the Columbia River, from the course which it bears which is West I take it to be Mt. St. Helens, destant about 120 miles a range of mountains in the Derection crossing a conical mountain S. W. toped with snow,1 1 The mountain was not Mt. St. Helens, but Mt. Adams. The latter is east of the main Cascade range; the former (which is 2, 500 feet lower than Mt. Adams) is west of the range, and would not be visible from the locality where Clark was, unless from some very lofty and exceptional spot. Other explorers have, like Clark, confused the identity of these two peaks.—O. D. Wheeler. This rapid I observed as I passed opposit to it to be verry bad intersep[t]ed with high rock and Small rockey Islands, here I observed banks of Muscle Shells banked up in the river in Several places, I delayed at the foot of the rapid about 2 hours for the canoes which I could see met with much dificuelty in passing down the rapid on the oposit Side maney places the men were obliged to get into the water and haul the canoes over sholes while Setting on a rock wateing for Capt. Lewis I shot a crain which was flying over of the common kind. I observed a great number of Lodges on the opposit Side at some distance below, and Several Indians on the opposit bank passing up to where Capt. Lewis was with the Canoes, others I saw on a knob nearly opposit to me at which place they delayed but a Short time, before they returned to their Lodges as fast as they could run, I was fearfull that those people might not be informed of us, I deturmined to take the little canoe which was with me and proceed with the three men in it to the Lodges, on my aproach not one person was to be seen except three men off in the plains, and they sheared off as I saw approached near the Shore, I landed in front of five Lodges which was at no great distance from each other, Saw no person the enterance or Dores of the Lodges wer Shut with the Same materials of which they were built a Mat, I approached one with a pipe in my hand entered a lodge which was the nearest to me found 32 persons men, women and a few children Setting permiscuisly in the Lodge, in the greatest agutation, Some crying and ringing there hands, others hanging their heads. I gave my hand to them all and made Signs of my friendly dispo[si]tion and offered the men my pipe to Smok and distributed a fiew Small articles which I had in my pockets, this measure passified those distressed people verry much, I then sent one man into each lodge and entered a Second myself the inhabitants of which I found more fritened than those of the first lodge I destributed Sundrey Small articles amongst them, and Smoked with the men, I then entered the third 4th. &amp; fifth Lodge which I found Somewhat passified, the three men, Drewer Jo. &amp; R. Fields, haveing useed everey means in their power to convince them of our friendly disposition to them, I then Set my self on a rock and made signs to the men to come and Smoke with me not one come out untill the canoes arrived with the 2 chiefs, one of whom spoke aloud, and as was their custom to all we had passed. the Indians came out &amp; Set by me and smoked They said we came from the clouds1 1 The Biddle text explains this notion: these Indians had seen the birds which Clark had shot fall from the sky; and, connecting this with the fact that some clouds were floating above, they imagined that he had dropped from the clouds; the sound of his gun (a weapon which they had never seen), and his use of a burning-glass to make fire, confirmed their superstitious dread.—Ed. &amp;c. &amp;c. and were not men &amp;c. &amp;c. this time Capt. Lewis came down with the canoes in which the Indian[s were], as Soon as they Saw the Squar wife of the interperter they pointed to her and informed those who continued yet in the Same position I first found them, they imediately all came out and appeared to assume new life, the sight of This Indian woman, wife to one of our interprs. confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter. [See Descriptions] Capt. Lewis joined us and we smoked with those people in the greatest friendship, dureing which time one of our Old Chiefs informed them who we were from whence we came and where we were going giveing them a friendly account of us, those people do not speak prosisely the same language of those above but understand them, I saw Several Horses and persons on horsback in the plains maney of the men womin and children came up from the Lodges below, all of them appeared pleased to see us, we traded some fiew articles for fish and berries, Dined, and proceeded on passed a Small rapid and 15 Lodges below the five, and Encamped1 1 Six or seven miles below the mouth of Umatilla River.—Ed. below an Island close under the Lard.

Side, we came too at those lodges, bought some wood and brackfast, Those people recived us with great kindness, and examined us Map from Clark Field-book, showing Course and Camping place, October 21, 1805. with much attention, their employments customs, Dress and appearance Similar to those above, Speak the Same language, here we Saw two scarlet and a blue cloth blankets, also a Salors Jacket the Dress of the men of this tribe only a Short robe of Deer or Goat Skins, and that of the women is a short piece of Dressed Skin which fall from the neck so as to cover the front of the body as low as the waste, a Short robe, which is of one Deer or antilope Skin, and a flap around their waste and Drawn tite between their legs as before described, their orniments are but fiew, and worn as those above. we got from those people a fiew pounded roos [roots] fish and Acorns1 1 We saw among them some small robes made of the skins of grey squirrel, some racoon skins, and acorns, which are signs of a timbered country not far distant.— Gass (p. 220). of white oake, those Acorns they make use of as food raw &amp; roasted and inform us they precure them of the natives who live near the falls below which place they all discribe by the term Timm2 2 Which they pronounce so as to make it perfectly represent the sound of a distant cataract.—Biddle (ii, p.28). at 2 miles lower passed a rapid large rocks stringing into the river of large Size, opposit to this rapid on the Stard. Shore is Situated two Lodges of the Nativs drying fish here we halted a fiew minits to examine the rapid before we entered it which was our Constant Custom, and at all that was verry dangerous put out all who Could not Swim to walk around, after passing this rapid we proceeded on passed anoother rapid at 5. miles lower down, above this rapid on the Stard. Side five Lodges of Indians fishing &amp;c above this rapid maney large rocks on each Side at Some distance from Shore, [at] one mile passed an Island close to the Stard. Side, below which is two Lodges of nativs, a little below is a bad rapid which is bad crouded with hugh [huge] rocks scattered in every Direction which renders the pasage verry Difficult a little above this rapid on the Lard.

Side, and one lodge on an Island near the Stard. Shore opposit to which is a verry bad rapid, thro which we found much dificuelty in passing, the river is crowded with rocks in every direction, after Passing this dificult rapid to the mouth of a Small river on the Larboard Side 40 yards wide descharges but little water at this time, and appears to take its Sourse in the open plains to the S. E.1 1 We gave it the name of Lepage's river from Lepage one of our company. —Biddle (ii, p. 29). This is now the John Day's River, named for a Virginia backwoodsman who was a member of the overland expedition to Astoria in 1811–12. See Bradbury's Travels (Thwaites' ed., Cleveland, 1904), note 104.—Ed. from this place I proceved some fiew Small pines on the tops of the high hills and bushes in the hollars. imediately above &amp; below this little river comences a rapid which is crouded with large rocks in every direction, the pasage both crooked and dificuelt, we halted at a Lodge to examine those noumerous Islands of rock which apd. to extend maney miles below, great numbs. of Indians came in canoes to View us at this place, after passing this rapid which we accomplished without loss; winding through between the hugh rocks for about 2 miles. (from this rapid the Conical mountain is S.W. which the Indians inform me is not far to the left of the great falls; this I call the Timm or falls mountain it is high and the top is covered with snow) imediately below the last rapids there is four Lodges of Indians on the Stard. Side, proceeded on about two miles lower and landed and encamped near five Lodges of nativs, drying fish those are the relations of those at the great falls, they are pore and have but little wood which they bring up the river from the falls as they Say, we purchased a little wood to cook our Dog meat and fish; those people did not receive us at first with the same cordiality of those above, they appeare to be the Same nation Speak the Same language with a little curruption of maney words Dress and fish in the same way, all of whome have pierced noses and the men when Dressed ware a long taper'd piece of Shell or beed put through the nose.2 2 Inserting two small, tapering white shells, about two inches long, through the lower part of the cartilaginous division of the nose. These shells are of the genus dentalium, they inhabit the Pacific shore, and are an article of traffic among the natives.—Samuel Parker (Journal, p. 143). this part of the river is furnished with fine Springs which either rise high up the Sides of the hills or on the bottom near the river and run into the river. the hills are high and rugid a fiew scattering trees to be Seen on them either Small pine or Scrubey white oke. The probable reason of the Indians residing on the Stard. Side of this as well as the waters of Lewis's River is their fear of the Snake Indians who reside, as they nativs say on a great river to the South, and are at war with those tribes, one of the Old Chiefs who accompanies us pointed out a place on the Lard. Side where they had a great battle, not maney years ago, in which maney were killed on both Sides, One of our party J. Collins presented us with Some verry good beer made of the Pa-shi-co-quar-mash bread, which bread is the remains of what was laid in as a part of our Stores of Provisions, at the first flat heads or Cho-pun-nish Nation at the head of the Kosskoske river which by being frequently wet molded &amp; sowered &amp;c. we made 33 miles to day. [Clark, first draft:] October 22nd. Tuesday 1805 a fine morning calm we set out at 9 oClock and on the Course S. 52°. W. 10 miles passed lodges &amp; Indians and rapids as mentioned in the course of yesterday, from the expiration of S. 30° W. 3 miles to the mouth of a large river in the Lard. bend 200 yds. wide great rapids in it a ¼ up it long and impracticable of assent Passed a point of rock Island at 2 miles on the Stard. 3 Islands in the mouth of this river no bottoms a little up West 4 miles to a bend on Stard. side passed the Island of rocks at 2 miles at Lower point 8 large Lodges, on the Stard.

The Indians have their grave yard on an Island in the rapids. The Great Chief of those Indians is out hunting. no Indians reside on the Lard Side for fear of the Snake Indians with whome they are at war and who reside on the large fork on the Lard. a little above October 22d. Tuesday 1805 A fine morning calm and fare we set out at 9 oClock passed a verry bad rapid at the head of an Island close under the Stard. side above this rapid on the Stard side is six Lodges of nativs Drying fish, at 9 mls. passed a bad rapid at the head of a large Island of high &amp; uneaven [rocks], jutting over the water, a Small Island in a Stard. Bend opposit the upper point, on which I counted 20 parcels of dryed and pounded fish; on the main Stard. Shore opposit to this Island five Lodges of Indians are Situated, Several Indians in canoes killing fish with gigs &amp;c. opposit the center of this Island of rocks which is about 4 miles long we discovered the enterence of a large river on the Lard. Side which appeared to come from the S. E. we landed at some distance above the mouth of this river and Capt. Lewis and my Self set out to view this river above its mouth, as our rout was intersepted by a deep narrow Chanel which runs out of this river into the Columbia a little below the place we landed, leaveing a high dry rich Island of about 400 yards wide and 800 yards long here we Seperated, I proceeded on to the river and Struck it at the foot of a verry Considerable rapid, here I beheld an emence body of water compressd in a narrow chanel of about 200 yds in width, fomeing over rocks maney of which presented their tops above the water, when at this place Capt. Lewis joined me haveing delayed on the wày to examine a root of which the nativs had been digging great quantities in the bottoms of this River. at about two miles above this river appears to be confined between two high hils below which it [is] divided by numbers of large rocks, and Small Islands covered with a low groth of timber, and has a rapid as far as the narrows, three Small Islands in the mouth of this River, this River haveing no Indian name that we could find out, except "the River on which the Snake Indians live",1 1 The Indians called this Towahnahiooks River. It is now known as the Des Chutes.—Ed. we think it best to leave the nameing of it untill our return. we proceeded on pass[ed] the mouth of this river at which place it appears to discharge ¼ as much water as runs down the Columbia, at two miles below this River passed Eight Lodges on the Lower point of the Rock Island aforesaid at those Lodges we saw large logs of wood which must have been rafted down the To wor-ne hi ooks River, below this Island on the main Stard. Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs, here we landed a fiew minits to Smoke, the lower point of one Island opposit which heads in the mouth of Towornehiooks River which I did not observe untill after passing these lodges about ? a mile lower passed 6 more Lodges on the Same Side and 6 miles below the upper mouth of Towornehiooks River the comencement of the pitch of the great falls,2 2 Now known as Celilo Falls; at their head is the town of Celilo, Ore.—Ed. opposit on the Stard. Side is 17 Lodges of the nativs we landed and walked down accompanied by an old man to view the falls, and the best rout for to make a portage which we Soon discovered was much nearest on the Stard. Side, and the distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards over a loose Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the bottoms below which was disagreeable to pass, as it was steep and loose. at the lower part of those rapids we arrived at 5 Large Lod[g]es of nativs drying and prepareing fish for market, they gave us Philburts,1 1 The only species of filberts of the Columbia region is Corylus californica Dc. —C. V. Piper. and berries to eate. we returned droped down to the head of the rapids and took every article except the Canoes across the portag[e] where I had formed a camp on [an] ellegable Situation for the protection of our Stores from thieft, which we were more fearfull of, than their arrows, we despatched two men to examine the river on the opposit Side, and [they] reported that the canoes could be taken down a narrow Chanel on the opposit Side after a Short portage at the head of the falls, at which place the Indians take over their Canoes. Indians assisted us over the portage with our heavy articles on their horses,2 2 "But for this service they repaid themselves so adroitly" (Biddle) that the explorers had to take the precaution mentioned in the second preceding sentence.—Ed. the waters is divided into Several narrow chanels which pass through a hard black rock forming Islands of rocks at this Stage of the water, on those Islands of rocks as well as at and about their Lodges I observe great numbers of Stacks of pounded Salmon neetly preserved in the following manner, i. e. after [being] suffi[c]ently Dried it is pounded between two Stones fine, and put into a speces of basket neetly made of grass and rushes better than two feet long and one foot Diamiter, which basket is lined with the Skin of Salmon Stretched and dried for the purpose, in this it is pressed down as hard as is possible, when full they Secure the open part with the fish Skins across which they fasten th[r]o. the loops of the basket that part very securely, and then on a Dry Situation they Set those baskets the corded part up, their common custom is to Set 7 as close as they can Stand and 5 on the top of them, and secure them with mats which is raped around them and made fast with cords and covered also with mats, those 12 baskets of from 90 to 100lbs. each form a Stack, thus preserved those fish may be kept Sound and sweet Several years, as those people inform me, Great quantities as they inform us are sold to the whites people who visit the mouth of this river as well as to the nativs below.3 3 Almost, if not quite, along the very ground over which Lewis and Clark dragged their canoes around the falls, the railway trains of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company run. . . . I have stood on the river bank and have seen stacks of fish standing waiting until the Indians were ready to use them.—O. D. Wheeler. on one of those Island[s] I saw Several tooms but did not visit them The principal Chiefs of the bands resideing about this Place is out hunting in the mountains to the S. W. no Indians reside on the S. W. side of this river for fear (as we were informed) of the Snake Indians, who are at war with the tribes on this river. they represent the Snake Indians as being verry noumerous, and resideing in a great number of villages on Towornehiooks River which falls in 6 miles above on the Lard. Side and it reaches a great ways and is large a little abov its mouth at which part it is not intersepted with rapids, they inform that one considerable rapid &amp; maney Small ones in that river, and that the Snake live on Salmon, and they go to war to their first villages in 12 days, the Course they pointed is S. E. or to the S of S. E. we are visited by great numbers of Indians to Day to view us, we purchased a Dog for Supper, some fish and with dificuelty precured as much wood as cooked Supper, which we also purchased we made 19 miles to day. [Clark, first draft:] October 23rd. Wednesday 1805 Took the canoes over the Portage on the Lard. Side with much dificulty, description on another Paper one canoe got loose &amp; cought by the Indians which we were obliged to pay our old Chiefs over herd the Indians from below say they would try to kill us &amp; informed us of it, we have all the arms examined and put in order, all the Indians leave us early. Great numbers of flees on the Lard Side. Shot a Sea Orter [otter] which I did not get, Great Numbers about those rapids we purchased 8 dogs, Small &amp; fat for our party to eate, the Indians not verry fond of selling their good fish, compells us to make use of dogs for food. Exchanged our small canoe for a large &amp; verry new one built for riding the waves obsd Merdn Altd 66° 27′ 30″. Latd. prodsd. 45° 42′ 57″3/10 North. October 23d. Wednesday 1805 a fine morning, I with the greater part of the men crossed in the canoes to opposit side above the falls and hauled them across the portage of 457 yards which is on the Lard. Side and certainly the best side to pass the canoes, I then decended through a narrow chanel of about 150 yards wide forming a kind of half circle in it[s] course of a mile to a pitch of 8 feet in which the chanel is divided by 2 large rocks, at this place we were obliged to let the Canoes down by strong ropes of Elk Skin which we had for the purpose, one Canoe in passing this place got loose by the cords breaking, and was cought by the Indians below. I accomplished this necessary business and landed Safe with all the canoes at our Camp below the falls by 3 oClock P. M. nearly covered with flees which were so thick amongst the Straw and fish Skins at the upper part of the portage at which place the nativs had been Camped not long since; that every man of the party was obliged to Strip naked dureing the time of takeing over the canoes, that they might have an oppertunity of brushing the flees of[f] their legs and bodies. Great numbers of Sea Otters in the river below the falls, I shot one in the narrow chanel to day which I could not get. Great numbers of Indians visit us both from above and below. one of the old Chiefs who had accompanied us from the head of the river, informed us that he herd the Indians Say that the nation below intended to kill us. we examined all the arms &amp;c. complete the amunition to 100 rounds. The nativs leave us earlyer this evening than usial, which gives a Shadow of confermation to the information of our old Chief, as we are at all times &amp; places on our guard, are under no greater apprehention than is common. we purchased 8 Small fat dogs for the party to eate; the nativs not being fond of Selling their good fish, compells us to make use of Dog meat for food, the flesh of which the most of the party have become fond of from the habits of useing it for Some time past. The altitude of this day 66°. 27′. 30″ gave for Latd. 45°. 42′. 57. 3/10 N. I observed on the beach near the Indian Lodges two butifull canoes of different Shape &amp; Size to what we had Seen above wide in the midd[l]e and tapering to each end, on the bow curious figures were cut in the wood &amp;c. Capt. Lewis went up to the Lodges to See those Canoes and exchanged our Smallest canoe for one of them by giveing a Hatchet &amp; few trinkets to the owner who informed that he purchased it of a white man below for a horse, these canoes are neeter made than any I have ever Seen and calculated to ride the waves, and carry emence burthens, they are dug thin and are suported by cross pieces of about 1 inch diamieter tied with Strong bark thro' holes in the Sides. our two old chiefs appeared verry uneasy this evening. [Clark, first draft:] October 24th. Thursday 1805 a fine morning the Indians approached us with caution, our 2 old Chiefs deturmine to return home, saying they were at war with Indians below and they would kill them we purswaded them to stay 2 nights longer with us, with a view to make a peace with those Indians below as well as to have them with us dureing our Delay with this tribe. Capt Lewis went to view the falls I set out with the party at 9 oClock a m at 2 ? miles passed a rock which makes from the Stard Side (4 Lodges above 1 below) and confined the river in a narrow channel of about 45 yards this continued for about ¼ of a mile &amp; widened to about 200 yards, in those narrows the water was agitated in a most shocking manner boils swells &amp; whorlpools, we passed with great risque It being impossible to make a portage of the canoes, about 2 miles lower passed a verry Bad place between 2 rocks one large &amp; in the middle of the river here our canoes took in some water I put all the men who could not swim on shore, &amp; sent a fiew articles such as guns &amp; papers, and landed at a Village of 21 houses on the Stard Side in a Deep bason where the river appeared to be blocked up with emence rocks. I walked down and examined the passage found it narrow, and one verry bad place a little below the houses I pursued this channel which is from 50 to 100 yards wide and swels and boils with a most tremendeous manner, prosued this channel 5 ms. &amp; returned found Capt Lewis &amp; a Chief from below with maney of his men on a visit to us, one of our Party Pete Crusat played on the violin which pleased the savage, the men danced, Great numbers of Sea Orter Pole Cats about those fishings the houses of those Indians are 20 feet square and sunk 8 feet under ground &amp; covered with bark with a small door round at top rose about 18 Inches above ground, to keep out the snow I saw 107 parcels of fish stacked, and great quantites in the houses. October 24th.. Thursday 1805 The morning fare after a beautifull night, the nativs approached us this morning with great caution. our two old chiefs expressed a desire to return to their band from this place, Saying "that they could be of no further Service to us, as their nation extended no further down the river than those falls, (they could no longer understand the language of those below the falls, till then not much difference in the vocabs.) and as the nation below had expressed hostile intentions against us, would certainly kill them; perticularly as they had been at war with each other;" we requested them to Stay with us two nights longer, and we would See the nation below and make a peace between them, they replied they "were anxious to return and See our horses" we insisted on their staying with us two nights longer to which they agreed; our views were to detain those Chiefs with us, untill we should pass the next falls, which we were told were very bad, and at no great distance below, that they might inform us of any designs of the nativs, and if possible to bring about a peace between them and the tribes below. The first pitch of this falls is 20 feet perpendecular, then passing thro' a narrow chanel for 1 mile to a rapid of about 8 feet fall below which the water has no perceptable fall but verry rapid See Sketch N°. 1. It may be proper here to remark that from Some obstruction below, the cause of which we have not yet learned, the water in high fluds (which are in the Spring) rise below these falls nearly to a leavel with the water above the falls; the marks of which can be plainly tracd. around the falls1 1 The reason of the rise in the water below the falls is, that for three miles down, the river is so confined by rocks (being not more than 70 yards wide), that it cannot discharge the water, as fast as it comes over the falls, until what is deficient in breadth is made up in depth.—Gass (p. 222). : at that Stage of the water the Salmon must pass up which abounds in such great numbers above. below those falls we[re] Salmon trout, and great numbers of the heads of a Species of trout Smaller than the Salmon, those fish they catch out of the Salmon Season, and are at this time in the act of burrying those which they had drid for winter food. the mode of bur[y]ing those fish is in holes of various Sizes, lined with Straw on which they lay fish Skins in which they inclose the fish which is laid verry close, and then covered with earth of about 12 or 15 inches thick. Capt. Lewis and three men crossed the river and on the opposit Side to view the falls which he had not yet taken a full view of. At 9 oClock a. m. I Set out with the party and proceeded on down a rapid Stream of about 400 yards wide at 2-? miles the river widened into a large bason to the Stard. Side on which there is five Lodges of Indians. here a tremendious black rock Presented itself high and Steep appearing to choke up the river; nor could I See where the water passed further than the current was drawn with great velocity to the Lard. Side of this rock at which place I heard a great roreing. I landed at the Lodges and the natives went with me to the top of this rock which makes from the Stard. Side, from the top of which I could See the dificuelties we had to pass for Several miles below; at this place the water of this great river is compressed into a chanel between two rocks not exceeding forty five yards wide and continues for a ¼ of a mile when it again widens to 200 yards and continues this width for about 2 miles when it is again intersepted by rocks. This obstruction in the river accounts for the water in high floods riseing to Such a hite at the last falls. The whole of the Current of this great river must at all Stages pass thro' this narrow chanel of 45 yards wide.2 2 The so-called Short Narrows of the Columbia.—Ed. as the portage of our canoes over this high rock would be impossible with our Strength, and the only danger in passing thro those narrows was the whorls and swills [swells] arriseing from the Compression of the water, and which I thought (as also our principal watermen Peter Crusat) by good Stearing we could pass down Safe, accordingly I deturmined to pass through this place notwithstanding the horrid appearance of this agitated gut swelling, boiling &amp; whorling in every direction, (which from the top of the rock did not appear as bad as when I was in it; however we passed Safe to the astonishment of all the Inds. of the last Lodges who viewed us from the top of the rock. passed one Lodge below this rock, and halted on the Stard. Side to view a very bad place, the current divided by 2 Islands of rocks the lower of them large and in the midal of the river, this place being verry bad I sent by land all the men who could not Swim and such articles as was most valuable to us such as papers Guns &amp; amunition, and proceeded down with the canoes two at a time to a village of 20 wood houses in a Deep bend to the Stard. Side below which [was] a rugid black rock about 20 feet hiter [higher] than the Common high fluds of the river with Several dry chanels which appeared to Choke the river up quite across; this I took to be the 2d. falls or the place the nativs above call timm, The nativs of this village re[ce]ived me verry kindly, one of whome envited me into his house, which I found to be large and comodious, and the first wooden houses in which Indians have lived Since we left those in the vicinty of the Illinois, they are scattered permiscuisly on a elivated Situation near a mound of about 30 feet above the Common leavel, which mound has Some remains of houses and has every appearance of being artificial. those houses are about the Same Shape Sise and form 20 feet Square, [wide and 30 feet long] with one Dore raised 18 Inches above ground, they [the doors—Ed.] are 29-? inches high &amp; 14 wide, forming in a half circle above, those houses were Sunk into the earth six feet, the roofs of them was Supported by [a ridge pole resting on] three Strong pieces of Split timber on which, [thro' one of which the dare was cut] that and the walls, the top of which was just above ground Supported a certain number of Spars which are Covered with the Bark of the white Ceadar, or Arber Vitea; and the whole attached and Secured by the fibers of the Cedar. the eaves at or near the earth, the gable ends and Side Walls are Secured with split boards which is Seported on iner Side with Strong pieces of timber under the eves &amp;c. to keep those pieces errect &amp; the earth from without pressing in the boards, Suported by Strong posts at the corners to which those poles were attached to give aditional Strength, small openings were left in the roof above the ground, for the purpose, as I conjectured, of deschargeing their arrows at a besiegeing enimey; Light is admited thro' an opening at top which also Serves for the Smoke to pass through,1 1 This village has better lodges than any on the river above; one story of which is sunk under ground and lined with flag mats. The upper part, about 4 feet above ground, is covered over with cedar bark, and they are tolerably comfortable houses.— Gass (p. 223). one half of those houses is apropriated for the storeing away Dried &amp; pounded fish which is the principal food, the other part next the dore is the part occupied by the nativs who have beds raised on either side, with a fire place in the center of this Space each house appeared to be occupied by about three families; that part which is apropriated for fish was crouded with that article, and a fiew baskets of burries. I dispatched a Sufficent number of the good Swimers back for the 2 canoes above the last rapid, and with 2 men walked down three miles to examine the river Over a bed of rocks, which the water at verry high fluds passes over, on those rocks I Saw Several large scaffols on which the Indians dry fish, as this is out of Season the poles on which they dry those fish are tied up verry Securely in large bundles and put upon the scaffolds, I counted 107 stacks of dried pounded fish in different places on those rocks which must have contained 10.000lb of neet fish, The evening being late I could not examine the river to my Satisfaction, the chanel is narrow and compressed for about 2 miles, when it widens into a deep bason to the Stard Side, &amp; again contracts into a narrow chanel divided by a rock. I returned through a rockey open countrey infested with pole-cats to the village where I met with Capt. Lewis the two old Chiefs who accompanied us &amp; the party &amp; canoes who had all arrived Safe; the Canoes haveing taken in some water at the last rapids. here we formed a camp near the village, The principal chief from the nation below with Several of his men visited us, and afforded a favourable oppertunity of bringing about a Piece and good understanding between this chief and his people and the two chiefs who accompanied us which we have the Satisfaction to say we have accomplished, as we have every reason to believe, and that those two bands or nations are and will be on the most friendly terms with each other, gave this great chief a Medal and some other articles, of which he was much pleased. Peter Crusat played on the violin and the men danced which delighted the nativs, who Shew every civility towards us. we Smoked with those people untill late at night, when every one retired to rest.

Friday 1805 A cool morning Capt. Lewis and my Self walked down to See the place the Indians pointed out as the worst place in passing through the gut, which we found difficuelt of passing without great danger, but as the portage was impracti[c]able with our large canoes, we concluded to Make a portage of our most valuable articles and run the canoes thro.1 1 The Long Narrows.—Ed. accordingly on our return divided the party Some to take over the Canoes, and others to take our Stores across a portage of a mile to a place on the chanel below this bad whorl &amp; Suck, with Some others I had fixed on the Chanel with roapes to throw out to any who Should unfortunately meet with difficuelty in passing through; great number of Indians viewing us from the high rocks under which we had to pass, the 3 fir[s]t canoes passed thro very well, the 4th. nearly filled with water, the last passed through by takeing in a little water, thus Safely below what I conceved to be the worst part of this chanel felt my self extreamly gratified and pleased. We loaded the Canoes &amp; set out, and had not proceeded more than 2 mile[s] before the unfortunate Canoe which filled crossing the bad place above, run against a rock and was in great danger of being lost; this Chanel is through a hard rough black rock, from 50 to 100 yards wide, swelling and boiling in a most tremendious maner Several places on which the Indians inform me they take the Salmon as fast as they wish; we passed through a deep bason to the Stard. Side of 1 mile below which the River narrows and [is] divided by a rock the curent we found quit[e] gentle, here we met with our two old chiefs who had been to a village below to smoke a friendly pipe and at this place they met the Chief &amp; party from the village above on his return from hunting all of whome were then crossing over their horses, we landed to Smoke a pipe with this Chief whome we found to be a bold pleasing looking man of about 50 years of age dressd. in a war jacket a cap Legins &amp; mockesons. he gave us some meat of which he had but little and informed us he in his rout met with a war party of Snake Indians from the great river of the S. E. which falls in a few miles above and had a fight. we gave this Chief a Medal, &amp;c. [had] a parting Smoke with our two faithful friends the chiefs who accompanied us from the head of the river, (who had purchased a horse each with 2 rob[e]s and intended to return on horseback) we proceeded on down the water fine, rocks in every derection for a fiew miles when the river widens and becoms a butifull jentle Stream of about half a mile wide, Great numbers of the Sea orter [or Seals] about those narrows and both below and above. we came too, under a high point of rocks on the Lard. Side below a creek of 20 yards wide and much water, as it was necessary to make Some Selestial observations we formed our camp on the top of a high point of rocks, which forms a kind of fortification in the Point between the river &amp; creek, with a boat guard,1 1 The point at which the expedition camped is just below the steamboat landing at Dalles City, and across Mill Creek or Quenett (Quinett), as the explorers understood the Indians to say.—O.

Only the size of the Lewis and Clark party protected them on their outward journey; upon the return they were nearly involved in battle with the Indians.—Ed. &amp;c. at the mouth of this creek Saw Some beaver Sign, and a Small wolf in a Snare set in the willows The Snars of which I saw Several made for to catch wolves, are made as follows vz. a long pole which will Spring is made fast with bark to a willow, on the top of this pole a string (Described elsewhere) [Clark, first draft:] October 26th. 1805 Saturday a fine morning sent out six men to hunt deer &amp; collect rozin to Pitch our canoes, had all our articles put out to dry.

Those Indians are at war with the Snake Indians on the river which falls in a few miles above this and have lately had a battle with them, their loss I cannot lern October 26th. Saturday 1805. A fine morning Sent Six men out to hunt Deer, and collect rozin to pitch the canoes which has become verry leakey by frequently hauling them over rocks &amp;c. as well [as] Striking rocks frequently in passing down. all our articles we have exposed to the Sun to Dry; and the Canoes drawn out and turned up. maney of our Stores entirely spoiled by being repeetedly wet,1 1 The astronomical data, being a transcript of those in the first draft, are here omitted.—Ed. A number of Indians came to the oposit side of the river in the fore part of the day and Shew[ed] that they were anxious to cross to us, we did not think proper to cross them in our Canoes and did not Send for them. in the evening two chiefs and 15 men came over in a Small Canoe, those two chiefs proved to be the two Principal Chiefs of the tribes above at the falls, and above, who was out hunting at the time we passed their bands; one of those Chiefs made Capt. Lewis and my self each a Small present of Deer meat, and small cakes of white bread made of roots. we gave to each chief a Meadel of the Small Size a red Silk handkerchief, arm band, Knife &amp; a piece of Paint, and acknowledged them as chiefs; as we thought it necessary at this time to treat those people verry friendly &amp; ingratiate our Selves with them, to insure us a kind &amp; friendly reception on our return, we gave Small presents to Several, and half a Deer to them to eate. we had also a fire made for those people to sit around in the middle of our camp, and Peter Crusat Played on the violin, which pleased those nativs exceedingly. (Yorke danced for the Inds.) the two Chiefs and several men deturmined to delay all night with us all the others returned, leaving the horses for those who staied on the opposit Side. our hunters returned in the evening Killed five Deer, four verry large grey Squirels and a grouse. one of the guard at the river guiged a Salmon Trout, which we had fried in a little Bears oil which the Chief we passed below the narrows gave us: this I thought one of the most delicious fish I have ever tasted Great numbers of white crain flying in different Directions verry high. The river rose 8 inches to day from what cause I cannot Say certainly, as the tides cannot effect the river here as there is a falls below, I conjecture that the rise is owing to the winds which has Set up the river for 24 hours past our hunters inform that the country back is broken, stoney and thinly timbered with pine and white Oake. They saw Elk &amp; Bear sign in the mountains. Dried all our wet articles and repaired our canoes to day, and the Party amused themselves at night danceing. The Flees which the party got on them at the upper &amp; great falls, are very troublesom and dificuelt to get rid of, perticularly as the me[n] have not a Change of Clothes to put on, they strip off their Clothes and kill the flees, dureing which time they remain nakid. The nations in the vicinity of this place is at War with the Snake Indians who they Say are noumerous and live on the river we passed above the falls on the Same Side on which we have encamped, and, the nearest town is about four days march they pointed nearly S.

October 29th. Tuesday 1805 A cloudy morning wind from the west but not hard, we Set out at day light, and proceeded on about five miles came too on the Stard. Side at a village of 7 houses built in the Same form and materials of those above, here we found the Chief we had Seen at the long narrows named [blank space in MS.] we entered his lodge and he gave us to eate Pounded fish, bread made of roots, Filbert nuts, &amp; the berries of Sackecomme. [Sac de Commis] we gave to each.woman of the lodge a brace of Ribon of which they were much pleased. each of those houses may be calculated to contain 8 men and 30 Soles, they are hospitable and good humered Speak the Same language of the inhabitants of the last village, we call this the friendly village. I observed in the lodge of the chief sundery articles which must have been precured from the white people, Such [as] a Scarlet &amp; blue cloth Sword Jacket &amp; hat. I also observed two wide Split boards w[i]th images on them cut and painted in emitation of a man; I pointed to this image and asked a man to what use he put them to, he Said Something the only word I understood was "good," and then Steped to the image and took out his Bow &amp; quiver to Show me, and Some other of his war emplemints, from behind it. The Chief then directed his wife to hand him his medison bag which he opened and Showed us 14 fingers [different fingers not little or middle fingers] which he said was the fingers of his enemies which he had taken in war, and pointed to S. E. from which direction I concluded they were Snake Indians, this is the first Instance I ever knew of the Indians takeing any other trofea of their exploits off the dead bodies of their Enimies except the Scalp. The chief painted those fingers with Several other articles which was in his bag red and securely put them back,1 1 After an harangue . . . the fingers were carefully replaced among the valuable contents of the red medicine-bag.—Biddle (ii, p. 47). haveing first mad[e] a short harrang which I suppose was bragging of what he had done in war. we purchased 12 Dogs and 4 Sacks of fish, &amp; some fiew ascid berries, after brackfast we proceeded on, the mountains are high on each side, containing scattering pine white Oake &amp; under groth, hill Sides Steep and rockey; at 4 miles lower we observed a small river falling in with great rapidity on the Stard. Side below which is a village of 11 houses, here we landed to Smoke a pipe with the nativs and examine the mouth of the river, which I found to be 60 yards wide rapid and deep, The inhabitants of the village are friendly and chearfull; those people inform us as also those at the last village that this little river is long and full of falls, no Salmon pass up it, it runs from N. N. E., that ten nations live on this river and its waters, on buries, and what game they can kill with their Bow &amp; arrows we purchased 4 dogs and set out. (this village is the of the Same nation of the one we last passed) and proceeded on. The countrey on each side begin[s] to be thicker timbered with Pine and low white oake; verry rockey and broken. passed three large rocks in the river the middle rock is large long and has Several Squar vaults on it, we call this rockey Island the Sepulchar.2 2 One of the best known Indian burial-places, still showing many remains in the shape of skulls and bones. O. D. Wheeler describes a grave and monument of a well-known Oregon pioneer, Trevitt, upon this island.—Ed. The last river we passed we shall call the Cataract River3 3 Now Klickitat River, in the county of the same name, in Washington.—Ed. from the number of falls which the Indians say is on it, passed 2 Lodges of Indians a short distance below the sepulchor Island on the Stard.

Side, opposit to a large Sand bar, in this creek the Indians above take their fish, here we saw Several canoes, which induc[e]d us to call this Canoe Creek it is 28 yards wide, about 4 miles lower and below the Sand bar is a butifull cascade falling over a rock of about 100 feet [high], a Short distance lower passed 4 Indian houses on the Lard. Side in a timbered bottom, a fiew miles further we came too at 3 houses on Stard. Side, back of which is a pond in which I Saw great numbers of Small Swan, Capt. Lewis and [I] went into the houses of those people who appeared Somewhat surprised at first Their houses are built on the Same Construction of those above, Speak the Same language and Dress in the Same way, robes of the Skins of wolves, Deer, Elk, wild cat, or Loucirvia &amp; fox, I also Saw a mountain Sheap2 2 Not a sheep, but the mountain goat (Haplocerus montanus). "Loucirvia" is only a corruption of the Fr. loup cervier; the lynx.—Ed. skin the wool of which is long, thick, &amp; corse with long corse hare on the top of the neck and back something resembling bristles of a goat, the skin was of white hare, those animals these people inform me by signs live in the mountains among the rocks, their horns are Small and streight, Orter Skins are highly prised among those people as well as those on the river above, They cue their hare which is divided on each sholder, and also ware small strips about their necks with the tale hanging down in front. Those people gave us, High bush cramberries, [described hereafter not H. B.

The only tree closely resembling the beech is the Oregon alder, but Lewis and Clark call this the "black alder," Mar. 28, and June 10, 1806. The "growth resembling the beech" may be the "Indian plum," Nuttallia cerasformis T. &amp; G.—C. V. Piper. passed maney large rocks in the river and a large creek on the Stard. Side in the mouth of which is an Island3 3 Now Rock Creek, just above the Cascades.—Ed. passed on the right of 3 Islands near the Stard. Side, and landed on an Island close under the Stard.

Ponds back of the houses, and countrey low for a short distance. The day proved cloudy dark and disagreeable with some rain all day which kept us wet. The countary a high mountain on each side thickly covered with timber, such as Spruce, Pine, Cedar, oake Cotton &amp;c. &amp;c. I took two men and walked down three miles to examine the Shute and river below proceeded along an old Indian path, passd. an old village at 1 mile on an ellevated Situation of, this village contained verry large houses built in a different form from any I had seen, and laterly abandoned, and the most of the boa[r]ds put into a pond of water near the village, as I conceived to drown the flees, which was emensely noumerous about the houses, I found by examonation that we must make a portage of the greater perpotion of our stores 2-? miles, and the canoes we could haul over the rocks, I returned at Dark Capt. Lewis and 5 men had just returned from the village, Capt. L. informed me that he found the nativs kind, they gave him berries, nuts &amp; fish to eate; but he could get nothing from them in the way of information. The greater part of the inhabitants of this Village being absent down the river Some distance colecting roots Capt. L. Saw one gun and Several articles which must have been precured from the white people. a wet disagreeable evening, the only wood we could get to burn on this little Island on which we have encamped is the newly discovered Ash, which makes a tolerable fire. we made fifteen miles to daye. [Clark, first draft:] October 31st. Thursday 1805. a cloudey raney morning I proceed down the river to view it more at leasure, I took Jos. Fields &amp; Peter Crusat and proceeded on down, Send Crusat back at 2 ms. to examine the rapid near the shore &amp; I proceeded on down about 10 miles to a very high rock in a bottom on the Stard. opsd. 2 Islands covered with timber on which I saw Inds. at a distance; found the river rocky for 6 miles, after which the current became uniform. at 1 mile I passed an old deserted village on a Pond on a high situation of 8 Houses. at 3 ? miles one house the only remr. of an antient village ? a mile lower I saw 8 vaults for the Dead which was nearly square 8 feet closely covered with broad boa[r]ds curiously ingraved, the bones in some of those vaults were 4 feet thick, in others the Dead was yet layed side of each other nearly East &amp; west, [w]raped up &amp; bound securely in robes, great numbers of trinkets Brass kittles, sea shells, Iron Pan Hare &amp;c. &amp;c. were hung about the vaults and great maney wooden gods, or Imeges of men cut in wood, set up around the vaults, some of those so old and worn by time that they were nearly worn out of shape, and some of those vaults so old that they were roted entirely to the ground. not withstanding they [the] wood is of Pine &amp; [word illegible.—Ed.] or Seder as also the wooden gods. I can not learn certainly if those people worship those wooden emiges, they have them in conspicuous parts of their houses at 5 miles I passed 4 large houses on the Stard Side a little above the last rapid and opposit a large Island which is Situated near the Lard Side. The enhabitents of those houses had left them closely shut up, They appeared to contain a great deel of property and Provisions such as those people use. I did not disturb any thing about those houses, but proceed[ed] on down below the rapid which I found to be the last, a large village has at some period been on the Stard Side below this rapid The bottom is high stoney and about 2 miles wide covered with grass, here is the head of a large Island in high water, at this time no water passes on the Stard. Side I walked thro this Island which I found to be verry rich, open &amp; covered with Strawberry vines, and has greatly the appearance of having at some period been cultivated, The natives has dug roots in some parts of this Isl. which is about 3 miles long &amp; 1 wide, a small Island covered with timber opposit the lower point no water runs on the Stard Side of it below and in the middle of the river is a large Island covered with tall trees opposit the Strawberry Island on its Stard Side a creek falls in which has no running water at present, it has the appearance of throwing out emence torents. I saw 5 Indians in a canoe below. Jo [Fields] killed a Sand hill Crane &amp; we returned by the same rout to camp at the grand Shute where I found several Indians, I smoked Two canoes loaded with fish for the Trade below come down &amp; unloaded The after noon fare S. 30°. E 1 mile to a Lard Bend passing the Grand Shute which is ¼ of a mile and the water confined within about 150 yards, passing with Tremendeous force, great number of rocks in the upper pt. of this shute, a low pine mountain on the Stad. Side, high one on the Lard Side. S. 30°. W. 1 mile to a Lard. bend passed several rocks in the river &amp; a rapid at ¾ of a mile the water being confined between large rocks, maney of which is under water. an old village of 8 houses on the Stard. Side on the hill opposit. S. 45°. W 2 miles to a high rock above the upper point of a large Isld. on the Lard Side, passed maney rocks in different derections, a house on the Stard. at 1 mile just below is 8 Indian vaults in which is great number of dead, raped up their trinkets, &amp; wooden Gods are placed around the vaults, they lie East &amp; west S. 60°. W 2 miles to a large black rock in a Stard. bend at the commencement of a rapid opsd. lower point of an Island Lard passed a rapid at ? ml. not bad. several large rocks in the river permiscusly, 4 large Ind. houses without inhabitents on the Stard. Side at 1 ? mile a Island on the Lard Side extensive high stoney bottoms on the Stard Side South 2 miles to a creek under a Bluff in a Lard bend passed the rapid ¼ of a mile long. the upper point of a large Island on the Stard.

Side of it at present this Island high rich and open covered with Strawbery vines a narrow open bottom on the Lard Side Those Indians cut off the hands of those they kill &amp; preserve the fingers. October 31st. Thursday 1805 A cloudy rainey disagreeable morning I proceeded down the river to view with more attention [the rapids] we had to pass on the river below, the two men with me. Jo. Fields &amp; Peter Crusat proceeded down to examine the rapids the Great Shute1 1 Fr. chute, "fall." This is known as the Cascades of the Columbia. The Cascades cover a stretch of water several miles long where the river breaks through the Cascade Mountains. The Upper Cascades are those Lewis and Clark called the "Great Shute." The entire fall for three miles is sixty feet.—Ed. which commenced at the Island on which we encamped continued with great rapidity and force thro a narrow chanel much compressd. and interspersed with large rocks for ? a mile, at a mile lower is a verry considerable rapid at which place the waves are remarkably high, and proceeded on in a old Indian parth 2-? miles by land thro a thick wood &amp; hill Side, to the river where the Indians make a portage, from this place I Dispatched Peter Crusat (our principal waterman) back to follow the river and examine the practibility of the canoes passing, as the rapids appeared to continue down below as far as I could See, I with Jo Fields proceeded on, at ? a mile below the end of the portage passed a house where there had been an old town for ages past as this house was old Decayed and a place of flees I did not enter it, about ? a mile below this house in a verry thick part of the woods is 8 Vaults, which appeared closely covered and highly deckerated with orniments. Those vaults are all nearly the Same size and form 8 feet square, 6 feet high, sloped a little so as to convey off the rain, made of Pine or cedar boards Closely Connected &amp; s[e]curely Covered with wide boards, with a Dore left in the East side which is partially stoped with wide boards curiously engraved. In Several of those vaults the dead bodies w[e]re raped up verry securely in Skins tied around with cords of grass and bark, laid on a mat, all east &amp; west and some of those vaults had as maney as 4 Bodies laying on the Side of each other. the other Vaults containing bones only, Some contained bones for the debth of 4 feet. on the tops and on poles attached to those vaults hung Brass kittles &amp; frying pans pearced through their bottoms, baskets, bowls of wood, sea Shels, skins, bits of Cloth, hair, bags of Trinkets &amp; Small pieces of bone &amp;c. and independant of the [Hieroglyphics, figures of men &amp; animals] curious engraveing and Paintings on the boards which formed the Vaults I observed Several wooden Images, cut in the figure[s] of men and Set up on the Sides of the vaults all round, Some of those so old and worn by time, that they were nearly out of Shape,1 1 Wooden and stone Images like those here mentioned were found in great numbers by the early settlers, and many have been preserved. They suggest the figures of Idols which are brought from foreign lands.—Eva E. Dye. I also observed the remains of Vaults rotted entirely into the ground and covered with moss. This must bee the burrying place for maney ages for the inhabitants of those rapids, the vaults are of the most lasting timber Pine &amp; Cedar. I cannot say certainly that those nativs worship those wooden idols as I have every reason to believe they do not; as they are Set up in the most conspicious parts of their houses, and treated more like orniments than objects of adoration. at 2 miles lower and 5 below our Camp I passed a village of 4 large houses, abandond by the nativs, with their dores bared up, I looked into those houses and obsirved as much property as is usial in the houses of those people which induced me to conclude that they w[e]re at no great distance, either hunting or Colecting roots, to add to their winter subsistance. from a Short distance below the vaults the mountain which is but low on the Stard. Side, leave[s] the river, and a leavel stoney open bottom suckceeds on the Said Std. Side for a great Distance down, the mountains high and rugid on the Lard. Side this open bottom is about 2 miles a Short distance below this village is a bad Stoney rapid and appears to be the last in view I observed at this lower rapid the remains of a large and antient Village which I could plainly trace by the Sinks in which they had formed their houses, as also those in which they had buried their fish. from this rapid to the lower end of the portage the river is crouded with rocks of various sises between which the water passes with great velociety createing in maney places large waves, an Island which is Situated near the Lard. Side occupies about half the distance the lower point of which is at this rapid. immediately below this rapid the high water passes through a narrow chanel through the Stard. Bottom forming an Island of 3 miles Long &amp; one wide; I walked through this Island which I found to be verry rich land, and had every appearance of haveing been at some distant period cultivated at this time it is covered with grass intersperced with strawberry vines, I observed Several places on this Island where the nativs had dug for roots and from its lower point I observed 5 Indians in a Canoe below the upper point of an Island near the middle of the river covered with tall timber, which induced me to believe that a village was at no great distance below, I could not see any rapids below in the extent of my view which was for a long distance down the river, which from the last rapids widened and had everry appearance of being effected by the tide [this was in fact the first tide water] I deturmined to return to camp 10 miles distant, a remarkable high detached rock Stands in a bottom on the Stard. Side near the lower point of this Island on the Stard. Side about 800 feet high and 400 paces around, we call the Beaten [Beacon] rock.1 1 This rock is a well-known landmark on the lower river, and stands to-day as it did in the time of Lewis and Clark. It has been called Pillar Rock, but is now usually known as Castle Rock.—Ed. a Brook falls into the narrow chanel which forms the [what we call] Strawberry Island, which at this time has no running water, but has every appearance of dischargeing emence torrents &amp;c. &amp;c. Jo. Fields shot a Sand hill Crane. I returned by the Same rout on our Indian parth passing up on the N. W. Side of the river to our Camp at the Great Shute found Several Indians from the village, I Smoked with them; Soon after my return two canoes loaded with fish &amp; Bear grass for the trade below, came down from the village at the mouth of the Catterack River, they unloaded and turned their canoes up Side down on the beech, &amp; camped under a Shelving rock below our Camp. One of the men shot a goose above this Great Shute, which was floating into the Shute, when an Indian observed it, plunged! into the water &amp; swam to the Goose and brought in on shore, at the head of the Suck, [great danger, rapids bad, a descent close by him (150 feet off,) of all Columbia River, current dashed among rocks, if he had got in the Suck—lost] as this Indian richly earned the goose I suffered him to keep it which he about half picked and Spited it up with the guts in it to roste. This Great Shute or falls is about ? a mile, with the water of this great river compressed within the space of 150 paces in which there is great numbers of both large and Small rocks, water passing with great velocity forming [foaming] &amp; boiling in a most horriable manner, with a fall of about 20 feet, below it widens to about 200 paces and current gentle for a Short distance. a Short distance above is three Small rockey Islands and at the head of those falls, three Small rockey Islands are Situated crosswise the river, Several rocks above in the river. &amp; 4 large rocks in the head of the Shute; those obstructions together with the high Stones which are continually braking loose from the mountain on the Stard. Side and roleing down into the Shute aded to those which brake loose from these Islands above and lodge in the Shute, must be the cause of the rivers daming up to such a distance above, where it shows such evidant marks of the common current of the river being much lower than at the present day.

I can't lern whether those Indians trade with white people or Inds below for the Beeds &amp; copper which they are so fond of. They are nearly necked prefuring beeds to any thing. Those Beeds they trafick with Indians still higher up this river for skins robes &amp;c.&amp;c. The Indians on those waters do not appear to be sickly, sore eyes are common and maney have lost their eyes, some one and maney both, they have bad teeth, and the greater perpotion of them have worn their teeth down, maney into the gums. They are rather small high cheeks, women small and homely, maney of them have sweled legs, large about the knees owing to the position in which they set on their hams, They are nearly necked only a piece of leather tied about their breech and a small robe which generally comes to a little below their wastes and scercely sufficently large to cover arround them when confined they are all fond of clothes but more so of Beeds particularly blue &amp; white beeds. They are durty in the extreme both in their cooking and in their houses. Those at the last Village raise the beads about five feet from the earth, under which they store their Provisions. Their houses is about 33 feet to 50 feet square, the dore of which is about 30 Inches high and 16 Inches wide in this form cut in a wide part of Pine board, they have maney imeges cut in wood, generally in the figure of a man. Those people are high with what they have to sell, and say the white people below give them great Prices for what they sell to them. Their noses are all Pierced, and the[y] wear a white shell maney of which are 2 Inches long pushed thro' the nose. all the women have fiat heads pressed to almost a point at top. The[y] press the female childrens heads between 2 bords when young untill they form the skul as they wish it which is generally verry flat. This amongst those people is considered as a great mark of buty, and is practised in all the tribes we have passed on this river more or less.

Friday 1805 A verry cool morning wind hard from the N. E. The Indians who arrived last evening took their Canoes on ther Sholders and carried them below the Great Shute, we Set about takeing our Small canoe and all the baggage by land 940 yards of bad slippery and rockey way. The Indians we discoverd took ther loading the whole length of the portage 2-? miles, to avoid a second Shute which appears verry bad to pass, and thro' which they passed with their empty canoes. Great numbers of Sea Otters, they are so cautious that I with dificelty a Shot at one today, which I must have killed, but could not get him as he Sunk. We got all our baggage over the Portage of 940 yards, after which we got the 4 large canoes over by slipping them over the rocks on poles placed across from one rock to another, and at some places along partial Streams of the river. in passing those canoes over the rocks &amp;c. three of them rec[ei]ved injuries which obiliged us to delay to have them repared. Several Indian Canoes arrived at the head of the portage, Some of the men acompanied by those from the village come down to Smoke with us, they appear to Speak the same language with a little different axcent1 1 Astronomical data here omitted, being a transcript of those in first draft.—Ed. I visited the Indian Village found that the construction of the houses [was] Similar to those abov[e] described, with this difference only, that they are larger say from 35 to 50 feet by 30 feet, raised about 5 feet above the earth, and nearly as much below the Dores in the Same form and size cut in the wide post which supports one end of the ridge pole and which is carved and painted with different figures &amp; Hieroglyphics. Those people gave me to eate nuts berries &amp; a little dried fish, and Sold me a hat of their own taste without a brim, and baskets in which they hold their water. Their beads [beds] are raised about 4-? feet, under which they Store away their dried fish, between the part on which they lie and the back wall, they Store away their roots burries nuts and valuable articles on mats, which are Spread also around the fireplace which is Sunk about one foot lower than the bottom flore of the house, this fireplace is about 8 feet long and Six feet wide secured with a fraim, those houses are calculated for 4, 5 &amp; 6 families, each familey haveing a nice painted ladder to assend up to their beads. I Saw in those houses Several wooden Images all cut in imitation of men, but differently fasioned and placed in the most conspicious parts of the houses, probably as an orniment I cannot lern certainly as to the traffick those Inds. carry on below, if white people or the indians who trade with the whites who are either settled or visit the mouth of this river. I believe mostly with the latter as their knowledge of the white people appears to be verry imperfect, and the articles which they appear to trade mostly i. e. Pounded fish, Beargrass, and roots; cannot be an object of comerce with furin merchants. however they git in return for those articles Blue and white beeds copper [Tea] Kettles, brass arm bands, some scarlet and blue robes and a fiew articles of old clothes, they prefer beeds to any thing, and will part with the last mouthful or articles of clothing they have for a fiew of those beeds, those beeds the[y] trafick with Indians Still higher up this river for roabs, skins, cha-pel-el bread,1 1 Elsewhere spelled "shappellel" and "shappalell"; the word is a corruption of the Chinook tsá-po-lil, meaning "bread" or "flour." Gass says (p. 289): "A kind of bread the natives make of roots, and bake in the sun; and which is strong and palatable." In the Lewis and Clark collection of dried plants which is deposited in the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences is a specimen of "an umbelliferous plant of the root of which the Wallowallows make a kind of bread. The natives call it Shappalell." This Meehan identifies as Cymopterus campestris; but C. V. Piper, of the Washington Agricultural experiment station, regards it as a species of Lomatium. —Ed. beargrass &amp;c. who in their turn trafick with those under the rockey mountains for Beargrass, quarmash [Pashîco] roots &amp; robes &amp;c. The nativs of the waters of the Columbia appear helthy, Some have tumers on different parts of their bodies, and Sore and weak Eyes are common, maney have lost their Sight entirely, great numbers with one eye out and frequently the other verry weak, This misfortune I must again asscribe to the water &amp;c. They have bad teeth, which is not common with Indians, maney have worn their teeth down and Some quite into their gums, this I cannot satisfactorily account for it, do ascribe it in some measure to their method of eateing, their food, roots pert[i]cularly, which they make use of as they are taken out of the earth frequently nearly covered with sand, I have not Seen any of their long roots offered for Sale clear of sand. They are rether below the Common Size high cheeks womin Small and homely, and have Swelled legs and thighs, and their knees remarkably large which I ascribe to the method in which they sit on their hams go nearly necked wareing only a piece of leather tied about their breast which falls down nearly as low as the waste, a small roabe about 3 feet square, and a piece of leather tied about their breach, They [womin] have all flat heads in this quarter both men and women. They are dirty in the extream, both in their person and cookery. ware their hare loose hanging in every direction. They ask high prices for what they Sell and Say that the white people below give great prices for every thing &amp;c. The noses are all pierced and when they are dressed they have a long tapered piece of white shell or wampum put through the nose, those Shells are about 2 inches in length. I observed in maney of the villeages which I have passed, the heads of the female children in the press for the purpose of compressing their heads in their infancy into a certain form, between two boards1 1 This custom is described by Gass (pp. 224–225).—Ed.</field>

I saw a number of verry large spruce Pine one of which I measured 14 feet around and verry tall.

Thursday 1805 rained all the last night without intermition, and this morning. wind blows verry hard, but our situation is Such that we cannot tell from what point it comes. one of our canoes is much broken by the waves dashing it against the rocks. 5 Indians came up in a canoe, thro' the waves, which is verry high and role with great fury. They made Signs to us that they saw the 3 men we Sent down yesterday. only 3 of those Indians landed, the other 2 which was women played off in the waves, which induced me to Suspect that they had taken Something from our men below, at this time one of the men Colter returnd. by land and informed us that those Indians had taken his Gigg &amp; basket, I called to the Squars to land and give back the gigg, which they would not doe untill a man ran with a gun, as if he intended to Shute them when they landed, and Colter got his gig &amp; basket I then ordered those fellows off, and they verry readily cleared out they are of the War-ci-a-cum N. Colter informed us that "it was but a Short distance from where we lay around the point to a butifull Sand beech, which continued for a long ways, that he had found a good harber in the mouth of a creek near 2 Indian Lodges—that he had proceeded in the canoe as far as he could for the waves, the other two men Willard &amp; Shannon had proceeded on down ["] Capt.

[Clark, first draft:] November 15th. Friday 1805. Rained all the last night at intervales of sometimes of 2 hours, This morning it became cold &amp; fair, I prepared to set out at which time the wind sprung up from the S. E. and blew down the River &amp; in a fiew minits raised such swells and waves brakeing on the Rocks at the Point as to render it unsafe to proceed. I went to the point in an empty canoe and found it would be dangerous to proceed even in an empty canoe The sun shown untill 1 oClock P. M. which gave an oppertunity for us to dry some of our bedding &amp; examine our baggage, the greater Part of which I found wet. some of our Pounded fish spoiled I had all the arms put in order &amp; amunition examined. The rainey weather continued without a longer intermition than 2 hours at a time, from the 5th. in the morng. untill the 16th. is eleven days rain, and the most disagreeable time I have experenced confined on a tempiest coast wet, where I can neither git out to hunt, return to a better situation, or proceed on: in this situation have we been for Six days past. fortunately the wind lay about 3 oClock we loaded I in great haste and set out passed the blustering Point below which is a sand beech, with a small marshey bottom for 3 miles on the Stard. Side, on which is a large village of 36 houses deserted by the Inds &amp; in full possession of the flees, a small creek fall[s] in at this village, which waters the Country for a few miles back; Shannon &amp; 5 Indians met me here, Shannon informed me he met Capt. Lewis some distance below &amp; he took Willard with him &amp; sent him to meet me, the Inds. with him wer rogues, they had the night before stold both his and Willards guns from under their heads, Capt. Lewis &amp; party arrived at the camp of those Indians at so timely a period that the Inds. were allarmed &amp; delivered up the guns &amp;c. The tide meeting of me and the emence swells from the Main Ocian (imedeately in front of us) raised to such a hite that I concluded to form a camp on the highest spot I could find in the marshey bottom, and proceed no further by water as the Coaste becomes verry [dangerous] for crafts of the size of our Canoes, and as the Ocian is imedeately in front and gives us an extensive view of it from Cape disapointment to Point addams, except 3 small Islands off the mouth and S W of us. my situation is in the upper part of Haleys Bay S. 86°. W. course miles to Cape Disapt. and S. 35°. W. course miles from Point Addams. The River here at its mouth from Point addams to the enterance of Haley Bay above is [blank space in MS.] miles or thereabouts, a large Isd. the lower point of which is immediately in the mouth above 4 Indians in a canoe came down with papto [wapatoo] roots to sell, for which they asked blankets or robes, both of which we could not spare I informed those Indians all of which understood some English that if they stole our guns &amp;c the men would certainly shute them, I treated them with great distance, &amp; the sentinal which was over our Baggage allarmed them verry much, they all Promised not to take any thing, and if any thing was taken by the squars &amp; bad boys to return them &amp;c. the waves became verry high Evening fare &amp; pleasent, our men all comfortable in the camps they have made of the boards they found at the Town above November 15th. Friday 1805 Rained all the last night, this morning it became calm and fair, I preposed Setting out, and ordered the canoes Repared and loaded; before we could load our canoes the wind Sudenly Sprung up from the S. E. and blew with Such violence, that we could not proceed in Safty with the loading. I proceeded to the point in an empty canoe, and found that the waves dashed against the rocks with such Violence that I thought it unsave to Set out with the loaded canoes. The Sun Shown untill 1 oClock P. M. which afford[ed] us time to Dry our bedding and examine the baggage which I found nearly all wet, Some of our pounded fish Spoiled in the wet, I examined the amunition and caused all the arms to be put in order. about 3 oClock the wind luled, and the river became calm, I had the canoes loaded in great haste and Set Out, from this dismal nitich where we have been confined for 6 days passed, without the possibility of proceeding on, returning to a better Situation, or get out to hunt; Scerce of Provisions, and torents of rain poreing on us all the time. proceeded on passed the blustering point below which I found a butifull Sand beech thro which runs a Small river from the hills, below the mouth of this Stream is a village of 36 houses uninhabited by anything except flees, here I met G. Shannon and 5 Indians. Shannon informed me that he met Capt. Lewis at an Indian Hut about 10 miles below who had sent him back to meet me, he also told me the Indians were thievish, as the night before they had Stolen both his and Willards rifles from under their heads [they threatened them with a large party from above which Capt. Lewis's arrival confirmed] that they Set out on their return and had not proceeded far up the beech. before they met Capt. Lewis, whose arival was at a timely moment and alarmed the Indians So that they instantly produced the Guns. I told those Indians who accompanied Shannon that they should not come near us, and if any one of their nation Stold anything from us, I would have him Shot, which they understoot verry well. as the tide was comeing in and the Seas became verry high imediately from the ocian (imediately faceing us) I landed and formed a camp on the highest Spot I could find between the hight of the tides, and the Slashers in a small bottom this I could plainly See would be the extent of our journey by water, as the waves were too high at any stage for our Canoes to proceed any further down. in full view of the Ocian from Point Adams or Rond (see La Payrouse) to Cape Disapointment, I could not see any Island in the mouth of this river as laid down by Vancouver. the Bay which he laies down in the mouth is imediately below me.1 1 This bay is now known as Baker's Bay (sometimes called Rogue's Harbor). George Vancouver was commissioned by the English government to explore the N. W. coast of America; he did this during 1792–94, but in the first of these voyages (1792) he failed to find the Columbia, although he was in the above-named bay. One of his officers, however, Lieut. W. R. Broughton, discovered it in the autumn of that year, ascended the river to the Cascades, and took possession of the country for Great Britain. In 1786 a French expedition for scientific research and commercial information, headed by La Pérouse, made some explorations along the Alaska coast and for some distance southward. The report of his voyage was not published until 1798; the most important part of it is that which records his scientific observations.—Ed. This Bay we call Haley's bay2 2 The Haley's Bay of Lewis and Clark is now Baker's Bay. It was named in 1792 by Lieutenant Broughton, for the Captain of an American brig which he encountered in this bay. Point Adams was the name given by Captain Gray to the southern cape at the mouth of the Columbia. He named the northern cape Point Hancock; but Capt. John Meares, who in 1788 explored this coast, and failed to recognize the entrance of the Columbia as the mouth of a great river, called the bay Deception, and the northern headland, Cape Disappointment. Vancouver retained this nomenclature, which consequently persisted.—Ed. from a favourite trader with the Indians which they Say comes into this Bay and trades with them course to Point adams is S. 35°. W. about 8 miles to Cape Disapointment is S. 86° W. about 14 miles 4 Indians of the War-ki-a-cum nation came down with pap-pa-too (Wappatoo) to Sell &amp;c. The Indians who accompanied Shannon from the Village below Speake a Different language from those above, and reside to the north of this place The[y] Call themselves Chinnooks3 3 Sometimes known as Chinooks (or Tsinuks) proper; they are almost extinct now. From them is named the Chinookan family, embracing many of the tribes encountered by Lewis and Clark on the lower Columbia.—Ed. , I told those people that they had attempted to Steal 2 guns &amp;c. that if any one of their nation stole any thing that the Sentenl. whome they Saw near our baggage with his gun would most certainly Shute them, they all promised not to tuch a thing, and if any of their womin or bad boys took any thing to return it imediately and chastise them for it. I treated those people with great distance. our men all comfortable in their Camps1 1 Fort Columbia, opposite Astoria—a new fort, equipped with heavy ordnance—is probably upon or near the site of the old camp of Lewis and Clark (Nov. 15–25, 1805), as well as that of the Chinook village of their friend Concomly.—O. D. Wheeler. which they have made of boards from the old village above, we made 3 miles to day. [Clark, first draft:] November 16th.

The tide rises at this place 8 feet 6 inches and comes in with great waves brakeing on the Sand beech on which we lay with great fury Six hunters out this morning in serch of Deer &amp; fowl.1 1 The astronomical data are here omitted, being a transcript of those given in first draft.—Ed. At half past 10 Clock Capt. Lewis returned haveing travesed Haley Bay to Cape Disapointment and the Sea coast to the North for Some distance. Several Chinnook Indians followed Capt. L—, and a Canoe came up with roots mats &amp;c. to Sell. those Chinnooks made us a present of a rute boiled much resembling the common liquorice in taste and Size: [They call cul-wha-mo]1 1 Silas B. Smith says of this plant (Wonderland, 1900, p. 61): "'culhoma' should be 'culwhayma.' It is the root of what is popularly known as the wild blue lupine . . . it tastes something like a sweet potato." Douglas identifies it as Lupinus littoralis; the licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidata) does not grow at the mouth of the Columbia.—Ed. in return for this root we gave more than double the value to Satisfy their craveing dispostn. It is a bad practice to receive a present from those Indians as they are never satisfied for what they recive in return if ten time the value of the articles they gave. This Chinnook Nation is about 400 Souls inhabid the countrey on the Small rivers which run into the bay below us and on the Ponds to the N. W. of us, live principally on fish and roots, they are well armed with fusees and Sometimes kill Elk Deer and fowl, our hunters killed to day 3 Deer, 4 brant and 2 Ducks, and inform me they Saw Some Elk Sign. I directed all the men who wished to see more of the main Ocian to prepare themselves to Set out with me early on tomorrow morning. The principal chief of the Chinnooks &amp; his family came up to See us this evening. [Clark, first draft:] Novr. 18th.

This creek appears to be nothing more than the conveyance of Several Small dreans from the high hills and the ponds on each side near its mouth. here we were set across all in one canoe by 2 squars. to each I gave a small hook S. 79°. W. 5 Miles to the mouth of Chin nook river,1 1 Wallacut River, on the U. S. Coast survey chart.—Ed. passed a low bluff [of a small hite] at 2 miles below which is the remains of huts near which place is also the remains of a whale on the sand, the countrey low open and Slashey, with elivated lands interspersed covered with (Some) pine &amp; thick under groth. This river is 40 yards wide at low tide. here we made a fire and dined on 4 brant and 48 Plever which was killed by Labiech on the coast as we came on. Rubin Fields Killed a Buzzard [Vulture] of the large Kind near the [meat of the] whale we Saw [W. 25lb.] measured from the tips of the wings across 9 ? feet, from the point of the Bill to the end of the tail 3 feet 10-¼ inches, middle toe 5-? inches, toe nale 1 inch &amp; 3-? lines, wing feather 2-? feet long &amp; 1 inch 5 lines diamiter, tale feathers 14-? inches, and the head is 6-? inches including the beak. [head in Peale's Mus.]1 1 This was the Californian condor (Pseudogryphus californianus), as large as the condor of the Andes.—Ed. after dineing we crossed the river in an old canoe which I found on the sand near Some old houses and proceeded on S. 20°. W. 4 Miles to a Small rock island in a deep nitch passed a nitch at 2 miles in which there is a dreen from Some ponds back; the land low opposite this nitch a bluff of yellow clay and Soft Stone from the river to the commencement of this nitch. below the countrey rises to high hills of about 80 or 90 feet above the water. at 3 miles passed a nitch. this rock Island is Small and at the South of a deep bend in which the nativs inform us the Ships anchor, and from whence they receive their goods in return for their peltries and Elk skins &amp;c. this appears to be a very good harber for large Ships. here I found Capt. Lewis name on a tree. I also engraved my name, &amp; by land the day of the month and year, as also Several of the men. S. 46°. E. 2 Miles to the iner extremity of Cape Disapointment passing a nitch in which there is a Small rock island, a Small Stream falls into this nitch from a pond which is imediately on the Sea coast passing through a low isthmus. this Cape is an ellivated circlier [circular] point covered with thick timber on the iner Side and open grassey exposur next to the Sea and rises with a Steep assent to the hight of about 150 or 160 feet above the leavel of the water this cape as also the Shore both on the Bay &amp; Sea coast is a dark brown rock.2 2 In the Courses and Distances (Codex H, p. 148) which here end, Clark entered "Ocian 165 Miles from quick sand river.

I arose early this morning from under a Wet blanket caused by a Shower of rain which fell in the latter part of the last night, and Sent two men on a head with directions to proceed on near the Sea Coast and Kill Something for brackfast and that I should follow my self in about half an hour. after drying our blankets a little I set out with a view to proceed near the Coast the direction of which induced me to conclude that at the distance of 8 or 10 miles, the Bay was at no great distance across. I overtook the hunters at about 3 miles, they had killed a Small Deer on which we brackfast[ed], it Comen[c]ed raining and continud moderately untill 11 oClock A M. after takeing a Sumptious brackfast of Venison which was rosted on Stiks exposed to the fire, I proceeded on through ruged Country of high hills and Steep hollers on a course from the Cape N 20°.

W. from the top of the hill above the Sand Shore to a Point of high land distant near 20 miles. this point I have taken the Liberty of Calling after my particular friend Lewis.2 2 This promontory is now known as North Head, where a new and modern lighthouse stands. North of it is Long Beach, a well-known summer resort, extending for several miles along the coast.—Ed. at the commencement of this Sand beech the high lands leave the Sea Coast in a Direction to Chinnook river, and does not touch the Sea Coast again below point Lewis leaveing a low pondey Countrey, maney places open with small ponds in which there is great numbr. of fowl I am informed that the Chinnook Nation inhabit this low countrey and live in large wood houses on a river which passes through this bottom Parrilal to the Sea coast and falls into the Bay I proceeded on the sandy coast 4 miles, and marked my name on a Small pine, the Day of the month &amp; year, &amp;C. and returned to the foot of the hill, from which place I intended to Strike across to the Bay, I saw a Sturgeon which had been thrown on Shore and left by the tide 10 feet in length, and Several joints of the back bone of a Whale, which must have foundered on this part of the Coast. after Dineing on the remains of our Small Deer I proceeded through over a land S E with Some Ponds to the bay distance about 2 miles, thence up to the mouth of Chinnook river 2 miles, crossed this little river in the Canoe we left at its mouth and Encamped on the upper Side in an open sandy bottom. The hills next to the bay [on] Cape disapointment to a Short distance up the Chinnook river is not verry high thickly Coverd. with different Species of pine &amp;c. maney of which are large, I observed in maney places pine of 3 or 4 feet through growing on the bodies of large trees which had fallen down, and covered with moss and yet part Sound. The Deer1 1 This Coues calls "the original description of the Columbian black-tailed deer (Cariacus columbianus)," a distinct species from that found on the Missouri.—ED. of this Coast differ materially from our Common deer in as muech as they are much darker, deeper bodied, Shorter ledged [legged] horns equally branched from the beem the top of the tail black from the rute [root] to the end.

Some rain last night dispatchd. 3 men to hunt Jo Fields &amp; Colter to hunt Elk &amp; Labich to kill some Brant for our brackfast The Morning cleared up fare and we proceeded on by the same route we went out, at the River we found no Indians, made a raft &amp; Ruben Fields crossed and took over a small canoe which lay at the Indian cabin. This Creek is at this time of high tide 300 yards wide &amp; the marshes for some distance up the creek covered with water. not an Indian to be seen near the creek, I proceeded on to camp &amp; on my way was over taken by 3 Indians one gave us sturgeon &amp; Wapto roots to eate I met several parties on [the] way all of them appeared to know me &amp; was distant, found all well at camp, maney Indians about one of which had on a robe made of 2 sea orters skins. Capt Lewis offered him many things for his skins with others a blanket a coat all of which he refused we at length purchased it for a belt of Blue Beeds which the Squar had. The tide being out we walked home on the beech. Wednesday November the 20th. 1805 Some rain last night dispatched Labeech to kill some fowl for our brackfast he returned in about 2 hours with 8 large Ducks on which we brackfast I proceeded on to the enterance of a Creek near a Cabin. No person being at this Cabin and 2 Canoes laying on the opposit Shore from us, I deturmined to have a raft made and Send a man over for a canoe, a Small raft was Soon made, and Reuben Fields crossed and brought over a Canoe. This Creek which is the outlet of a number of ponds, is at this time (high tide) 300 yds. wide. I proceeded on up the Beech and was overtaken by three Indians one of them gave me Some dried Sturgeon and a fiew Wappato roots, I employ[e]d those Indians to take up one of our Canoes which had been left by the first party that Came down, for which Service I gave them each a fishing hook of a large Size. on my way up I met Several parties of Chinnooks which I had not before Seen, they were on their return from our Camp. all those people appeared to know my deturmonation of keeping every individual of their nation at a proper distance, as they were guarded and resurved in my presence &amp;c. found maney of the Chin nooks with Capt. Lewis of whome there was 2 Cheifs Com com mo ly1 1 A daughter of this chief became the wife (1813) of Duncan M'Dougal, one of the associates of John Jacob Astor. See Irving's Astoria (Phila., 1841), ii, pp. 219–221.—Ed. &amp; Chil-lar-la-wil to whome we gave Medals and to one a flag. one of the Indians had on a roab made of 2 Sea Otter Skins the fur of them were more butifull than any fur I had ever Seen both Capt. Lewis &amp; my self endeavored to purchase the roab with differant articles2 2 Several of the men have robes made of brant-skins; one of them had a hat made of the bark of white cedar and bear-grass, very handsomely wrought and waterproof. One of our party purchased it for an old razor.—Gass (p. 242). at length we precured it for a belt of blue beeds which the Squar-wife of our interpreter Shabono wore around her waste. in my absence the hunters had killed Several Deer and fowl of different kinds.

The nation liveing to the North is called Chieltz. The chief is name[d] Mâ-laugh not large nation and wore his beards as informed by the Inds. In my absence the hunters killed 7 Deer, 4 brants &amp; a crane. Great numbers of the dark brant passing Southerley, the white yet stationary, no Gees &amp; swan to be seen. The wind blew hard from the S. E. which with the addition of the flood tide raised emence swells &amp; waves which almost entered our Encampment. morng. dark &amp; Disagreeable, a supriseing climat. We have not had one cold day since we passed below the last falls or great Shute &amp; some time before the climent is temperate, and the only change we have experienced is from fair weather to rainey windey weather, I made a chief &amp; gave a medel this man is name[d] Tow-wâle and appears to have some influence with the nation and tells me he lives at the great shute. we gave the squar a coate of Blue Cloth for the belt of Blue Beeds we gave for the Sea otter skins purchased of an Indian. at 12 oClock it began to rain, and continued moderately all day, some wind from the S.E. waves too high for us to proceed on our homeward bound journey. (Lattitude of this place is 46° – 19′ – 11″ 1/10 North) Several Indians and square came this evening I beleave for the purpose of gratifying the passions of our men, Those people appear to view sensuality as a necessary evill, and do not appear to abhore this as crime in the unmarried females. The young women sport openly with our men, and appear to receve the approbation of theer friends &amp; relations for so doing maney of the women are handsom. They are all low both men and womin, I saw the name of J. Bowmon marked or picked on a young squars left arm. The women of this nation Pick their legs in different figures as an orniment the[y] ware their hair loose, some trinkets in their ears, none in the nose as those above, their Dress is as follows, i. e. the men were a roabe of either the skins of [blank space in MS.] a small fured animal, &amp; which is most common, or the Skins of the Sea orter, Loon, Swan, Beaver, Deer, Elk, or blankets either red, blu, or white, which roabes cover the sholders arms &amp; body, all other parts are nakd. The women were a short peticoat of the iner bark of the white Ceder or arber vita, which hang down loose in strings nearly as low as the knee, with a short Robe which falls half way down the Thigh. no other part is covered The orniments are beeds, Blue principally, large Brass wire around their rists some rings, and maney men have salors clothes, maney have good fusees &amp; Ball &amp; Powder. The women ware a string of something curious tied tight above the anckle, all have large swelled legs &amp; thighs The men [have] small legs &amp; thighs and generally badly made. They live on Elk, Deer, fowls, but principally fish and roots of 3 kinds. Lickorish, Wapto &amp;c. The women have more privalages than is common among Indians. Pocks &amp; venereal is common amongst them. I saw one man &amp; one woman who appeared to be all in scabs &amp; several men with the venereal their other Disorders and the remides for them I could not lern we divided some ribin between the men of our party to bestow on their favourite Lasses, this plan to save the knives &amp; more valueable articles. Those people gave me Sturgion Salmon &amp; wapto roots, &amp; we bought roots, some mats &amp;c. &amp;c. for which we were obliged to give emence prices. we also purchased a kind of Cramberry which the Indians say the[y] geather in the low lands, off of small either vines or bushes just above the ground. we also purchased hats made of Grass &amp;c. of those Indians, some very handsom mats made of flags some fiew curious baskets made of a strong weed &amp; willow or [blank space in MS.] splits, also a sweet soft black root, about the sise &amp; shape of a carrot, this root they value verry highly. The Wapto root is scerce, and highly valued by those people, this root they roste in hot ashes like a potato and the outer skin peals off, tho this is a trouble they seldom perform. Thursday November 21st. 1805. A cloudy morning most of the Chinnooks leave our camp and return home, great numbers of the dark brant passing to the South, the white Brant have not yet commenced their flight. the Wind blew hard from the S. E. which with the addition of the flood tide raised verry high waves which broke with great violence against the shore throwing water into our camp the forepart of this day Cloudy at 12 oClock it began to rain and continud all day moderately, Several Indians Visit us to day of differant nations or Bands Some of the Chiltz Nation who reside on the Sea Coast near Point Lewis, Several of the Clatsops1 1 The Chehalis (Tsihalis), here called Chiltz, are a Salishan tribe; the name has often been used collectively to include several tribes of that family. The Clatsops belong to the Chinookan stock.—Ed. who reside on the Opposit Side of the Columbia imediately opposit to us, and a Cheif from the Grand rapid to whome we gave a Medal. An old woman &amp; Wife to a Cheif of the Chunnooks came and made a Camp near ours. She brought with her 6 young Squars (her daughters &amp; nieces) I believe for the purpose of Gratifying the passions of the men of our party and receving for those indulgiences Such Small [presents] as She (the old woman) thought proper to accept of. Those people appear to View Sensuality as a Necessary evel, and do not appear to abhor it as a Crime in the unmarried State. The young females are fond of the attention of our men and appear to meet the sincere approbation of their friends and connections, for thus obtaining their favours, the Womin of the Chinnook Nation have handsom faces low and badly made with large legs &amp; thighs which are generally Swelled from a Stopage of the circulation in the feet (which are Small) by maney Strands of Beeds or curious Strings which are drawn tight around the leg above the ankle, their legs are also picked [i.e., tattooed] with defferent figures, I saw on the left arm of a Squar the following letters J. Bowman, all those are considered by the natives of this quarter as handsom deckerations, and a woman without those deckorations is Considered as among the lower Class they ware their hair lose hanging over their back and Sholders maney have blue beeds threaded &amp; hung from different parts of their ears and about ther neck and around their wrists, their dress otherwise is prosisely like that of the Nation of War ci a cum as already discribed. a Short roab, and tissue or kind of peticoat of the bark of Cedar which fall down in strings as low as the knee behind and not so low before. Maney of the men have blankets of red blue or Spotted Cloth or the common three &amp; 2 ? point blankets, and Salors old Clothes which they appear to prise highly, they also have robes of SeaOtter, Beaver, Elk, Deer, fox and cat common to this Countrey, which I have never Seen in the U States. they also precure a roabe from the nativs above, which is made of the Skins of a Small animal about the Size of a cat, which is light and dureable and highly prized by those people. the greater numbers of the men of the Chinnooks have Guns and powder and Ball. The Men are low homely and badly made, Small crooked legs large feet, and all of both Sects have flattened heads. The food of this nation is principally fish &amp; roots the fish they precure from the river by the means of nets and gigs, and the Salmon which run up the Small branches together with what they collect drifted up on the Shores of the Sea coast near to where they live. The roots which they use are Several different kinds, the Wap pa to which they precure from the nativs above, a black root which they call Shaw-na-tâh-que1 1 This should be shanatawhee. It is the root of the edible thistle [Cnicus edulis]; the first year's growth of the thistle, that has one straight root something like a parsnip, it is tender, sweet, and palatable.—S. B. Smith (Wonderland, 1900, p. 61). &amp; the Wild licquorish is the most Common, they also kill a fiew Elk Deer &amp; fowl. maney of the Chinnooks appear to have Venerious and pustelus disorders. one woman whome I saw at the Creek appeared all over in Scabs and ulsers &amp;c. We gave to the men each a pece of ribin. We purchased cramberies Mats verry netely made of flags and rushes, Some roots, Salmon and I purchased a hat made of Splits &amp; Strong grass, which is made in the fashion which was common in the U States two years ago also small baskets to hold Water made of Split and Straw, for those articles we gave high prices.</field>

The advantage of the arival of a vestle from whome we can precure goods will be more than an over ballance, for the bad liveing we shall have in liveing on Pore deer &amp; Elk we may get in this neighbourhood.1 1 Coues thinks (L. and C., ii, pp. 720, 721) that Jefferson might have been expected, in ordinary circumstances, to send a ship to the Columbia River, to meet the expedition; but that he preferred not to risk giving possible offence to Spain by such action.—Ed.

East. being now determined to go into Winter quarters as soon as possible, as a convenient Situation to precure the Wild animals of the forest which must be our dependance for Subsisting this Winter, we have every reason to believe that the Nativs have not provisions Suffi[ci]ent for our consumption, and if they had, their prices are So high that it would take ten times as much to purchase their roots &amp; Dried fish as we have in our possesion, encluding our Small remains of Merchindize and Clothes &amp;c. This certinly enduces every individual of the party to make diligient enquiries of the nativs [for] the part of the Countrey in which the Wild animals are most plenty. They generaly agree that the Most Elk is on the Opposit Shore, and that the greatest Numbers of Deer is up the river at Some distance above. The Elk being an animal much larger than Deer, easier to Kill, &amp; better meat (in the Winter when pore) and Skins better for the Clothes of our party: added to [this] a convenient Situation to the Sea coast where We Could make-Salt, and a probibility of Vessels comeing into the Mouth of Columbia ("which the Indians inform us would return to trade with them in 3 months") from whome we might precure a fresh Supply of Indian trinkets to purchase provisions on our return home: together with the Solicitations of every individual, except one of our party induced us [to] Conclude to Cross the river and examine the opposit Side, and if a Sufficent quantity of Elk could probebly be precured to fix on a Situation as convenient to the Elk &amp; Sea Coast as we could find. added to the above advantagies in being near the Sea Coast one most Strikeing one occurs to me i. e, the Climate which must be from every appearance much milder than that above the 1st. range of Mountains, The Indians are Slightly Clothed and give an account of but little Snow, and the weather which we have experienced since we arrived in the neighbourhood of the Sea coast has been verry warm, and maney of the fiew days past disagreeably so. if this Should be the case it will most Certainly be the best Situation of our Naked party dressed as they are altogether in leather.

On the explorers' return (see March 24, 1806) they mention a Cathlamet village just below this point. Confusion has arisen because the present town of Cathlamet is on the north side of the river. Thomas U. Strong of Portland, Oregon, writes that "Some time after the expedition of Lewis and Clark the Cathlamet Tribe of Indians, very much reduced by some pestilence that prevailed, moved over to the north bank of the Columbia River and settled somewhere near the present town of Cathlamet where somt kinsfolk of theirs, the Wahkiakums, had already a village."

Soon after we encamped 3 Indians of the last town Came in a Canoe with Wap. pa to roots to sell to us, Some of which we purchased with fish hooks. from the Village quite around this bend to the West the land is high and thickly timbered with pine balsom &amp;c. a Short distance below the Calt har mer Village on the island which is Opposit I observed Several Canoes Scaffold[ed] in which [were] contained their dead, as I did not examine this mode of depos[it]ing the dead, must refer it to a discription hereafter.

[Clark, first draft:] November 29th.. Friday 1805. Blew hard and rained the greater part of the last night and this morning, Capt Lewis and 5 men set out in our small Indian canoe (which is made in the Indian fashion calculated to ride the waves) down the South Side of the river to the place the Indians informed us by signs that numbers of Elk were to be found near the river. The swells and waves being too high for us to proceed down in our large canoes in safety. I sent out two hunters to hunt deer, &amp; one to hunt fowl, all the others employed in drying their leather and prepareing it for use, as but fiew of them have many other clothes to boste of at this time, we are smoked verry much in this camp The shore on the side next the sea is covered with butifull pebble of various colours our diat at this time and for several days past is the dried pounded fish we purchased at the falls boiled in a little salt water.

Fields givs me an account of a great deel of Elk Sign &amp; says he Saw 2 Gangs of those animals in his rout, but it rained So hard that he could not Shoot them. The party up the Creek returned without any thing and informs me they could not See any fish in the Creek to kill and the fowls were too wild to be killed, this must be owing to their being much hunted and pursued by the Indians in their Canoes.

Some rain from 10 to 12 last night, this morning fair, have every thing put on board the Canoes and Set out to the place Capt. Lewis had viewed and thought well Situated for winter quarters. we proceeded on against the tide to a point about [blank space in MS.] miles here we met Sergt. Pryor and his party returning to the Camp we had left without any meat, the waves verry verry high, as much as our Canoes could bear rendered it impossible to land for the party, we proceeded on around the point into the bay and landed to take brackfast on 2 Deer which had been killed &amp; hung up, one of which we found the other had been taken off by [s]ome wild animal probably Panthors or the Wild [cat?] of this Countrey here all the party of Sergt. Pryors joined us except my man York, who had stoped to rite his load and missed his way, Sergt. Pryor informed us that he had found the Elk, which was much further from the bay than he expected, that they missed the way for one day and a half, &amp; when he found the Elk they were mostly spoiled, and they only brought the Skins of 4 of the Elk. after brackfast I delayed about half an hour before York Came up, and then proceeded around this Bay which I call [have taken the liberty of calling] Meriwethers Bay the Cristian name of Capt. Lewis who no doubt was the 1st white man who ever Surveyed this Bay, we assended a river which falls in on the South Side of this Bay 3 miles to the first point of high land on the West Side, the place Capt. Lewis had viewed and formed in a thick groth of pine about 200 yards from the river, this situation is on a rise about 30 feet higher than the high tides leavel and thickly Covered with lofty pine, this is certainly the most eligable Situation for our purposes of any in its neighbourhood.

We haveing fixed on this Situation as the one best Calculated for our Winter quarters I deturmin'd to go as direct a Course as I could to the Sea Coast which we could here roar and appeared to be at no great distance from us, my principal object is to look out a place to make Salt, blaze the road or rout that they men out hunting might find the direction to the fort if they Should get lost in cloudy weather—and See the probibility of game in that direction, for the Support of the Men, we Shall Send to make Salt, I took with me five men and Set out on a Course S 60 W proceeded on a dividing ridge through lofty piney land much falling timber. passed the heads of 2 brooks one of them had wide bottoms which was over flown &amp; we waded to our knees crossed 2 Slashes2 2 The Century Dictionary defines "slashes" (adj. slashey) as a wet or swampy place overgrown with bushes.

Those bogs are covered with a kind of Moss among' which I observe an ebundance of Cramberries. in those Slashes Small Knobs are promisquisly scattered about which are Steep and thickly Covered with pine Common to the Countrey &amp; Lorel. we made a camp of the Elk skin to keep off the rain which continued to fall, the Small Knob on which we camped did not afford a Sufficiency of dry wood for our fire, we collected what dry wood we could and what Sticks we could Cut down with the Tomahawks, which made us a tolerable fire.

I can plainly discover that a considerable exchange of property is continually carried on between the Tribes and villages of those people they all dress litely ware nothing below the waste, a pice of fur abt. around the body, and a short robe which composes the total of their dress, except a few split hats, and beeds around ther necks wrists and anckles, and a few in their ears.

Indeed I scercely get to sleep half the night clear of the torments of those flees, with the precaution of haveing my blankets serched and the flees killed every day. The 1st. of those insects we saw on the Collumbia River was at the 1st Great falls. I have the satisfaction to say that we had but little rain in the course of this day, not as much as would wet a person. but hard wind and cloudy all day. Sunday 29th. December 1805 rained all the last night a[s] usial, this morning cloudy without rain, a hard wind from the S.E I gave the Cheif a razor, and himself and party left us after begging us for maney articles none of which they recevied as we Could not Spare the articles they were most in want of. Peter Crusat Sick with a violent Cold, my Man Y. better; all hands employed about the Pickets &amp; gates of the fort. we were informed day before yesterday that a whale had foundered on the coast to the S.W. near the Kil a mox N. and that the greater part of the Clatsops were gorn for the oile &amp; blubber, the wind proves too high for us to proceed by water to See this Monster, Capt. Lewis has been in readiness Since we first heard of the whale to go and see it and collect Some of its Oil, the wind has proved too high as yet for him to proceed. this evining a young Chief 4 Men and 2 womin of the Warciacum nation arrived, and offered for Sale Dressed Elk Skins and Wappato, the Chief made us a preasent of about ? a bushel of those roots. and we purchased about 1 ? bushels of those roots for which we gave Some fiew red beeds Small peaces of brass wire &amp; old Check those roots proved a greatfull addition to our Spoiled Elk, which has become verry disagreeable both to the taste &amp; smell we gave this Chief a Medal of a Small size and a piece of red riben to tie around the top of his hat which was of a Singular Construction (in Peales Museum) Those people will not sell all their Wappato to us they inform us that they are on their way to trade with the Clâtsops. The Nations above carry on a verry considerable interchange of property with those in this neighbourhood. they pass altogether by water, they have no roads or pathes through the Countrey which we have observed, except across portages from one creek to another, all go litely dressed ware nothing below the waste in the Coaldest of weather, a piece of fur around their bodies and a Short roabe composes the sum total of their dress, except a few hats, and beeds about their necks arms and legs Small badly made and homely generally. The flees are So noumerous and hard to get rid of; that the Indians have different houses which they resort to occasionally, not withstanding all their precautions, they never Step into our house without leaveing Sworms of those tormenting insects; and they torment us in such a manner as to deprive us of half the nights Sleep frequently. the first of those insects which we saw on the Columbian waters was at the Canoe portage at the great falls. Hard winds &amp; cloudy all day but verry little rain to day. [Clark, first draft:] December 30th. Monday 1805. Hard wind and some rain last night, this morning fair and the sun shown for a short time 4 Indians came from the upper Villages they offered us roots which we did not chuse to axcept of, as their expectations for those presents of a fiew roots is 3 or 4 times their real worth, those Indians with those of yesterday continued all day. Drewyer &amp; party of hunters returned and informed they had killed 4 Elk, a party of 6 men was imediately sent for the meet, they returned at Dusk, with the 4 Elk, of which we had a sumptious supper of Elk Tongues &amp; marrow bones which was truly gratifying. The fort was completed this evening and at sun set we let The Indians know that, our custom will be to shut the gates at sun set, at which time they must all go out of the fort.1 1 The sketch-plan here given of the fort on the Pacific Coast, wherein the Lewis and Clark expedition spent the winter of 1805–06 was traced by Clark upon the rough elk-skin cover of his field-book. In the original it is much faded, and the lines have been pulled out of shape by a fold in the skin; no doubt, when drawn, the walls of the fort were straight. Apparently the stockade was 50 feet square, with a long cabin of three rooms ranged along the upper wall, each with what seems to be a central fire-place; and along the lower wall four cabins, two of them with fireplaces and one with an outside chimney; the gates are to the left and the parade ground is 20 × 48 feet. In tnis connection, see also the plan in the map given on p. 268, ante. From that it would appear that the gates opened" to the south.—Ed. those people who are verry foward and disegreeable, left the huts with reluctiance. This day proved the best we have had since at this place, only 3 Showers of rain to day, cloudy nearly all day, in the evening the wind luled and the fore part of the night fair and clear. I saw flies &amp; different kinds of insects in motion to day Snakes are yet to be seen, and Snales without cover is common and large, fowls of every kind common to this quarter abound in the Creek &amp; Bay near us Monday 30th. December 1805 Hard wind and Some rain last night. this morning the Sun Shown for a Short time. four Indians came down from the Warciacum village, they offered us roots which we did not think proper to accept of as in return they expect 3 or 4 times as much as the roots as we could purchase the Roots for, and are never satisfied with what they receive, those 4 Indians &amp; these that came yesterday Stayed all day. Drewyer returned and informed that he had killed 4 Elk at no great distance off, a party of 6 men was imediately dispatched for the meat, and returned at Dusk with the 4 Elk. we had a Sumptious Supper of Elks tongues &amp; marrow bones which was truly gratifying. our fortification is completed this evening and at Sun set we let the nativs know that our Custom will be in future, to Shut the gates at Sun Set at which time all Indians must go out of the fort and not return into it untill next morning after Sunrise at which time the gates will be opened, those of the Warciacum Nation who are very fo[r]ward left the houses with reluctianc[e] this day proved to be the fairest and best which we have had since our arrival at this place, only three Showers dureing this whole day, wind the fore part of the day. [Clark, first draft:] December 31st.. Tuesday 1805. A Cloudy night &amp; some rain, this day proved cloudy and some showers of rain to day all the Indians continued at their camp near us, 2 others canoes came one from the War-ci-a-cum Village, with three Indians, and the other from higher up the river of the Skil-lute nation with three men and a Squar; Those people brought with them some Wap to roots, mats made of flags, &amp; rushes, dried fish and some fiew She-ne-tock-we (or black) roots &amp; Dressed Elk skins, all of which they asked enormous prices for, particularly the Dressed Elk Skins; I purchased of those people some Wapto roots, two mats and a small pouch of Tobacco of their own manufactory, for which I gave large fish hooks, [of] which they were verry fond, those Indians are much more reserved and better behaved to day than yesterday the sight of our Sentinal who walks on his post, has made this reform in those people who but yesterday was verry impertenant and disagreeable to all. This evening they all cleared out before the time to shut the gates, without being derected to doe So. I derected sinks to be dug and a Sentinal Box which was accomplished One of those Indeans brought a Musquet to be repared, which only wanted a Screw flattened, for which he gave me a Peck of Wapto roots, I gave him a flint and a pice of Sheep Skin of which he was pleased. January 1st. Wednesday 1806 in another book1 1 Here end the entries in the Clark-Voorhis field-book. On the last fly-leaf is written: "Presented to J. J. Audubon at St. Louis, April 19th. 1843, by D. D. Mitchell, Supt. Indian Affairs." It is not known how this field-book was returned to the custody of the Clark heirs. See Introduction for description of this MS.—Ed. Tuesday 31st. December 1805 last night was cloudy and Some rain, this day prove Cloudy and Showerry all day, all the Indians continue at their camp near us, two other canoes arrived, one from the Warciâcum Village with 3 indians and the other [of 3 men &amp; a squar] from higher up the river and are of the Skil-lute Nation, those people brought with them Some Wappato roots, mats made of flags and rushes dried fish, and fiew Shaw-na-tâh-que and Dressed Elk Skins, all of which they asked enormous prices for, perticularly the dressed Elk Skins, I purchased of those people Some Wappato two mats and about 3 pipes of their tobacco in a neet little bag made of rushes. This tobacco was much like what we had Seen before with the Sosone or Snake indians, for those articles I gave a large fishing hook and Several other Small articles, the fishinghooks they were verry fond of. Those Skillutes are much better behaved than the Warciacum indeed we found a great alteration in the conduct of them all this morning, the Sight of our Sentinal on his post at the gate, together with our deturmined proseedure of putting all out at Sun set has made this reform in those Warciacoms who is fo[r]ward impertinant an [d] thieveish. The nativs all leave the fort this evening before Sun set without being told or desired to do So. we had Sinks dug &amp; a Sentinal box made. a Skillute brought a gun which he requested me to have repared, it only wanted a Screw flattened so as to catch, I put a flint into his gun &amp; he presented me in return a peck of Wappato for payment, I gave him piece of a Sheap Skin and a Small piece of blue Cloth to cover his lock for which he was much pleased and gave me in return Some roots &amp;c. I saw flies and different kinds of insects in motion to day. Snakes are yet to be Seen and Snales without covers is common and verry large water fowls of various kinds are in great numbers in the rivers and Creeks and the sides of Meriwethers Bay near us but excessively wild. the fore part of this night fair and clear With the party of Clâtsops who visited us last was a man of much lighter Coloured than the nativs are generaly, he was freckled with long duskey red hair, about 25 years of age, and must Certainly be half white at least, this man appeared to understand more of the English language than the others of his party, but did not Speak a word of English, he possessed all the habits of the indians1 1 Ross Cox, in his Adventures on the Columbia (New York, 1832) describes this man as a lusus nature. "His skin was fair, his face partially freckled, and his hair quite red. He was about five feet ten inches high, was slender, but remarkably well made; his head had not undergone the flattening process. His father was a sailor who had deserted from an English ship, his name, Jack Ramsay, was tattooed on the son's arm. Poor Jack was fond of his father's countrymen, and had the decency to wear trousers whenever he came to the fort (Astoria). We therefore made a collection of old clothes for his use; sufficient to last him many years."—Ed. [Lewis:] Fort Clatsop. 1806. January 1st. Tuesday. [Wednesday]2 2 Here begins Codex J, written by Lewis; it contains the journal of the expedition from Jan. 1 to March 20, 1806.—Ed. This morning I was awoke at an early hour by the discharge of a volley of small arms, which were fired by our party in front of our quarters to usher in the new year; this was the only mark of rispect which we had it in our power to pay this celebrated day. our repast of this day tho' better than that of Christmass, consisted principally in the anticipation of the 1st. day of January 1807, when in the bosom of our friends we hope to participate in the mirth and hilarity of the day, and when with the zest given by the recollection of the present, we shall completely, both mentally and corporally, enjoy the repast which the hand of civilization has prepared for us. at present we were content with eating our boiled Elk and wappetoe, and solacing our thirst with our only beverage pure water. two of our hunters who set out this morning reterned in the evening having killed two bucks elk; they presented Capt. Clark and myself each a marrow-bone and tonge, on which we suped. visited today by a few of the Clatsops who brought some roots and burries for the purpose of trading with us. we were uneasy with rispect to two of our men, Willard and Wiser, who were dispatched on the 28th. ult0. with the salt-makers, and were directed to return immediately; their not having returned induces us to believe it probable that they have missed their way. our fourtification being now completed we issued an order for the more exact and uniform discipline and government of the garrison. [Orderly Book; Lewis:] Fort Clatsop, January 1st. 1806 The fort being now completed, the Commanding officers think proper to direct: that the guard shall as usual consist of one Sergeant and three privates, and that the same be regularly relieved each morning at sunrise. The post of the new guard shall be in the room of the Sergeants rispectivly commanding the same. the centinel shall be posted, both day and night, on the parade in front of the commanding offercers quarters; tho' should he at any time think proper to remove himself to any other part of the fort, in order the better to inform himself of the desighns or approach of any party of savages, he is not only at liberty, but is hereby required to do so. It shall be the duty of the centinel also to announce the arrival of all parties of Indians to the Sergeant of the Guard, who shall immediately report the same to the Commanding officers. The Commanding Officers require and charge the Garrison to treat the natives in a friendly manner; nor will they be permitted at any time, to abuse, assault or strike them; unless such abuse assault or stroke be first given by the natives. nevertheless it shall be right for any individual, in a peaceable manner, to refuse admittance to, or put out of his room, any native who may become troublesome to him; and should such native refuse to go when requested, or attempt to enter their rooms after being forbidden to do so; it shall be the duty of the Sergeant of the guard on information of the same, to put such native out of the fort and see that he is not again admitted during that day unless specially permitted; and the Sergeant of the guard may for this purpose imploy such coercive measures (not extending to the taking of life) as shall at his discretion be deemed necessary to effect the same. When any native shall be detected in theft, the Sergt. of the guard shall immediately inform the Commanding offercers of the same, to the end that such measures may be pursued with rispect to the culprit as they shall think most expedient. At sunset on each day, the Sergt. attended by the interpreter Charbono and two of his guard, will collect and put out of the fort, all Indians except such as may specially be permitted to remain by the Commanding offercers, nor shall they be again admitted untill the main gate be opened the ensuing morning. At Sunset, or immediately after the Indians have been dismissed, both gates shall be shut, and secured, and the main gate locked and continue so untill sunrise the next morning: the water-gate may be used freely by the Garrison for the purpose of passing and repassing at all times, tho' from sunset, untill sunrise, it shall be the duty of the centinel, to open the gate for, and shut it after all persons passing and repassing, suffering the same never to remain unfixed long[er] than is absolutely necessary. It shall be the duty of the Sergt. of the guard to keep the kee of the Meat house, and to cause the guard to keep regular fires therein when the same may be necessary; and also once at least in 24 hours to visit the canoes and see that they are safely secured; and shall further on each morning after he is relieved, make his report verbally to the Command[in]g officers. Each of the old guard will every morning after being relieved furnish two loads of wood for the commanding offercers fire. No man is to be particularly exempt from the duty of bringing meat from the woods, nor none except the Cooks and Interpreters from that of mounting guard. Each mess being furnished with an ax, they are directed to deposit in the room of the commanding offercers all other public tools of which they are possessed; nor shall the same at any time hereafter be taken from the said deposit without the knoledge and permission of the commanding officers; and any individual so borrowing the tools are strictly required to bring the same back the moment he has ceased to use them, and [in] no case shall they be permited to keep them out all night. Any individual selling or disposing of any tool or iron or steel instrument, arms, accoutrements or ammunicion, shall be deemed guilty of a breach of this order, and shall be tryed and punished accordingly. the tools loaned to John Shields are excepted from the restrictions of this order.

Sent Sergt. Gass and George shannon to the saltmakers who are somewhere on the coast to the S.W. of us,1 1 The site of the salt-makers' cairns was located June 9, 1900, by a committee of the Oregon Historical Society (see Proceedings, 1900, pp. 16–23), who had the testimony of a pioneer and an Indian, that had known contemporaries of the explorers. It was upon what is known as Clatsop Beach, near the mouth of Necanicum River, a little north of a summer resort called Seaside.—Ed. to enquire after Willard and Wiser who have not yet returned. Reubin Fields Collins and Pots the hunters who set out on the 26th [28th] Ulto. returned this evening after dark. they reported that they had been about 15 Miles up the river at the head of the bay just below us and had hunted the country from thence down on the East side of the river, even to a considerable distance from it and had proved unsuccessfull having killed one deer and a few fowls, barely as much as subsisted them. this reminded us of the necessity of taking time by the forelock, and keep out several parties while we have yet a little meat beforehand. I gave the Chief Comowooll a pare of sattin breechies with which he appeared much pleased. [Clark, first draft:] January 3rd. Friday 1806 The Sun rose fair this morning for the first time for Six weeks past, the Clouds soon obscure it from our view, and a Shower of rain Suckceeded. last night we had Sharp lightening a hard thunder Suckceeded with heavy Showers of hail, and rain, which Continud with intervales of fair Moon Shine dureing the night. Sent out Sergt. Gass &amp; 2 men to the Salt makers with a v[i]ew to know what is the cause of the delay of 2 of our party Willard &amp; Wiser who we are uneasy about, as they were to have been back 6 days ago. Friday the 3rd. January 1806 At 11 A. M. we were visited by our near neighbour Chief or tiá Co mo wool alias Conia (Côné) and six Clatsops. they brought for Sale Some roots berries and 3 Dogs also a Small quantity of fresh blubber. this blubber they informed us they had obtained from their neighbours the Cal lá mox who inhabit the coast to the S.E. near one of their Villages a Whale had recently perished. this blubber the Indians eat and esteem it excellent food. our party from necescity have been obliged to Subsist some length of time on dogs have now become extreamly fond of their flesh; it is worthey of remark that while we lived principally on the flesh of this animal we wer much more helthy strong and more fleshey then we have been Sence we left the Buffalow Country. as for my own part I have not become reconsiled to the taste of this animal as yet. a Small crow, the blue crested Corvus and the smaller corvus with a white breast, the little brown ren, and a large brown Sparrow, the bald Eagle, and the butifull Buzzard of the Columbia Still continue with us, Send Sarjt. Gass and G. Shannon to the Salt makers who are on the Sea Coast to the S.W. of us, to enquire after Willard &amp; Wiser who have not yet returned. R. Field, potts &amp; Collins the hunters who Set out on the 28th. ulto., returned this evening after dark. they reported that they had been about 15 miles up the river which falls into Merewethers Bay to the East of us, and had hunted the Country a considerable distance to East, and had proved unsucksesfull haveing killed one Deer and a fiew fowls, bearly as much as Subsisted them. this reminded us of the necessity of takeing time by the forelock, and keep out Several parties while we have yet a little meat beforehand. Capt. Lewis gave the Cheif Cania a par of Sattin breechies with which he appeared much pleased. [Lewis:] Saturday January 4th 1806. Comowooll and the Clatsops who visited us yesterday left us in the evening. These people the Chinnooks and others residing in this neighbourhood and speaking the same language have been very friendly to us; they appear to be a mild inoffensive people but will pilfer if they have an opportunity to do so where they conceive themselves not liable to detection. they are great higlers in trade and if they conceive you anxious to purchase will be a whole day bargaining for a handfull of roots; this I should have thought proceeded from their want of knowledge of the comparitive value of articles of merchandize and the fear of being cheated, did I not find that they invariably refuse the price first offered them and afterwards very frequently accept a smaller quantity of the same article; in order to satisfy myself on this subject I once offered a Chinnook my watch two knives and a considerable quantity of beads for a small inferior sea Otter's skin which I did not much want, he immediately conceived it of great value, and refused to barter except I would double the quantity of beads; the next day with a great deal of importunity on his part I received the skin in exchange for a few strans of the same beads he had refused the day before. I therefore believe this trait in their character proceeds from an avaricious all grasping disposition. in this rispect they differ from all Indians I ever became acquainted with, for their dispositions invariably lead them to give whatever they are possessed off no matter how usefull or valuable, for a bauble which pleases their fancy, without consulting it's usefullness or value. nothing interesting occurred today, or more so, than our wappetoe being all exhausted. [Clark:] Saturday 4th January 1806 Comowool and the Clatsops who visited us yesterday left us in the morning. Those people the Chinnooks and others resideing in this neighbourhood and Speaking the Same language have been verry friendly to us; they appear to be a Mild inoffensive people, but will pilfer if they have an oppertunity to do so when they conceive themselves not liable to detection. they are great higlers in trade and if they conceive you anxious to purchase will be a whole day bargaining for a hand full of roots; this I should have thought proceeded from their want of Knowledge of the comparitive value of articles of Merchindize and the fear of being Cheated, did I not find that they invariably refuse the price first offered them and afterwards very frequently accept a smaller quantity of the Same article; in order to satisfy myself on this point, I onc[e] offered a Clatsop man my watch a knife, a Dollar of the coin of U States and a hand full of beeds, for a Small Sea otter Skin, which I did not much want, he imediately Conceived it of great value, and refused to Sell unless I would give as maney more blue beeds; the next day with a great deel of importunity on his part we received the Skin in exchange for a fiew Strans of the Same beeds he had refused the day before. I therefore beleive this treat [trait] in their Charector proceeds from an avericious all grasping disposition. in this respect they differ from all Indians I ever became acquainted with, for their dispositions invariably lead them to give whatever they are possessed off no matter how usefull or valueable, for a bauble which pleases their fancy, without consulting its usefullness or value. nothing occured to day, or more So, than our Wappato being all exhausted. [Lewis:] Sunday January 5th. 1806. At 5.P.M. Willard and Wiser returned, they had not been lost as we apprehended. they informed us that it was not untill the fifth day after leaving the Fort that they could find a convenient place for making salt; that they had at length established themselves on the coast about 15 Miles S.W. from this, near the lodge of some Killamuck families; that the Indians were very friendly and had given them a considerable quantity of the blubber of a whale which perished on the coast some distance S.E. of them; part of this blubber they brought with them, it was white &amp; not unlike the fat of Poork, tho' the texture was more spongey and somewhat coarser. I had a part of it cooked and found it very pallitable and tender, it resembled the beaver or the dog in flavour. it may appear somewhat extraordinary tho' it is a fact that the flesh of the beaver and dog possess a very great affinity in point of flavour. These lads also informed us that J. Fields, Bratton and Gibson (the Salt Makers) had with their assistance erected a comfortable camp killed an Elk and several deer and secured a good stock of meat; they commenced the making of salt and found that they could obtain from 3 quarts to a gallon a day; they brought with them a specemine of the salt of about a gallon, we found it excellent, fine, strong, &amp; white; this was a great treat to myself and most of the party, having not had any since the 20th. Ultmo.; I say most of the party, for my friend Capt. Clark. declares it to be a mear matter of indifference with him whether he uses it or not; for myself I must confess I felt a considerable inconvenience from the want of it; the want of bread I consider as trivial provided, I get fat meat, for as to the species of meat I am not very particular, the flesh of the dog the horse and the wolf, having from habit become equally formiliar with any other, and I have learned to think that if the chord be sufficiently strong, which binds the soul and boddy together, it dose not so much matter about the materials which compose it. Colter also returned this evening unsuccessfull from the chase, having been absent since the 1st. Inst. Capt. Clark determined this evening to set out early tomorrow with two canoes and 12 men in quest of the whale, or at all events to purchase from the Indians a parcel of the blubber, for this purpose he prepared a small assortment of merchandize to take with him. [Clark:] Sunday 5th. of January 1806 At 5 P.M. Willard and Wiser returned, they had not been lost as we expected, they informd. us that it was not untill the 5th. day after leaveing the fort, that they could find a convenient place for makeing Salt; that they had at length established themselves on the Sea Coast about 15 miles S.W. from this, near the houses of Some Clat-sop &amp; Kilamox families; that the Indians were very friendly and had given them a considerable quantity of the blubber of the whale which perished on the coast Some distance S.E. of them, it was white and not unlike the fat of Pork, tho' the texture was more Spungey and Somewhat Coarser. we had part of it cooked and found it very pallitable and tender, it resembles the Beaver in flavour. those men also informed us that the Salt makers with their assistance had erected a comfortable camp, had killed an Elk and Several Deer and secured a good Stock of Meat; they commenced the makeing of Salt and found that they could make from 3 quarts to a gallon a day; they brought with them a specimen of the Salt, of about a gallon, we found it excellent white &amp; fine, but not so strong as the rock salt or that made in Kentucky or the Western parts of the U, States. this salt was a great treat to most of the party, haveing not had any Since the 20th. ulto. as to my self I care but little whether I have any with my meat or not; provided the meat [is] fat, haveing from habit become entirely cearless about my diat, and I have learned to think that if the cord be Sufficiently Strong which binds the Soul and boddy together, it does not so much matter about the materials which compose it. Colter returned this evening unsecksessfull from the chase, haveing been absent since the 1st. instt. I determine to Set out early tomorrow with two canoes &amp; 12 men in quest of the whale, or at all events to purchase from the indians a parcel of the blubber, for this purpose I made up a Small assortment of merchindize, and directed the men to hold themselves in readiness &amp;c. [Lewis:] Monday January 6th. 1806. Capt Clark set out after an early breakfast with the party in two canoes as had been concerted the last evening; Charbono and his Indian woman were also of the party; the Indian woman was very impo[r]tunate to be permited to go, and was therefore indulged; she observed that she had traveled a long way with us to see the great waters, and that now that monstrous fish was also to be seen, she thought it very hard she could not be permitted to see either (she had never yet been to the Ocean). The Clatsops, Chinnooks, Killamucks &amp;c. are very loquacious and inquisitive; they possess good memories and have repeated to us the names capasities of the vessels &amp;c of many traders and others who have visited the mouth of this river; they are generally low in stature, proportionably small, reather lighter complected and much more illy formed than the Indians of the Missouri and those of our frontier; they are generally cheerfull but never gay. with us their conversation generally turns upon the subjects of trade, smoking, eating or their women; about the latter they speak without reserve in their presents, of their every part, and of the most formiliar connection. they do not hold the virtue of their women in high estimation, and will even prostitute their wives and daughters for a fishinghook or a stran of beads. in common with other savage nations they make their women perform every species of domestic drudgery. but in almost every species of this drudgery the men also participate, their women are also compelled to geather roots, and assist them in taking fish, which articles form much the greatest part of their subsistance; notwithstanding the survile manner in which they treat their women they pay much more rispect to their judgment and oppinions in many rispects than most indian nations; their women are permitted to speak freely before them, and sometimes appear to command with a tone of authority; they generally consult them in their traffic and act in conformity to their opinions. I think it may be established as a general maxim that those nations treat their old people and women with most differrence [deference] and rispect where they subsist principally on such articles that these can participate with the men in obtaining them; and that, that part of the community are treated with least attention, when the act of procuring subsistence devolves entirely on the men in the vigor of life. It appears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial tie than in any other of the strong affections of the human heart, and therefore think, our old men equally with our women indebted to civilization for their ease and comfort. Among the Siouxs, Assinniboins and others on the Missouri who subsist by hunting it is a custom when a person of either sex becomes so old and infurm that they are unable to travel on foot from camp to camp as they rome in surch of subsistance, for the children or near relations of such person to leave them without compunction or remo[r]se; on those occasions they usually place within their reach a small peace of meat and a platter of water, telling the poor old superannuated wretch for his consolation, that he or she had lived long enough, that it was time they should dye and go to their relations who can afford to take care of them much better than they could. I am informed that this custom prevails even among the Minetares Arwaharmays and Recares when attended by their old people on their hunting excurtions; but in justice to these people I must observe that it appeared to me at their vilages, that they provided tolerably well for their aged persons, and several of their feasts appear to have principally for their object a contribution for their aged and infirm persons. This day I overhalled our merchandize and dryed it by the fire, found it all damp; we have not been able to keep anything dry for many days together since we arrived in this neighbourhood, the humidity of the air has been so excessively great. our merchandize is reduced to a mear handfull, and our comfort during our return the next year much depends on it, it is therefore almost unnecessary to add that we much regret the reduced state of this fund. [Clark:] Monday 6th. of January 1806 The last evening Shabono and his Indian woman was very impatient to be permitted to go with me, and was therefore indulged; She observed that She had traveled a long way with us to See the great waters, and that now that monstrous fish was also to be Seen, She thought it verry hard that She could not be permitted to See either (She had never yet been to the Ocian). after an early brackfast I Set out with two Canoes down the Netel R into Meriwether Bay with a view to proced on to the Clatsop town, and hire a guide to conduct me through the creeks which I had every reason to beleeve Comunicated both with the Bay and a Small river near to which our men were making Salt. Soon after I arrived in the Bay the wind Sprung up from the N. W. and blew So hard and raised the waves so high that we were obliged to put into a Small creek Short of the Village. finding I could not proceed on to the Village in safety, I deturmined to assend this Creek as high as the canoes would go; which from its directions must be near the open lands in which I had been on the 10th. ulto., and leave the Canoes and proceed on by land. at the distance of about 3 miles up this creek I observed Some high open land, at which place a road set out and had every appearance of a portage, here I landed drew up the canoes and Set out by land, proceeded on through 3 deep Slashes to a pond about a mile in length and 200 yards wide, kept up this pond leaving it to the right, and passing the head to a creek which we could not cross, this Creek is the one which I rafted on the 8th. &amp; 9 ultimo: and at no great distance from where I crossed in Cus ca lars Canoe on the 10th. ulto. to which place I expected a find a canoe, we proceeded on and found a Small Canoe at the place I expected, calculated to carry 3 men, we crossed and from the top of a ridge in the Prarie we Saw a large gange of Elk feeding about 2 miles below on our direction. I divided the party So as to be certain of an elk, Several Shot[s] were fired only one Elk fell. I had this Elk butchered and carried to a Creak in advance at which place I intended to encamp, two other Elk were badly Shot, but as it was nearly dark we could not pursue them, we proceeded on to the forks of the Creek which we had just crossed turning around to the S.W. and meeting one of equal Size from the South, the two makeing a little river 70 yards wide which falls into the Ocian near the 3 Clat Sop houses which I visited on the 9th. ulto. in the forks of this Creek we found Some drift pine which had been left on the Shore by the tide of which we made fires. the evening a butifull Clear moon Shiney night, and the 1st. fair night which we have had for 2 months</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter XXII AT FORT CLATSOP Lewis's Journal, January 7–20, 1806 Clark's Journal, January 7–20 [Lewis:] Monday (Tuesday) January 7th. 1806. LAST evening Drewyer visited his traps and caught a beaver and an otter; the beaver was large and fat we have therefore fared sumptuously today; this we consider a great prize for another reason, it being a full grown beaver was well supplyed with the materials for making bate with which to catch others. this bate when properly prepared will intice the beaver to visit it as far as he can smell it, and this I think may be safely stated at a mile, their sense of smelling being very accute. To prepare beaver bate, the castor or bark stone is taken as the base, this is gently pressed out of the bladderlike bag which contains it, into a phiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you have them you will put from four to six stone in a phiol of that capacity, to this you will add half a nutmeg, a douzen or 15 grains of cloves and thirty grains of cinimon finely pulverized, stir them well together and then add as much ardent sperits to the composition as will reduce it the consistency [of] mustard prepared for the table; when thus prepared it resembles mustard precisely to all appearance. when you cannot procure a phiol a bottle made of horn or a tight earthen vessel will answer, in all cases it must be excluded from the air or it will soon loose it's virtue; it is fit for uce immediately it is prepared but becomes much stronger and better in about four or five days and will keep for months provided it be perfectly secluded from the air. when cloves are not to be had use double the quantity of Allspice, and when no spice can be obtained use the bark of the root of sausafras; when sperits can not be had use oil stone of the beaver adding mearly a sufficient quantity to moisten the other materials, or reduce it to a stif past[e.] it appears to me that the principal uce of the spices is only to give a variety to the scent of the bark stone and if so the mace vineller [vanilla] and other sweetsmelling spices might be employed with equal advantage. The male beaver has six stones, two [of] which contain a substance much like finely pulvarized bark of a pale yellow colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in smell, these are called the bark stones or castors;1 1 The preputial glands, containing the substance called castoreum (which once had much vogue as an efficacious medicine). See H. T. Martin's monograph on the beaver, Castorologia (Montreal, 1892), pp. 90–98.—Jesuit Relations, lxix, p. 291. two others, which like the bark stone resemble small bladders, contain a pure oil of a strong rank disagreeable smell, and not unlike train oil, these are called the oil stones; and 2 others of generation. the Barkstones are about two inc[h]es in length, the others somewhat smaller all are of a long oval form, and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the root of the tail, beneath or behind the fundament with which they are closely connected and seem to communicate. the pride of the female lyes on the inner side much like those of the hog. they have no further parts of generation that I can perceive and therefore beleive that like the birds they copulate with the extremity of the gut. The female have from two to four young ones at a birth and bring fourth once a year only, which usually happens about the latter end of may and begining of June. at this stage she is said to drive the male from the lodge, who would otherwise destroy the young. dryed our lodge and had it put away under shelter; this is the first day during which we have had no rain since we arrived at this place. nothing extraordinary happened today. [Clark:] Tuesday 7th of January 1806 Some frost this morning. I[t] may appear somewhat incrediable, but So it is that the Elk which was killed last evening was eaten except about 8 pounds, which I directed to be taken along with the Skin, I proceded up the South fork of the Creek about 2 miles and crossed on a pine tree which had been fallen by the Saltmakers on their first going out, on this tree we crossed the deepest of the Water and waded on the opposit Side for 30 yards,1 1 A branch of Skipanon Creek in the northwest corner of Clatsop County.—Ed. from thence to the Ocian ¾ of a mile through a Continuation of open ridgey Prarie, here the Coast is Sandy, we proceeded on the Sandy beech nearly South for 3 miles to the mouth of [a] butifull river with bold and rapid current of 85 yards wide and 3 feet deep in the Shallowest place, a Short distance up this river on the N E side is the remains of an old village of Clatsops. I entered a house where I found a Man 2 Wom[e]n &amp; 3 Children, they appeared retchedly pore &amp; dirty, I hired the man to Set us across the River which I call after the Nation Clatsop river2 2 Now the Necanicum, falling into the ocean north of Tillamook Head.—Ed. for which I gave 2 fishing hooks. at this place the Creek over which I crossed on a tree passes within 100 yards of the Clatsop river over which the nativs have a portage which affords them an easy communication with the villages near point adams, and at the mouth of the creek, on which we lay last night. in walking on the Sand after crossing the river I saw a Singular Species of fish which I had never before Seen one of the men Call this fish a Skaite, it is properly a Thornback. I proceeded on about 2 miles to near the base of [a] high Mountain where I found our Salt makers, and with them Sergt. Gass, Geo. Shannon was out in the woods assisting Jo Field and gibson to kill Some Meat, the Salt Makers had made a Neet close camp, convenient to wood Salt water and the fresh water of the Clâtsop river which at this place was within 100 paces of the Ocian. they wer also Situated near 4 houses of Clatsops &amp; Killamox, who they informed me had been verry kind and attentive to them. I hired a young Indian to pilot me to the whale for which Service I gave him a file in hand and promised Several other small articles on my return, left Sergt. gass and one man of my party Werner to make Salt &amp; permited Bratten to accompany me, we proceeded on the round Slipery Stones under a high hill which projected into the ocian about 4 miles further than the direction of the Coast.1 1 Tillamook Head, a high forest-covered point, upon which an important coast lighthouse now stands.—Ed. after walking for 2 ? miles on the Stones, my guide made a Sudin halt, pointed to the top of the mountain and uttered the word Pe shack which means bad, and made signs that we could not proceed any further on the rocks, but must pass over that mountain, I hesitated a moment &amp; view this emence mountain the top of which was obscured in the clouds, and the assent appeard. to be almost perpindecular; as the small Indian parth allong which they had brought emence loads but a fiew hours before, led up this mountain and appeared to assend in a Sideling direction, I thought more than probable that the assent might be torerably easy and therefore proceeded on, I soon found that the [path] become much worst as I assended, and at one place we were obliged to Support and draw our selves up by the bushes &amp; roots for near 100 feet, and after about 2 hours labour and fatigue we reached the top of this high mountain, from the top of which I looked down with estonishment to behold the hight which we had assended, which appeared to be 10 or 12 hundred feet up a mountain which appeared to be almost perpindicular, here we met 14 Indians men and women loaded with the Oil &amp; Blubber of the whale. In the face of this tremendeous precipic[e] imediately below us, there is a Stra (tar) of white earth (which my guide informed me) the neighbouring indians use to paint themselves, and which appears to me to resemble the earth of which the French Porcelain is made; I am confident that this earth contains argile,2 2 The word argil was first used as synonomous with alumina. It is now confined to potter's clay. This earth was doubtless some form of kaolinite.—Ed. but whether it also contains silex or magnesia, or either of those earths in a proper perpotion I am unable to deturmine. we left the top of the precipice and proceeded on a bad road and encamped on a small run passing to the left; all much fatiagued [Lewis:] Tuesday (Wednesday) January 8th. 1806. Our meat is begining to become scarse; sent Drewyer and Collins to hunt this morning, the guard duty being hard on the men who now remain in the fort I have for their relief since the departure of Capt. Clark made the Cooks mount guard. Sergt. Gass and Shannon have not yet returned, nor can I immajen what is the cause of their detention. In consequence of the clouds this evening I lost my P.M. observation for Equal Altitudes, and from the same cause have not been able to take a single observation since we have been at this place. nothing extraordinary happened today. The Clatsops Chinnooks and others inhabiting the coast and country in this neighbourhood, are excessively fond of smoking tobacco. in the act of smoking they appear to swallow it as they draw it from the pipe, and for many draughts together you will not perceive the smoke which they take from the pipe; in the same manner also they inhale it in their lungs untill they become surcharged with this vapour when they puff it out to a great distance through their nost[r]ils and mouth; I have no doubt the smoke of the tobacco in this manner becomes much more intoxicating and that they do possess themselves of all it's virtues in their fullest extent; they freequently give us sounding proofs of it's creating a dismorallity of order in the abdomen, nor are those light matters thought indelicate in either sex, but all take the liberty of obeying the dictates of nature without reserve. these people do not appear to know the uce of sperituous liquors, they never having once asked us for it; I presume therefore that the traders who visit them have never indulged them with the uce of it; from what ever cause this may proceede, it is a very fortunate occurrence, as well for the natives themselves, as for the quiet and safety of thos whites who visit them. [Clark:] Wednesday 8th. January 1806 The last night proved fair and cold wind hard from the S. E. we Set out early and proceeded to the top of the mountain next to the [former?] which is much the highest part and that part faceing the sea is open, from this point I beheld the grandest and most pleasing prospects which my eyes ever surveyed, in my frount a boundless Ocean; to the N. and N.E. the coast as as far as my sight could be extended, the Seas rageing with emence wave[s] and brakeing with great force from the rocks of Cape Disapointment as far as I could See to the N.W. The Clatsops Chinnooks and other villagers on each Side of the Columbia river and in the Praries below me, the meanderings of 3 handsom Streams heading in Small lakes at the foot [of] the high Country; The Columbia River for some distance up, with its Bays and Small rivers: and on the other side I have a view of the coast for an emence distance to the S.E. by S. the nitches and points of high land which forms this corse for a long ways aded to the inoumerable rocks of emence Sise out at a great distance from the shore and against which the Seas brak with great force gives this coast a most romantic appearance. from this point of View1 1 Called by the explorers, Clark's Point of View. It is now known as False Tillamook Head, or Cape Falcon, and was the headland seen from Cape Disappointment, Nov. 18, 1805.—Ed. My guide pointed to a Village at the mouth of a Small river near which place he Said the whale was, he also pointed to 4 other places where the princ[i]pal Villages of the Killamox were Situated, I could plainly See the houses of 2 of those Villeges &amp; the Smoke of a 3rd. which was two far of[f], for me to disern with my naked eye. after taking the courses and computed the Distances in my own mind, I proceeded on down a Steep decent to a Single house the remains of an old Kil a mox Town in a nitch imediately on the Sea coast, at which place great N°. of eregular rocks are out and the waves comes in with great force. Near this old Town I observed large Canoes of the neetest kind on the ground, Some of which appeared nearly decayed others quit[e] Sound, I examoned those canoes and found that [they] were the repository of the dead. This Custom of Secureing the Dead differs a little from the Chinnooks. the Kilamox Secure the dead bodies in an oblong box of Plank, which is placed in an open canoe resting on the ground, in which is put a paddle and Sundery other articles the property of the disceased. The Coast in the neighbourhood of this old village is slipping from the Sides of the high hills, in emence masses; fifty or a hundred acres at a time give way and a great proportion of [in] an instant precipitated into the Ocean. those hills and mountains are principally composed of a yellow clay; their Slipping off or Spliting assunder at this time is no doubt caused by the incessant rains which has fallen within the last two months. the mountans covered with a verry heavy c[g]roth of pine &amp; furr, also the white cedar or arbor vita and a Small proportion of the black alder, this alder grows to the hight of Sixty or Seventy feet and from 2 to 3 feet in diamiter. Some Species of pine (or fur) on the top of the Point of View rise to the emmence hight of 210 feet and from 8 to 12 feet in diameter, and are perfectly Sound and Solid. Wind hard from the S.E. and See looked [wild] in the after part of the Day breaking with great force against the Scattering rocks at some distance from Shore, and the ruged rockey points under which we wer obleged to pass and if we had unfortunately made one false Step we Should eneviateably have fallen into the Sea and dashed against the rocks in an instant, fortunately we passed over 3 of those dismal points and arived on a butifull Sand Shore on which we continued for 2 miles, crossed a Creek 80 yards near 5 Cabins, and proceeded to the place the whale had perished, found only the Skelleton of this Monster on the Sand between (2 of) the Villages of the Kil a mox nation; the Whale was already pillaged of every Valuable part by the Kilamox Inds. in the Vecinity of whose village's it lay on the Strand where the waves and tide had driven up &amp; left it. this Skeleton (of the Whale Capt. Clark) measured 105 feet.1 1 Gass says the head alone measured twelve feet. Coues thinks this was probably the great gray whale of the Pacific (Rhachianectes glaucus), but that the length must have been exaggerated.—Ed. I returned to the Village of 5 Cabins on the creek which I shall call E co-la or Whale Creek,2 2 The Nehalem River, a considerable stream in Tillamook County emptying into a bay of the same name.—Ed. found the nativs busily engaged boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large Squar wooden trought by means of hot stones; the oil when extracted was secured in bladders and the Guts of the whale; the blubber from which the oil was only partially extracted by this process, was laid by in their cabins in large flickes [flitches] for use; those flickes they usially expose to the fire on a wooden Spit untill it is prutty well wormed through and then eate it either alone or with roots of the rush, Shaw na tâk-we or Diped in the oil. The Kil a mox although they possessed large quantities of this blubber and oil were so prenurious that they disposed of it with great reluctiance and in small quantities only; insomuch that my utmost exertion aided by the party with the Small Stock of merchindize I had taken with me were not able to precure more blubber than about 300lb. and a fiew gallons of oil; Small as this stock is I prise it highly; and thank providence for directing the whale to us; and think him much more kind to us than he was to jonah, having Sent this Monster to be Swallowed by us in Sted of Swallowing of us as jonah's did. I recrossed Ecola Creek and encamped on the bank at which place we observed an ebundance of fine wood the Indian men followed me for the purpose of Smokeing. I enquired of those people as well as I could by Signs the Situation, mode of liveing &amp; Strength of their nation. They informed me that the bulk of their nation lived in 3 large villages Still further along the Sea coast to the S.S.W. at the enterence of 3 Creek[s] which fell into a bay, and that other houses were scattered about on the coast, Bay and on a Small river which fell into the Bay in which they cought Salmon, and from this Creek (which I call Kil a mox River)1 1 The Indians were speaking here of Tillamook Bay, into which several rivers and creeks run. The largest of these (doubtless the one Clark named Kilamox from hearsay) is now Wilson River, from whose upper waters a portage to Sauvie (Wappato) Island would not be difficult.—Ed. they crossed over to the (Wap pato I.) on the Shock.ah lil com (which is the Indian name for the Columbia river)2 2 Silas B. Smith says that Clark misunderstood the Indians at this point. They never name a river, only localities, so that there was no Indian word for the Columbia. Shocatilcum (Shockahlilcom) was a chief of the tribe from whom the Tillamook purchased wappato.—Ed. and purchased Wappato &amp;c. that the nation was verry large and that they had a great maney houses, In Salmon Season they cought great numbers of that fish in the Small creeks, when the Salmon was Scerce they found Sturgion and a variety of other fish thrown up by the waves and left by the tide which was verry fine, Elk was plenty in the mountains, but they could not Kill maney of them with their arrows. The Kil â mox in their habits customs manners dress &amp; language differ but little from the Clatsops, Chinnooks and others in the neighbourhood, [their houses] are of the Same form of those of the Clatsops with a Dore at each end &amp; two fire places i, e. the house is double as long as wide and divided into 2 equal parts with a post in the middle Supporting the ridge pole, and in the middle of each of those divisions they make their fires, dores Small &amp; houses Sunk 5 feet. [Lewis:] Friday (Thursday) January 9th. 1806. Our men are now very much engaged in dressing Elk and Deer skins for mockersons and cloathing. the deer are extreemly scarce in this neighbourhood, some are to be found near the praries and open grounds along the coast. this evening we heard seven guns in quick succession after each other, they appeared to be on the Creek to the South of us and several miles distant; I expect that the hunters Drewyer and Collins have fallen in with a gang of Elk. some marrow bones and a little fresh meat would be exceptable; I have been living for two days past on poor dryed Elk, or jurk as the hunters term it. The Clatsops Chinnooks &amp;c bury their dead in their canoes. for this purpose four pieces of split timber are set erect on end, and sunk a few feet in the grown[d], each brace having their fiat sides opposite to each other and sufficiently far assunder to admit the width of the canoes in which the dead are to be deposited; through each of these perpendicular posts, at the hight of six feet a mortice is cut, through which two bars of wood are incerted; on these cross bars a small canoe is placed in which the body is laid after being carefully roled in a robe of some dressed skins; a paddle is also deposited with them; a larger canoe is now reversed, overlaying and im bracing the small one, and resting with it's gunwals on the cross bars; one or more large mats of rushes or flags are then Two swords, a bludgeon and a paddle, apparently drawn by Lewis. roled around the canoes and the whole securely lashed with a long cord, usually made of the bark of the Arbor vita or white cedar. on the cross bars which support the canoes is frequently hung or laid various articles of cloathing culinary eutensels &amp;c. I cannot understand them sufficiently to make any enquiries relitive to their religeous opinions, but presume from their depositing various articles with their dead that they believe in a state of future existence. The persons who usually visit the entrance of this river for the purpose of traffic or hunting I believe are either English or Americans; the Indians inform us that they speak the same language with ourselves, and give us proofs of their varacity by repeating many words of English, as musquit, powder, shot, [kjnife, file, damned rascal, sun of a bitch &amp;c. whether these traders are from Nootka sound, from some other late establishement on this coast, or immediately from the U'States or Great Brittain, I am at a loss to determine, nor can the Indians inform us. the Indians Whom I have asked in what direction the traders go when they depart from hence, or arrive here, always point to the S.W. from which it is presumeable that Nootka cannot be their destination; and as from Indian information a majority of these traders annually visit them about the beginning of April and remain with them six or seven Months, they cannot come immediately from Great Britain or the U'States, the distance being too great for them to go and return in the ballance of the year. from this circumstance I am sometimes induced to believe that there is some other establishment on the coast of America south West of this place of which little is but yet known to the world, or it may be perhaps on some Island in the pacific ocean between the Continents of Asia and America to the South West of us.1 1 In 1788 the English trader Meares established a post at Nootka Sound, and built and launched the first vessel ever constructed on the Northwest Coast; and American traders erected, three years later, a post at Clayoquot, and built and launched a schooner. Americans and British were trading on that coast thereafter. For accounts of their early voyages thereto, see Bancroft, N. W. Coast, ii, pp. 320–326. Most ships, whether traders or whalers, then sailed by way of the Sandwich Islands. These facts will sufficiently explain our text. The brig "Lydia," ftom Boston, Captain Hill commanding, was in Columbia River in November, 1805, a fortnight after Lewis and Clark had passed down the river, possibly while they lay encamped in Gray's Bay, or upon Point Ellice. See Jewitt, Journal kept at Nootka Sound (New York, 1812), and later editions under title of Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt. This author says, "We proceeded about ten miles up the river to a small Indian village, where we heard from the inhabitants that Captains Clark and Lewis, from the United States of America, had been there about a fortnight before on their journey overland, and had left several medals with them, which they showed us." The "Lydia" remained upon the Northwest coast until August of the next year. The ignorance of the explorers as to the vicinity of this ship is to be assigned to either the stupidity or the cunning of the Indians. Possibly the crafty Chinook Concomly resented the explorers' treatment of his nation, and took his revenge by keeping them in ignorance of a fact that would have been of great value to the expedition. —Ed. This traffic on the part of the whites consists in vending, guns, (principally old british or American musquits) powder, balls and shot, Copper and brass kettles, brass teakettles and coffee pots, blankets from two to three point, scarlet and blue Cloth (coarse), plates and strips of sheet copper and brass, large brass wire, knives, beads and tobacco with fishinghooks buttons and some other small articles; also a considerable quantity of Sailor's cloaths, as hats coats, trowsers and shirts, for these they receive in return from the natives, dressed and undressed Elk-skins, skins of the sea Otter, common Otter, beaver, common fox, spuck,1 1 A term applied by the natives to the young of the sea-otter.—Ed. and tiger cat; also dryed and pounded sammon in baskets, and a kind of buisquit, which the natives make of roots called by them shappelell. The natives are extravegantly fond of the most common cheap blue and white beads, of moderate size, or such that from 50. to 70. will weigh one penneyweight. the blue is usually p[r]efered to the white; these beads constitute the principal circulating medium with all the indian tribes on this river; for these beads they will dispose [of] any article they possess, the beads are strung on strans of a fathom in length and in that manner sold by the bredth or yard. [Clark:] Thursday 9th. January 1806 a fine morning wind from the N.E. last night about 10 oClock while Smokeing with the nativ's I was alarmed by a loud Srill voice from the cabins on the opposite side, the Indians all run immediately across to the village, my guide who continued with me made Signs that Some one's throat was Cut, by enquiry I found that one man Mc.Neal was absent, I imediately Sent off Sergt. N. Pryor &amp; 4 men in quest of Mc Neal who' they met comeing across the Creak in great hast, and informed me that the people were alarmed on the opposit side at Something but what he could not tell, a Man had verry friendly envited him to go and eate in his lodge, that the Indian had locked armes with him and went to a lodge in which a woman gave him Some blubber, that the man envited him to another lodge to get Something better, and the woman [Knowing his design] held him [Mc Neal] by the blanket which he had around him (He not knowing her object freed himself &amp; was going off, when [This woman a Chinnook an old friend of Mc Neals] and another ran out and hollow'd and his pretended friend disapeared. I emediately ordered every man to hold themselves in a State of rediness and Sent Sergt. Pryor &amp; 4 men to know the cause of the alarm which was found to be a premeditated plan of the pretended friend of Mc Neal to ass[ass]anate [him] for his Blanket and what fiew articles he had about him, which was found out by a Chinnook woman who allarmed the men of the village who were with me in time to prevent the horred act. this man was of another band at Some distance and ran off as soon as he was discovered. we have now to look back and Shudder at the dreadfull road on which we have to return of 45 miles S E of Point adams &amp; 35 miles from Fort Clatsop. I had the blubber &amp; oil divided among' the party and set out about Sunrise and returned by the Same rout we had went out, met Several parties of men &amp; women of the Chinnook and Clatsops nations, on their way to trade with the Kil a mox for blubber and oil; on the Steep decent of the Mountain I overtook five men and Six women with emence loads of the Oil and blubber of the Whale, those Indians had passed by Some rout by which we missed them as we went out yesterday; one of the women in the act of getting down a Steep part of the Mountain her load by Some means had Sliped off her back, and She was holding the load by a Strap which was fastened to the mat bag in which it was in, in one hand and holding a bush by the other, as I was in front of my party, I endeavoured to relieve this woman by takeing her load untill She could get to a better place a little below, &amp; to my estonishment found the load as much as I could lift and must exceed 1001bs. the husband of this woman who was below Soon came to her releif, those people proceeded on with us to the Salt works, at which place we arrived late in the evening, found them without meat, and 3 of the Party J. Field Gibson &amp; Shannon out hunting, as I was excessively fatigued and my party appeared verry much so, I determined to Stay untill the morning and rest our selves a little. The Clatsops proceeded on with their lodes. The Clatsops, Chinnooks Kilámox &amp;c. are verry loquacious and inquisitive; they possess good memories and have repeeted to us the names capasities of the Vessels &amp;c of maney traders and others who have visited the mouth of this river; they are generally low in Statu[r]e, proportionably Small, reather lighter complected and much more illy formed than the Indians of the Missouri and those of our fronteers; they are generally Chearfull but never gay. with us their conversation generally turns upon the subject of trade, Smokeing, eating or their women; about the latter, they Speak without reserve in their presence, of their every part, and of the most farmiliar Connection. they do not hold the virtue of their women in high estimation, and will even prostitute their wives and Daughters for a fishing-hook or a Stran of beeds. in Common with other Savage nations they make their womin perform every Species of domestic drugery; but in almost every Species of this drugery the men also participate, their woman are compelled to gather roots, and assist them in takeing fish; which articles form much the greater part of their Subsistance; notwithstanding the Survile manner in which they treat their womin they pay much more respect to their judgement and oppinion in maney respects than most indian nations; their womin are permited to Speak freely before them, and Sometimes appear to command with a tone of authority; they generally consult them in their traffic and act conformably to their opinions. I think it may be established as a general maxim that those nations treat their old people and women with most defference and respect where they Subsist principally on Such articles that these can participate with the men in obtaining them; and that, that part of the Community are treated with least attention, when the act of precureing subsistance devolves entirely on the men in the vigor of life. It appears to me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial ties than in any others of the Strong effections of the humane heart, and therefore think our old men equally with our woman indebted to sivilization for their ease and comfort. I am told among the Sioux's, Assinniboins and others on the Missouri who Subsist by hunting it is a Custom when a person of either Sex becoms So old and infirm that they are unable to travel on foot, from Camp to Camp as they rove in serch of subsistance, for the Children or near relations of such person to leave them without compunction or remorse; on those occasions they usially place within their reach a Small piece of meat and a platter of water, telling the poor old Superannuated retch for their Consolation, that he or She had lived long enough, and that it was time they Should die and go to their relations who can afford to take care of them, much better than they Could. I am informed that the Menetares Arwarharmays and Ricares when attended by their old people on their hunting expedition[s] prosued the Same Custom; but in justice to those people I must observe that it appeared to me at their villages, that they provided tolerably well for their aged persons, and Several of their feasts appear to have principally for their object a contribution for their aged and infirm persons. In one of the Mandan villages I Saw an old man to whome I gave a knife and enquired his age, he Said he had Seen more than 100 winters, and that he Should Soon go down the river to their old village. he requested I would give him Something to prevent the pain in his back his grand Son a Young man rebuked the old man and Said it was not worth while, that it was time for the old man to die. the old man occupied one Side of the fire and was furnished with plenty of covouring and food, and every attention appeared to be paid to him. &amp;c. Jó. Field in my absence had killed an Elk and a Deer, brought in the Deer and half of the Elk on a part of which we Suped, Some rain a little after dark. I visited a house near the Salt boilers found it inhabited by 2 families, they were pore dirty and their house Sworming with flees. [Lewis:] Saturday (Friday) January 10th 1806. About 10.A.M. I was visited by Tia Shâh-hâr-wâr-cap and eleven of his nation in one large canoe; these are the Cuth'-lâh-mâh' nation who reside first above us on the South side of the Columbia river; this is the first time that I have seen the Chief, he was hunting when we past his vilage on our way to this place. I gave him a medal of the smallest size; he presented me with some indian tobacco and a basquit of woppetoe, in return for which I gave him some thread for making a skiming-net and a small piece of tobacco. these people speak the same language with the Chinnooks and C[l]atsops whom they also resemble in their dress customs manners &amp;c. they brought some dryed salmon, wappetoe, dogs, and mats made of rushes and flags, to barter; their dogs and a part of their wappetoe they disposed off, an[d] remained all night near the fort. This morning Drewyer and Collins returned having killed two Elk only, and one of those had died in their view over a small lake which they had not the means of passing it being late in the evening and has of course spoiled, as it laid with the entrals in it all night; as the tide was going out we could not send for the elk today, therefore ordered a party to go for it early in the morning and George and Collins to con tinue their hunt; meat has now become scarce with us.— Capt Clark returned at 10 P.M. this evening with the majority of the party who accompanyed him; having left some men to assist the saltmakers to bring in the meat of two Elk which they had killed, and sent 2 others through by land to hunt. Capt. Clark found the whale on the Coast about 45 Miles S.E. of Point Adams [Round], and about 35 Miles from Fort Clatsop by the rout he took; The whale was already pillaged of every valuable part by the Killamucks, in the vicinity of one of whose villages it lay on the strand where the waves and tide had driven [it] up and left it. this skelleton measured one hundred and five feet. Capt C. found the natives busily engaged in boiling the blubber, which they performed in a large wooden trought by means of hot stones; the oil when extracted was secured in bladders and the guts of the whale; the blubber, from which the oil was only partially extracted by this process, was laid by in their lodges in large fliches for uce; this they usually expose to the fire on a wooden spit untill it is pretty well warmed through and then eat it either alone or with the roots of the rush, squawmash, fern1 1 A species of brake (Pteris aquilina lanuguinosa) the root of which is edible and nutritious. "Squawmash" is only a corruption of camass (Camassia esculenta). The "rush" is one of the horsetails (Equisetum telmateia); its root is edible, although insipid to the taste.—Ed. wappetoe &amp;c. The natives although they possessed large quantities of this blubber and oil were so penurious that they disposed of it with great reluctance and in small quantities only; insomuch that the utmost exertions of Capt. C. and the whole party aided by the little stock of merchandize he had taken with him and some small articles which the men had, were not able to procure more blubber than about 300 lb. and a few gallons of the oil; this they have brought with them, and small as the store is, we prize it highly, and thank providence for directing the whale to us, and think him much more kind to us than he was [to] jonah, having sent this monster to be swallowed by us in stead of swallowing of us as jona's did. Capt. C. found the road along the coast extreemly difficult of axcess, lying over some high rough and stoney hills, one of which he discribes as being much higher than the others; having it's base washed by the Ocea[n] over which it rares it's towering summit perpendicularly to the hight of 1500 feet; from this summit Capt. C. informed me that there was a delightfall and most extensive view of the ocean, the coast and adjacent country; this Mou.t I have taken the liberty of naming Clark's Mountain and point of view; it is situated about 30 M. S.E. of Point Adams. (Disapointment) and projects about 2 ? miles into the Ocean; Killamucks [Qu. Clatsop] river falls in a little to the N.W. of this mountain; in the face of this tremendious precepice there is a stra[tum] of white earth (see specimen N°. [blank space in Ms.]) which the neighbouring Indians use to paint themselves, and which appears to me to resemble the earth of which the French Porcelain is made; I am confident this earth contains Argill, but w[h]ether it also contains Silex or magnesia, or either of those earths in a proper proportion I am unable to determine. Shannon and Gass were found with the Salt makers and ordered to return M,c Neal was near being assassinated by a Killamuck Indian, but fortunately escaped in consequence of a Chinnook woman giving information to Capt. C., the party and Indians with them before the villain had prepared himself to execute his purposes. The party returned excessively fortiegued and tired of their jaunt. Killamucks [Clatsop] river is 85 yards wide, rappid and 3 feet deep in the shallowest part. The Killamucks in their habits customs manners dress and language differ but little from the Clatsoops &amp; Chinnooks. they place their dead in canoes and [resting on the ground] uncovered, having previously secured the dead bodies in an oblong box of plank. The coast in the neighbourhood of Clarks Mountain is sliping off &amp; falling into the Ocean in immence masses; fifty or a hundred acres at a time give way and a great proportion in an instant [is] precipitated into the Ocean. these hills and mountains are principally composed of a yellow clay; there sliping off or spiking assunder at this time is no doubt caused by the incessant rains which have fallen within the last two months. the country in general as about Fort Clatsop is covered with a very heavy growth of several species of pine &amp; furr, also the arbor vita or white cedar and a small proportion of the black Alder which last sometimes grows to the hight of sixty or seventy feet, and from two to four feet in diameter. some species of the pine rise to the immence hight of 210 feet and are from 7 to 12 feet in diameter, and are perfectly sound and solid. [Clark:] Friday the 10th. of January 1806 I derected Sergt. Gass to continue with the salt makers untill Shannon return from hunting, and then himself and Shannon to return to the Fort, I set out at Sunrise with the party waded the Clatsop river which I found to be 85 Steps across and 3 feet deep, on the opposite Side a Kilamox Indian Came to [me] and offered to Sell Some roots of which I did not want [any], he had a robe made of 2 large Sea otter Skins which I offered to purchase, but he would not part with them, we returned by nearly the Same rout which I had come out, at four miles, I met Gibson &amp; Shannon each with a load of meat, they informed me that they had killed Elk about 2 miles off, I directed 3 men to go with the hunters and help them pack the meat to the place they were makeing Salt, and return to the fort with Sergt. Gass, the balance of the party took the load of the 3 men, after crossing the 2d. Creek frasure informed me that he had lost his big knife, here we Dined. I put frasurs load on my guide who is yet with me, and Sent him back in Serch of his knife with directions to join the other men who were out packing meat &amp; return to the fort all together. I arrived at the Canoes about Sunset, the tides was Comeing in I thought it a favourable time to go on to the fort at which place we arrived at 10 oClock P M, found Several inidians of the Cath′lâh-mâh nation the great Chief Shâh-hâr-wâh cop who reside not far above us on the South Side of the Columbia River, this is the first time I have Seen the Chief, he was hunting when we passed his village on our way to this place, we gave him a medal of the Smallest Size, he presented me with a basquet of Wappato, in return for which I gave him a fish hook of a large Size and Some wire, those people Speak the Same language with the Chinnooks and Clatsops, whome they all resemble in Dress, Custom, manners &amp;c. they brought Some Dried Salmon, Wappato, Dogs, and mats made of rushes &amp; flags to barter; their Dogs and part of their Wappato they disposed of, and remained in their Camp near the fort all night. In my absence the hunters from the fort killed only two Elk which is yet out in the woods. Capt. Lewis examined our Small Stock of merchendize found Some of it wet and Dried it by the fire. Our Merchindize is reduced to a mear handfull, and our comfort, dureing our return next year, much depends on it, it is therefore almost unnecessary to add that it is much reduced T[he] nativs in this neighbourhood are excessively fond of Smokeing tobacco. in the act of Smokeing they appear to swallow it as they draw it from the pipe, and for maney. draughts together you will not perceive the Smoke they take from the pipe, in the Same manner they inhale it in their longs untill they become Surcharged with the Vapour when they puff it out to a great distance through their norstils and mouth; I have no doubt that tobacco Smoked in this manner becomes much more intoxicating, and that they do possess themselves of all its virtues to the fullest extent; they frequently give us Sounding proofs of its createing a dismorallity of order in the abdomen, nor are those light matters thought indelicate in either Sex, but all take the liberty of obeying the dicktates of nature without reserve. Those people do not appear to know the use of Speritious licquors, they never haveing once asked us for it; I prosume therefore that the traders who visit them have never indulged them with the use of it; of whatever cause this may proceed, it is a verry fortunate occurrence, as well for the nativs themselves, as for the quiet and Safty of those whites who visit them. George Drewyer visited this [his] traps in my absence and caught a Beaver &amp; a otter; the beaver was large and fat, and Capt. L. has feested Sumptiously on it yesterday; this we consider as a great prize, it being a full grown beaver was Well Supplyed with the materials for makeing bate with which to catch others. this bate when properly prepared will entice the beaver to visit it as far as he can Smell it, and this I think may be Safely Stated at ? a mile, their sence of Smelling being verry accute. To prepare beaver bate, the Caster-or bark Stone is taken as the base, this is generally pressed out of the bladder like bag which contains it, into a phiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you have them you will put from 4 to 6 Stone in a phial of that capacity, to this you will add half a Nutmeg, a Dozen or 15 grains of Cloves .and 30 grains of Sinimon finely pulverised, stur them well together, and then add as much ardent Sperits to the composition as will reduce it to the Consistancey of Mustard prepared for the table, when thus prepared it resembles mustard precisely to all appearance. When you cannot precure a phial a bottle made of horn or a light earthern vessel will answer, in all cases it must be excluded from the air or it will Soon lose its Virtue; it is fit for use imediately it is prepared but becoms much stronger and better in 4 or 5 days and will keep for months provided it be purfectly Secluded from the air. when cloves are not to be had use double the quantity of allspice, and when no spices can be obtained use the bark of the root of the Sausafras; when Sperits cannot be had use oil Stone of the beaver adding mearly a Sufficent quantity to moisten the other materials, or reduce it to a Stiff paste. it appears to me that the principal use of the Spices is only to give a variety to the Scent of the bark Stone and if So the mace vineller, and other Sweet Smelling Spices might be employd with equal advantage. The Male Beaver has Six stones, two[of] which contanes a substance much like finely pulverised bark of a pale yellow Colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in smell, these are Called the bark stones or castors; two others, which like the bark stone resemble Small blatters, contain a pure oil of a Strong rank disagreable Smell, and not unlike train Oil, these are Called the Oil Stones, and two others of Generation. The bark stones are about 2 inches in length, the others somewhat Smaller, all are of a long Oval form, and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the root of the tail beneath or behind the fundiment with which they are closely connected and Seam to communicate, the pride of the female lye on the inner Side much like those of the hog they have no further parts of Generation that I can proceive, and therefore believe that like the birds they Coperate [copulate] with the extremity of the gut. The female have from 2 to 4 young ones at a birth and bring forth once a year only which usially happins about the latter end of May and beginning of June. at this Stage She is said to drive the Mail from the lodge, who would otherwise distroy the young. [Lewis:] Sunday (Saturday) January 11th. 1806. Sent a party early this morning for the Elk which was killed on the 9th. they returned with it in the evening; Drewyer and Collins also returned without having killed anything. this morning the Sergt. of the guard reported the absence of our Indian Canoe, on enquiry we found that those who came in it last evening had been negligent in securing her and the tide in the course of the night had taken her off; we sent a party down to the bay in surch of her, they returned unsuccessfull, the party also who went up the river and Creek in quest of the meat were ordered to lookout for her but were equally unsuccessfull; we ordered a party to resume their resurches for her, early tomorrow; this will be a very considerable loss to us if we do not recover her; she is so light that four men can carry her on their sholders a mile or more without resting; and will carry three men and from 12 to 15 hundred lb8. the Cuthlâhmâhs left us this evening on their way to the C[l]atsops, to whom they purpose bartering their wappetoe for the blubber and oil of the whale, which the latter purchase for beads &amp;c. from the Killamucks; in this manner there is a trade continually carryed on by the natives of the river each trading some article or other with their neighbours above and below them; and thus articles which are vended by the whites at the entrance of this river, find their way to the most distant nations enhabiting it's waters. [Clark:] Saturday 11th. of January 1806 Sent a party early this morning for the Elk which was killed on the 9th. they returned with it in the evining; This morning the Sergt. of the guard reported that our Indian Canoe had gone a Drift, on enquiry we found that those who came in it last evening had been negligent in Secureing her, and the tide in corse of the night had taken her off; we Sent a party down to the bay in Serch of her, they returned unsecksessfull, the party who went up the river and creek after meat were derected to look out for her but were equally unsecksessfull; this will be a verry considerable loss to us if we do not recover her, She is so light that 4 men can carry her on their Sholders a mile or more without resting, and will carry four men and from 10 to 12 hundred pounds. The Cathlâmâhs left us this evening on their way to the Clatsops, to whome they perpose bartering their Wappato for the blubber &amp; Oil of the whale, which the latter purchased for Beeds &amp;c. from the Kilámox; in this Manner there is a trade continually carried on by the nativs of the river each tradeing Some articles or other with their neighbours above and below them, and those articles which are Vended by the Whites at their enterance of this river, find their way to the most distant nations inhabiting its waters. [Lewis:] Monday (Sunday) January 12th. 1806. The men who were sent in surch of the canoe returned without being able to find her, we therefore give her over as lost. This morning sent out Drewyer and one man to hunt, they returned in the evening, Drewyer having killed seven Elk; I scarcely know how we should subsist were it not for the exertions of this excellent hunter. At 2.P.M. the ballance of the party who had been left by Capt. C. arrived; about the same time the two hunters [also arrived] who had been dispatched by Capt. C. for the purpose of hunting, [on the 9th. inst.] they had killed nothing. We have heretofore usually divided the meat when first killed among the four messes into which we have divided our party leaving to each the care of preserving and the discretion of using it, but we find that they make such prodigal use of it when they hapen to have a tolerable stock on hand that we have determined to adapt a different system with our present stock of seven Elk; this is to jirk it &amp; issue to them in small quantities [Clark:] Sunday the 12th. of January 1806 This morning Sent out Drewyer and one man to hunt, they returned in the evening Drewyer haveing killed 7 Elk; I scercely know how we Should Subsist, I beleive but badly if it was not for the exertions of this excellent hunter; maney others also exert themselves, but not being accquainted with the best method of finding and killing the elk and no other wild animals is to be found in this quarter, they are unsucksessfull in their exertions. at 2 P.M. Sergt. Gass and the men I left to assist the salt makers in carrying in their meat arrived also the hunters which I directed to hunt in the point, they killed nothing. We have heretofore devided the Meat when first killed among the four messes, into which we have divided our party, leaveing to each the care of preserving and distribution of useing it; but we find that they make such prodigal use of it when they happen to have a tolerable Stock on hand, that we are determined to adopt a Different System with our present stock of Seven Elk; this is to jurk it and issue it to them in Small quantities. [Lewis:] Tuesday (Monday) January 13th. 1806. This morning I took all the men who could be spared from the Fort and set out in quest of the flesh of the seven Elk that were killed yesterday, we found it in good order being untouched by the wolves, of which indeed there are but few in this country; at 1.P.M. we returned having gotten all the meat to the fort, this evening we exhausted the last of our candles, but fortunately had taken the precaution to bring with us moulds and wick, by means of which and some Elk's tallow in our possession we do not yet consider oursleves destitute of this necessary article; the Elk we have killed have a very small portion of tallow. The traders usually arrive in this quarter, as has been before observed, in the month of April, and remain untill October; when here they lay at anchor in a bay within Cape Disappointment on the N. side of the river; here they are visited by the natives in their canoes who run along side and barter their comodities with them, their being no houses or fortification on shore for that purpose. the nations who repare thither are fi[r]st, those of the sea coast S. E. of the entrance of the river, who reside in the order in which their names are mentioned, begining at the entrance of the river (viz) The Clatsop, Killamuck, Ne-cost, Nat-ti, Nat-chies, Tarl-che, E-slitch, You-cone and So-see. secondly those inhabiting the N.W. coast begining at the entrance of the river and mentioned in the same order; the Chinnook and Chiltch the latter very numerous; and thirdly the Cath-lâh-mah, and Skil-lutes, the latter numerous and inhabiting the river from a few miles above the marshey Islands, where the Cuth-lâh-mâhs cease, to the grand rappids. These last may be esteemed the principal carryers or intermediate traders betwen the whites and the Indians of the sea Coast, and the E-ne-shurs, the E-chee-lutes, and the Chil-luck-kit-te quaws, who inhabit the river above, to the grand falls inclusive, and who prepare most of the pounded fish which is brought to market.1 1 In the Biddle text (ii, pp. 116–120) is given an enumeration of the tribes, with their population, located on the seacoast near the Columbia, on both sides of the river. The explicit statement is made that "our personal observation has not extended beyond the Killamucks;" and, at the close, that details of the characters and customs of those tribes "must be left to future adventurers." The tribes whom they mention belong mainly to the Salishan, Chinookan, and Yakonan families.—Ed. The bay in which this trade is carryed on is spacious and commodious, and perfectly secure from all except the S. and S.E. winds, these however are the most prevalent and strong winds in the Winter season. fresh water and wood are very convenient and excellent timber for refiting and reparing vessels.— [Clark:] Monday 13th. January 1806 Capt. Lewis took all the men which could be speared from the Fort and Set out in quest of the flesh of the Seven Elk which were killed yesterday they found the meat all Secure untouched by the Wolves, of which indeed there are but fiew in this countrey; at 1 P.M. the party returned with the 2d. and Last load of meat to the fort. this evening we finished all [the] last of our candles, we brought with us, but fortunately had taken the precaution to bring with us moulds and wick, by means of which and Some Elk tallow in our possession we do not think our Selves distitute of this necessary article, the Elk which have been killed have a verry Small portion of tallow. The Traders usially arrive in this quarter, in the month of april, and remain until October; when here they lay at anchor in a Bay within Cape Disapointment on the N. side of the river; here they are visited by the nativs in their Canoes who run along Side and barter their comodities with them, their being no houses or fortification on Shore for that purpose. The nations who repare thither ar[e] first those of the Sea Coast S.E. &amp; N W of the enterance of the river, who reside in the order in which their names are mentioned to the S E the Clatsops, Kil á mox, and those to the N W. the Chinnooks, and Chiltch; (Ch. on the coast to the N. W.) and Secondly the Cath-lâh-mâh, War-ki-a-cum, and Skil-lutes, the latter noumerous and inhabiting (the river Cowe lis kee) those last may be considered or [as] intermedeate traders between the whites and nations on the Sea Coast, and the E-ne-churs, the E-chee-lutes, and the Chil-luck-kit-te-quaws, who inhabit the river up to the great falls inclusive, and who prepare most of the pounded fish which is brought to Market. The Bay in which the trade is Carried on is Spacious and Commodious, and perfectly Secure from all except the S. &amp; S. E. Winds and those blow but Seldom the most prevalent &amp; strong winds are from the S.W. &amp; N W in the Winter Season. fish water and wood are very convenient and excellent timber for refitting and repareing vessels. [Lewis:] Wednesday (Tuesday) January 14th. 1806. This morning the Sergt. of the Guard reported the absence of one of the large perogues, it had broken the chord by which it was attatched and the tide had taken it off; we sent a party immediately in surch of her, they returned in about 3 hours having fortunately found her. we now directed three of the perogues to be drawn up out of reach of the tide and the fourth to be mored in the small branch just above the landing and confined with a strong rope of Elk-skin. had we lost this perogue also we should have been obliged to make three small ones, which with the few tools we have now left would be a serious undertaking. a fatiegue of 6 men employed in jerking the Elk beaf. From the best estimate we were able to make as we d[e]scended the Columbia we conceived that the natives inhabiting that noble stream, for some miles above the great falls to the grand rappids inclusive annually prepare about 30,000 lbs. of pounded sammon for market. but whether this fish is an article of commerce with the whites or is exclusively sold to, and consumed by the natives of the sea Coast, we are at a loss to determine. the first of those positions I am disposed to credit most, but, still I must confess that I cannot imagine what the white merchant's object can be in purchasing this fish, or where they dispose of it. and on the other hand the Indians in this neighbourhood as well as the Skillutes have an abundance of dryed sammon which they take in the creeks and inlets, and I have never seen any of this pounded fish in their lodges, which I presume would have been the case if they purchased this pounded fish for their own consumption. the Indians who prepared this dryed and pounded fish, informed us that it was to trade with the whites, and shewed us many articles of European manufacture which they obtained for it. it is true they obtain those articles principally for their fish but they trade with the Skillutes for them and not immediately with the whites; the intermediate merchants and carryers, the Skillutes, may possibly consume a part of this fish themselves and dispose of the ballance of it [to] the natives of the sea coast, and from them obtain such articles as they again trade with the whites. [Clark:] Tuesday 14th. January 1806 This morning the Serjt. of the guard reported the absence of one of our canoes it had broken the cord by which it was attached and the tide had taken her off; We Sent a party imediately in Serch of her, they returned in about 3 hours haveing fortunately found her. We now derect that 3 of the [canoes] be drawed up out of reach of the tide and the 4th. to be tied with a long Strong Cord of Elk Skins, ready for use. had we lost this large Canoe We Should have been obliged to make 3 other Small ones, which with the fiew tools we have now left would be a Serious undertakeing. a fatiege of six men employd in jurking the Elk beef. From the best estermate we were enabled to make as we decended the columbia we conceived that the nativs inhabiting that noble Stream (from the enterance of Lewis's river to the neighbourhood of the falls the nativs consume all the fish they Catch either for food or fuel) From Towarnehiooks River or a fiew mil[e]s above the Great falls to the grand rapids inclusive anually prepare about 30,000 lbs of pounded fish (Chiefly Salmon) for Market, but whether this fish is an article of Commerce with their neighbours or is exclusively Sold to, and Consumed by the nativs of the sea coast, we are at a loss to determine the latter of those positions I am dispose[d] to credit most, as I cannot imagine what the white merchants obje[c]ts could be in purchaseing fish, or where they could dispose of it. on the other hand the Indians in this neighbourhood as well as the Skillutes and those above have an abundance of Dryed Salmon which they take in the creeks and inlets, they are excessively fond of the pounded fish haveing frequently asked us for Some of it. the Indians who prepared this pounded fish made signs that they traded it with people below them for Beeds and trinkets &amp;c. and Showed us maney articles of European Manufacture which they obtained for it; the Skillutes and Indians about the great rapids are the intermediate merchants and Carryers, and no doubt consume a part of this fish themselves and dispose of the ballance of it to the nativs of the Sea coast, and from this obtain Such articles as they again trade with the whites. The persons who usially visit the enterence of this river for the purpose of traffic or hunting, I believe is either English or Americans; the Indians inform us that they Speak the Same language with ourselves, and gave us proofs of their varacity by repeating maney words of English, Sun of a pitch &amp;. (heave the lead &amp; maney blackguard phrasses). Whether those traders are from Nootka Sound, from Some other late establishment on this Coast, or imediately from the U. States or Great Brittain, I am at a loss to determine, nor can the Indians inform us. the Indians whome I have asked in what direction the traders go when they depart from hence, allways point to the S. W. from which it is prosumeable that Nootka cannot be their distination; and from Indian information a Majority of those traders annually visit them about the beginning of April and remain Some time and either remain or revisit them in the fall of which I cannot properly understand, from this circumstance they canot come directly from the U States or Great Brittain, the distance being to great for them to go and return in the ballance of a year. I am Sometimes induced to believe that there is Some other Establishment on the Coast of America South of this place of which little is but yet known to the world, or it may be perhaps on Some Island in the Pacific Ocian between the Continant of America &amp; Asia to the S.W. of us. This traffic on the part of the whites consist in vending, guns, principally old British or American Musquets, powder, balls and shote, brass tea kittles, Blankets from two to three points, scarlet and blue Cloth (Coarse), plates and Strips of Sheet Copper and brass, large brass wire Knives Beeds &amp; Tobacco with fishing hook buttons and Some other Small articles; also a considerable quantity of Salors Clothes, as hats, Coats, Trouse[r]s and Shirts. for those they receive in return from the nativs Dressed and undressed Elk Skins, Skins of the Sea otter, Common otter, beaver, common fox, Speck, and [Spotted or] tiger Cat, also Some Salmon dried or pounded and a kind of buisket, [the native dispose of some of these biscuits not a great article of trade] which the nativs make of roots called by them Shappelell. The nativs are extravigantly fond of the most common cheap Blue and white beeds, of moderate size, or Such that from 50 to 70 will way one pennyweight, the blue is usially preferred to the white; those beeds constitute the principal Circulating medium with all the Indian tribes on the river; for those beeds they will dispose of any article they possess. the beeds are Strung on Strans of a fathom in length &amp; in that manner Sold by the bre[d]th [arms length or double arms lengtlh] or yard. [Lewis:] Thursday (Wednesday) January 15th. 1806. Had a large coat completed out of the skins of the Tiger Cat and those also of a small animal about the size of a squirrel not known to me; these skins I procured from the Indians who had previously dressed them and formed them into robes; it took seven of these robes to complete the coat. we had determined to send out two hunting parties today but it rained so incessantly that we posponed it. no occurrence worthy of relation took place today. The implyments used by the Chinnooks Clatsops Cuthlahmahs &amp;c in hunting are the gun the bow &amp; arrow, deadfalls, pitts, snares, and spears or gigs; their guns are usually of an inferior quality being oald refuse American &amp; brittish Musquits which have been repared for this trade. there are some very good peices among them. but they are invariably in bad order; they apear not to have been long enou[g]h accustomed to fire arms to understand the management of them, they have no rifles. Their guns and amunition they reserve for the Elk, deer and bear, of the two last however there are but few in their neighbourhood. they keep their powder in small japaned tin flasks which they obtain with their amunition from the traders; when they happen to have no ball or shot, they substitute gravel or peices of potmettal, and are insensible of the damage done thereby to their guns. The bow and arrow is the most common instrument among them, every man being furnished with them whether he has a gun or not; this instrument is employed indiscriminately in hunting every species of anamal on which they subsist. Their bows are extreamly neat and very elastic, they are about two and a half feet in length, and two inches in width in the center, thence tapering graduly to the extremities where they are half an inch wide they are very flat and thin, formed of the heart of the arbor-vita or white cedar, the back of the bow being thickly covered with sinews of the Elk laid on with a Gleue which they make from the sturgeon; the string is made of sinues of the Elk also. the arrow is formed of two parts usually tho' sometimes entire; those formed of two parts are unequally divided that part on which the feathers are placed occupyes four fifths of it's length and is formed of light white pine reather larger than a swan's quill, the lower extremity of this is a circular mortice secured by sinues roled around it; this mortice receives the one end of the 2nd. part which is of a smaller size than the first and about five inches long, in the end of this the barb is fixed and confined with sinue, this barb is either stone, iron or copper, if metal in this form forming at it's point a greater angle than those of any other Indians I have observed. the shorter part of the arrow is of harder wood as are also the whole of the arrow when it is of one piece only. as these people live in a country abounding in ponds lakes &amp;c and frequently hunt in their canoes and shoot at fowl and other anamals where the arrow missing its object would be lost in the water they are constructed in the manner just discribed in order to make them float should they fall in the water, and consequently can again be recovered by the hunter; the quiver is usually the skin of a young bear or that of a wolf invariably open at the side in stead of the end as the quivers of other Indians generally are; this construction appears to answer better for the canoe than if they were open at the end only. maney of the Elk we have killed since we have been here, have been wounded with these arrows, the short piece with the barb remaining in the animal and grown up in the flesh. the deadfalls and snares are employed in taking the wolf the raccoon and fox of which there are a few only. the spear or gig is used to take the sea otter, the common otter, spuck, and beaver. their gig consists of two points or barbs and are the same in their construction as those discribed before as being common among the Indians on the upper part of. this river. their pits are employed in taking the Elk, and of course are large and deep, some of them a cube of 12 or 14 feet. these are usually placed by the side of a large fallen tree which as well as the pit lye across the roads frequented by the Elk. these pitts are disguised with the slender boughs of trees and moss; the unwary Elk in passing the tree precipiates himself into the pitt which is sufficiently deep to prevent his escape, and is thus taken. [Clark:] Friday [Wednesday] 15th. of January 1806 Capt. Lewis had a large coat finished made of the Skins of the tiger Cat, and those of the Small animal about the Size of Small cat not known to me; those Skins were precured from the Indians who had previously dressed them and formed them into robes; it took Seven of those robes to Complete the coat. no occurrence worthey of remark took place. rained hard all day. The imployments used by the Chinnooks Clatsops, Cath-lah-mahs Kil-a-mox &amp;c in hunting are the gun the bow &amp; arrow, dead falls, Pitts, Snares, and Spears or gigs; their guns are usially of an inferior quallity being old refuse american or brittish muskets which have been repared for this trade there are Some verry good pieces among them, but they are invariably in bad order they appear not to be long enough acquainted with fire arms to understand the management of them. They have no rifles. Their guns and amunition they reserve for the Elk, Deer, and Bear, of the two last however there are but fiew in their neighbourhoods. they keep their powder in Small japaned tin flasks which they obtain with their amunition from the traders; when they happen to have no Ball or Shot they Substitute Gravel and are insenceable of the dammage done thereby to their Guns. The Bow and arrow is the most common instrument among them, every man being furnished with them whether he has a gun or not, this instrement is imployed indiscreminately in hunting every Species of animal on which they Subsist, Their bows are extreemly meet [neat] and very elastic, they are about two feet six inches long and two inches wide in the Center, thence tapering gradually to the extremities, where they ar ¾ of an Inch wide, they are very flat and thin, formed of the heart of the arbor vita or white cedar, the back of the Bow being thickly covered with Sinues of the Elk laid on with a Gleue which they make from the Sturgeon; the String is made of the Sinues of the Elk also, the arrow is formed of two parts usually tho' Sometimes entire; those formed of 2 parts are uneaquilly devided, the part on which the feathers are placed occupie 4/5 of it's length and is formed of light white pine rather larger than a Swans quill, in the lower extremity of this is a circular mortice Secured by sinues raped around it; this mortice rec[e]ives the one end of the 2d part which is of Smaller Size than the first and about five inches long, in the end of this the barb is fixed and Confined with Sinues, the berb is either Iron Copper or Stone—in this form forming at its point a greater angle than those of any other Indians I have observed. The Shorter part of the arrow is of harder wood, as are also the whole of the arrow where it is of one piece only. as these people live in a Countrey abounding in Ponds lakes &amp;c. and frequently hunt in their Canoes and Shoot at fowls and other animals where the arrow missing its object would be lost in the water they are constructed in the Manner just discribed in order to make them flote Should they fall in the water, and consequently can again be recovered by the hunter; the quiver is useally the Skin of a young bear or that of a wolf invariably open at the Side in Sted of the end, as the quiver of other Indians generally are, this Construction appears to answer better for the Canoe, than if they were open at the end only. maney of the Elk which our hunters have killd. Sence we have been here have been wounded with those arrows, the Short piece with the barbe remaining in the Animal and grown up in the flesh, the Deadfalls &amp; snares are employd in takeing the Wolf, the racoon and fox of which there are a fiew. the Spear or gig is used to take the Sea otter, [or] Spuck, [Ind. name] &amp; Beaver. The gig consists of two points or birbs and are the Same in their construction as those which are common among the Indians on the upper part of this river and before discribed. Their pitt are employed in takeing the Elk, and of Course are large and Deep, Some of them a Cube of 12 or 14 feet, those ar commonly placed by the Side of a large fallen tree which as well as the pitt lie across the roads frequented by the Elk, these pitts are disguised with the Slender bows of trees &amp; moss: the unwarry Elk In passing the tree precipates himself into the pitt which is Sufficiently deep to prevent his escape. [Lewis:] Friday (Thursday) January 16th. 1806. This evening we finished curing the meat. no occurrence worthy of relation took place today. we have plenty of Elk beef for the present and a little salt, our houses dry and comfortable, and having made up our minds to remain until the 1st. of April, every one appears content with his situation and his fare. it is true that we could even travel now on our return as far as the timbered country reaches, or to the falls of the river; but further it would be madness for us to attempt to proceede untill April, as the indians inform us that the snows lye knee deep in the plains of Columbia during the winter, and in these plains we could scarcely get as much fuel of any kind as would cook our provision as we descended the river; and even were we happyly over these plains and again in the woody country at the foot of the Rocky Mountains we could not possibly pass that immence barrier of mountains on which the snows ly in winter to the debth in many places of 20 feet; in short the Indians inform us that they are impracticable untill about the 1st. of June, at which time even there is an abundance of snow but a scanty subsistence may be obtained for the horses. we should not therefore forward ourselves on our homeward journey by reaching the rocky mountains. early than the 1st. of June, which we can easily effect by seting out from hence on the 1st. of April. The Clatsops Chinnooks &amp;c. in fishing employ the common streight net, the scooping or diping net with a long handle, the gig, and the hook and line. the common net is of different lengths and debths usually employed in taking the sammon, Carr [cherr] and trout in the inlets among the marshey grounds and the mouths of deep creeks the skiming or [s]cooping net to take small fish in the spring and summer season; the gig and hook are employed indiscriminately at all seasons in taking such fish as they can procure by their means. their nets and fishing lines are made of the silk-grass or white cedar bark; and their hooks are generally of European manufactory, tho' before the whites visited them they made hooks of bone and other substances formed in the following manner A C, and C.B. are two small pieces of bone about the size of a strong twine, these are flattened and leveled off of their extremities near C. where they are firmly attatched together with sinues and covered with rosin. CA. is reduced to a sharp point at A where it is also bent in a little; C B. is attatched to the line, for about half it's length at the upper extremity B. the whole forming two sides of an accute angled triangle. [Clark:] Saturday [Thursday] 16th. January 1806 This evening we finished cureing the meat. no occurrence worthey of relation took place to day. we have a plenty of Elk beef for the present and a little salt, our houses dry and comfortable, haveing made up our minds to Stay untill the 1st. of April every one appears contented with his Situation, and his fare. it is true we could travel even now on our return as far as the timbered Country reaches, or to the falls of the river, but further it would be madness for us to attempt to proceed untill april, as the indians inform us that the Snows lyes Knee deep in the Columbian Plains dureing the winter, and in those planes we could not git as much wood as would cook our provisions untill the drift wood comes down in the Spring and lodges on the Shore &amp;c. and even were we happily over those plains and in the woodey Countrey at the foot of the rockey Mountains, we could not possibly pass that emence bearier of Mountains on which the snow lyes in winter to the debth in maney plac[e]s of 20 feet; in Short the Indians tell us they [are] impassable untill about the 1st. of June, at which time even then is an abundance of snow but a Scanty Subsistance may be had for the horses. We Should [not] fo[r]ward our homeward journey any by reaching the Rocky Mountains earlier than the 1st. of June which we can effect by Setting out from hence by the 1st. of April. The Clatsops, Chinnooks &amp;c. in fishing employ the common Streight net, the scooping or dipping net with a long handle, the gig, and the hook and line. the common nets are of different lengths and debths usually employd in takeing the Salmon, Carr and trout in the inlets among the marshey grounds and the mouths of deep Creeks, the Skiming or [s]cooping nets to take Smaller fish in the Spring and Summer Season; the gig and hook are employed indiscreminately at all Seasons in takeing Such fish as they can precure by these means. their nets and fishing lines are made of the Silk Grass or White Cedar bark; and their hooks are generally of European Manufactory, tho' before the whites visited them they made their Hooks of bone and other Substances formed in the following Manner AC and BC are two Small pieces of bone about the Size of a Strong twine, these are flattened &amp; beaveled off to their extremites at C. where they are firmley attached together and Covered with rozin CA is reduced to a Sharp point at A where it is also bent in a little; CB is attached to the line, at the upper extremity B. the whole forming two Sides of an accute angled triangle. the [line] has a loop at D [by] which it is anexed to a longer line and taken off at pleasure. Those Hooks are yet common among' the nativs on the upper parts of the Columbia river for to Catch fish in Deep places. [Lewis:] Saturday (Friday) January 17th. 1806. This morning we were visited by Comowool and 7 of the Clatsops our nearest neighbours, who left us again in the evening. They brought with them some roots and buries for sale, of which however they disposed of but very few as they asked for them such prices as our stock in trade would not license us in giving. the Chief Comowool gave us some roots and buries for which we gave him in return a mockerson awl and some thread; the latter he wished for the purpose of making a skiming net. one of the party was dressed in t[h]ree very eligant Sea Otter skins which we much wanted; for these we offered him many articles but he would not dispose of them for any other consideration but blue beads, of these we had only six fathoms left, which being 4 less than his price for each skin he would not exchange nor would a knife or an equivalent in beads of any other colour answer his purposes, these coarse blue beads are their f [av]orite merchandize, and are called by them tia Commáshuck′ or Chiefs beads. the best wampum is not so much esteemed by them as the most inferior beads. Sent Coalter out to hunt this morning, he shortly after returned with a deer, venison is a rarity with us we have had none for some weeks. Drewyer also set out on a hunting excertion and took one man with him. he intends both to hunt the Elk and trap the beaver. The Culinary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood consist of wooden bowls or throughs, baskets, wooden spoons and woden scures or spits. Their wooden bowls and troughs are of different forms and sizes, and most generally dug out of a solid piece; they are ither round or semi-globular, in the form of a canoe, cubic, and cubic at top terminating in a globe at bottom; these are extreemly well executed and many of them neatly carved, the larger vessels with hand-holes to them; in these vessels they boil their fish or flesh by means of hot stones which they immerce in the water with the article to be boiled. they also render the oil of fish or other anamals in the same manner. their baskets are formed of cedar bark and beargrass so closely interwoven with the fingers that they are watertight without the aid of gum or rosin; some of these are highly ornamented with strans of beargrass which they dye of several colours and interweave in a great variety of figures; this serves them the double perpuse of holding their water or wearing on their heads; and are of different capacities from that of the smallest cup to five or six gallons; they are generally of a conic form or reather the segment of a cone of which the smaller end forms the base or bottom of the basket. these they make very expediciously and dispose off for a mear trifle. it is for the construction of these baskets that the beargrass becomes an article of traffic among the natives this grass grows only on their high mountains near the snowey region; the blade is about 3/8 of an inch wide and 2 feet long, smoth pliant and strong; the young blades which are white from not being exposed to the sun or air, are those most commonly employed, particularly in their neatest work. Their spoons are not remarkable nor abundant, they are generally large and the bole brawd. their meat is roasted with a sharp scure, one end of which is incerted in the meale with the other is set erect in the ground. the spit for roasting fish has it's upper extremity split, and between it's limbs the center of the fish is inscerted with it's head downwards and the tale and extremities of the scure secured with a string, the sides of the fish, which was in the first instance split on the back, are expanded by means of small splinters of wood which extend crosswise the fish. a small mat of rushes or flags is the usual plate or dish on which their fish, flesh, roots or burries are served. they make a number of bags and baskets not watertight of cedar bark, silk-grass, rushes, flags and common coarse sedge. in these they secure their dryed fish, roots, buries. &amp;c. [Clark:] Sunday [Friday] 17th. January 1806 This morning we were visited by Comowool and 7 of the Clatsops our nearest neighbours, who left us again in the evening. They brought with them Some roots and beries for Sale, of which however they disposed of very fiew as they asked for them Such prices as our Stock in trade would not licence us in giveing. The chief Comowool gave us some roots and berries, for which we gave him in return a Mockerson awl and some thread; the latter he wished for the purpose of makeing a Skiming net. one of the party was dressed in three verry elegant Sea otter Skins which we much wanted; for these we offered him maney articles but he would not dispose of them for aney other Consideration but Blue beeds, of those we had only Six fathoms left, which being 4 less than his price for each Skin he would not exchange nor would a Knife or any other equivalent in beeds of aney other Colour answer his purpose, these Coarse blue beeds are their favourite Merchandize and are Called by them Tia com ma shuck or chief beeds, the best Wampom is not as much esteemed by them as the most indifferent beeds. Sent Colter out to hunt he Shortly after returned with a Deer, Venison is a rarity with us we have had none for Some weeks. Drewyer Set out on a hunting expedition one man went with him. he intends to hunt the Elk and trap the beaver. The Culianary articles of the Indians in our neighbourhood consists of wooden bowls or troughs, Baskets, Shell and wooden Spoons and wooden Scures or Spits, their wooden Bowles and troughs are of different forms and Sizes, and most generally dug out of Solid piecies; they are either round, Square or in the form of a canoe; those are extreemly well executed and maney of them neetly covered, the larger vessels with hand-holes to them; in these vessels they boil their fish or flesh by means of hot Stones which they immerce in the water with the articles to be boiled. They also render the Oil of the fish, or other animals in the same manner. Their baskets are formed of Cedar bark and bargrass So closely interwoven withe hands or fingers that they are watertight without the aid of gum or rozin; Some of those are highly ornimented with the Strans of bargrass which they dye of Several Colours and interweave in a great variety of figures; this Serves a double purpose of holding the Water or wareing on their heads; and are of different capacities, from that of a Smallest cup to five or Six gallons, they are generally of a Conic form or reather the Segment of a Cone of which the Smaller end forms the base or bottom of the basket. these they make verry expediciously and dispose of for a mear trifle. it is for the construction of those baskets that Bargrass becoms an article of traffic among the nativs of the Columbia. this grass grows only on their mountains near the Snowey region; the blade is about 3/8 of an inch wide and 2 feet long Smothe plient and strong; the young blades which are white from not being exposed to the Sun or air, are those which are most Commonly employ'd, particularly in their neatest work. Their wooden Spoons are not remarkable nor abundant, they are large &amp; the bowls broad. their meat is roasted with a Sharp Scure, one end of which is incerted in the meat while' the other is Set erect in the ground. The Spit for roasting fish has its upper extremity Split, and between its limbs the Center of the fish is incerted with its head downwards, and the tale and the extremities of the Scure Secured with a String, the Side[s] of the fish. which was in the first instance Split in the back, are expanded by means of Small Splinters of wood which extend Crosswise the fish, a Small mat of rushes or flags is the usual plate, or Dish on which their fish, flesh, roots &amp; berries are served, they make a number of Bags and Baskets not water tight of Cedar bark Silk Grass, rushes, flags, and common corse Sedge, in those they Secure their dried fish, roots berries &amp;c. [Lewis:] Sunday (Saturday) January 18th. 1806. Two of the Clatsops who were here yesterday returned today for a dog they had left; they remained with us a few hours and departed. no further occurrence worthy of relation took place. the men are still much engaged in dressing skins in order to cloath themselves and prepare for our homeward journey. The Clatsops Chinnooks &amp;c construct their houses of timber altogether. they are from 14 to 20 feet wide and from 20 to 60 feet in length, and acommodate one or more families sometimes three or four families reside in the same room. thes[e] houses a[re] also divided by a partition of boards, but this happens only in the largest houses as the rooms are always large compared with the number of inhabitants. these houses are constructed in the following manner; two or more posts of split timber agreeably to the number of divisions or partitions are furst provided, these are sunk in the ground at one end and rise perpendicularly to the hight of 14 or 18 feet, the tops of them are hollowed in such manner as to receive the ends of a round beam of timber which reaches from one to the other, most commonly the whole length of the building, and forming the upper part of the roof; two other sets of posts and poles are now placed at proper distances on either side of the first, formed in a similar manner and parrallel to it; these last rise to the intended hight of the eves, which is usually about 5 feet. smaller sticks of timber are now provided and are placed by pares in the form of rafters, resting on, and reaching from the lower to the upper horizontal beam, to both of which they are attatched at either end with the cedar bark; two or three ranges of small poles are now placed horizontally on these rafters on each side of the roof and are secured likewise with strings of the Cedar bark. the ends sides and partitions are then formed with one range of wide boards of ab[o]ut two inches thick, which are sunk in the ground a small distance at their lower ends and stand erect with their upper ends laping on the outside of the eve poles and end rafters to which they are secured by an outer pole lying parallel with the eve poles and rafters being secured to them by chords of cedar bark which pass through wholes made in the boards at certain distances for that purpose; the rough [roof] is then covered with a double range of thin boards, and an aperture of 2 by 3 feet is left in the center of the roof to permit the smoke to pass. these houses are sometimes sunk to the debth of 4 or 5 feet in which cace the eve of the house comes nearly to the surface of the earth. in the center of each room a space of six by eight feet square is sunk about twelve inches lower than the floor having it's sides secured with four sticks of squar timber, in this space they make their fire, their fuel being generally pine bark. mats are spread arround the fire on all sides, on these they set in the day and frequently sleep at night. on the inner side of the ho[u]se on two sides and sometimes on three, there is a range of upright peices about 4 feet removed from the wall; these are also sunk in the ground at their lower ends, and secured at top to the rafters, from these other peices ar extended horizontally to the wall and are secured in the usual method by bark to the upright peices which support the eve poles. on these short horizontal pieces of which there are sometimes two ranges one above the other, boards are laid, which either form ther beads, or shelves on which to put their goods and chattles of almost every discription. their uncured fish is hung on sticks in the smoke of their fires as is also the flesh of the Elk when they happen to be fortunate enough to procure it which is but seldom. [Clark:] Monday [Saturday]18th. January 1806 Two of the Clatsops that were here yesterday returned to day for a Dog they had left; they remained with us a fiew hours and departed. no further accounts worthey of relation took place. the men are much engaged dressing Skins in order to Cloath themselves and prepare for the homeward journey. The Clatsops Chinnooks &amp;c. construct their Houses of timber altogether. they are from 14 to 20 feet wide, and from 20 to 60 feet in length, and accomodate one or more families sometimes three or four families reside in the Same room. this house is also devided by petitions of Boards, but this happens only in the largest houses, as the rooms are always large compared with the number of inhabitents. those houses are constructed in the following manner; two or more posts of Split timber agreeably to the number of devisions or partitions are first provided, these are Sunk in the ground at one end and raised pirpindicular to the hight of 12 or 14 feet, the top of them are hollowed So as to recive the end of a round beem of timber which reaches from one to the other or the entire length of the house; and forming the ridge pole; two other Sets of posts and poles are then placed at proper distancies on either Side of the first, formed in a Similar manner and parrelal to it; those last rise to the intended hight of the eves, which is usially about 5 feet, Smaller Sticks of timber is then previded and are placed by pears in the form of rafters, resting on, and reaching from the lower to the upper horizontial beam, to both of which they are atached at either end with the Cedar bark; two or 3 ranges of Small poles are then placed Horizontially on these rafters on each Side of the roof &amp; are Secured likewise with Cedar bark. the ends, sides, and partitions are then formed, with one range of wide boards of about 2 inches thick, which are Sunk in the ground a Small distance at their lower ends &amp; stands erect with their upper ends lapping on the out side of the eve poles and end rafters to which they are secured by a outerpole lyeing parrelal with the eve pole and rafters being Secured to them by cords of Cedar bark which pass through wholes made in the bods at certain distances for that purpose; the rough [roof] is then Covered with a double range of thin boards, and an aperture of 2 by 3 feet left in the center of the roof to admit the Smoke to pass. These houses are commonly Sunk to the debth of 4 or 5 feet in which case the eve of the house comes nearly to the surface of the earth. in the center of each room a Space of from 6 by 8 feet is Sunk about 12 inches lower than the floar haveing its Sides Secured by four thick boards or Squar pieces of timber, in this Space they make their fire, their fuel being generally dry pine Split Small which they perform with a peice of an Elks horn Sharpened at one end drove into the wood with a Stone. Mats are Spred around the fire on all Sides, on these they Sit in the day and frequently Sleep at night, on the inner Side of the house on two Sides and Sometimes on three, there is a range of upright pieces about 4 feet removed from the wall; these are also Sunk in the ground a[t] their lower end, and Secured at top to the rafters, from those, other pieces are extended horozontially to the wall and are Secured in the usial manner with bark to the upright pieces which Support the eve pole. on these Short horizontial peic[e]s of which there are Sometimes two ranges one above the other, boards are laid, which either form their beads, or Shelves on which to put their goods and Chattles, of almost every discription. their uncured fish is hung on Sticks in the Smoke of their fires as is also the flesh of the Elk when they happen to be fortunate enough to precure it which is but seldom. [Lewis:] Monday (Sunday) January 19th. 1806. This morning sent out two parties of hunters, consisting of Collins and Willard whom we sent down the bay towards point Adams, and Labuish and Shannon whom we sent up Fort River;1 1 The Netul, or Lewis and Clark River.—Ed. the fi[r]st by land and the latter by water. we were visited today by two Clatsop men and a woman who brought for sale some Sea Otter skins of which we purchased one, giving in exchange the remainder of our blue beads consisting of 6 fathoms and about the same quantity of small white beads and a knife. we also purchased a small quantity of train oil for a pair of Brass armbands and a hat for some fishinghooks. these hats are of their own manufactory and are composed of Cedar bark and bear grass interwoven with the fingers and ornimented with various colours and figures, they are nearly waterproof, light, and I am convinced are much more durable than either chip or straw. These hats form a small article of traffic with the Clatsops and Chinnooks who dispose of them to the whites. the form of the hat is that which was in vogue in the Ued. States and great Britain in the years 1800 &amp; 1801 with a high crown reather larger at the top than where it joins the brim; the brim narrow or about 2 or 2 ? inches. Several families of these people usually reside together in the same room; they appear to be the father &amp; mother and their sons with their son's wives and children; their provision seems to be in common and the greatest harmoney appears to exist among them. The old man is not always rispected as the head of the family, that duty most commonly devolves on one of the young men. They have seldom more than one wife, yet the plurality of wives is not denied them by their customs. These families when ascociated form nations or bands of nations each acknowledging the authority of it's own chieftain who dose not appear to be heriditary, nor his power to extend further than a mear repremand for any improper act of an individual; the creation of a chief depends upon the upright deportment of the individual &amp; his ability and disposition to render service to the community; and his authority or the deference paid him is in exact equilibrio with the popularity or voluntary esteem he has acquired among the individuals of his band or nation. Their laws like those of all uncivilized Indians consist of a set of customs which have grown out of their local situations. not being able to speak their language we have not been able to inform ourselves of the existence of any peculiar customs among them. [Clark:] Tuesday [Sunday] 19th of January 1806 This morning Sent out two parties of hunters, one party towards Point adams and the other party up Ne tel River by water. We were visited to day by two Clatsop men and a woman who brought for Sale Some Sea Otter Skins of which we purchased one gave in exchange the remainder of our blue beeds Consisting of 6 fathoms, and the same quantity of small white beids and a knife. we also purchased a Small quantity of train oil for a par of Brass arm bands, and a hat for Some fishinghooks. these hats are of their own manufactory and are composed of Cedar bark and bear grass interwoven with the fingers and ornimented with various colours and figures, they are nearly water proof, light, and I am Convinced are much more dureable than either Chip or Straw, These hats form a article of traffic with Clatsops an[d] Chinnooks who dispose of them to the Whites, the form of the Hats is that which was in voge in the UStates and Great Britain in 1800 &amp; 1801 with a high crown rather larger at the top than where it joins the brim, the brim narrow about 2 or 2 ? inches.

Their Laws like all uncivilized Indians consist of a Set of customs which has grown out of their local Situations. Not being able to Speak their language we have not been able to inform ourselves of the existance of any peculiar customs among them. [Lewis:] Tuesday (Monday) January 20th. 1806. Visited this morning by three Clatsops who remained with us all day; the object of their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe. on the morning of the eighteenth we issued 6 lbs. of jirked Elk pr. man, this evening the Sergt. reported that it was all exhausted; the six lbs. have therefore lasted two days and a half only. at this rate our seven Elk will last us only 3 days longer, yet no one seems much concerned about the state of the stores; so much for habit. we have latterly so frequently had our stock of provisions reduced to a minimum and sometimes taken a small touch of fasting that three days full allowance excites no concern. In those cases our skill as hunters afford us some consolation, for if there is any game of any discription in our neighbourhood we can track it up and kill it. most of the party have become very expert with the rifle. The Indians who visited us today understood us sufficiently to inform us that the whites did not barter for the pounded fish; that it was purchased and consumed by the Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs and Skillutes. The native roots which furnish a considerable proportion of the subsistence of the indians in our neighbourhood are those of a species of Thistle, fern, and rush; the Liquorice, and a small celindric root the top of which I have not yet seen, this last resembles the sweet pittatoe very much in it's flavor and consistency. [Clark:] Wednesday [Monday] 20th. January 1806 Visited this morning by three Clapsots who remained with us all day; the object of their visit is mearly to Smoke the pipe. on the morning of the 18 inst. we issued 6lb. of jurked Meat pr. man, this evening the Serjt. reports that is all exhosted; the 6lb. have therefore lasted 2 days and a half only. at this rate our Seven Elk will only last us 3 days longer, yet no one appears much concerned about the State of the Stores; So much for habet. we have latterly so frequently had our Stock of provisions reduced to a Minimum and Sometimes taken a Small tuch of fasting that 3 days full allowance exites no concern. In those cases our Skill as hunters affords us some consolation, for if there is any game of any description in our neighbourhood we can track it up and kill it.

The native roots which furnish a considerable proportion of the Subsistance of the indians in our neighbourhood are those of a Species of Thistle, fern, and rush; the Licquorice, and a Small celindric root the top of which I have not yet Seen, this last resembles the Sweet potato verry Much in its flavour and Consistency.
