      <field name="heading_text">PAUL PRESCOTT'S CHARGE. I. SQUIRE NEWCOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"HANNAH!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty. He was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, and looked as if it would be quite impossible to deviate from his position of unbending rigidity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Squire Benjamin Newcome, as he was called, in the right of his position as Justice of the Peace, Chairman of the Selectmen, and wealthiest resident of Wrenville, was a man of rule and measure. He was measured in his walk, measured in his utterance, and measured in all his transactions. He might be called a dignified machine. He had a very exalted conception of his own position, and the respect which he felt to be his due, not only from his own household, but from all who approached him. If the President of the United States had called upon him, Squire Newcome would very probably have felt that he himself was the party who conferred distinction, and not received it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Squire Newcome was a widower. His wife, who was as different from himself as could well be conceived, did not live long after marriage. She was chilled to death, as it was thought, by the dignified iceberg of whose establishment she had become a part. She had left, however, a child, who had now grown to be a boy of twelve. This boy was a thorn in the side of his father, who had endeavored in vain to mould him according to his idea of propriety. But Ben was gifted with a spirit of fun, sometimes running into mischief, which was constantly bursting out in new directions, in spite of his father's numerous and rather prosy lectures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Han-nah!" again called Squire Newcome, separating the two syllables by a pause of deliberation, and strongly accenting the last syllable,—a habit of his with all proper names.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah was the Irish servant of all work, who was just then engaged in mixing up bread in the room adjoining, which was the kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Feeling a natural reluctance to appear before her employer with her hands covered with dough, she hastily washed them. All this, however, took time, and before she responded to the first summons, the second "Han-nah!" delivered with a little sharp emphasis, had been uttered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length she appeared at the door of the sitting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Han-nah!" said Squire Newcome, fixing his cold gray eye upon her, "when you hear my voice a calling you, it is your duty to answer the summons immejiately ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have endeavored to represent the Squire's pronunciation of the last word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I would have come immejously ," said Hannah, displaying a most reprehensible ignorance, "but me hands were all covered with flour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That makes no difference," interrupted the Squire. "Flour is an accidental circumstance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" thought Hannah, opening her eyes in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And should not be allowed to interpose an obstacle to an immejiate answer to my summons."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir," said Hannah, who guessed at the meaning though she did not understand the words, "you wouldn't have me dirty the door-handle with me doughy hands?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That could easily be remedied by ablution."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain't any ablution in the house," said the mystified Hannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean," Squire Newcome condescended to explain, "the application of water—in short, washing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shure," said Hannah, as light broke in upon her mind, "I never knew that was what they called it before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Ben-ja-min at home?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. He was out playin' in the yard a minute ago. I guess you can see him from the winder."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying she stepped forward, and looking out, all at once gave a shrill scream, and rushed from the room, leaving her employer in his bolt-upright attitude gazing after her with as much astonishment as he was capable of.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cause of her sudden exit was revealed on looking out of the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Master Benjamin, or Ben, as he was called everywhere except in his own family, had got possession of the black kitten, and appeared to be submerging her in the hogshead of rainwater.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, you wicked, cruel boy, to drown poor Kitty!" exclaimed the indignant Hannah, rushing into the yard and endeavoring to snatch her feline favorite—an attempt which Ben stoutly resisted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Doubtless the poor kitten would have fared badly between the two, had not the window opened, and the deliberate voice of his father, called out in tones which Ben saw fit to heed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come into my presence immejiately, and learn to answer me with more respect."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben came in looking half defiant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His father, whose perpendicularity made him look like a sitting grenadier, commenced the examination thus:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you to inform me what you was a doing of when I spoke to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be observed that the Squire's dignified utterances were sometimes a little at variance with the rule of the best modern grammarians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was trying to prevent Hannah from taking the kitten," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was you a doing of before Hannah went out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Playing with Kitty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why were you standing near the hogshead, Benjamin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why," said Ben, ingenuously, "the hogshead happened to be near me—that was all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you not trying to drown the kitten?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, I wouldn't drown her for anything," said Ben with an injured expression, mentally adding, "short of a three-cent piece."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, to repeat my interrogatory, what was you a doing of with the kitten in the hogshead?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was teaching her to swim," said Ben, looking out of the corner of his eye at his father, to see what impression this explanation made upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what advantageous result do you think would be brought about by teaching of the kitten to swim, Benjamin?" persisted his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Advantageous result!" repeated Ben, demurely, pretending not to understand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certingly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does that mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you not study your dictionary at school, Benjamin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but I don't like it much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very much in error. You will never learn to employ your tongue with elegance and precision, unless you engage in this beneficial study."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can use my tongue well enough, without studying grammar," said Ben. He proceeded to illustrate the truth of this assertion by twisting his tongue about in a comical manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tongue," exclaimed his father, "is but another name for language I mean your native language."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben was about to leave the room to avoid further questions of an embarrassing nature, when his father interrupted his exit by saying—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stay, Benjamin, do not withdraw till I have made all the inquiries which I intend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy unwillingly returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have not answered my question."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've forgotten what it was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What good would it do?" asked the Squire, simplifying his speech to reach Ben's comprehension, "what good would it do to teach the kitten to swim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, I thought," said Ben, hesitating, "that some time or other she might happen to fall into the water, and might not be able to get out unless she knew how."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think," said his father with an unusual display of sagacity, "that she will be in much greater hazard of drowning while learning to swim under your direction than by any other chance likely to befall her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shouldn't wonder," was Ben's mental comment, "Pretty cute for you, dad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fortunately, Ben did not express his thoughts aloud. They would have implied such an utter lack of respect that the Squire would have been quite overwhelmed by the reflection that his impressive manners had produced no greater effect on one who had so excellent a chance of being impressed by them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Benjamin," concluded his father, "I have an errand for you to execute. You may go to Mr. Prescott's and see if he is yet living. I hear that he is a lying on the brink of the grave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An expression of sadness stole over the usually merry face of Ben, as he started on his errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor Paul!" he thought, "what will he do when his father dies? He's such a capital fellow, too. I just wish I had a wagon load of money, I do, and I'd give him half. That's so!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">II. PAUL PRESCOTT'S HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WE will precede Ben on his visit to the house of Mr. Prescott.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was an old weather-beaten house, of one story, about half a mile distant from 'Squire Newcome's residence. The Prescott family had lived here for five years, or ever since they had removed to Wrenville. Until within a year they had lived comfortably, when two blows came in quick succession. The first was the death of Mrs. Prescott, an excellent woman, whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son. Soon afterwards Mr. Prescott, a carpenter by trade, while at work upon the roof of a high building, fell off, and not only broke his leg badly, but suffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature. He had not been able to do a stroke of work since. After some months it became evident that he would never recover. A year had now passed. During this time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had succeeded in laying up previous to his sickness. It was clear that at his death there would be nothing left. At thirteen years of age Paul would have to begin the world without a penny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen. Paul, a thoughtful-looking boy sat beside it, ready to answer his call.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There had been silence for some time, when Mr. Prescott called feebly—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am here, father," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am almost gone, Paul, I don't think I shall last through the day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, father," said Paul, sorrowfully, "Don't leave me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is the only grief I have in dying—I must leave you to struggle for yourself, Paul. I shall be able to leave you absolutely nothing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't think of that, father. I am young and strong—I can earn my living in some way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hoped to live long enough to give you an education. I wanted you to have a fairer start in the world than I had."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, father," said Paul, soothingly, "Don't be uneasy about me. God will provide for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again there was a silence, broken only by the difficult breathing of the sick man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He spoke again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is one thing, Paul, that I want to tell you before I die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul drew closer to the bedside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is something which has troubled me as I lay here. I shall feel easier for speaking of it. You remember that we lived at Cedarville before we came here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About two years before we left there, a promising speculation was brought to my notice. An agent of a Lake Superior mine visited our village and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of my neighbors bought shares, fully expecting to double their money in a year. Among the rest I was attacked with the fever of speculation. I had always been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation, and had not been able to do much more than support my family. This it seemed to me, afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something which might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of sickness. I had but about two hundred dollars, however, and from so scanty an investment I could not, of course, expect a large return; accordingly I went to Squire Conant; you remember him, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`I went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars. After some hesitation he agreed to lend it to me. He was fond of his money and not much given to lending, but it so happened that he had invested in the same speculation, and had a high opinion of it, so he felt pretty safe in advancing me the money. Well, this loan gave me seven hundred dollars, with which I purchased seven shares in the Lake Superior Grand Combination Mining Company. For some months afterwards, I felt like a rich man. I carefully put away my certificate of stock, looking upon it as the beginning of a competence. But at the end of six months the bubble burst—the stock proved to be utterly worthless,—Squire Conant lost five thousand dollars. I lost seven hundred, five hundred being borrowed money. The Squire's loss was much larger, but mine was the more serious, since I lost everything and was plunged into debt, while he had at least forty thousand dollars left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two days after the explosion, Squire Conant came into my shop and asked abruptly when I could pay him the amount I had borrowed. I told him that I could not fix a time. I said that I had been overwhelmed by a result so contrary to my anticipations, but I told him I would not rest till I had done something to satisfy his claim. He was always an unreasonable man, and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless speculation, as if I could foresee how it would end any better than he."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you ever been able to pay back any part of the five hundred dollars, father?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have paid the interest regularly, and a year ago, just before I met with my accident, I had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which I had intended to pay the Squire, but when my sickness came I felt obliged to retain it to defray our expenses, being cut off from earning anything"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you heard from the Squire lately?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I had a letter only last week. You remember bringing me one postmarked Cedarville?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I wondered at the time who it could be from."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will find it on the mantelpiece. I should like to have you get it and read it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul readily found the letter. It was enclosed in a brown envelope, directed in a bold hand to "Mr. John Prescott, Wrenville."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The letter was as follows:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CEDARVILLE, APRIL 15, 18—, MR. JOHN PRESCOTT:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIR: I have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five hundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me, on account of a loan which I was fool enough to make you seven years since. I thought you an honest man, but I have found, to my cost, that I was mistaken. For the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated between us. Your intention is evident. I quite understand that you have made up your mind to defraud me of what is rightfully mine. I don't know how you may regard this, but I consider it as bad as highway robbery. I do not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the Penitentiary. Let me advise you, if you wish to avoid further trouble, to make no delay in paying a portion of this debt. Yours, etc. EZEKIEL CONANT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does Squire Conant know that you are sick, father?" he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I wrote him about my accident, telling him at the same time that I regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must occasion in my payments."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And knowing this, he wrote such a letter as that," said Paul, indignantly, "what a hard, unfeeling wretch he must be!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose it is vexatious to him to be kept out of his money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he has plenty more. He would never miss it if he had given it to you outright."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is not the way to look at it, Paul. The money is justly his, and it is a great sorrow to me that I must die without paying it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Father," said Paul, after a pause, "will it be any relief to you, if I promise to pay it,— that is, if I am ever able?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Prescott's face brightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was what I wanted to ask you, Paul. It will be a comfort to me to feel thar there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then don't let it trouble you any longer, father. The debt shall be mine, and I will pay it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again a shadow passed over the sick man's face, "Poor boy," he said, "why should I burden your young life with such a load? You wil have to struggle hard enough as it is. No, Paul, recall your promise. I don't want to purchase comfort at such a price."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, father," said Paul sturdily, "it is too late now. I have made the promise and I mean to stick to it. Besides, it will give me something to live for. I am young—I may have a great many years before me. For thirteen years you have supported me. It is only right that I should make what return I can. I'll keep my promise, father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May God help and prosper you, my boy," said Mr. Prescott, solemnly. "You've been a good son; I pray that you may grow up to be a good man. But, my dear, I feel tired. I think I will try to go to sleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul smoothed the comforter, adjusting it carefully about his father's neck, and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place upon the fire. Their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted, and Paul was obliged to go into the woods near by, to obtain such loose fagots as he might find upon the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a whistle. Looking up he discovered Ben Newcome approaching him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well, Ben."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How precious lonesome you must be, mewed up in the house all the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it is lonesome, but I wouldn't mind that if I thought father would ever get any better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How is he this morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty low; I expect he is asleep. He said he was tired just before I went out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I brought over something for you," said Ben, tugging away at his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I found 'em in the closet," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't Hannah make a precious row when she finds 'em gone?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I don't know as I ought to take them," said Paul, though, to tell the truth, they looked tempting to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, nonsense," said Ben; "they don't belong to Hannah. She only likes to scold a little; it does her good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys sat on the doorstep and talked while Paul ate the turnovers. Ben watched the process with much satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't they prime?" he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"First rate," said Paul; `won't you have one?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Ben; "you see I thought while I was about it I might as well take four, so I ate two coming along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In about fifteen minutes Paul went into the house to look at his father. He was lying very quietly upon the bed. Paul drew near and looked at him more closely. There was something in the expression of his father's face which terrified him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben heard his sudden cry of dismay, and hurriedly entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul pointed to the bed, and said briefly, "Father's dead!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben, who in spite of his mischievous propensities was gifted with a warm heart, sat down beside Paul, and passing his arm round his neck, gave him that silent sympathy which is always so grateful to the grief-stricken heart.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">III. PAUL'S BRILLIANT PROSPECTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two days later, the funeral of Mr. Prescott took place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Paul! It seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow. His father and mother both gone, he felt that he was indeed left alone in the world. No thought of the future had yet entered his mind. He was wholly occupied with his present sorrow. Desolate at heart he slipped away from the graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over, and took his way back again to the lonely dwelling which he had called home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he was sitting in the corner, plunged in sorrowful thought, there was a scraping heard at the door, and a loud hem!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking up, Paul saw entering the cottage the stiff form of Squire Benjamin Newcome, who, as has already been stated, was the owner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul," said the Squire, with measured deliberation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean me, sir?" asked Paul, vaguely conscious that his name had been called.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did I not address you by your baptismal appellation?" demanded the Squire, who thought the boy's question superfluous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul," pursued Squire Newcome, "have you thought of your future destination?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Paul, "I suppose I shall live here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That arrangement would not be consistent with propriety. I suppose you are aware that your deceased parent left little or no worldly goods."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know he was poor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Therefore it has been thought best that you should be placed in charge of a worthy man, who I see is now approaching the house. You will therefore accompany him without resistance. If you obey him and read the Bible regularly, you will—ahem!—you will some time or other see the advantage of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this consolatory remark Squire Newcome wheeled about and strode out of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Immediately afterwards there entered a rough-looking man arrayed in a farmer's blue frock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're to come with me, youngster," said Mr. Nicholas Mudge, for that was his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With you?" said Paul, recoiling instinctively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fact there was nothing attractive in the appearance or manners of Mr. Mudge. He had a coarse hard face, while his head was surmounted by a shock of red hair, which to all appearance had suffered little interference from the comb for a time which the observer would scarcely venture to compute. There was such an utter absence of refinement about the man, that Paul, who had been accustomed to the gentle manners of his father, was repelled by the contrast which this man exhibited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure you're to go with me," said Mr. Mudge. "You did not calc'late you was a goin' to stay here by yourself, did you? We've got a better place for you than that. But the wagon's waitin' outside, so just be lively and bundle in, and I'll carry you to where you're a goin' to live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, some folks call it the Poor House, but it ain't any the worse for that, I expect. Anyhow, them as has no money may feel themselves lucky to get so good a home. So jest be a movin', for I can't be a waitin' here all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul quietly submitted himself to the guidance of Mr. Mudge. He was so occupied with the thought of his sad loss that he did not realize the change that was about to take place in his circumstances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About half a mile from the village in the bleakest and most desolate part of the town, stood the Poor House. It was a crazy old building of extreme antiquity, which, being no longer considered fit for an ordinary dwelling-house, had been selected as a suitable residence for the town's poor. It was bleak and comfortless to be sure, but on that very account had been purchased at a trifling expense, and that was, of course, a primary consideration. Connected with the house were some dozen acres of rough-looking land, plentifully over-spread with stones, which might have filled with despair the most enterprising agriculturist. However, it had this recommendation at least, that it was quite in character with the buildings upon it, which in addition to the house already described, consisted of a barn of equal antiquity and a pig pen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This magnificent domain was under the superintendence of Mr. Nicholas Mudge, who in consideration of taking charge of the town paupers had the use of the farm and buildings, rent free, together with a stipulated weekly sum for each of the inmates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Paul," said Mr. Mudge, as they approached the house, in a tone which was meant to be encouraging, "this is goin' to be your home. How do you like it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus addressed, Paul ventured a glance around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`I don't know," said he, doubtfully; "it don't look very pleasant."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't look very pleasant!" repeated Mr. Mudge in a tone of mingled amazement and indignation. "Well, there's gratitude for you. After the town has been at the expense of providin' a nice, comfortable home for you, because you haven't got any of your own, you must turn up your nose at it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean to complain," said Paul, feeling very little interest in the matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you expected to live in a marble palace," pursued Mr. Mudge, in an injured tone. "We don't have any marble palaces in this neighborhood, we don't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul disclaimed any such anticipation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge deigned to accept Paul's apology, and as they had now reached the door, unceremoniously threw it open, and led the way into a room with floor unpainted, which, to judge from its appearance, was used as a kitchen.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">IV. LIFE IN A NEW PHASE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EVERYTHING was "at sixes and sevens," as the saying is, in the room Mr. Mudge and Paul had just entered. In the midst of the scene was a large stout woman, in a faded calico dress, and sleeves rolled up, working as if her life or the world's destiny depended upon it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was evident from the first words of Mr. Mudge that this lady was his helpmeet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, wife," he said, "I've brought you another boarder. You must try to make him as happy and contented as the rest of 'em are."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the tone of the speaker, the last words might be understood to be jocular.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge, whose style of beauty was not improved by a decided squint, fixed a scrutinizing gaze upon Paul, and he quite naturally returned it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Haven't you ever seen anybody before, boy? I guess you'll know me next time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shouldn't wonder if he did," chuckled Mr. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know where on earth we shall put him," remarked the lady. "We're full now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, put him anywhere. I suppose you won't be very particular about your accommodations?" said Mr. Mudge turning to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul very innocently answered in the negative, thereby affording Mr. Mudge not a little amusement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's lucky," he said, "because our best front chamber's occupied just now. We'd have got it ready for you if you'd only wrote a week ago to tell us you were coming. You can just stay round here," he said in a different tone as he was about leaving the room, "Mrs. Mudge will maybe want you to do something for her. You can sit down till she calls on you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was washing day with Mrs. Mudge, and of course she was extremely busy. The water was to be brought from a well in the yard, and to this office Paul was at once delegated. It was no easy task, the full pails tugging most unmercifully at his arms. However, this was soon over, and Mrs. Mudge graciously gave him permission to go into the adjoining room, and make acquaintance with his fellow-boarders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were nine of them in all, Paul, the new-comer making the tenth. They were all advanced in years, except one young woman, who was prevented by mental aberration from supporting herself outside the walls of the Institution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all present, Paul's attention was most strongly attracted towards one who appeared more neatly and scrupulously attired than any of the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy Lee, or plain Aunt Lucy, for in her present abode she had small use for her last name, was a benevolent-looking old lady, who both in dress and manners was distinguished from her companions. She rose from her knitting, and kindly took Paul by the hand. Children are instinctive readers of character, and Paul, after one glance at her benevolent face, seated himself contentedly beside her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose," said the old lady, socially, "you've come to live with us. We must do all we can to make you comfortable. Your name is Paul Prescott, I think Mrs. Mudge said."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am" answered Paul, watching the rapid movement of the old lady's fingers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mine is Aunt Lucy," she continued, "that is what everybody calls me. So now we know each other, and shall soon be good friends, I hope. I suppose you have hardly been here long enough to tell how you shall like it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul confessed that thus far he did not find it very pleasant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I dare say not," said Aunt Lucy, "I can't say I think it looks very attractive myself. However, it isn't wholly the fault of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge. They can't afford to do much better, for the town allows them very little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy's remarks were here interrupted by the apparition of the worthy landlady at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinner's ready, folks," said that lady, with little ceremony, "and you must come out quick if you want any, for I'm drove with work, and can't be hindered long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The summons was obeyed with alacrity, and the company made all haste to the dining-room, or rather the kitchen, for it was here that the meals were eaten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the center of the room was set a table without a cloth, a table-cloth being considered a luxury quite superfluous. Upon this were placed several bowls of thin, watery liquid, intended for soup, but which, like city milk, was diluted so as hardly to be distinguishable. Beside each bowl was a slice of bread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such was the bill of fare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, folks, the sooner you fall to the better," exclaimed the energetic Mrs. Mudge, who was one of those driving characters, who consider any time spent at the table beyond ten minutes as so much time wasted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The present company appeared to need no second invitation. Their scanty diet had the positive advantage of giving them a good appetite; otherwise the quality of their food might have daunted them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul took his place beside Aunt Lucy. Mechanically he did as the rest, carrying to his mouth a spoonful of the liquid. But his appetite was not sufficiently accustomed to Poor House regime to enable him to relish its standing dish, and he laid down his spoon with a disappointed look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He next attacked the crust of bread, but found it too dry to be palatable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please, ma'am," said he to Mrs. Mudge, "I should like some butter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's companions dropped their spoons in astonishment at his daring, and Mrs. Mudge let fall a kettle she was removing from the fire, in sheer amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you ask for?" she inquired, as if to make sure that her ears did not deceive her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little butter," repeated Paul, unconscious of the great presumption of which he had been guilty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You want butter, do you?" repeated Mr. Mudge. "Perhaps you'd like a slice of beef-steak and a piece of plum-pudding too, wouldn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should very much," said Paul, resolved to tell the truth, although he now began to perceive the sarcasm in his landlady's tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't anything more you would like, is there?" inquired the lady, with mock politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, ma'am," returned Paul after a pause, "I believe not, to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very moderate, upon my word," exclaimed Mrs. Mudge, giving vent at length to her pent-up indignation. "You'll be contented with butter and roast beef and plum-pudding! A mighty fine gentleman, to be sure. But you won't get them here, I'll be bound."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So will I," thought Aunt Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you ain't satisfied with what I give you," pursued Mrs. Mudge, "you'd better go somewhere else. You can put up at some of the great hotels. Butter, forsooth!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having thus given expression to her feelings, she left the room, and Paul was left to finish his dinner with the best appetite he could command. He was conscious that he had offended Mrs. Mudge, but the thoughts of his recent great sorrow swallowed up all minor annoyances, so that the words of his estimable landlady were forgotten almost as soon as they were uttered. He felt that he must henceforth look for far different treatment from that to which he had been accustomed during his father's lifetime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His thoughts were interrupted in a manner somewhat ludicrous, by the crazy girl who sat next to him coolly appropriating to herself his bowl of soup, having already disposed of her own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look," said Aunt Lucy, quickly, calling Paul's attention, "you are losing your dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," said Paul, amused in spite of his sadness, "she is quite welcome to it if she likes it; I can't eat it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So the dinner began and ended. It was very brief and simple, occupying less than ten minutes, and comprising only one course— unless the soup was considered the first course, and the bread the second. Paul left the table as hungry as he came to it. Aunt Lucy's appetite had become accustomed to the Mudge diet, and she wisely ate what was set before her, knowing that there was no hope of anything better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About an hour after dinner Ben Newcome came to the door of the Poor House and inquired for Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was in one of her crusty moods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't see him," said she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not?" said Ben, resolutely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because he's busy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better let me see him," said Ben, sturdily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to know what's going to happen if I don't," said Mrs. Mudge, with wrathful eyes, and arms akimbo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall go home and report to my father," said Ben, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is your father?" asked Mrs. Mudge, for she did not recognize her visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father's name is Newcome—Squire Newcome, some call him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it so happened that Squire Newcome was Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor, and in that capacity might remove Mr. Mudge from office if he pleased. Accordingly Mrs. Mudge softened down at once, on learning that Ben was his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh," said she, "I didn't know who it was. I thought it might be some idle boy from the village who would only take Paul from his work, but if you have a message from your father—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This she said to ascertain whether he really had any message or not, but Ben, who had in fact come without his father's knowledge, only bowed, and said, in a patronizing manner, "I accept your apology, Mrs. Mudge. Will you have the goodness to send Paul out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you step in?" asked Mrs. Mudge with unusual politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I believe not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was accordingly sent out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was very glad to meet his schoolmate and playfellow, Ben, who by his gayety, spiced though it was with roguery, had made himself a general favorite in school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, Paul," said Ben, "I'm sorry to find you in such a place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't very pleasant," said Paul, rather soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that woman—Mrs. Mudge—she looks as if she might be a regular spitfire, isn't she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I only wish the old gentleman—meaning of course, the Squire—would take you to live with me. I want a fellow to play with. But I say, Paul, go and get your hat, and we'll go out for a walk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what Mrs. Mudge will say," said Paul, who had just come from turning the handle of a churn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just call Mrs. Mudge, and I'll manage it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge being summoned, made her appearance at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I presume, ma'am," said Ben, confidently, "you will have no objection to Paul's taking a walk with me while I deliver the message I am entrusted with."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly," said Mrs. Mudge, rather unwillingly, but not venturing to refuse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It takes me to come it over the old lady," said Ben, when they were out of hearing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, we'll go a fishing."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">V. A CRISIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BEFORE sunrise the next morning Paul was awakened by a rude shake from Mr. Mudge, with an intimation that he had better get up, as there was plenty of work before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the light of the lantern, for as yet it was too dark to dispense with it, Paul dressed himself. Awakened from a sound sleep, he hardly had time to collect his thoughts, and it was with a look of bewilderment that he surveyed the scene about him. As Mrs. Mudge had said, they were pretty full already, and accordingly a rude pallet had been spread for him in the attic, of which, with the exception of nocturnal marauders, he was the only occupant. Paul had not, to be sure, been used to very superior accommodations, and if the bed had not been quite so hard, he would have got along very well. As it was he was separated from slats only by a thin straw bed which did not improve matters much. It was therefore with a sense of weariness which slumber had not dissipated, that Paul arose at the summons of Mr. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he reached the kitchen, he found that gentleman waiting for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know how to milk?" was his first salutation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never learned," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you'll have to, in double-quick time," was the reply, "for I don't relish getting up so early, and you can take it off my hands."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two proceeded to the barn, where Paul received his first lesson in this important branch of education.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge kept five cows. One might have thought he could have afforded a moderate supply of milk to his boarders, but all, with the exception of a single quart, was sold to the milkman who passed the door every morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After breakfast, which was on the same economical plan with the dinner of the day previous, Paul was set to work planting potatoes, at which he was kept steadily employed till the dinner-hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Paul! his back ached dreadfully, for he had never before done any harder work than trifling services for his father. But the inexorable Mr. Mudge was in sight, and however much he wished, he did not dare to lay aside his hoe even for a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Twelve o'clock found him standing beside the dinner-table. He ate more heartily than before, for his forenoon's labor made even poorhouse fare palatable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge observed the change, and remarked in a satisfied tone. "Well, my fine gentleman, I see you are coming to your appetite. I thought you wouldn't hold out long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul, who had worn off something of his diffidence, could not help feeling indignant at this speech; unaccustomed to be addressed in this way, the taunt jarred upon his feelings, but he only bit his lip and preserved silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy, too, who had come to feel a strong interest in Paul, despite her natural mildness, could not resist the temptation of saying with some warmth, "what's the use of persecuting the child? He has sorrows enough of his own without your adding to them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was not a little incensed at this remonstrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to know, ma'am, who requested you to put in your oar!" she said with arms akimbo. "Anybody wouldn't think from your lofty airs that you lived in the poorhouse; I'll thank you to mind your own business in future, and not meddle with what don't concern you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy was wise enough to abstain from provoking further the wrath of her amiable landlady, and continued to eat her soup in silence. But Mrs. Mudge never forgot this interference, nor the cause of it, and henceforth with the malignity of a narrow-minded and spiteful woman, did what she could to make Paul uncomfortable. Her fertile ingenuity always found some new taunt, or some new reproach, to assail him with. But Paul, though at first he felt indignant, learned at last to treat them as they deserved, with silent disdain. Assured of the sympathy of those around him, he did not allow his appetite to be spoiled by any remark which Mrs. Mudge might offer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This, of course, only provoked her the more, and she strove to have his daily tasks increased, in the amiable hope that his " proud spirit " might be tamed thereby. Mr. Mudge, who was somewhat under petticoat government, readily acceded to his wife's wishes, and henceforth Paul's strength was taxed to its utmost limit. He was required to be up with the first gray tint of dawn and attend to the cattle. From this time until night, except the brief time devoted to his meals, he was incessantly occupied. Aunt Lucy's society, his chief comfort, was thus taken from him; since, in order to rise early, he was obliged to go to bed as soon as possible after his day's work was finished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The effects of such incessant labor without a sufficient supply of nourishing food, may easily be imagined. The dry bread and meager soup which constituted the chief articles of diet in Mrs. Mudge's economical household, had but one recommendation,—they were effectual preventives of gluttony. It was reported that on one occasion a beggar, apparently famishing with hunger, not knowing the character of the house, made application at the door for food. In an unusual fit of generosity, Mrs. Mudge furnished him with a slice of bread and a bowl of soup, which, however, proved so far from tempting that the beggar, hungry as he was, left them almost untouched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day, as Paul was working in the field at a little distance from Mr. Mudge, he became conscious of a peculiar feeling of giddiness which compelled him to cling to the hoe for support,—otherwise he must have fallen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" No laziness there," exclaimed Mr. Mudge, observing Paul's cessation from labor, " We can't support you in idleness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the boy paid no regard to this admonition, and Mr. Mudge, somewhat surprised, advanced toward him to enforce the command. Even he was startled at the unusual paleness of Paul's face, and inquired in a less peremptory tone, " what's the matter? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I feel sick,"gasped Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without another word, Mr. Mudge took Paul up in his arms and carried him into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" What's the matter, now? " asked his wife, meeting him at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" The boy feels a little sick, but I guess he'll get over it by-and-by. Haven't you got a little soup that you can give him? I reckon he's faint, and that'll brighten him up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul evidently did not think so, for he motioned away a bowl of the delightful mixture, though it was proffered him by the fair hands of Mrs. Mudge. That lady was somewhat surprised, and said, roughly, " I shouldn't wonder if he was only trying to shirk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was too much even for Mr. Mudge; " The boy's sick," said he, " that's plain enough; if he don't get better soon, I must send for the doctor, for work drives, and I can't spare him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" There's no more danger of his being sick than mine," said Mrs. Mudge, emphatically; "however, if you're fool enough to go for a doctor, that's none of my business. I've heard of feigning sickness before now, to get rid of work. As to his being pale, I've been as pale as that myself sometimes without your troubling yourself very much about me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" 'Twon't be any expense to us," alleged Mr. Mudge, in a tone of justification, for he felt in some awe of his wife's temper, which was none of the mildest when a little roused. " 'Twon't be any expense to us; the town has got to pay for it, and as long, as it will get him ready for work sooner, we might as well take advantage of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This consideration somewhat reconciled Mrs. Mudge to the step proposed, and as Paul, instead of getting, better, grew rapidly worse, Mr. Mudge thought it expedient to go immediately for the village physician. Luckily Dr. Townsend was at home, and an hour afterwards found him standing beside the sick boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I don't know hut you'll think it rather foolish our sending for you, doctor," said Mrs. Mudge, " but Mudge would have it that the boy was sick and so he went for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he did quite right," said Dr. Townsend, noticing the ghastly pallor of Paul's face. " He is a very sick boy, and if I had not been called I would not have answered for the consequences. How do you feel; my boy? " he inquired of Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I feel very weak, and my head swims," was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" How and when did this attack come on? " asked the doctor, turning to Mr. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" He was taken while hoeing in the field," was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Have you kept him at work much there lately? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Well, yes, I've been drove by work, and he has worked there all day latterly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" At what time has he gone to work in the morning? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" He has got up to milk the cows about five o'clock. I used to do it, but since he has learned, I have indulged myself a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" It would have been well for him if he had enjoyed the same privilege. It is my duty to speak plainly. The sickness of this boy lies at your door. He has never been accustomed to hard labor, and yet you have obliged him to rise earlier and work later than most men. No wonder he feels weak. Has he a good appetite? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, rather middlin'," said Mrs. Mudge, " but it's mainly because he's too dainty to eat w hat's set before him. Why, only the first day he was here he turned up his nose at the bread and soup we had for dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Is this a specimen of the soup? " asked Dr. Townsend taking from the table the bowl which had been proffered to Paul and declined by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without ceremony he raised to his lips a spoonful of the soup and tasted it with a wry face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Do you often have this soup on the table? " he asked abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We always have it once a day, and sometimes twice," returned Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you call the boy dainty because he don't relish such stuff as this? " said the doctor, with an indignation he did not attempt to conceal. "Why, I wouldn't be hired to take the contents of that bowl. It is as bad as any of my own medicines, and that's saying a good deal. How much nourishment do you suppose such a mixture would afford? And yet with little else to sustain him you have worked this boy like a beast of burden,—worse even, for they at least have abundance of good food."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. and Mrs. Mudge both winced under this plain speaking, but they did not dare to give expression to their anger, for they well knew that Dr. Townsend was an influential man in town, and, by representing the affair in the proper quarter, might render their hold upon their present post a very precarious one. Mr. Mudge therefore contented himself with muttering that he guessed he worked as hard as anybody, and he didn't complain of his fare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" May I ask you, Mr. Mudge," said the doctor, fixing his penetrating eye full upon him " whether you confine yourself to the food upon which you have kept this boy? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Well," said Mr. Mudge, in some confusion, moving uneasily in his seat, " I can't say but now and then I eat something a little different."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Do you eat at the same table with the inmates of your house? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Well, no," said the embarrassed Mr. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Tell me plainly,—how often do you partake of this soup ? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I ain't your patient," said the man, sullenly, "why should you want to know what I eat? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I have an object in view. Are you afraid to answer ? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I don't know as there's anything to be afraid of. The fact is, I ain't partial to soup; it don't agree with me, and so I don't take it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Did you ever consider that this might be the case with others as well as yourself? " inquired the doctor with a glance expressive of his contempt for Mr. Mudge's selfishness. Without waiting for a reply, Dr. Townsend ordered Paul to be put to bed immediately, after which he would leave some medicine for him to take.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">was another embarrassment for the worth y couple. They hardly knew where to put our hero. It would not do for them to carry him to his pallet in the attic, for they felt sure that this would lead to some more plain speaking on the part of Dr. Townsend. He was accordingly, though with reluctance, placed in a small bedroom upstairs, which, being more comfortable than those appropriated to the paupers, had been reserved for a son at work in a neighboring town, on his occasional visits home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Is there no one in the house who can sit in the chamber and attend to his occasional wants? " asked Dr. Townsend. "He will need to take his medicine at stated periods, and some one will be required to administer it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" There's Aunt Lucy Lee," said Mrs. Mudge, "she's taken a fancy to the boy, and I reckon she'll do as well as anybody."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" No one better," returned the doctor, who well knew Aunt Lucy's kindness of disposition and was satisfied that she would take all possible care of his patient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it was arranged that Aunt Lucy should take her place at Paul's bedside as his nurse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was sick for many days,—not dangerously so, but hard work and scanty fare had weakened him to such a degree that exhausted nature required time to recruit its wasted forces. But he was not unhappy or restless. Hour after hour he would lie patiently, and listen to the clicking of her knitting, needles. Though not provided with luxurious food, Dr. Townsend had spoken with so much plainness that Mrs. Mudge felt compelled to modify her treatment, lest, through his influence, she with her husband, might lose their situation. This forced forbearance, however, was far from warming her heart towards its object. Mrs. Mudge was a hard, practical woman, and her heart was so encrusted with worldliness and self-interest that she might as well have been without one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day, as Paul lay quietly gazing at Aunt Lucy's benevolent face, and mentally contrasting it with that of Mrs. Mudge, whose shrill voice could be heard from below, he was seized with a sudden desire to learn something of her past history.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" How long have you been here, Aunt Lucy?" he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked up from her knitting, and sighed as she answered, " A long and weary time to look back upon, Paul. I have been here ten years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Ten years," repeated Paul, thoughtfully, "and I am thirteen. So you have been here nearly all my lifetime. Has Mr. Mudge been here all that time? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Only the last two years. Before that we had Mrs. Perkins."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Did she treat you any better than Mrs. Mudge? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Any better than Mrs. Mudge!" vociferated that lady, who had ascended the stairs without being heard by Aunt Lucy or Paul, and had thus caught the last sentence. " Any better than Mrs. Mudge!" she repeated, thoroughly provoked. " So you've been talking about me, you trollop, have you? I'll come up with you, you may depend upon that. That's to pay for my giving you tea Sunday night, is it? Perhaps you'll get some more. It's pretty well in paupers conspiring together because they ain't treated like princes and princesses. Perhaps you'd like to got boarded with Queen Victoria."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old lady sat very quiet during this tirade. She had been the subject of similar invective before, and knew that it would do no good to oppose Mrs. Mudge in her present excited state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I don't wonder you haven't anything to say," said the infuriated dame. " I should think you'd want to hide your face in shame, you trollop."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was not quite so patient as his attendant. Her kindness had produced such an impression upon him, that Mrs. Mudge, by her taunts, stirred up his indignation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" She's no more of a trollop than you are," said he, with spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge wheeled round at this unexpected attack, and shook her fist menacingly at Paul-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" So you've put in your oar, you little jackanapes," said she, " if you're well enough to be impudent you're well enough to go to work. You ain't a goin' to lie here idle much longer, I can tell you. If you deceive Dr. Townsend, and make him believe you're sick, you can't deceive me. No doubt you feel mighty comfortable, lyin' here with nothin' to do, while I'm a slavin' myself to death downstairs, waitin' upon you; (this was a slight exaggeration, as Aunt Lucy took the entire charge of Paul, including the preparation of his food;) but you'd better make the most of it, for you won't lie here much longer. You'll miss not bein' able to talk about me, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge paused a moment as if expecting an answer to her highly sarcastic question, but Paul felt that no advantage would be gained by saying more. He was not naturally a quick-tempered boy, and had only been led to this little ebullition by the wanton attack of Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">lady, after standing a moment as if defying the twain to a further contest, went out, slamming the door violent] y after her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" You did wrong to provoke her, Paul," said Aunt Lucy, gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" How could I help it? " asked Paul, earnestly. "If she had only abused me, I should not have cared so much, but when she spoke about you, who have been so kind to me, I could not be silent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I thank you, Paul, for your kind feeling," said the old lady gently, " but we must learn to bear and forbear. The best of us have our faults and failings."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" What are yours, Aunt Lucy? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" O, a great many. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Such as what? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I am afraid I am sometimes discontented with the station which God has assigned me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I don't think you can be very much t blame for that. I should never learn to be contented here if I lived to the age of Methuselah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul lay quite still for an hour or more During that time he formed a determination which will be announced in the next chapter</field>
      <field name="heading_text">VI. PAUL'S DETERMINATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT the close of the last chapter it was stated that Paul had come to a determination. This was,—to runaway. That he had good reason for this we have already seen. He was now improving rapidly, and only waited till he was well enough to put his design into execution. "Aunt Lucy," said he one day, " I've got something to tell you." The old lady looked up inquiringly. " It's something I've been thinking of a long time,—at least most of the time since I've been sick. It isn't pleasant for me to stay here, and I've pretty much made up my mind that I shan't." " Where will you go? " asked the old lady dropping her work in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I don't know of any particular place, but I should be better off almost anywhere than here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" But you are so young, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" God will take care of me, Aunt Lucy,— mother used to tell me that. Besides, here I have no hope of learning anything or improving my condition. Then again, if I stay here, I can never do what father wished me to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that, Paul? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul told the story of his father's indebtedness to Squire Conant, and the cruel letter which the Squire had written.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I mean to pay that debt," he concluded firmly. "I won't let anybody say that my father kept them out of their money. There is no chance here; somewhere else I may find work and money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" It is a great undertaking for a boy like you, Paul,' said Aunt Lucy thoughtfully. " To whom is the money due? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Squire Conant of Cedarville."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy seemed surprised and agitated by the mention of this name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Paul," said she, " Squire Conant is my brother." " Your brother!" repeated he in great surprise. " Then why does he allow you to live here? He is rich enough to take care of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" It is a long story," said the old lady, sadly. "All that you will be interested to know is that I married against the wishes of my family. My husband died and I was left destitute. My brother has never noticed me since."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" It is a great shame," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" We won't judge him, Paul. Have you fixed upon any time to go? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I shall wait a few days till I get stronger. Can you tell me how far it is to New York ? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Oh, a great distance. a hundred miles at least. You can't think of going so far as that ? "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I think it would be the best plan," said Paul. "In a great city like New York there must be a great many things to do which I can't do here. I don't feel strong enough to work on a farm. Besides I don't like it. Oh, it must be a fine thing to live in a great city. Then too," pursued Paul, his face lighting up with the hopeful confidence of youth. "I may become rich. If I do, Aunt Lucy, I will build a fine house, and you shall come and live with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy had seen more of life than Paul, and was less sanguine. The thought came to her that her life was already declining while his was but just begun, and in the course of nature, even if his bright dreams should be realized, she could hardly hope to live long enough to see it. But of this she said nothing. She would not for the world have dimmed the brightness of his anticipations by the expression of a single doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I wish you all success, Paul, and I thank you for wishing me to share in your good fortune. God helps those who help themselves, and he will help you if you only deserve it. r shall miss you very much when you are gone. It will seem more lonely than ever."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" If it were not for you, Aunt Lucy, I should not mind going at all, but I shall be sorry to leave you behind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" God will care for both of us, my dear boy. I shall hope to hear from you now and then, and if I learn that you are prosperous and happy, I shall be better contented with my own lot. But have you thought of all the labor and weariness that you will have to encounter? It is best to consider well all this, before entering upon such an undertaking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" I have thought of all that, and if there were any prospects of my being happy here, I might stay for the present. But you know how Mrs. Mudge has treated me, and how she feels towards me now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I acknowledge, Paul, that it has proved a hard apprenticeship, and perhaps it might be made yet harder if you should stay longer. You must let me know when you are going, I shall want to bid you good-by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No fear that I shall forget that, Aunt Lucy. Next to my mother you have been most kind to me, and I love you for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lightly pressing her lips to Paul's forehead Aunt Lucy left the room to conceal the emotion called forth by his approaching departure. Of all the inmates of the establishment she had felt most closely drawn to the orphan boy, whose loneliness and bereavement had appealed to her woman's heart. This feeling had been strengthened by the care she had been called to bestow upon him in his illness, for it is natural to love those whom we have benefited. But Aunt Lucy was the most unselfish of living creatures, and the idea of dissuading Paul from a course which he felt was right never occurred to her. She determined that she would do what she could to further his plans, now that he had decided to go. Accordingly she commenced knitting him a pair of stockings, knowing that this would prove a useful present. This came near being the means of discovering Paul's plan to Mrs. Mudge The latter, who notwithstanding her numerous duties, managed to see everything that was going on, had her attention directed to Aunt Lucy's work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you finished the stockings that I set you to knitting for Mr. Mudge?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Aunt Lucy, in some confusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then whose are those, I should like to know? Somebody of more importance than my husband, I suppose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are for Paul," returned the old lady, in some uneasiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul!" repeated Mrs. Mudge, in her haste putting a double quantity of salæratus into the bread she was mixing; "Paul's are they? And who asked you to knit him a pair, I should like to be informed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then what are you doing it for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought he might want them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mighty considerate, I declare. And I shouldn't be at all surprised if you were knitting them with the yarn I gave you for Mr. Mudge's stockings."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are mistaken," said Aunt Lucy, shortly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you're putting on your airs, are you? I'll tell you what, Madam, you'd better put those stockings away in double-quick time, and finish my husband's, or I'll throw them into the fire, and Paul Prescott may wait till he goes barefoot before he gets them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no alternative. Aunt Lucy was obliged to obey, at least while her persecutor was in the room. When alone for any length of time she took out Paul's stockings from under her apron, and worked on them till the approaching steps of Mrs. Mudge warned her to desist. —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days passed. The shadows of twilight were already upon the earth. The paupers were collected in the common room appropriated to their use. Aunt Lucy had suspended her work in consequence of the darkness, for in this economical household a lamp was considered a useless piece of extravagance. Paul crept quietly to her side, and whispered in tones audible to her alone, "I am going to-morrow ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow! so soon?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, "I am as ready now as I shall ever be. I wanted to tell you, because I thought maybe you might like to know that this is the last evening we shall spend together at present."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you go in the morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Aunt Lucy, early in the morning. Mr. Mudge usually calls me at five; I must be gone an hour before that time. I suppose I must bid you good-by to-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not to-night, Paul; I shall be up in the morning to see you go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if Mrs. Mudge finds it out she will abuse you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am used to that, Paul," said Aunt Lucy, with a sorrowful smile. "I have borne it many times, and I can again. But I can't lie quiet and let you go without one word of parting. You are quite determined to go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite, Aunt Lucy. I never could stay here. There is no pleasure in the present, and no hope for the future. I want to see something of life," and Paul's boyish figure dilated with enthusiasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God grant that you do not see too much!" said Aunt Lucy, half to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is the world then, so very sad a place?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Both joy and sorrow are mingled in the cup of human life," said Aunt Lucy, solemnly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which shall preponderate it is partly in our power to determine. He who follows the path of duty steadfastly, cannot be wholly miserable, whatever misfortunes may come upon him. He will be sustained by the conviction that his own errors have not brought them upon him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will try to do right," said Paul, placing his hand in that of his companion, "and if ever I am tempted to do wrong, I will think of you and of my mother, and that thought shall restrain me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's time to go bed, folks," proclaimed Mrs Mudge, appearing at the door. "I can't have you sitting up all night, as I've no doubt you'd like to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was only eight o'clock, but no one thought of interposing an objection. The word of Mrs. Mudge was law in her household, as even her husband was sometimes made aware.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All quietly rose from their seats and repaired to bed. It was an affecting sight to watch the tottering gait of those on whose heads the snows of many winters had drifted heavily, as they meekly obeyed the behest of one whose coarse nature forbade her sympathizing with them in their clouded age, and many infirmities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come," said she, impatient of their slow movements, "move a little quicker, if it's perfectly convenient. Anybody'd think you'd been hard at work all day, as I have. You're about the laziest set I ever had anything to do with. I've got to be up early in the morning, and can't stay here dawdling."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's got a sweet temper," said Paul, in a whisper, to Aunt Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush!" said the old lady. "She may hear you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that you're whispering about?" said Mrs. Mudge, suspiciously. "Something you're ashamed to have heard, most likely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul thought it best to remain silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow morning at four! ' he whispered to Aunt Lucy, as he pressed her hand in the darkness.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">VII. PAUL BEGINS HIS JOURNEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PAUL ascended the stairs to his hard pallet for the last time. For the last time! There is sadness in the thought, even when the future which lies before us glows with brighter colors than the past has ever worn. But to Paul, whose future was veiled in uncertainty, and who was about to part with the only friend who felt an interest in his welfare, this thought brought increased sorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stood before the dirt-begrimed window through which alone the struggling sunbeams found an inlet into the gloomy little attic, and looked wistfully out upon the barren fields that surrounded the poorhouse. Where would he be on the morrow at that time? He did not know. He knew little or nothing of the great world without, yet his resolution did not for an instant falter. If it had, the thought of Mrs. Mudge would have been enough to remove all his hesitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He threw himself on his hard bed, and a few minutes brought him that dreamless sleep which comes so easily to the young.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Aunt Lucy, whose thoughts were also occupied with Paul's approaching departure, had taken from the pocket of her other dress—for she had but two—something wrapped in a piece of brown paper. One by one she removed the many folds in which it was enveloped, and came at length to the contents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a coin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul will need some money, poor boy," said she, softly to herself, "I will give him this. It will never do me any good, and it may be of some service to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying she looked carefully at the coin in the moonlight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But what made her start, and utter a half exclamation?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of the gold eagle, the accumulation of many years, which she had been saving for some extraordinary occasion like the presents she held in her hand—a copper cent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been robbed," she exclaimed indignantly in the suddenness of her surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter now?" inquired Mrs Mudge, appearing at the door, "Why are you not in bed, Aunt Lucy Lee? How dare you disobey my orders?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been robbed," exclaimed the old lady in unwonted excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of what, pray?" asked Mrs. Mudge, with a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had a gold eagle wrapped up in that paper," returned Aunt Lucy, pointing to the fragments on the floor, "and now, to-night, when I come to open it, I find but this cent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A likely story," retorted Mrs. Mudge, "very likely, indeed, that a common pauper should have a gold eagle. If you found a cent in the paper, most likely that's what you put there. You're growing old and forgetful, so don't get foolish and flighty. You'd better go to bed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I did have the gold, and it's been stolen," persisted Aunt Lucy, whose disappointment was the greater because she intended the money for Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Again!" exclaimed Mrs. Mudge. "Will you never have done with this folly? Even if you did have the gold, which I don't for an instant believe, you couldn't keep it. A pauper has no right to hold property."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then why did the one who stole the little I had leave me this?" said the old lady, scornfully, holding up the cent which had been substituted for the gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How should I know?" exclaimed Mrs. Mudge, wrathfully. "You talk as if you thought I had taken your trumpery money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you did!" chimed in an unexpected voice, which made Mrs. Mudge start nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the young woman already mentioned, who was bereft of reason, but who at times, as often happens in such cases, seemed gifted with preternatural acuteness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you did. I saw you, I did; I saw you creep up when you thought nobody was looking, and search her pocket. You opened that paper and took out the bright yellow piece, and put in another. You didn't think I was looking at you, ha! ha! How I laughed as I stood behind the door and saw you tremble for fear some one would catch you thieving. You didn't think of me, dear, did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the wild creature burst into an unmeaning laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge stood for a moment mute, overwhelmed by this sudden revelation. But for the darkness, Aunt Lucy could have seen the sudden flush which overspread her face with the crimson hue of detected guilt. But this was only for a moment. It was quickly succeeded by a feeling of intense anger towards the unhappy creature who had been the means of exposing her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll teach you to slander your betters, you crazy fool," she exclaimed, in a voice almost inarticulate with passion, as she seized her rudely by the arm, and dragged her violently from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She returned immediately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose," said she, abruptly, confronting Aunt Lucy, "that you are fool enough to believe her ravings?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I bring no accusation," said the old lady, calmly, "If your conscience acquits you, it is not for me to accuse you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But what do you think?" persisted Mrs. Mudge, whose consciousness of guilt did not leave her quite at ease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot read the heart," said Aunt Lucy, composedly. "I can only say, that, pauper as I am, I would not exchange places with the one who has done this deed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean me?" demanded Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can tell best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tell you what, Aunt Lucy Lee," said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes blazing with anger, "If you dare insinuate to any living soul that I stole your paltry money, which I don't believe you ever had, I will be bitterly revenged upon you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She flaunted out of the room, and Aunt Lucy, the first bitterness of her disappointment over, retired to bed, and slept more tranquilly than the unscrupulous woman who had robbed her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At a quarter before four Paul started from his humble couch, and hastily dressed himself, took up a little bundle containing all his scanty stock of clothing, and noiselessly descended the two flights of stairs which separated him from the lower story. Here he paused a moment for Aunt Lucy to appear. Her sharp ears had distinguished his stealthy steps as he passed her door, and she came down to bid him good-by. She had in her hands a pair of stockings which she slipped into his bundle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I had something else to give you, Paul," she said, "but you know that I am not very rich."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear Aunt Lucy," said Paul, kissing her, "you are my only friend on earth. You have been very kind to me, and I never will forget you, never! By-and-by, when I am rich, I will build a fine house, and you will come and live with me, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's bright anticipations, improbable as they were, had the effect of turning his companion's thoughts into a more cheerful channel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She bent down and kissed him, whispering softly, "Yes, I will, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it's a bargain," said he, joyously, "Mind you don't forget it. I shall come for you one of these days when you least expect it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any money?" inquired Aunt Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then," said she, drawing from her finger a gold ring which had held its place for many long years, "here is something which will bring you a little money if you are ever in distress."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul hung back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would rather not take it, indeed I would," he said, earnestly, "I would rather go hungry for two or three days than sell your ring. Besides, I shall not need it; God will provide for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you need not sell it," urged Aunt Lucy, "unless it is absolutely necessary. You can take it and keep it in remembrance of me. Keep it till you see me again, Paul. It will be a pledge to me that you will come back again some day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On that condition I will take it," said Paul, "and some day I will bring it back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A slight noise above, as of some one stirring in sleep, excited the apprehensions of the two, and warned them that it was imprudent for them to remain longer in conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a hurried good-by, Aunt Lucy quietly went upstairs again, and Paul, shouldering his bundle, walked rapidly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The birds, awakening from their night's repose, were beginning to carol forth their rich songs of thanksgiving for the blessing of a new day. From the flowers beneath his feet and the blossom-laden branches above his head, a delicious perfume floated out upon the morning air, and filled the heart of the young wanderer with a sense of the joyousness of existence, and inspired him with a hopeful confidence in the future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the first time he felt that he belonged to himself. At the age of thirteen he had taken his fortune in his own hand, and was about to mold it as best he might.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were care, and toil, and privations before him, no doubt, but in that bright morning hour he could harbor only cheerful and trusting thoughts. Hopefully he looked forward to the time when he could fulfil his father's dying injunction, and lift from his name the burden of a debt unpaid. Then his mind reverting to another thought, he could not help smiling at the surprise and anger of Mr. Mudge, when he should find that his assistant had taken French leave. He thought he should like to be concealed somewhere where he could witness the commotion excited by his own departure. But as he could not be in two places at the same time, he must lose that satisfaction. He had cut loose from the Mudge household, as he trusted, forever. He felt that a new and brighter life was opening before him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">VIII. A FRIEND IN NEED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OUR hero did not stop till he had put a good five miles between himself and the poorhouse. He knew that it would not be long before Mr. Mudge would discover his absence, and the thought of being carried back was doubly distasteful to him now that he had, even for a short time, felt the joy of being his own master. His hurried walk, taken in the fresh morning air, gave him quite a sharp appetite. Luckily he had the means of gratifying it. The night before he had secreted half his supper, knowing that he should need it more the next morning. He thought he might now venture to sit down and eat it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At a little distance from the road was a spring, doubtless used for cattle, since it was situated at the lower end of a pasture. Close beside and bending over it was a broad, branching oak, which promised a cool and comfortable shelter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just the place for me," thought Paul, who felt thirsty as well as hungry, "I think I will take breakfast here and rest awhile before I go any farther."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying he leaped lightly over the rail fence, and making his way to the place indicated, sat down in the shadow of the tree. Scooping up some water in the hollow of his hand, he drank a deep and refreshing draught. He next proceeded to pull out of his pocket a small package, which proved to contain two small pieces of bread. His long morning walk had given him such an appetite that he was not long in despatching all he had. It is said by some learned physicians, who no doubt understand the matter, that we should always rise from the table with an appetite. Probably Paul had never heard of this rule. Nevertheless, he seemed in a fair way of putting it into practice, for the best of reasons, because he could not help it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His breakfast, though not the most inviting, being simply unbuttered bread and rather dry at that, seemed more delicious than ever before, but unfortunately there was not enough of it. However, as there seemed likely to be no more forthcoming, he concluded in default of breakfast to lie down under the tree for a few minutes before resuming his walk. Though he could not help wondering vaguely where his dinner was to come from, as that time was several hours distant, he wisely decided not to anticipate trouble till it came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lying down under the tree, Paul began to consider what Mr. Mudge would say when he discovered that he had run away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll have to milk the cows himself," thought Paul. "He won't fancy that much. Won't Mrs. Mudge scold, thought? I'm glad I shan't be within hearing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Holloa!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a boy's voice that Paul heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking up he saw a sedate company of cows entering the pasture single file through an aperture made by letting down the bars. Behind them walked a boy of about his own size, flourishing a stout hickory stick. The cows went directly to the spring from which Paul had already drunk. The young driver looked at our hero with some curiosity, wondering, doubtless, what brought him there so early in the morning. After a little hesitation he said, remarking Paul's bundle, "Where are you traveling?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know exactly," said Paul, who was not quite sure whether it would be politic to avow his destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't know?" returned the other, evidently surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly; I may go to New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"New York! That's a great ways off. Do you know the way there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I can find it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going all alone?" asked his new acquaintance, who evidently thought Paul had undertaken a very formidable journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to walk all the way?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, unless somebody offers me a ride now and then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But why don't you ride in the stage, or in the cars? You would get there a good deal quicker."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One reason," said Paul, hesitating a little, "is because I have no money to pay for riding."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then how do you expect to live? Have you had any breakfast, this morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I brought some with me, and just got through eating it when you came along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And where do you expect to get any dinner?" pursued his questioner, who was evidently not a little puzzled by the answers he received.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," returned Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His companion looked not a little confounded at this view of the matter, but presently a bright thought struck him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't wonder," he said, shrewdly, "if you were running away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul hesitated a moment. He knew that his case must look a little suspicious, thus unexplained, and after a brief pause for reflection determined to take the questioner into his confidence. He did this the more readily because his new acquaintance looked very pleasant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've guessed right," he said; "if you'll promise not to tell anybody, I'll tell you all about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was readily promised, and the boy who gave his name as John Burgess, sat down beside Paul, while he, with the frankness of boyhood, gave a circumstantial account of his father's death, and the ill-treatment he had met with subsequently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you come from Wrenville?" asked John, interested. "Why, I've got relations there. Perhaps you know my cousin, Ben Newcome."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Ben Newcome your cousin? O yes, I know him very well; he's a first-rate fellow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He isn't much like his father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all. If he was"—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You wouldn't like him so well. Uncle talks a little too much out of the dictionary, and walks so straight that he bends backward. But I say, Paul, old Mudge deserves to be choked, and Mrs. Mudge should be obliged to swallow a gallon of her own soup. I don't know but that would be worse than choking. I wouldn't have stayed so long if I had been in your place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't," said Paul, "if it hadn't been for Aunt Lucy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was she an aunt of yours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but we used to call her so, She's the best friend I've got, and I don't know but the only one," said Paul, a little sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, she isn't," said John, quickly; "I'll be your friend, Paul. Sometime, perhaps, I shall go to New York, myself, and then I will come and see you. Where do you expect to be?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know anything about the city," said Paul, "but if you come, I shall be sure to see you somewhere. I wish you were going now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Neither Paul nor his companion had much idea of the extent of the great metropolis, or they would not have taken it so much as a matter of course that, being in the same place, they should meet each other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from a farmhouse within sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's our breakfast-bell," said John rising from the grass. "It is meant for me. I suppose they wonder what keeps me so long. Won't you come and take breakfast with me, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess not," said Paul, who would have been glad to do so had he followed the promptings of his appetite. "I'm afraid your folks would ask me questions, and then it would be found out that I am running away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think of that," returned John, after a pause. "You haven't got any dinner with you?" he said a moment after.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. Come with me as far as the fence, and lie down there till I've finished breakfast. Then I'll bring something out for you, and maybe I'll walk along a little way with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind," said Paul, gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, nonsense," said John, "that's nothing. Besides, you know we are going to be friends."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"John! breakfast's ready."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's Nelson calling me," said John, hurriedly. "I must leave you; there's the fence; lie down there, and I'll be back in a jiffy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"John, I say, why don't you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm coming. You mustn't think everybody's got such a thundering great appetite as you, Nelson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you've got enough to keep you from pining away," said Nelson, good-naturedly, "you're twice as fat as I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's because I work harder," said John, rather illogically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The brothers went in to breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But a few minutes elapsed before John reappeared, bearing under his arm a parcel wrapped up in an old newspaper. He came up panting with the haste he had made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It didnt take you long to eat breakfast," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I hurried through it; I thought you would get tired of waiting. And now I'll walk along with you a little ways. But wait here's something for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying he unrolled the newspaper and displayed a loaf of bread, fresh and warm, which looked particularly inviting to Paul, whose scanty breakfast had by no means satisfied his appetite. Besides this, there was a loaf of molasses ginger-bread, with which all who were born in the country, or know anything of New England housekeeping, are familiar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There," said John, "I guess that'll be enough for your dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But how did you get it without having any questions asked?" inquired our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh," said John, "I asked mother for them, and when she asked what I wanted of them, I told her that I'd answer that question to-morrow. You see I wanted to give you a chance to get off out of the way, though mother wouldn't tell, even if she knew."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Paul, with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He could not help looking wistfully at the bread, which looked very inviting to one accustomed to poorhouse fare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you wouldn't mind," he said hesitating, "I would like to eat a little of the bread now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind, of course not," said John, breaking off a liberal slice. "Why didn't I think of that before? Walking must have given you a famous appetite."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John looked on with evident approbation, while Paul ate with great apparent appetite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There," said he with a sigh of gratification, as he swallowed the last morsel, "I haven't tasted anything so good for a long time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it as good as Mrs. Mudge's soup?" asked John, mischievously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Almost," returned Paul, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We must now leave the boys to pursue their way, and return to the dwelling from which our hero had so unceremoniously taken his departure, and from which danger now threatened him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">IX. A CLOUD IN THE MUDGE HORIZON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. MUDGE was accustomed to call Paul at five o'clock, to milk the cows and perform other chores. He himself did not rise till an hour later. During Paul's sickness, he was obliged to take his place,—a thing he did not relish overmuch. Now that our hero had recovered, he gladly prepared to indulge himself in an extra nap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul!" called Mr. Mudge from the bottom of the staircase leading up into the attic, "it's five o'clock; time you were downstairs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge waited for an answer, but none came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul!" repeated Mr. Mudge in a louder tone, "it's time to get up; tumble out there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again there was no answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first, Mr. Mudge thought it might be in consequence of Paul's sleeping so soundly, but on listening attentively, he could not distinguish the deep and regular breathing which usually accompanies such slumber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He must be sullen," he concluded, with a feeling of irritation. "If he is, I'll teach him—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without taking time to finish the sentence, he bounded up the rickety staircase, and turned towards the bed with the intention of giving our hero a smart shaking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked with astonishment at the empty bed. "Is it possible," he thought, "that Paul has already got up? He isn't apt to do so before he is called."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this juncture, Mrs. Mudge, surprised at her husband's prolonged absence, called from below, "Mr. Mudge!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, wife?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What in the name of wonder keeps you up there so long?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just come up and see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge did come up. Her husband pointed to the empty bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think of that?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What about it?" she inquired, not quite comprehending.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About that boy, Paul. When I called him I got no answer, so I came up, and behold he is among the missing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't think he's run away, do you?" asked Mrs. Mudge startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is more than I know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll see if his clothes are here," said his wife, now fully aroused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her search was unavailing. Paul's clothes had disappeared as mysteriously as their owner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a clear case," said Mr. Mudge, shaking his head; "he's gone. I wouldn't have lost him for considerable. He was only a boy, but I managed to get as much work out of him as a man. The question is now, what shall we do about it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He must be pursued," said Mrs. Mudge, with vehemence, "I'll have him back if it costs me twenty dollars. I'll tell you what, husband," she exclaimed, with a sudden light breaking in upon her, "if there's anybody in this house knows where he's gone, it is Aunt Lucy Lee. Only last week I caught her knitting him a pair of stockings. I might have known what it meant if I hadn't been a fool."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha, ha! So you might, if you hadn't been a fool!" echoed a mocking voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning with sudden anger, Mrs. Mudge beheld the face of the crazy girl peering up at her from below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This turned her thoughts into a different channel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll teach you what I am," she exclaimed, wrathfully descending the stairs more rapidly than she had mounted them, "and if you know anything about the little scamp, I'll have it out of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl narrowly succeeded in eluding the grasp of her pursuer. But, alas! for Mrs. Mudge. In her impetuosity she lost her footing, and fell backward into a pail of water which had been brought up the night before and set in the entry for purposes of ablution. More wrathful than ever, Mrs. Mudge bounced into her room and sat down in her dripping garments in a very uncomfortable frame of mind. As for Paul, she felt a personal dislike for him, and was not sorry on some accounts to have him out of the house. The knowledge, however, that he had in a manner defied her authority by running away, filled her with an earnest desire to get him back, if only to prove that it was not to be defied with impunity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hoping to elicit some information from Aunt Lucy, who, she felt sure, was in Paul's confidence, she paid her a visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, here's a pretty goings on," she commenced, abruptly. Finding that Aunt Lucy manifested no curiosity on the subject, she continued, in a significant tone, "Of course, you don't know anything about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can tell better when I know what you refer to," said the old lady calmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you are very ignorant all at once. I suppose you didn't know Paul Prescott had run away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not surprised," said the old lady, in the same quiet manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge had expected a show of astonishment, and this calmness disconcerted her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not surprised!" she retorted. "I presume not, since you knew all about it beforehand. That's why you were knitting him some stockings. Deny it, if you dare."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no disposition to deny it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't!" exclaimed the questioner, almost struck dumb with this audacity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Aunt Lucy. "Why should I? There was no particular inducement for him to stay here. Wherever he goes, I hope he will meet with good friends and good treatment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As much as to say he didn't find them here. Is that what you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no charges to bring."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I have," said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes lighting with malicious satisfaction. "Last night you missed a ten-dollar gold piece, which you saw was stolen from you. This morning it appears that Paul Prescott has run away. I charge him with the theft."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You do not, can not believe this," said the old lady, uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I do," returned Mrs. Mudge, triumphantly, perceiving her advantage. "I have no doubt of it, and when we get the boy back, he shal be made to confess it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy looked troubled, much to the gratification of Mrs. Mudge. It was but for a short time, however. Rising from her seat, she stood confronting Mrs. Mudge, and said quietly, but firmly, "I have no doubt, Mrs. Mudge, you are capable of doing what you say. I would advise you, however, to pause. You know, as well as I do, that Paul is incapable of this theft. Even if he were wicked enough to form the idea, he would have no need, since it was my intention to give him this money. Who did actually steal the gold, you perhaps know better than I. Should it be necessary, I shall not hesitate to say so. I advise you not to render it necessary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The threat which lay in these words was understood. It came with the force of a sudden blow to Mrs. Mudge, who had supposed it would be no difficult task to frighten and silence Aunt Lucy. The latter had always been so yielding in all matters relating to herself, that this intrepid championship of Paul's interests was unlooked for. The tables were completely turned. Pale with rage, and a mortified sense of having been foiled with her own weapons, Mrs. Mudge left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile her husband milked the cows, and was now occupied in performing certain other duties that could not be postponed, being resolved, immediately after breakfast was over, to harness up and pursue the runaway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, did you get anything out of the old lady?" he inquired, as he came from the barn with the full milk-pails.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She said she knew beforehand that he was going."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh!" said Mr. Mudge, pricking up his ears, "did she say where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, and she won't. She knit him a pair of stockings to help him off, and doesn't pretend to deny it. She's taken a wonderful fancy to the young scamp, and has been as obstinate as could be ever since he has been here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I get him back," said Mr. Mudge, "he shall have a good flogging, if I am able to give him one, and she shall be present to see it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's right," said Mrs. Mudge, approvingly, "when are you going to set out after him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right after breakfast. So be spry, and get it ready as soon as you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the stimulus of this inspiring motive, Mrs. Mudge bustled about with new energy, and before many minutes the meal was in readiness. It did not take long to dispatch it. Immediately afterwards, Mr. Mudge harnessed up, as he had determined, and started off in pursuit of our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the meantime the two boys had walked leisurely along, conversing on various subjects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When you get to the city, Paul," said John, "I shall want to hear from you. Will you write to me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul promised readily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can direct to John Burges, Burrville. The postmaster knows me, and I shall be sure to get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you were going with me," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sometimes when I think that I am all alone it discourages me. It would be so much pleasanter to have some one with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall come sometime," said John, "when I am a little older. I heard father say something the other day about my going into a store in the city. So we may meet again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope we shall."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were just turning a bend of the road, when Paul chanced to look backward. About a quarter of a mile back he descried a horse and wagon wearing a familiar look. Fixing his eyes anxiously upon them, he was soon made aware that his suspicions were only too well founded. It was Mr. Mudge, doubtless in quest of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What shall I do?" he asked, hurriedly of his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was quickly explained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John was quickwitted, and he instantly decided upon the course proper to be pursued. On either side of the road was a growth of underbrush so thick as to be almost impenetrable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Creep in behind there, and be quick about it," directed John, "there is no time to lose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There," said he, after Paul had followed his advice, "if he can see you now he must have sharp eyes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you come in too?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not I," said John, "I am anxious to see this Mr. Mudge, since you have told me so much about him. I hope he will ask me some questions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What will you tell him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Trust me for that. Don't say any more. He's close by."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">X. MR. MUDGE MEETS HIS MATCH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN lounged along, appearing to be very busily engaged in making a whistle from a slip of willow which he had a short time before cut from the tree. He purposely kept in the middle of the road, apparently quite unaware of the approach of the vehicle, until he was aroused by the sound of a voice behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be a little more careful, if you don't want to get run over."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John assumed a look of surprise, and with comic terror ran to the side of the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge checked his horse, and came to a sudden halt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, youngster, haven't you seen a boy of about your own size walking along, with a bundle in his hand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tied up in a red cotton handkerchief?" inquired John.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I believe so," said Mr. Mudge, eagerly, "where did you—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With a blue cloth cap?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, where—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gray jacket and pants?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes. Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With a patch on one knee?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, the very one. When did you see him?" said Mr. Mudge, getting ready to start his horse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it isn't the one you mean," continued John, who took a mischievous delight in playing with the evident impatience of Mr. Mudge; "the boy that I saw looked thin, as if he hadn't had enough to eat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge winced slightly, and looked at John with some suspicion. But John put on so innocent and artless a look that Mr. Mudge at once dismissed the idea that there was any covert meaning in what he said. Meanwhile Paul, from his hiding-place in the bushes, had listened with anxiety to the foregoing colloquy. When John described his appearance so minutely, he was seized with a sudden apprehension that the boy meant to betray him. But he dismissed it instantly. In his own singleness of heart he could not believe such duplicity possible. Still, it was not without anxiety that he waited to hear what would be said next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Mr. Mudge, slowly, "I don't know but he is a little peaked . He's been sick lately, and that's took off his flesh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was he your son?" asked John, in a sympathizing tone; "you must feel quite troubled about him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked askance at Mr. Mudge, enjoying that gentleman's growing irritation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My son? No. Where—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nephews perhaps?" suggested the imperturbable John, leisurely continuing the manufacture of a whistle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I tell you, nothing of the kind. But I can't sit waiting here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I hope you'll excuse me," said John, apologetically. "I hope you won't stop on my account. I didn't know you were in a hurry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you know it now," said Mr. Mudge, crossly. "When and where did you see the boy you have described? I am in pursuit of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has he run away?" inquired John in assumed surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to answer my question or not?" demanded Mr. Mudge, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I beg your pardon. I shouldn't have asked so many questions, only I thought he was a nice-looking boy, and I felt interested in him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a young scamp," said Mr. Mudge, impetuously, "and it's my belief that you're another. Now answer my question. When and where did you see this boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This time Mr. Mudge's menacing look warned John that he had gone far enough. Accordingly he answered promptly, "He passed by our farm this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far back is that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About three miles."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he stop there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he stopped a while to rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you seen him since?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I saw him about half a mile back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On this road?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but he turned up the road that branches off there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just what I wanted to find out," said Mr. Mudge, in a tone of satisfaction, "I'm sure to catch him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying, he turned about and put his horse to its utmost speed, determined to make up for lost time. When he was fairly out of sight, Paul came forth from his hiding-place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How could you do so!" he asked in a reproachful tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could I do what?" asked John, turning a laughing face towards Paul. "Didn't I tell old Mudge the exact truth? You know you did turn up that road. To be sure you didn't go two rods before turning back. But he didn't stop to ask about that. If he hadn't been in such a hurry, perhaps I should have told him. Success to him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't think how I trembled when you described me so particularly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't think I would betray you?" said John, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I was afraid you would venture too far, and get us both into trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Trust me for that, Paul; I've got my eyes wide open, and ain't easily caught. But wasn't it fun to see old Mudge fuming while I kept him waiting. What would he have said if he had known the bird was so near at hand? He looked foolish enough when I asked him if you were his son."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John sat down and gave vent to his pent-up laughter which he had felt obliged to restrain in the presence of Mr. Mudge. He laughed so heartily that Paul, notwithstanding his recent fright and anxiety, could not resist the infection. Together they laughed, till the very air seemed vocal with merriment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John was the first to recover his gravity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry, Paul," he said, "but I must bid you good-by. They will miss me from the house. I am glad I have got acquainted with you, and I hope I shall see you again some time before very long. Good-by, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, John."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys shook hands and parted. One went in one direction, the other in the opposite. Each looked back repeatedly till the other was out of sight. Then came over Paul once more a feeling of sadness and desolation, which the high spirits of his companion had for the time kept off. Occasionally he cast a glance backwards, to make sure that Mr. Mudge was not following him. But Paul had no cause to fear on that score. The object of his dread was already some miles distant in a different direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For an hour longer, Paul trudged on. He met few persons, the road not being very much frequented. He was now at least twelve miles from his starting-place, and began to feel very sensibly the effects of heat and fatigue combined. He threw himself down upon the grass under the overhanging branches of an apple-tree to rest. After his long walk repose seemed delicious, and with a feeling of exquisite enjoyment he stretched himself out at full length upon the soft turf, and closed his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Insensibly he fell asleep. How long he slept he could not tell. He was finally roused from his slumber by something cold touching his cheek. Starting up he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment, and gradually became aware that this something was the nose of a Newfoundland dog, whose keen scent had enabled him to discover the whereabouts of the small stock of provisions with which Paul had been supplied by his late companion. Fortunately he awoke in time to save its becoming the prey of its canine visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon you came nigh losing your dinner," fell upon his ears in a rough but hearty tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time he heard the noise of wheels, and looking up, beheld a specimen of a class well known throughout New England —a tin pedler. He was seated on a cart liberally stocked with articles of tin ware. From the rear depended two immense bags, one of which served as a receptacle for white rags, the other for bits of calico and whatever else may fall under the designation of "colored." His shop, for such it was, was drawn at a brisk pace by a stout horse, who in this respect presented a contrast to his master, who was long and lank. The pedler himself was a man of perhaps forty, with a face in which shrewdness and good humor seemed alike indicated. Take him for all in all, you might travel some distance without falling in with a more complete specimen of the Yankee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you came nigh losing your dinner," he repeated, in a pleasant tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, "I got tired and fell asleep, and I don't know when I should have waked up but for your dog."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Boney's got a keen scent for provisions," laughed the pedler. "He's a little graspin', like his namesake. You see his real name is Bonaparte; we only call him Boney, for short."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile he had stopped his horse. He was about to start afresh, when a thought struck him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you're goin' my way," said he, turning to Paul; "if you are, you're welcome to a ride."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was very glad to accept the invitation. He clambered into the cart, and took a seat behind the pedler, while Boney, who took his recent disappointment very good-naturedly, jogged on contentedly behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far are you goin'?" asked Paul's new acquaintance, as he whipped up his horse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul felt a little embarrassed. If he had been acquainted with the names of any of the villages on the route he might easily have answered. As it was, only one name occurred to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think," said he, with some hesitation, "that I shall go to New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"New York!" repeated the pedler, with a whistle expressive of his astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you've a journey before you. Got any relations there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No uncles, aunts, cousins, nor nothing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then what makes you go? Haven't run away from your father and mother, hey?" asked the pedler, with a knowing look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no father nor mother," said Paul, sadly enough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you had somebody to take care of you, I calculate. Where did you live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I tell you, you won't carry me back?" said Paul, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit of it. I've got too much business on hand for that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Relieved by this assurance, Paul told his story, encouraged thereto by frequent questions from his companion, who seemed to take a lively interest in the adventures of his young companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a capital trick you played on old Mudge," he said with a hearty laugh which almost made the tins rattle. "I don't blame you a bit for running away. I've got a story to tell you about Mrs. Mudge. She's a regular skinflint."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XI. WAYSIDE GOSSIP.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS was the pedler's promised story about Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The last time I was round that way, I stopped, thinking maybe they might have some rags to dispose of for tin-ware. The old lady seemed glad to see me, and pretty soon she brought down a lot of white rags. I thought they seemed quite heavy for their bulk,— howsomever, I wasn't looking for any tricks, and I let it go. By-and-by, when I happened to be ransacking one of the bags, I came across half a dozen pounds or more of old iron tied up in a white cloth. That let the cat out of the bag. I knew why they were so heavy, then, I reckon I shan't call on Mrs. Mudge next time I go by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you've run off," he continued, after a pause, "I like your spunk,—just what I should have done myself. But tell me how you managed to get off without the old chap's finding it out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul related such of his adventures as he had not before told, his companion listening with marked approval.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I'd been there," he said. "I'd have given fifty cents, right out, to see how old Mudge looked, I calc'late he's pretty well tired with his wild-goose chase by this time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was now twelve o'clock, and both the travelers began to feel the pangs of hunger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's about time to bait, I calc'late," remarked the pedler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The unsophisticated reader is informed that the word "bait," in New England phraseology, is applied to taking lunch or dining.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this point a green lane opened out of the public road, skirted on either side by a row of trees. Carpeted with green, it made a very pleasant dining-room. A red-and-white heifer browsing at a little distance looked up from her meal and surveyed the intruders with mild attention, but apparently satisfied that they contemplated no invasion of her rights, resumed her agreeable employment. Over an irregular stone wall our travelers looked into a thrifty apple-orchard laden with fruit. They halted beneath a spreading chestnut-tree which towered above its neighbors, and offered them a grateful shelter from the noonday sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the box underneath the seat, the pedler took out a loaf of bread, a slice of butter, and a tin pail full of doughnuts. Paul, on his side, brought out his bread and gingerbread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I most generally carry round my own provisions," remarked the pedler, between two mouthfuls. "It's a good deal cheaper and more convenient, too. Help yourself to the doughnuts. I always calc'late to have some with me. I'd give more for 'em any day than for rich cake that ain't fit for anybody. My mother used to beat everybody in the neighborhood on making doughnuts. She made 'em so good that we never knew when to stop eating. You wouldn't hardly believe it, but, when I was a little shaver, I remember eating twenty-three doughnuts at one time. Pretty nigh killed me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think it might," said Paul, laughing</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mother got so scared that she vowed she wouldn't fry another for three months, but I guess she kinder lost the run of the almanac, for in less than a week she turned out about a bushel more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All this time the pedler was engaged in practically refuting the saying, that a man cannot do two things at once. With a little assistance from Paul, the stock of doughnuts on which he had been lavishing encomiums, diminished rapidly. It was evident that his attachment to this homely article of diet was quite as strong as ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be afraid of them," said he, seeing that Paul desisted from his efforts, "I've got plenty more in the box."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul signified that his appetite was already appeased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we might as well be jogging on. Hey, Goliah," said he, addressing the horse, who with an air of great content, had been browsing while his master was engaged in a similar manner. "Queer name for a horse, isn't it? I wanted something out of the common way, so I asked mother for a name, and she gave me that. She's great on scripture names, mother is. She gave one to every one of her children. It didn't make much difference to her what they were as long as they were in the Bible. I believe she used to open the Bible at random, and take the first name she happened to come across. There are eight of us, and nary a decent name in the lot. My oldest brother's name is Abimelech. Then there's Pharaoh, and Ishmael, and Jonadab, for the boys, and Leah and Naomi, for the girls; but my name beats all. You couldn't guess it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe you could," said the pedler, shaking his head in comic indignation. "It's Jehoshaphat. Ain't that a respectable name for the son of Christian parents?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It wouldn't be so bad," continued the pedler, "if my other name was longer; but Jehoshaphat seems rather a long handle to put before Stubbs. I can't say I feel particularly proud of the name, though for use it'll do as well as any other. At any rate, it ain't quite so bad as the name mother pitched on for my youngest sister, who was lucky enough to die before she needed a name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was it?" inquired Paul, really curious to know what name could be considered less desirable than Jehoshaphat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was Jezebel," responded the pedler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Everybody told mother 'twould never do; but she was kind of superstitious about it, because that was the first name she came to in the Bible, and so she thought it was the Lord's will that that name should be given to the child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Mr. Stubbs finished his disquisition upon names, there came in sight a small house, dark and discolored with age and neglect. He pointed this out to Paul with his whip-handle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That," said he, "is where old Keziah Onthank lives. Ever heard of him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul had not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's the oldest man in these parts," pursued his loquacious companion. "There's some folks that seem a dyin' all the time, and for all that manage to outlive half the young folks in the neighborhood. Old Keziah Onthank is a complete case in p'int. As long ago as when I was cutting my teeth he was so old that nobody know'd how old he was. He was so bowed over that he couldn't see himself in the looking-glass unless you put it on the floor, and I guess even then what he saw wouldn't pay him for his trouble. He was always ailin' some way or other. Now it was rheumatism, now the palsy, and then again the asthma. He had that awful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He lived in the same tumble-down old shanty we have just passed,—so poor that nobody'd take the gift of it. People said that he'd orter go to the poorhouse, so that when he was sick—which was pretty much all the time —he'd have somebody to take care of him. But he'd got kinder attached to the old place, seein' he was born there, and never lived anywhere else, and go he wouldn't.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Everybody expected he was near his end, and nobody'd have been surprised to hear of his death at any minute. But it's strange how some folks are determined to live on, as I said before. So Keziah, though he looked so old when I was a boy that it didn't seem as if he could look any older, kept on livin,' and livin', and arter I got married to Betsy Sprague, he was livin' still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One day, I remember I was passin' by the old man's shanty, when I heard a dreadful groanin', and thinks I to myself, `I shouldn't wonder if the old man was on his last legs.' So in I bolted. There he was, to be sure, a lyin', on the bed, all curled up into a heap, breathin' dreadful hard, and lookin' as white and pale as any ghost. I didn't know exactly what to do, so I went and got some water, but he motioned it away, and wouldn't drink it, but kept on groanin'.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `He mustn't be left here to die without any assistance,' thinks I, so I ran off as fast I could to find the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I found him eatin' dinner—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come quick," says I, "to old Keziah Onthank's. He's dyin', as sure as my name is Jehoshaphat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said the doctor, "die or no die, I can't come till I've eaten my dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he's dyin', doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, nonsense. Talk of old Keziah Onthank's dyin'. He'll live longer than I shall."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I recollect I thought the doctor very un feelin' to talk so of a fellow creetur, just stepping into eternity, as a body may say. However, it's no use drivin' a horse that's made up his mind he won't go, so although I did think the doctor dreadful deliberate about eatin' his dinner (he always would take half an hour for it), I didn't dare to say a word for fear he wouldn't come at all. You see the doctor was dreadful independent, and was bent on havin' his own way, pretty much, though for that matter I think it's the case with most folks. However, to come back to my story, I didn't feel particularly comfortable while I was waitin' his motions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"After a long while the doctor got ready. I was in such a hurry that I actilly pulled him along, he walked so slow; but he only laughed, and I couldn't help thinkin' that doctorin' had a hardinin' effect on the heart. I was determined if ever I fell sick I wouldn't send for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At last we got there. I went in all of a tremble, and crept to the bed, thinkin' I should see his dead body. But he wasn't there at all. I felt a little bothered you'd better believe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said the doctor, turning to me with a smile, "what do you think now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what to think," said I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll help you," said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So sayin', he took me to the winder, and what do you think I see? As sure as I'm alive, there was the old man in the back yard, a squattin' down and pickin' up chips."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And is he still living?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, or he was when I come along last. The doctor's been dead these ten years. He told me old Keziah would outlive him, but I didn't believe him. I shouldn't be surprised if he lived forever."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul listened with amused interest to this and other stories with which his companion beguiled the way. They served to divert his mind from the realities of his condition, and the uncertainty which hung over his worldly prospects.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XII. ON THE BRINK OF DISCOVERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"IF you're in no great hurry to go to New York," said the pedler, "I should like to have you stay with me for a day or two. I live about twenty-five miles from here, straight ahead, so it will be on your way. I always manage to get home by Saturday night if it is any way possible. It doesn't seem comfortable to be away Sunday. As to-day is Friday,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall get there to-morrow. So you can lie over a day and rest yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul felt grateful for this unexpected invitation. It lifted quite a load from his mind, since, as the day declined, certain anxious thoughts as to where he should find shelter, had obtruded themselves. Even now, the same trouble would be experienced on Monday night, but it is the characteristic of youth to pay little regard to anticipated difficulties as long as the present is provided for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It must not be supposed that the pedler neglected his business on account of his companion. On the road he had been traveling the houses were few and far between. He had, therefore, but few calls to make. Paul remarked, however, that when he did call he seldom failed to sell something.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Mr. Stubbs, on being interrogated, "I make it a p'int to sell something, if it's no more than a tin dipper. I find some hard cases sometimes, and sometimes I have to give it up altogether. I can't quite come up to a friend of mine, Daniel Watson, who used to be in the same line of business. I never knew him to stop at a place without selling something. He had a good deal of judgment, Daniel had, and knew just when to use `soft sodder,' and when not to. On the road that he traveled there lived a widow woman, who had the reputation of being as ugly, cross-grained a critter as ever lived. People used to say that it was enough to turn milk sour for her even to look at it. Well, it so happened that Daniel had never called there. One night he was boasting that he never called at a house without driving a bargain, when one of the company asked him, with a laugh, if he had ever sold the widow anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no," said Daniel, "I never called there; but I've no doubt I could."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'll you bet of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not a betting man," said Daniel, "but I feel so sure of it that I don't mind risking five dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Agreed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The next morning Daniel drove leisurely up to the widow's door and knocked. She had a great aversion to pedlers, and declared they were cheats, every one of them. She was busy sweeping when Daniel knocked. She came to the door in a dreadful hurry, hoping it might be an old widower in the neighborhood that she was trying to catch. When she saw how much she was mistaken she looked as black as a thundercloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Want any tin ware to-day, ma'am?" inquired Daniel, noways discomposed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," snapped she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got all kinds,—warranted the best in the market. Couldn't I sell you something?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a single thing," said she, preparing to shut the door; but Daniel, knowing all would then be lost, stepped in before she could shut it quite to, and began to name over some of the articles he had in his wagon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may talk till doomsday," said the widow, as mad as could be, "and it won't do a particle of good. Now, you've got your answer, and you'd better leave the house before you are driven out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Brooms, brushes, lamps—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here the widow, who had been trying to keep in her anger, couldn't hold out any longer. She seized the broom she had been sweeping with, and brought it down with a tremendous whack upon Daniel's back. You can imagine how hard it was, when I tell you that the force of the blow snapped the broom in the middle. You might have thought Daniel would resent it, but he didn't appear to notice it, though it must have hurt him awful. He picked up the pieces, and handing them, with a polite bow, to the widow, said, "Now, ma'am, I'm sure you need a new broom. I've got some capital ones out in the cart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The widow seemed kind of overpowered by his coolness. She hardly knew what to say or what to think. However, she had broken her old broom, that was certain, and must have a new one; so when Daniel ran out and brought in a bundle of them, she picked out one and paid for it without saying a word; only, when Daniel asked if he might have the pleasure of calling again, she looked a little queer, and told him that if he considered it a pleasure, she had no objection."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And did he call again?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, whenever he went that way. The widow was always very polite to him after that, and, though she had a mortal dislike to pedlers in general, she was always ready to trade with him. Daniel used to say that he gained his bet and the widow's custom at one blow ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were now descending a little hill at the foot of which stood a country tavern. Here Mr. Stubbs declared his intention of spending the night. He drove into the barn, the large door of which stood invitingly open, and unharnessed his horse, taking especial care to rub him down and set before him an ample supply of provender.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I always take care of Goliah myself," said he. "He's a good friend to me, and it's no more than right that I should take good care of him. Now, we'll go into the house, and see what we can get for supper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was surprised to see that Paul hung back, and seemed disinclined to follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" asked Mr. Stubbs, in surprise. "Why don't you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because," said Paul, looking embarrassed, "I've got no money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I have," said Mr. Stubbs, "and that will answer just as well, so come along, and don't be bashful. I'm about as hungry as a bear, and I guess you are too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before many minutes, Paul sat down to a more bountiful repast than he had partaken of for many a day. There were warm biscuits and fresh butter, such as might please the palate of an epicure, while at the other end of the table was a plate of cake, flanked on one side by an apple-pie, on the other by one of pumpkin, with its rich golden hue, such as is to be found in its perfection, only in New England. It will scarcely be doubted that our hungry travellers did full justice to the fare set before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they had finished, they went into the public room, where were engaged some of the village worthies, intent on discussing the news and the political questions of the day. It was a time of considerable political excitement, and this naturally supplied the topic of conversation. In this the pedler joined, for his frequent travel on this route had made him familiarly acquainted with many of those present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul sat in a corner, trying to feel interested in the conversation; but the day had been a long one, and he had undergone an unusual amount of fatigue. Gradually, his drowsiness increased. The many voices fell upon his ears like a lullaby, and in a few minutes he was fast asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early next morning they were up and on their way. It was the second morning since Paul's departure. Already a sense of freedom gave his spirits unwonted elasticity, and encouraged him to hope for the best. Had his knowledge of the future been greater, his confidence might have been less. But would he have been any happier?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So many miles separated him from his late home, that he supposed himself quite safe from detection. A slight circumstance warned him that he must still be watchful and cautious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they were jogging easily along, they heard the noise of wheels at a little distance. Paul looked up. To his great alarms he recognized in the driver of the approaching vehicle, one of the selectmen of Wrenville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" asked his companion, noticing his sudden look of apprehension.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul quickly communicated the ground of his alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you are afraid he will want to carry you back, are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit of it. We'll circumvent the old fellow, unless he's sharper than I think he is. You've only got to do as I tell you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this Paul quickly agreed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The selectman was already within a hundred rods. He had not yet apparently noticed the pedler's cart, so that this was in our hero's favor. Mr. Stubbs had already arranged his plan of operations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is what you are to do, Paul," said he, quickly. "Cock your hat on the side of your head, considerably forward, so that he can't see much of your face. Then here's a cigar to stick in your mouth. You can make believe that you are smoking. If you are the sort of boy I reckon you are, he'll never think it's you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul instantly adopted this suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slipping his hat to one side in the jaunty manner characteristic of young America, he began to puff very gravely at a cigar the pedler handed him, frequently taking it from his mouth, as he had seen older persons do, to knock away the ashes. Nothwithstanding his alarm, his love of fun made him enjoy this little stratagem, in which he bore his part successfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The selectman eyed him intently. Paul began to tremble from fear of discovery, but his apprehensions were speedily dissipated by a remark of the new-comer, "My boy, you are forming a very bad habit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul did not dare to answer lest his voice should betray him. To his relief, the pedler spoke—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just what I tell him, sir, but I suppose he thinks he must do as his father does."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the vehicles had passed each other, and the immediate peril was over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Paul," said his companion, laughing, "I'll trouble you for that cigar, if you have done with it. The old gentleman's advice was good. If I'd never learned to smoke, I wouldn't begin now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero was glad to take the cigar from his mouth. The brief time he had held it was sufficient to make him slightly dizzy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XIII. PAUL REACHES THE CITY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TOWARDS evening they drew up before a small house with a neat yard in front.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess we'll get out here," said Mr. Stubbs. "There's a gentleman lives here that I feel pretty well acquainted with. Shouldn't wonder if he'd let us stop over Sunday. Whoa, Goliah, glad to get home, hey?" as the horse pricked up his ears and showed manifest signs of satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, youngster, follow me, and I guess I can promise you some supper, if Mrs. Stubbs hasn't forgotten her old tricks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They passed through the entry into the kitchen, where Mrs. Stubbs was discovered before the fire toasting slices of bread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lor, Jehoshaphat," said she, "I didn't expect you so soon," and she looked inquiringly at his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A young friend who is going to stay with us till Monday," explained the pedler. "His name is Paul Prescott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad to see you, Paul," said Mrs. Stubbs with a friendly smile. "You must be tired if you've been traveling far. Take a seat. Here's a rocking-chair for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This friendly greeting made Paul feel quite at home. Having no children, the pedler and his wife exerted themselves to make the time pass pleasantly to their young acquaintance. Paul could not help contrasting them with Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, not very much to the advantage of the latter. On Sunday he went to church with them, and the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed, made him listen to the sermon with unusual attention. It was an exposition of the text, "My help cometh from the Lord," and Paul could not help feeling that it was particularly applicable to his own case. It encouraged him to hope, that, however uncertain his prospects appeared, God would help him if he put his trust in Him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Monday morning Paul resumed his journey, with an ample stock of provisions supplied by Mrs. Stubbs, in the list of which doughnuts occupied a prominent place; this being at the particular suggestion of Mr. Stubbs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Forty or fifty miles remained to be traversed before his destination would be reached. The road was not a difficult one to find, and he made it out without much questioning. The first night, he sought permission to sleep in a barn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He met with a decided refusal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was about to turn away in disappointment, when he was called back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a little too fast, youngster. I said I wouldn't let you sleep in my barn, and I won't; but I've got a spare bed in the house, and if you choose you shall occupy it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the guise of roughness, this man had a kind heart. He inquired into the particulars of Paul's story, and at the conclusion terrified him by saying that he had been very foolish and ought to be sent back. Nevertheless, when Paul took leave of him the next morning, he did not go away empty-handed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you must be so foolish as to set up for yourself, take this," said the farmer, placing half a dollar in his hand. "You may reach the city after the banks are closed for the day, you know," he added, jocularly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it was in the morning that Paul came in sight of the city. He climbed up into a high tree, which, having the benefit of an elevated situation, afforded him an extensive prospect. Before him lay the great city of which he had so often heard, teeming with life and activity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Half in eager anticipation, half in awe and wonder at its vastness, our young pilgrim stood upon the threshold of this great Babel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Everything looked new and strange. It had never entered Paul's mind, that there could be so many houses in the whole State as now rose up before him. He got into Broadway, and walked on and on thinking that the street must end somewhere. But the farther he walked the thicker the houses seemed crowded together. Every few rods, too, he came to a cross street, which seemed quite as densely peopled as the one on which he was walking. One part of the city was the same as another to Paul, since he was equally a stranger to all. He wandered listlessly along, whither fancy led. His mind was constantly excited by the new and strange objects which met him at every step.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he was looking in at a shop window, a boy of about his own age, stopped and inquired confidentially, "when did you come from the country?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This morning," said Paul, wondering how a stranger should know that he was a country boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could you tell me what is the price of potatoes up your way?" asked the other boy, with perfect gravity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Paul, innocently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry for that," said the other, "as I have got to buy some for my wife and family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul stared in surprise for a moment, and then realizing that he was being made game of, began to grow angry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better go home to your wife and family," he said with spirit, "or you may get hurt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bully for you, country!" answered the other with a laugh. "You're not as green as you look."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Paul, "I wish I could say as much for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tired with walking, Paul at length sat down in a doorway, and watched with interest the hurrying crowds that passed before him. Everybody seemed to be in a hurry, pressing forward as if life and death depended on his haste. There were lawyers with their sharp, keen glances; merchants with calculating faces; speculators pondering on the chances of a rise or fall in stocks; errand boys with bundles under their arms; business men hurrying to the slip to take the boat for Brooklyn or Jersey City,—all seemed intent on business of some kind, even to the ragged newsboys who had just obtained their supply of evening papers, and were now crying them at the top of their voices,—and very discordant ones at that, so Paul thought. Of the hundreds passing and repassing before him, every one had something to do. Every one had a home to go to. Perhaps it was not altogether strange that a feeling of desolation should come over Paul as he recollected that he stood alone, homeless, friendless, and, it might be, shelterless for the coming night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yet," thought he with something of hopefulness, "there must be something for me to do as well as the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then a boy some two years older than Paul paced slowly by, and in passing, chanced to fix his eyes upon our hero. He probably saw something in Paul which attracted him, for he stepped up and extending his hand, said, "why, Tom, how came you here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name isn't Tom," said Paul, feeling a little puzzled by this address.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, so it isn't. But you look just like my friend, Tom Crocker."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this succeeded a few inquiries, which Paul unsuspiciously answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you like oysters?" inquired the new comer, after a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I know of a tip top place to get some, just round the corner. Wouldn't you like some?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul thanked his new acquaintance, and said he would.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without more ado, his companion ushered him into a basement room near by. He led the way into a curtained recess, and both boys took seats one on each side of a small table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just pull the bell, will you, and tell the waiter we'll have two stews."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul did so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose," continued the other, "the governor wouldn't like it much if he knew where I was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The governor!" repeated Paul. "Why, it isn't against the laws, is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," laughed the other. "I mean my father. How jolly queer you are!" He meant to say green, but had a purpose in not offending Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you the Governor's son?" asked Paul in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure," carelessly replied the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's wonder had been excited many times in the course of the day, but this was more surprising than anything which had yet befallen him. That he should have the luck to fall in with the son of the Governor, on his first arrival in the city, and that the latter should prove so affable and condescending, was indeed surprising. Paul inwardly determined to mention it in his first letter to Aunt Lucy. He could imagine her astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While he was busy with these thoughts, his companion had finished his oysters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Most through?" he inquired nonchalantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got to step out a minute; wait till I come back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul unsuspectingly assented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He heard his companion say a word to the barkeeper, and then go out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waited patiently for fifteen minutes and he did not return; another quarter of an hour, and he was still absent. Thinking he might have been unexpectedly detained, he rose to go, but was called back by the barkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hallo, youngster! are you going off without paying?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For what?" inquired Paul, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the oysters, of course. You don't suppose I give 'em away, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought," hesitated Paul, "that the one who was with me paid,—the Governor's son," he added, conscious of a certain pride in his intimacy with one so nearly related to the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Governor's son," laughed the barkeeper. "Why the Governor lives a hundred miles off and more. That wasn't the Governor's son any more than I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He called his father governor," said Paul, beginning to be afraid that he had made some ridiculous blunder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I wouldn't advise you to trust him again, even if he's the President's son. He only got you in here to pay for his oysters. He told me when he went out that you would pay for them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And didn't he say he was coming back?" asked Paul, quite dumbfounded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said you hadn't quite finished, but would pay for both when you came out. It's two shillings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul rather ruefully took out the half dollar which constituted his entire stock of money, and tendered it to the barkeeper who returned him the change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Paul went out into the streets, with his confidence in human nature somewhat lessened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, then, is our hero with twenty-five cents in his pocket, and his fortune to make.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XIV. A STRANGE BED-CHAMBER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALTHOUGH Paul could not help being vexed at having been so cleverly taken in by his late companion, he felt the better for having eaten the oysters. Carefully depositing his only remaining coin in his pocket, he resumed his wanderings. It is said that a hearty meal is a good promoter of cheerfulness. It was so in Paul's case, and although he had as yet had no idea where he should find shelter for the night he did not allow that consideration to trouble him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So the day passed, and the evening came on. Paul's appetite returned to him once more. He invested one-half of his money at an old woman's stall for cakes and apples, and then he ate leisurely while leaning against the iron railing which encircles the park.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He began to watch with interest the movements of those about him. Already the lamplighter had started on his accustomed round, and with ladder in hand was making his way from one lamp-post to another. Paul quite marvelled at the celerity with which the lamps were lighted, never before having witnessed the use of gas. He was so much interested in the process that he sauntered along behind the lamplighter for some time. At length his eye fel upon a group common enough in our cities, but new to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Italian, short and dark-featured, with a velvet cap, was grinding out music from a hand-organ, while a woman with a complexion equally dark, and black sorrowful-looking eyes, accompanied her husband on the tambourine. They were playing a lively tune as Paul came up, but quickly glided into "Home, Sweet Home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul listened with pleased, yet sad interest, for him "home" was only a sad remembrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He wandered on, pausing now and then to look into one of the brilliantly illuminated shop windows, or catching a glimpse through the open doors of the gay scene within, and as one after another of these lively scenes passed before him, he began to think that all the strange and wonderful things in the world must be collected in these rich stores.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next, he came to a place of public amusement. Crowds were entering constantly, and Paul, from curiosity, entered too. He passed on to a little wicket, when a man stopped him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's your ticket?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got any," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then what business have you here?" said the man, roughly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't this a meeting-house?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This remark seemed to amuse two boys who were standing by. Looking up with some indignation, Paul recognized in one of them the boy who had cheated him out of the oysters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Look here," said Paul, "what made you go off and leave me to pay for the oysters this morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which of us do you mean?" inquired the "governor's son," carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Really, I don't understand your meaning. Perhaps you mistake me for somebody else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?" said Paul, in great astonishment. "Don't you remember me, and how you told me you were the Governor's son?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both boys laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must be mistaken. I haven't the honor of being related to the distinguished gentleman you name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The speaker made a mocking bow to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that," said Paul, with spirit, "but you said you were, for all that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must have been some other good-looking boy, that you are mistaking me for. What are you going to do about it? I hope, by the way, that the oysters agreed with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, they did," said Paul, "for I came honestly by them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's got you there, Gerald," said the other boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul made his way out of the theater. As his funds were reduced to twelve cents, he could not have purchased a ticket if he had desired it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still he moved on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon he came to another building, which was in like manner lighted up, but not so brilliantly as the theater. This time, from the appearance of the building, and from the tall steeple,—so tall that his eye could scarcely reach the tapering spire,—he knew that it must be a church. There was not such a crowd gathered about the door as at the place he had just left, but he saw a few persons entering, and he joined them. The interior of the church was far more gorgeous than the plain village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend with his mother. He gazed about him with a feeling of awe, and sank quietly into a back pew. As it was a week-day evening, and nothing of unusual interest was anticipated, there were but few present, here and there one, scattered through the capacious edifice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By-and-by the organist commenced playing, and a flood of music, grander and more solemn than he had ever heard, filled the whole edifice. He listened with rapt attention and suspended breath till the last note died away, and then sank back upon the richly cushioned seat with a feeling of enjoyment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the services which followed he was not so much interested. The officiating clergyman delivered a long homily in a dull unimpassioned manner, which failed to awaken his interest. Already disposed to be drowsy, it acted upon him like a gentle soporific. He tried to pay attention as he had always been used to do, but owing to his occupying a back seat, and the low voice of the preacher, but few words reached him, and those for the most part were above his comprehension.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gradually the feeling of fatigue—for he had been walking the streets all day—became so powerful that his struggles to keep awake became harder and harder. In vain he sat erect, resolved not to yield. The moment afterwards his head inclined to one side; the lights began to swim before his eyes; the voice of the preacher subsided into a low and undistinguishable hum. Paul's head sank upon the cushion, his bundle, which had been his constant companion during the day, fell softly to the floor, and he fell into a deep sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile the sermon came to a close, and another hymn was sung, but even the music was insufficient to wake our hero now. So the benediction was pronounced, and the people opened the doors of their pews and left the church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last of all the sexton walked up and down the aisles, closing such of the pew doors as were open. Then he shut off the gas, and after looking around to see that nothing was forgotten, went out, apparently satisfied, and locked the outer door behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul, meanwhile, wholly unconscious of his situation, slept on as tranquilly as if there were nothing unusual in the circumstances in which he was placed. Through the stained windows the softened light fell upon his tranquil countenance, on which a smile played, as if his dreams were pleasant. What would Aunt Lucy have thought if she could have seen her young friend at this moment?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XV. A TURN OF FORTUNE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOTWITHSTANDING his singular bedchamber, Paul had a refreshing night's sleep from which he did not awake till the sun had fairly risen, and its rays colored by the medium through which they were reflected, streamed in at the windows and rested in many fantastic lines on the richly carved pulpit and luxurious pews.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul sprang to his feet and looked around him in bewilderment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where am I?" he exclaimed in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the momentary confusion of ideas which is apt to follow a sudden awakening, he could not remember where he was, or how he chanced to be there. But in a moment memory came to his aid, and he recalled the events of the preceding day, and saw that he must have been locked up in the church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How am I going to get out?" Paul asked himself in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the important question just now. He remembered that the village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend was rarely opened except on Sundays. What if this should be the case here? It was Thursday morning, and three days must elapse before his release. This would never do. He must seek some earlier mode of deliverance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went first to the windows, but found them so secured that it was impossible for him to get them open. He tried the doors, but found, as he had anticipated, that they were fast. His last resource failing, he was at liberty to follow the dictates of his curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finding a small door partly open, he peeped within, and found a flight of steep stairs rising before him. They wound round and round, and seemed almost interminable. At length, after he had become almost weary of ascending, he came to a small window, out of which he looked. At his feet lay the numberless roofs of the city, while not far away his eye rested on thousands of masts. The river sparkled in the sun, and Paul, in spite of his concern, could not help enjoying the scene. The sound of horses and carriages moving along the great thoroughfare below came confusedly to his ears. He leaned forward to look down, but the distance was so much greater than he had thought, that he drew back in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What shall I do?" Paul asked himself, rather frightened. "I wonder if I can stand going without food for three days? I suppose nobody would hear me if I should scream as loud as I could."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul shouted, but there was so much noise in the streets that nobody probably heard him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He descended the staircase, and once more found himself in the body of the church. He went up into the pulpit, but there seemed no hope of escape in that direction. There was a door leading out on one side, but this only led to a little room into which the minister retired before service.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It semed rather odd to Paul to find himself the sole occupant of so large a building. He began to wonder whether it would not have been better for him to stay in the poorhouse, than come to New York to die of starvation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just at this moment Paul heard a key rattle in the outer door. Filled with new hope, he ran down the pulpit stairs and out into the porch, just in time to see the entrance of the sexton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sexton started in surprise as his eye fell upon Paul standing before him, with his bundle under his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you come from, and how came you here?" he asked with some suspicion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I came in last night, and fell asleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you passed the night here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What made you come in at all?" inquired the sexton, who knew enough of boys to be curious upon this point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know where else to go," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul answered with perfect truth, "I don't live anywhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! Have you no home?" asked the sexton in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where should you have slept if you hadn't come in here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, I'm sure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I suppose you don't know where you shall sleep to-night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul signified that he did not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knew there were plenty of such cases," said the sexton, meditatively; "but I never seemed to realize it before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long have you been in New York?" was his next inquiry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not very long," said Paul. "I only got here yesterday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you don't know anybody in the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why did you come here, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I wanted to go somewhere where I could earn a living, and I thought I might find something to do here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But suppose you shouldn't find anything to do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Paul, slowly. "I haven't thought much about that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my lad," said the sexton, not unkindly, "I can't say your prospects look very bright. You should have good reasons for entering on such an undertaking. I—I don't think you are a bad boy. You don't look like a bad one," he added, half to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not, sir," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not, too. I was going to say that I wish I could help you to some kind of work. If you will come home with me, you shall be welcome to a dinner, and perhaps I may be able to think of something for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul gladly prepared to follow his new acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your name?" inquired the sexton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul Prescott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That sounds like a good name. I suppose you haven't got much money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only twelve cents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bless me! only twelve cents. Poor boy! you are indeed poor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I can work," said Paul, spiritedly. "I ought to be able to earn my living."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes, that's the way to feel. Heaven helps those who help themselves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they were fairly out of the church, Paul had an opportunity of observing his companion's external appearance. He was an elderly man, with harsh features, which would have been forbidding, but for a certain air of benevolence which softened their expression.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Paul walked along, he related, with less of detail, the story which is already known to the reader. The sexton said little except in the way of questions designed to elicit further particulars, till, at the conclusion he said, "Must tell Hester."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length they came to a small house, in a respectable but not fashionable quarter of the city. One-half of this was occupied by the sexton. He opened the door and led the way into the sitting-room. It was plainly but neatly furnished, the only ornament being one or two engravings cheaply framed and hung over the mantel-piece. They were by no means gems of art, but then, the sexton did not claim to be a connoisseur, and would probably not have understood the meaning of the word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit here a moment," said the sexton, pointing to a chair, "I'll go and speak to Hester."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul whiled away the time in looking at the pictures in a copy of "The Pilgrim's Progress," which lay on the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the next room sat a woman of perhaps fifty engaged in knitting. It was very easy to see that she could never have possessed the perishable gift of beauty. Hers was one of the faces on which nature has written plain , in unmistakable characters. Yet if the outward features had been a reflex of the soul within, few faces would have been more attractive than that of Hester Cameron. At the feet of the sexton's wife, for such she was, reposed a maltese cat, purring softly by way of showing her contentment. Indeed, she had good reason to be satisfied. In default of children, puss had become a privileged pet, being well fed and carefully shielded from all the perils that beset cat-hood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Home so soon?" said Hester inquiringly, as her husband opened the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Hester, and I have brought company with me," said the sexton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Company!" repeated his wife. "Who is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a poor boy, who was accidentally locked up in the church last night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he had to stay there all night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; but perhaps it was lucky for him, for he had no other place to sleep, and not money enough to pay for one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor child!" said Hester, compassionately. "Is it not terrible to think that any human creature should be without the comforts of a home which even our tabby possesses. It ought to make you thankful that you are so well cared for, Tab."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cat opened her eyes and winked drowsily at her mistress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you brought the poor boy home, Hugh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Hester,—I thought we ought not to begrudge a meal to one less favored by fortune than ourselves. You know we should consider ourselves the almoners of God's bounties."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Surely, Hugh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knew you would feel so, Hester. And suppose we have the chicken for dinner that I sent in the morning. I begin to have a famous appetite. I think I should enjoy it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hester knew perfectly well that it was for Paul's sake, and not for his own, that her husband spoke. But she so far entered into his feelings, that she determined to expend her utmost skill as cook upon the dinner, that Paul might have at least one good meal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I will bring the boy in," said he. "I am obliged to go to work, but you will find some way to entertain him, I dare say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you will come out (this he said to Paul), I will introduce you to a new friend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was kindly welcomed by the sexton's wife, who questioned him in a sympathizing tone about his enforced stay in the church. To all her questions Paul answered in a modest yet manly fashion, so as to produce a decidedly favorable impression upon his entertainer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero was a handsome boy. Just at present he was somewhat thin, not having entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness and poor fare while a member of Mr. Mudge's family; but he was well made, and bade fair to become a stout boy. His manner was free and unembarrassed, and he carried a letter of recommendation in his face. It must be admitted, however that there were two points in which his appearance might have been improved. Both his hands and face had suffered from the dust of travel. His clothes, too, were full of dust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A single glance told Hester all this, and she resolved to remedy it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She quietly got some water and a towel, and requested Paul to pull off his jacket, which she dusted while he was performing his ablutions. Then, with the help of a comb to arrange his disordered hair, he seemed quite like a new boy, and felt quite refreshed by the operation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Really, it improves him very much," said Hester to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She couldn't help recalling a boy of her own, —the only child she ever had,—who had been accidentally drowned when about the age of Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he had only lived," she thought, "how different might have been our lives."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A thought came into her mind, and she looked earnestly at Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—yes I will speak to Hugh about it," she said, speaking aloud, unconsciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you speak to me?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No,—I was thinking of something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She observed that Paul was looking rather wistfully at a loaf of bread on the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you feel hungry?" she asked, kindly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dare say you have had no breakfast."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have eaten nothing since yesterday afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bless my soul! How hungry you must be!" said the good woman, as she bustled about to get a plate of butter and a knife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She must have been convinced of it by the rapid manner in which the slices of bread and butter disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At one o'clock the sexton came home. Dinner was laid, and Paul partook of it with an appetite little affected by his lunch of the morning. As he rose from the table, he took his cap, and saying, "Good-by, I thank you very much for your kindness!" he was about to depart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going?" asked the sexton, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," answered Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop a minute. Hester, I want to speak to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went into the sitting-room together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This boy, Hester," he commenced with hesitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Hugh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has no home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a hard lot."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think we should be the worse off if we offered to share our home with him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is like your kind heart, Hugh. Let us go and tell him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We have been talking of you, Paul," said the sexton. "We have thought, Hester and myself, that as you had no home and we no child, we should all be the gainers by your staying with us. Do you consent?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Consent!" echoed Paul in joyful surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can I ever repay your kindness?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are the boy we take you for, we shall feel abundantly repaid. Hester, we can give Paul the little bedroom where—where John used to sleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His voice faltered a little, for John was the name of his boy, who had ben drowned.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XVI. YOUNG STUPID.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PAUL found the sexton's dwelling very different from his last home, if the Poorhouse under the charge of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge de served such a name. His present home was an humble one, but he was provided with every needful comfort, and the atmosphere of kindness which surrounded him, gave him a feeling of peace and happiness which he had not enjoyed for a long time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul supposed that he would be at once set to work, and even then would have accounted himself fortunate in possessing such a home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Mr. Cameron had other views for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you fond of studying?" asked the sexton, as they were all three gathered in the little sitting room, an evening or two after Paul first came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very much!" replied our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And would you like to go to school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, here in New York?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, very much indeed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to hear you say so, my lad. There is nothing like a good education. If I had a son of my own, I would rather leave him that than money, for while the last may be lost, the first never can be. And though you are not my son, Paul, Providence has in a manner conducted you to me, and I feel responsible for your future. So you shall go to school next Monday morning, and I hope you will do yourself much credit there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you very much," said Paul. "I feel very grateful, but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You surely are not going to object?" said the sexton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Paul, go on," seeing that the boy hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why," said our hero, with a sense of delicacy which did him credit, "If I go to school, I shall not be able to earn my board, and shall be living at your expense, though I have no claim upon you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, is that all?" said the sexton cheerfully, "I was afraid that it was something more serious. As to that, I am not rich, and never expect to be. But what little expense you will be will not ruin me. Besides, when you are grown up and doing well, you can repay me, if I ever need it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That I will," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind, if I ever need it,—not otherwise. There, now, it's a bargain on that condition. You haven't any other objection," seeing that Paul still hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, or at least I should like to ask your advice," said Paul. "Just before my father died, he told me of a debt of five hundred dollars which he had not been able to pay. I saw that it troubled him, and I promised to pay it whenever I was able. I don't know but I ought to go to work so as to keep my promise."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the sexton after a moment's reflection, "the best course will be to go to school, at present. Knowledge is power, and a good education will help you to make money by and by. I approve your resolution, my lad, and if you keep it resolutely in mind I have no doubt you will accomplish your object. But the quickest road to success is through the schoolroom. At present you are not able to earn much. Two or three years hence will be time enough."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's face brightened as the sexton said this. He instinctively felt that Mr. Cameron was right. He had never forgotten his father's dying injunction, and this was one reason that impelled him to run away from the Almshouse, because he felt that while he remained he never would be in a situation to carry out his father's wishes. Now his duty was reconciled with his pleasure, and he gratefully accepted the sexton's suggestions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next Monday morning, in accordance with the arrangement which had just been agreed upon, Paul repaired to school. He was at once placed in a class, and lessons were assigned him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first his progress was not rapid. While living in Wrenville he had an opportunity only of attending a country school, kept less than six months in the year, and then not affording advantages to be compared with those of a city school. During his father's sickness, besides, he had been kept from school altogether. Of course all this lost time could not be made up in a moment. Therefore it was that Paul lagged behind his class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are generally some in every school, who are disposed to take unfair advantage of their schoolmates, or to ridicule those whom they consider inferior to themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one such in Paul's class. His name was George Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was rather a showy boy, and learned easily. He might have stood a class above where he was, if he had not been lazy, and depended too much on his natural talent. As it was, he maintained the foremost rank in his class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better be the first man in a village than the second man in Rome," he used to say; and as his present position not only gave him the pre-eminence which he desired, but cost him very little exertion to maintain, he was quite well satisfied with it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This boy stood first in his class, while Paul entered at the foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laughed unmercifully at the frequent mistakes of our hero, and jeeringly dubbed him, "Young Stupid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know what Dawkins calls you?" asked one of the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. What does he call me?" asked Paul, seriously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He calls you `Young Stupid.' "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's face flushed painfully. Ridicule was as painful to him as it is to most boys, and he felt the insult deeply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd fight him if I were you," was the volunteered advice of his informant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Paul. "That wouldn't mend the matter. Besides, I don't know but he has some reason for thinking so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't call yourself stupid, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I am not as far advanced as most boys of my age. That isn't my fault, though. I never had a chance to go to school much. If I had been to school all my life, as Dawkins has, it would be time to find out whether I am stupid or not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you ain't going to do anything about it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You said you wasn't going to fight him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That wouldn't do any good. But I'm going to study up and see if I can't get ahead of him. Don't you think that will be the best way of showing him that he is mistaken?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, capital, but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you think I can't do it, I suppose," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know he is at the head of the class, and you are at the foot."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that," said Paul, resolutely. "But wait awhile and see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In some way George Dawkins learned that Paul had expressed the determination to dispute his place. It occasioned him considerable amusement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Halloa, Young Stupid," he called out, at recess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul did not answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you answer when you are spoken to?" he asked angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When you call me by my right name," said Paul, quietly, "I will answer, and not before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're mighty independent," sneered Dawkins. "I don't know but I may have to teach you manners."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better wait till you are qualified," said Paul, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins approached our hero menacingly, but Paul did not look in the least alarmed, and he concluded to attack him with words only.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand you have set yourself up as my rival!" he said, mockingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not just yet," said Paul, "but in time I expect to be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you expect my place," said Dawkins, glancing about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll talk about that three months hence," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't hurt yourself studying," sneered Dawkins, scornfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this Paul did not deign a reply, but the same day he rose one in his class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero had a large stock of energy and determination. When he had once set his mind upon a thing, he kept steadily at work till he accomplished it. This is the great secret of success. It sometimes happens that a man who has done nothing will at once accomplish a brilliant success by one spasmodic effort, but such cases are extremely rare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Slow and sure wins the race," is an old proverb that has a great deal of truth in it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul worked industriously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kind sexton and his wife, who noticed his assiduity, strove to dissuade him from working so steadily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are working too hard, Paul," they said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do I look pale?" asked Paul, pointing with a smile to his red cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but you will before long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I am, I will study less. But you know, Uncle Hugh," so the sexton instructed him to call him, "I want to make the most of my present advantages. Besides, there's a particular boy who thinks I am stupid. I want to convince him that he is mistaken."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a little ambitious, then, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but it isn't that alone. I know the value of knowledge, and I want to secure as much as I can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is an excellent motive, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you won't make me study less?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not unless I see you are getting sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul took good care of this. He knew how to play as well as to study, and his laugh on the playground was as merry as any. His cheerful, obliging disposition made him a favorite with his companions. Only George Dawkins held out; he had, for some reason, inbibed a dislike for Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's industry was not without effect. He gradually gained position in his class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take care, Dawkins," said one of his companions—the same one who had before spoken to Paul—"Paul Prescott will be disputing your place with you. He has come up seventeen places in a month."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Much good it'll do him," said Dawkins, contemptuously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For all that, you will have to be careful; I can tell you that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not in the least afraid. I'm a little too firm in my position to be ousted by Young Stupid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just wait and see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins really entertained no apprehension. He had unbounded confidence in himself, and felt a sense of power in the rapidity with which he could master a lesson. He therefore did not study much, and though he could not but see that Paul was rapidly advancing, he rejected with scorn the idea that Young Stupid could displace him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This, however, was the object at which Paul was aiming. He had not forgotten the nickname which Dawkins had given him, and this was the revenge which he sought,—a strictly honorable one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length the day of his triumph came. At the end of the month the master read off the class-list, and, much to his disgust, George Dawkins found himself playing second fiddle to Young Stupid.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XVII. BEN'S PRACTICAL JOKE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. MUDGE was in the back room, bending over a tub. It was washing-day, and she was particularly busy. She was a driving, bustling woman, and, whatever might be her faults of temper, she was at least industrious and energetic. Had Mr. Mudge been equally so, they would have been better off in a worldly point of view. But her husband was constitutionally lazy, and was never disposed to do more than was needful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was in a bad humor that morning. One of the cows had got into the garden through a gap in the fence, and made sad havoc among the cabbages. Now if Mrs. Mudge had a weakness, it was for cabbages. She was excessively fond of them, and had persuaded her husband to set out a large number of plants from which she expected a large crop. They were planted in one corner of the garden, adjoining a piece of land, which, since mowing, had been used for pasturing the cows. There was a weak place in the fence separating the two inclosures, and this Mrs. Mudge had requested her husband to attend to. He readily promised this, and Mrs. Mudge supposed it done, until that same morning, her sharp eyes had detected old Brindle munching the treasured cabbages with a provoking air of enjoyment. The angry lady seized a broom, and repaired quickly to the scene of devastation. Brindle scented the danger from afar, and beat a disorderly retreat, trampling down the cabbages which she had hitherto spared. Leaping over the broken fence, she had just cleared the gap as the broom-handle, missing her, came forcibly down upon the rail, and was snapped in sunder by the blow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here was a new vexation. Brindle had not only escaped scot-free, but the broom, a new one, bought only the week before, was broken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a plaguy shame," said Mrs. Mudge, angrily. "There's my best broom broken; cost forty-two cents only last week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned and contemplated the scene of devastation. This yielded her little consolation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At least thirty cabbages destroyed by that scamp of a cow," she exclaimed in a tone bordering on despair. "I wish I'd a hit her. If I'd broken my broom over her back I wouldn't a cared so much. And it's all Mudge's fault. He's the most shiftless man I ever see. I'll give him a dressing down, see if I don't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge's eyes snapped viciously, and she clutched the relics of the broom with a degree of energy which rendered it uncertain what sort of a dressing down she intended for her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ten minutes after she had re-entered the kitchen, the luckless man made his appearance. He wore his usual look, little dreaming of the storm that awaited him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you've come," said Mrs. Mudge, grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's amiss, now?" inquired Mudge, for he understood her look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's amiss?" blazed Mrs. Mudge. "I'll let you know. Do you see this?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seized the broken broom and flourished it in his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Broken your broom, have you? You must have been careless."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Careless, was I?" demanded Mrs. Mudge, sarcastically. "Yes, of course, it's always I that am in fault."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't broken it over the back of any of the paupers, have you?" asked her husband, who, knowing his helpmeet's infirmity of temper, thought it possible she might have indulged in such an amusement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I had broken it over anybody's back it would have been yours," said the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mine! what have I been doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's what you haven't done," said Mrs. Mudge. "You're about the laziest and most shiftless man I ever came across."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, what does all this mean?" demanded Mr. Mudge, who was getting a little angry in his turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll let you know. Just look out of that window, will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Mr. Mudge, innocently, "I don't see anything in particular."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't!" said Mrs. Mudge with withering sarcasm. "Then you'd better put on your glasses. If you'd been here quarter of an hour ago, you'd have seen Brindle among the cabbages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did she do any harm?" asked Mr. Mudge, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's scarcely a cabbage left," returned Mrs. Mudge, purposely exaggerating the mischief done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you had mended that fence, as I told you to do, time and again, it wouldn't have happened."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't tell me but once," said Mr. Mudge, trying to get up a feeble defence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once should have been enough, and more than enough. You expect me to slave myself to death in the house, and see to all your work besides. If I'd known what a lazy, shiftless man you were, at the time I married you, I'd have cut off my right hand first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time Mr. Mudge had become angry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you hadn't married me, you'd a died an old maid," he retorted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was too much for Mrs. Mudge to bear. She snatched the larger half of the broom, and fetched it down with considerable emphasis upon the back of her liege lord, who, perceiving that her temper was up, retreated hastily from the kitchen; as he got into the yard he descried Brindle, whose appetite had been whetted by her previous raid, re-entering the garden through the gap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was an unfortunate attempt on the part of Brindle. Mr. Mudge, angry with his wife, and smarting with the blow from the broomstick, determined to avenge himself upon the original cause of all the trouble. Revenge suggested craft. He seized a hoe, and crept stealthily to the cabbage-plot. Brindle, whose back was turned, did not perceive his approach, until she felt a shower of blows upon her back. Confused at the unexpected attack she darted wildly away, forgetting the gap in the fence, and raced at random over beds of vegetables, uprooting beets, parsnips, and turnips, while Mr. Mudge, mad with rage, followed close in her tracks, hitting her with the hoe whenever he got a chance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Brindle galloped through the yard, and out at the open gate. Thence she ran up the road at the top of her speed, with Mr. Mudge still pursuing her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may be mentioned here that Mr. Mudge was compelled to chase the terrified cow over two miles before he succeeded with the help of a neighbor in capturing her. All this took time. Meanwhile Mrs. Mudge at home was subjected to yet another trial of her temper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has already been mentioned that Squire Newcome was Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor. In virtue of his office, he was expected to exercise a general supervision over the Almshouse and its management. It was his custom to call about once a month to look after matters, and ascertain whether any official action or interference was needed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben saw his father take his gold-headed cane from behind the door, and start down the road. He understood his destination, and instantly the plan of a stupendous practical joke dawned upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It'll be jolly fun," he said to himself, his eyes dancing with fun. "I'll try it, anyway."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took his way across the fields, so as to reach the Almshouse before his father. He then commenced his plan of operations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge had returned to her tub, and was washing away with bitter energy, thinking over her grievances in the matter of Mr. Mudge, when a knock was heard at the front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking her hands from the tub, she wiped them on her apron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish folks wouldn't come on washing day!" she said in a tone of vexation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She went to the door and opened it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nobody there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought somebody knocked," thought she, a little mystified. "Perhaps I was mistaken."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She went back to her tub, and had no sooner got her hands in the suds than another knock was heard, this time on the back door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I declare!" said she, in increased vexation, "There's another knock. I shan't get through my washing to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again Mrs. Mudge wiped her hands on her apron, and went to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nobody there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I need hardly say that it was Ben, who had knocked both times, and instantly dodged round the corner of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's some plaguy boy," said Mrs. Mudge, her eyes blazing with anger. "Oh, if I could only get hold of him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you wish you could?" chuckled Ben to himself, as he caught a sly glimpse of the indignant woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, Squire Newcome had walked along in his usual slow and dignified manner, until he had reached the front door of the Poorhouse, and knocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's that plaguy boy again," said Mrs. Mudge, furiously. "I won't go this time, but if he knocks again, I'll fix him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She took a dipper of hot suds from the tub in which she had been washing, and crept carefully into the entry, taking up a station close to the front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if Mrs. Mudge heard me knock," thought Squire Newcome. "I should think she might. I believe I will knock again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This time he knocked with his cane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rat-tat-tat sounded on the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The echo had not died away, when the door was pulled suddenly open, and a dipper full of hot suds was dashed into the face of the astonished Squire, accompanied with, "Take that, you young scamp!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wh—what does all this mean?" gasped Squire Newcome, nearly strangled with the suds, a part of which had found its way into his mouth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I beg your pardon, Squire Newcome," said the horrified Mrs. Mudge. "I didn't mean it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you mean, then?" demanded Squire Newcome, sternly. "I think you addressed me,—ahem!—as a scamp."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I didn't mean you," said Mrs. Mudge, almost out of her wits with perplexity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in, sir, and let me give you a towel. You've no idea how I've been tried this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I trust," said the Squire, in his stateliest tone, "you will be able to give a satisfactory explanation of this, ahem—extraordinary proceeding."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Mrs. Mudge was endeavoring to sooth the ruffled dignity of the aggrieved Squire, the "young scamp," who had caused all the mischief, made his escape through the fields.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, wasn't it bully!" he exclaimed. "I believe I shall die of laughing. I wish Paul had been here to see it. Mrs. Mudge has got herself into a scrape, now, I'm thinking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having attained a safe distance from the Poorhouse, Ben doubled himself up and rolled over and over upon the grass, convulsed with laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd give five dollars to see it all over again," he said to himself. "I never had such splendid fun in my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently the Squire emerged, his tall dicky looking decidedly limp and drooping, his face expressing annoyance and outraged dignity. Mrs. Mudge attended him to the door with an expression of anxious concern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I'd better make tracks," said Ben to himself, "it won't do for the old gentleman to see me here, or he may smell a rat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He accordingly scrambled over a stone wall and lay quietly hidden behind it till he judged it would be safe to make his appearance.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XVIII. MORE ABOUT BEN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"BENJAMIN," said Squire Newcome, two days after the occurrence mentioned in the last chapter, "what made the dog howl so this morning? Was you a doing anything to him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I gave him his breakfast," said Ben, innocently. "Perhaps he was hungry, and howling for that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not refer to that," said the Squire. "He howled as if in pain or terror. I repeat; was you a doing anything to him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben shifted from one foot to the other, and looked out of the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I desire a categorical answer," said Squire Newcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't know what categorical means," said Ben, assuming a perplexed look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I desire you to answer me immegiately ," explained the Squire. "What was you a doing to Watch?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was tying a tin-kettle to his tail," said Ben, a little reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what was you a doing that for?" pursued the Squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wanted to see how he would look," said Ben, glancing demurely at his father, out of the corner of his eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did it ever occur to you that it must be disagreeable to Watch to have such an appendage to his tail?" queried the Squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How should you like to have a tin pail suspended to your—ahem! your coat tail?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got any coat tail," said Ben, "I wear jackets. But I think I am old enough to wear coats. Can't I have one made, father?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ahem!" said the Squire, blowing his nose, "we will speak of that at some future period."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fred Newell wears a coat, and he isn't any older than I am," persisted Ben, who was desirous of interrupting his father's inquiries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I apprehend that we are wandering from the question," said the Squire. "Would you like to be treated as you treated Watch?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Ben, slowly, "I don't know as I should."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then take care not to repeat your conduct of this morning," said his father. "Stay a moment," as Ben was about to leave the room hastily. "I desire that you should go to the post-office and inquire for letters."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben left the room and sauntered out in the direction of the post-office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A chaise, driven by a stranger, stopped as it came up with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The driver looked towards Ben, and inquired, "Boy, is this the way to Sparta?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben, who was walking leisurely along the path, whistling as he went, never turned his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you deaf, boy?" said the driver, impatiently. "I want to know if this is the road to Sparta?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben turned round.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fine morning, sir," he said politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that well enough without your telling me. Will you tell me whether this is the road to Sparta?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben put his hand to his ear, and seemed to listen attentively. Then he slowly shook his head, and said, "Would you be kind enough to speak a little louder, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The boy is deaf, after all," said the driver to himself. "IS THIS THE ROAD TO SPARTA?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, this is Wrenville," said Ben, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Plague take it! he don't hear me yet. IS THIS THE ROAD TO SPARTA?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a little louder, if you please," said Ben, keeping his hand to his ear, and appearing anxious to hear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Deaf as a post!" muttered the driver. "I couldn't scream any louder, if I should try. Go along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor man! I hope he hasn't injured his voice," thought Ben, his eyes dancing with fun. "By gracious!" he continued a moment later, bursting into a laugh, "if he isn't going to ask the way of old Tom Haven. He's as deaf as I pretended to be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The driver had reined up again, and inquired the way to Sparta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you say?" said the old man, putting his hand to his ear. "I'm rather hard of hearing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The traveller repeated his question in a louder voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you'd better ask that boy," he said, pointing to Ben, who by this time had nearly come up with the chaise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have had enough of him," said the traveller, disgusted. "I believe you're all deaf in this town. I'll get out of it as soon as possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He whipped up his horse, somewhat to the old man's surprise, and drove rapidly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I desire my young readers to understand that I am describing Ben as he was, and not as he ought to be. There is no doubt that he carried his love of fun too far. We will hope that as he grows older, he will grow wiser.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben pursued the remainder of his way to the Post-office without any further adventure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Entering a small building appropriated to this purpose, he inquired for letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's nothing for your father to-day," said the post-master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps there's something for me,— Benjamin Newcome, Esq.," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me see," said the post-master, putting on his spectacles; "yes, I believe there is. Post-marked at New York, too. I didn't know you had any correspondents there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's probably from the Mayor of New York," said Ben, in a tone of comical importance, "asking my advice about laying out Central Park."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably it is," said the postmaster. "It's a pretty thick letter,—looks like an official document."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time, Ben, who was really surprised by the reception of the letter, had opened it. It proved to be from our hero, Paul Prescott, and inclosed one for Aunt Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Crosby," said Ben, suddenly, addressing the postmaster, "you remember about Paul Prescott's running away from the Poorhouse?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I didn't blame the poor boy a bit. I never liked Mudge, and they say his wife is worse than he."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, suppose the town should find out where he is, could they get him back again?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bless you! no. They ain't so fond of supporting paupers. If he's able to earn his own living, they won't want to interfere with him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, this letter is from him," said Ben. "He's found a pleasant family in New York, who have adopted him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad of it," said Mr. Crosby, heartily. "I always liked him. He was a fine fellow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what I think. I'll read his letter to you, if you would like to hear it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should, very much. Come in behind here, and sit down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben went inside the office, and sitting down on a stool, read Paul's letter. As our reader may be interested in the contents, we will take the liberty of looking over Ben's shoulder while he reads. New York, Oct. 10, 18—. DEAR BEN:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been intending to write to you before, knowing the kind interest which you take in me. I got safely to New York a few days after I left Wrenville. I didn't have so hard a time as I expected, having fallen in with a pedler, who was very kind to me, with whom I rode thirty or forty miles. I wish I had time to tell all the adventures I met with on the way, but I must wait till I see you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I got to the city, I was astonished to find how large it was. The first day I got pretty tired wandering about, and strayed into a church in the evening, not knowing where else to go. I was so tired I fell asleep there, and didn't wake up till morning. When I found myself locked up in a great church, I was frightened, I can tell you. It was only Thursday morning, and I was afraid I should have to stay there till Sunday. If I had, I am afraid I should have starved to death. But, fortunately for me, the sexton came in the morning, and let me out. That wasn't all. He very kindly took me home with him, and then told me I might live with him and go to school. I like him very much, and his wife too. I call them Uncle Hugh and Aunt Hester. When you write to me, you must direct to the care of Mr. Hugh Cameron, 10 R— Street. Then it will be sure to reach me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going to one of the city schools. At first, I was a good deal troubled because I was so far behind boys of my age. You know I hadn't been to school for a long time before I left Wrenville, on account of father's sickness. But I studied pretty hard, and now I stand very well. I sometimes think, Ben, that you don't care quite so much about study as you ought to. I wish you would come to feel the importance of it. You must excuse me saying this, as we have always been such good friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sometimes think of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, and wonder whether they miss me much. I am sure Mr. Mudge misses me, for now he is obliged to get up early and milk, unless he has found another boy to do it. If he has, I pity the boy. Write me what they said about my going away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I inclose a letter for Aunt Lucy Lee, which I should like to have you give her with your own hands. Don't trust it to Mrs. Mudge, for she doesn't like Aunt Lucy, and I don't think she would give it to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write soon, Ben, and I will answer without delay, Your affectionate friend, PAUL PRESCOTT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a very good letter," said Mr. Crosby; "I am glad Paul is doing so well. I should like to see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So should I," said Ben; "he was a prime fellow,—twice as good as I am. That's true, what he said about my not liking study. I guess I'll try to do better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll make a smart boy if you only try," said the postmaster, with whom Ben was rather a favorite, in spite of his mischievous propensities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Ben, laughing, "that's what my friend, the mayor of New York, often writes me. But honestly, I know I can do a good deal better than I am doing now. I don't know but I shall turn over a new leaf. I suppose I like fun a little too well. Such jolly sport as I had coming to the office this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben related the story of the traveller who inquired the way to Sparta, much to the amusement of the postmaster, who, in his enjoyment of the joke, forgot to tell Ben that his conduct was hardly justifiable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Ben, "as soon as I have been home, I must go and see my particular friend, Mrs. Mudge. I'm a great favorite of hers," he added, with a sly wink.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XIX. MRS. MUDGE'S DISCOMFITURE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BEN knocked at the door of the Poorhouse. In due time Mrs. Mudge appeared. She was a little alarmed on seeing Ben, not knowing how Squire Newcome might be affected by the reception she had given him on his last visit. Accordingly she received him with unusual politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Master Newcome?" she inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As well as could be expected," said Ben, hesitatingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, is there anything the matter with you?" inquired Mrs. Mudge, her curiosity excited by his manner of speaking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No one can tell what I suffer from rheumatism," said Ben, sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was very true, since not even Ben himself could have told.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very young to be troubled in that way," said Mrs. Mudge, "and how is your respected father, to-day?" she inquired, with some anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was just going to ask you, Mrs. Mudge," said Ben, "whether anything happened to disturb him when he called here day before yesterday?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why," said Mrs. Mudge, turning a little pale, "Nothing of any consequence,—that is, not much. What makes you ask?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought it might be so from his manner," said Ben, enjoying Mrs. Mudge's evident alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There was a little accident," said Mrs. Mudge, reluctantly. "Some mischievous boy had been knocking and running away; so, when your father knocked, I thought it might be he, and—and I believe I threw some water on him. But I hope he has forgiven it, as it wasn't intentional. I should like to get hold of that boy," said Mrs. Mudge, wrathfully, "I should like to shake him up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any idea who it was?" asked Ben, gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Mrs. Mudge, "I haven't, but I shall try to find out. Whoever it is, he's a scamp."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very complimentary old lady," thought Ben. He said in a sober tone, which would have imposed upon any one, "There are a good many mischievous boys around here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge grimly assented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, by the way, Mrs. Mudge," asked Ben, suddenly, "have you ever heard anything of Paul Prescott since he left you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," snapped Mrs. Mudge, her countenance growing dark, "I haven't. But I can tell pretty well where he is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the penitentiary. At any rate, if he isn't, he ought to be. But what was you wanting?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to see Mrs. Lee."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Lucy Lee?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I've got a letter for her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you'll give me the letter I'll carry it to her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Ben, "but I would like to see her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," thought Mrs. Mudge, "I'll get hold of it yet. I shouldn't wonder at all if it was from that rascal, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Paul! It was fortunate that he had some better friends than Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, otherwise he would have been pretty poorly off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy came to the door. Ben placed the letter in her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it from Paul?" she asked, hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She opened it eagerly. "Is he well?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, well and happy," said Ben, who treated the old lady, for whom he had much respect, very differently from Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm truly thankful for that," said Aunt Lucy; "I've laid awake more than one night thinking of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So has Mrs. Mudge, I'm thinking," said Ben, slyly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't much love lost between them," said Aunt Lucy, smiling. "He was very badly treated here, poor boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was he, though?" repeated Mrs. Mudge? who had been listening at the keyhole, but not in an audible voice. "Perhaps he will be again, if I get him back. I thought that letter was from Paul. I must get hold of it some time to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I must go," said Ben. "If you answer the letter, I will put it into the office for you. I shall be passing here to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind," said Aunt Lucy. "I am very much obliged to you for bringing me this letter to-day. You can't tell how happy it makes me. I have been so afraid the dear boy might be suffering."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's no trouble at all," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's a pretty good woman," thought he, as he left the house. "I wouldn't play a trick on her for a good deal. But that Mrs. Mudge is a hard case. I wonder what she would have said if she had known that I was the "scamp" that troubled her so much Monday. If I had such a mother as that, by jingo, I'd run away to sea."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was bent upon reading Aunt Lucy's letter. Knowing it to be from Paul, she had a strong curiosity to know what had become of him. If she could only get him back! Her heart bounded with delight as she thought of the annoyances to which, in that case, she could subject him. It would be a double triumph over him and Aunt Lucy, against whom she felt that mean spite with which a superior nature is often regarded by one of a lower order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After some reflection, Mrs. Mudge concluded that Aunt Lucy would probably leave the letter in the little chest which was appropriated to her use, and which was kept in the room where she slept. The key of this chest had been lost, and although Aunt Lucy had repeatedly requested that a new one should be obtained, Mrs. Mudge had seen fit to pay no attention to her request, as it would interfere with purposes of her own, the character of which may easily be guessed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As she suspected, Paul's letter had been deposited in this chest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly, the same afternoon, she left her work in the kitchen in order to institute a search for it. As a prudent precaution, however, she just opened the door of the common room, to make sure that Aunt Lucy was at work therein.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made her way upstairs, and entering the room in which the old lady lodged, together with two others, she at once went to the chest and opened it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She began to rummage round among the old lady's scanty treasures, and at length, much to her joy, happened upon the letter, laid carefully away in one corner of the chest. She knew it was the one she sought, from the recent postmark, and the address, which was in the unformed handwriting of a boy. To make absolutely certain, she drew the letter from the envelope and looked at the signature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was right, as she saw at a glance. It was from Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I'll see what the little rascal has to say for himself," she muttered, "I hope he's in distress; oh, how I'd like to get hold of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge began eagerly to read the letter, not dreaming of interruption. But she was destined to be disappointed. To account for this we must explain that, shortly after Mrs. Mudge looked into the common room, Aunt Lucy was reminded of something essential, which she had left upstairs. She accordingly laid down her work upon the chair in which she had been sitting, and went up to her chamber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was too much preoccupied to hear the advancing steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the old lady entered the chamber, what was her mingled indignation and dismay at seeing Mrs. Mudge on her knees before her chest, with the precious letter, whose arrival had gladdened her so much, in her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you doing there, Mrs. Mudge?" she said, sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge rose from her knees in confusion. Even she had the grace to be ashamed of her conduct.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Put down that letter," said the old lady in an authoritative voice quite new to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge, who had not yet collected her scattered senses, did as she was requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy walked hastily to the chest, and closed it, first securing the letter, which she put in her pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope it will be safe, now," she said, rather contemptuously. "Ain't you ashamed of yourself, Mrs. Mudge?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ashamed of myself!" shrieked that amiable lady, indignant with herself for having quailed for a moment before the old lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean—you—you pauper?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I may be a pauper," said Aunt Lucy, calmly, "But I am thankful to say that I mind my own business, and don't meddle with other people's chests."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A red spot glowed on either cheek of Mrs. Mudge. She was trying hard to find some vantage-ground over the old lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to say that I don't mind my business?" she blustered, folding her arms defiantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What were you at my trunk for?" said the old lady, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because it was my duty," was the brazen reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge had rapidly determined upon her line of defense, and thought it best to carry the war into the enemy's country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I felt sure that your letter was from Paul Prescott, and as he ran away from my husband and me, who were his lawful guardians, it was my duty to take that means of finding out where he is. I knew that you were in league with him, and would do all you could to screen him. This is why I went to your chest, and I would do it again, if necessary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you have been before," said Aunt Lucy, scornfully. "I think I understand, now, why you were unwilling to give me another key. Fortunately there has been nothing there until now to reward your search."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You impudent trollop!" shrieked Mrs. Mudge, furiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her anger was the greater, because Aunt Lucy was entirely correct in her supposition that this was not the first visit her landlady had made to the little green chest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll give Paul the worst whipping he ever had, when I get him back," said Mrs. Mudge, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is beyond your reach, thank Providence," said Aunt Lucy, whose equanimity was not disturbed by this menace, which she knew to be an idle one. "That is enough for you to know. I will take care that you never have another chance to see this letter. And if you ever go to my chest again"—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ma'am, what then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall appeal for protection to 'Squire Newcome."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hoity, toity," said Mrs. Mudge, but she was a little alarmed, nevertheless, as such an appeal would probably be prejudicial to her interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So from time to time Aunt Lucy received, through Ben, letters from Paul, which kept her acquainted with his progress at school. These letters were very precious to the old lady, and she read them over many times. They formed a bright link of interest which bound her to the outside world, and enabled her to bear up with greater cheerfulness against the tyranny of Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XX. PAUL OBTAINS A SITUATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE month after Paul Prescott succeeded in reaching the head of his class, George Dawkins exerted himself to rise above him. He studied better than usual, and proved in truth a formidable rival. But Paul's spirit was roused. He resolved to maintain his position if possible. He had now become accustomed to study, and it cost him less effort. When the end of the month came, there was considerable speculation in the minds of the boys as to the result of the rivalry. The majority had faith in Paul, but there were some who, remembering how long Dawkins had been at the head of the class, thought he would easily regain his lost rank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The eventful day, the first of the month, at length came, and the class-list was read.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul Prescott ranked first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Dawkins ranked second.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A flush spread over the pale face of Dawkins, and he darted a malignant glance at Paul, who was naturally pleased at having retained his rank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins had his satellites. One of these came to him at recess, and expressed his regret that Dawkins had failed of success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins repelled the sympathy with cold disdain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you suppose I care for the head of the class?" he demanded, haughtily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you had been studying for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you thought wrong. Let the sexton's son have it, if he wants it. It would be of no use to me, as I leave this school at the end of the week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leave school!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys gathered about Dawkins, curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it really so, Dawkins?" they inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dawkins, with an air of importance; "I shall go to a private school, where the advantages are greater than here. My father does not wish me to attend a public school any longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This statement was made on the spur of the moment, to cover the mortification which his defeat had occasioned him. It proved true, however. On his return home, Dawkins succeeded in persuading his father to transfer him to a private school, and he took away his books at the end of the week. Had he recovered his lost rank there is no doubt that he would have remained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Truth to tell, there were few who mourned much for the departure of George Dawkins. He had never been a favorite. His imperious temper and arrogance rendered this impossible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After he left school, Paul saw little of him for two or three years. At their first encounter Paul bowed and spoke pleasantly, but Dawkins looked superciliously at him without appearing to know him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's face flushed proudly, and afterwards he abstained from making advances which were likely to be repulsed. He had too much self-respect to submit voluntarily to such slights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Paul's school life fled rapidly. It was a happy time,—happy in its freedom from care, and happy for him, though all school boys do not appreciate that consideration, in the opportunities for improvement which it afforded. These opportunities, it is only just to Paul to say, were fully improved. He left school with an enviable reputation, and with the good wishes of his schoolmates and teachers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was now sixteen years old, a stout, handsome boy, with a frank, open countenance, and a general air of health which formed quite a contrast to the appearance he presented when he left the hospitable mansion which Mr. Nicholas Mudge kept open at the public expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was now very desirous of procuring a situation. He felt that it was time he was doing something for himself. He was ambitious to relieve the kind sexton and his wife of some portion, at least, of the burden of his support.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides, there was the legacy of debt which his father had bequeathed him. Never for a moment had Paul forgotten it. Never for a moment had he faltered in his determination to liquidate it at whatever sacrifice to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father's name shall be cleared," he said to himself, proudly. "Neither Squire Conant nor any one else shall have it in his power to cast reproach upon his memory."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sexton applauded his purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are quite right, Paul," he said. "But you need not feel in haste. Obtain your education first, and the money will come by-and-by. As long as you repay the amount, principal and interest, you will have done all that you are in honor bound to do. Squire Conant, as I understand from you, is a rich man, so that he will experience no hardship in waiting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was now solicitous about a place. The sexton had little influence, so that he must depend mainly upon his own inquiries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went into the reading-room of the Astor House every day to look over the advertised wants in the daily papers. Every day he noted down some addresses, and presented himself as an applicant for a position. Generally, however, he found that some one else had been before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day his attention was drawn to the following advertisement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WANTED. A smart, active, wide-awake boy, of sixteen or seventeen, in a retail dry-goods store. Apply immediately at—Broadway."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul walked up to the address mentioned. Over the door he read, "Smith &amp; Thompson." This, then, was the firm that had advertised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The store ran back some distance. There appeared to be six or eight clerks in attendance upon quite a respectable number of customers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mr. Smith in?" inquired Paul, of the nearest clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll find him at the lower end of the store. How many yards, ma'am?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This last was of course addressed to a customer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul made his way, as directed, to the lower end of the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A short, wiry, nervous man was writing at a desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mr. Smith in?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name; what can I do for you?" said the short man, crisply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw an advertisement in the Tribune for a boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you have applied for the situation?" said Mr. Smith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you?" with a rapid glance at our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sixteen—nearly seventeen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that means that you will be seventeen in eleven months and a half."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Paul, "I shall be seventeen in three months."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Most boys call themselves a year older. What's your name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul Prescott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P. P. Any relation to Fanny Fern?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Paul, rather astonished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't know but you might be. P. P. and F. F. Where do you live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul mentioned the street and number.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's well, you are near by," said Mr. Smith. "Now, are you afraid of work?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No sir," said Paul, smiling, "not much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's important; how much wages do you expect?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose," said Paul, hesitating, "I couldn't expect very much at first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not; green, you know. What do you say to a dollar a week?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dollar a week!" exclaimed Paul, in dismay, "I hoped to get enough to pay for my board."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense. There are plenty of boys glad enough to come for a dollar a week. At first, you know. But I'll stretch a point with you, and offer you a dollar and a quarter. What do you say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How soon could I expect to have my wages advanced?" inquired our hero, with considerable anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Smith, "at the end of a month or two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go home and speak to my uncle about it," said Paul, feeling undecided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't keep the place open for you. Ah, there's another boy at the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll accept," said Paul, jumping to a decision. He had applied in so many different quarters without success, that he could not make up his mind to throw away this chance, poor as it seemed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When shall I come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come to-morrow"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At what time, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At seven o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed rather early. However, Paul was prepared to expect some discomforts, and signified that he would come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he turned to go away, another boy passed him, probably bent on the same errand with himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry. He had expected at least three dollars a week, and the descent to a dollar and a quarter was rather disheartening. Still, he was encouraged by the promise of a rise at the end of a month or two,—so on the whole he went home cheerful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Paul, what luck to-day?" asked Mr. Cameron, who had just got home as Paul entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got a place, Uncle Hugh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have,—where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With Smith &amp; Thompson, No.—Broadway."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What sort of a store? I don't remember the name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a retail dry-goods store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you like the looks of your future employer?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Paul, hesitating, "He looked as if he might be a pretty sharp man in business, but I have seen others that I would rather work for. However, beggars mustn't be choosers. But there was one thing I was disappointed about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was that, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About the wages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much will they give you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only a dollar and a quarter a week, at first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is small, to be sure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The most I think of, Uncle Hugh, is, that I shall still be an expense to you. I hoped to get enough to be able to pay my board from the first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear boy," said the sexton, kindly, "don't trouble yourself on that score. It costs little more for three than for two, and the little I expend on your account is richly made up by the satisfaction we feel in your society, and your good conduct."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You say that to encourage me, Uncle Hugh," said Paul. "You have done all for me. I have done nothing for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Paul, I spoke the truth. Hester and I have both been happier since you came to us. We hope you will long remain with us. You are already as dear to us as the son that we lost."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Uncle Hugh," said Paul, in a voice tremulous with feeling. "I will do all I can to deserve your kindness."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXI. SMITH AND THOMPSON'S YOUNG MAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT seven o'clock the next morning Paul stood before Smith &amp; Thompson's store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he came up on one side, another boy came down on the other, and crossed the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you the new boy?" he asked, surveying Paul attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose so," said Paul. "I've engaged to work for Smith &amp; Thompson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. I'm glad to see you," said the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This looked kind, and Paul thanked him for his welcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O." said the other, bursting into a laugh, "you needn't trouble yourself about thanking me. I'm glad you've come, because now I shan't have to open the store and sweep out. Just lend a hand there; I'll help you about taking down the shutters this morning, and to-morrow you'll have to get along alone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys opened the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's your name?" asked Paul's new acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul Prescott. What is yours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nicholas Benton. You may call me Mr . Benton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Benton?" repeated Paul in some astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I'm a young man now. I've been Smith &amp; Thompson's boy till now. Now I'm promoted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul looked at Mr . Benton with some amusement. That young man was somewhat shorter than himself, and sole proprietor of a stock of pale yellow hair which required an abundant stock of bear's grease to keep it in order. His face was freckled and expressionless. His eyebrows and eyelashes were of the same faded color. He was dressed, however, with some pretensions to smartness. He wore a blue necktie, of large dimensions, fastened by an enormous breast-pin, which, in its already tarnished splendor, suggested strong doubts as to the apparent gold being genuine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's the broom, Paul," said Mr. Benton, assuming a graceful position on the counter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to sweep out; only look sharp about raising a dust, or Smith'll be into your wool."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What sort of a man is Mr. Smith?" asked Paul, with some curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, he's an out and outer. Sharp as a steel trap. He'll make you toe the mark."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you like him?" asked Paul, not quite sure whether he understood his employer's character from the description.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like him well enough to advise any of my folks to trade with him," said Mr. Benton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'd cheat 'em out of their eye teeth if they happened to have any," said the young man coolly, beginning to pick his teeth with a knife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul began to doubt whether he should like Mr. Smith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say," said Mr. Benton after a pause, "have you begun to shave yet?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul looked up to see if his companion were in earnest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said he; "I haven't got along as far as that. Have you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I," repeated the young man, a little contemptuously, "of course I have. I've shaved for a year and a half."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you find it hard shaving?" asked Paul, a little slily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my beard is rather stiff," said the late boy , with an important air, "but I've got used to it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't you rather young to shave, Nicholas?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Benton, if you please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean, Mr. Benton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I was when I begun. But now I am nineteen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nineteen?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, that is to say, I'm within a few months of being nineteen. What do you think of my moustache?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hadn't noticed it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The store's rather dark," muttered Mr. Benton, who seemed a little annoyed by this answer. "If you'll come a little nearer you can see it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Drawing near, Paul, after some trouble, descried a few scattering hairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said he, wanting to laugh, "I see it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Coming on finely, isn't it?" asked Mr. Nicholas Benton, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, rather doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't mind letting you into a secret," said Benton, affably, "if you won't mention it. I've been using some of the six weeks' stuff."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The what?" asked Paul, opening his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Haven't you heard of it?" inquired Ben a little contemptuously. "Where have you been living all your life? Haven't you seen it advertised,—warranted to produce a full set of whiskers or moustaches upon the smoothest face, etc. I got some a week ago, only a dollar. Five weeks from now you'll see something that'll astonish you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was not a little amused by his new companion, and would have laughed, but that he feared to offend him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better get some," said Mr. Benton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll let you just try mine once, if you want to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Paul; "I don't think I want to have a moustache just yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, perhaps you're right. Being a boy, perhaps it wouldn't be advisable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When does Mr. Smith come in?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not till nine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And the other clerks?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About eight o'clock. I shan't come till eight, to-morrow morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's one thing I should like to ask you," said Paul. "Of course you won't answer unless you like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Out with it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much does Mr. Smith pay you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ahem!" said Benton, "what does he pay you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dollar and a quarter a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He paid me a dollar and a half to begin with."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he? He wanted me to come first at a dollar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just like him. Didn't I tell you he was an out and outer? He'll be sure to take you in if you will let him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But," said Paul, anxiously, "he said he'd raise it in a month or two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't offer to; you'll have to tease him. And then how much'll he raise it? Not more than a quarter. How much do you think I get now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long have you been here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A year and a half."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five dollars a week," guessed Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five! he only gives me two and a half. That is, he hasn't been paying me but that. Now, of course, he'll raise, as I've been promoted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you expect to get now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe four dollars, and I'm worth ten any day. He's a mean old skinflint, Smith is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This glimpse at his own prospects did not tend to make Paul feel very comfortable. He could not repress a sigh of disappointment when he thought of this mortifying termination of all his brilliant prospects. He had long nourished the hope of being able to repay the good sexton for his outlay in his behalf, besides discharging the debt which his father had left behind him. Now there seemed to be little prospect of either. He had half a mind to resign his place immediately upon the entrance of Mr. Smith, but two considerations dissuaded him; one, that the sum which he was to receive, though small, would at least buy his clothes, and besides, he was not at all certain of obtaining another situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sigh, therefore, he went about his duties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had scarcely got the store ready when some of the clerks entered, and the business of the day commenced. At nine Mr. Smith appeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you're here, Peter," remarked he, as he caught sight of our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul," corrected the owner of that name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, well, Peter or Paul, don't make much difference. Both were apostles, if I remember right. All ready for work, eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Paul, neither very briskly nor cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Mr. Smith, after a pause, "I guess I'll put you into the calico department. Williams, you may take him under your wing. And now Peter,—all the same, Paul,—I've got a word or two to say to you, as I always do to every boy who comes into my store. Don't forget what you're here for? It's to sell goods. Take care to sell something to every man, woman, and child, that comes in your way. That's the way to do business. Follow it up, and you'll be a rich man some day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But suppose they don't want anything?" said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make 'em want something," returned Smith, "Don't let 'em off without buying. That's my motto. However, you'll learn."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Smith bustled off, and began in his nervous way to exercise a general supervision over all that was going on in the store. He seemed to be all eyes. While apparently entirely occupied in waiting upon a customer, he took notice of all the customers in the store, and could tell what they bought, and how much they paid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul listened attentively to the clerk under whom he was placed for instruction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the price of this calico?" inquired a common-looking woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A shilling a yard, ma'am," (this was not in war times.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks rather coarse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Coarse, ma'am! What can you be thinking of? It is a superfine piece of goods. We sell more of it than of any other figure. The mayor's wife was in here yesterday, and bought two dress patterns off of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did she?" asked the woman, who appeared favorably impressed by this circumstance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and she promised to send her friends here after some of it. You'd better take it while you can get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will it wash?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure it will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I guess you may cut me off ten yards."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was quickly done, and the woman departed with her purchase.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes later, another woman entered with a bundle of the same figured calico.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seeing her coming, Williams hastily slipped the remnant of the piece out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got this calico here," said the newcomer, "one day last week. You warranted it to wash, but I find it won't. Here's a piece I've tried."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She showed a pattern, which had a faded look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've come to the wrong store," said Williams, coolly. "You must have got the calico somewhere else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I'm sure I got it here. I remember particularly buying it of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've got a better memory than I have, then. We haven't got a piece of calico like that in the store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul listened to this assertion with unutterable surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am quite certain I bought it here," said the woman, perplexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Must have been the next store,—Blake &amp; Hastings. Better go over there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman went out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the way to do business," said Williams, winking at Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul said nothing, but he felt more than ever doubtful about retaining his place.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXII. MR. BENTON'S ADVENTURE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONE evening, about a fortnight after his entrance into Smith &amp; Thompson's employment, Paul was putting up the shutters, the business of the day being over. It devolved upon him to open and close the store, and usually he was the last one to go home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This evening, however, Mr. Nicholas Benton graciously remained behind and assisted Paul in closing the store. This was unusual, and surprised Paul a little. It was soon explained, however.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night, Nicholas,—I mean, Mr. Benton," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite yet. I want you to walk a little way with me this evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, no backing out. I want to confide to you a very important secret."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked so mysterious that Paul's curiosity was aroused, and reflecting that it was yet early, he took his companion's proffered arm, and sauntered along by his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the secret?" he asked at length, perceiving that Nicholas was silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait till we get to a more retired place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned out of Broadway into a side street, where the passers were less numerous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think you could guess," said the young man, turning towards our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think I could."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And yet," continued Benton, meditatively, "it is possible that you may have noticed something in my appearance just a little unusual, within the last week. Haven't you, now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul could not say that he had.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benton looked a little disappointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody can tell what has been the state of my feelings," he resumed after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ain't sick?" questioned Paul, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing of the sort, only my appetite has been a good deal affected. I don't think I have eaten as much in a week as you would in a day," he added, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I felt that way I should think I was going to be sick," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll let you into the secret," said Mr. Benton, lowering his voice, and looking carefully about him, to make sure that no one was within hearing distance— "I'm in love ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed so utterly ludicrous to Paul, that he came very near losing Mr. Benton's friendship forever by bursting into a hearty laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think of that," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's taken away my appetite, and I haven't been able to sleep nights," continued Mr. Benton, in a cheerful tone. "I feel just as Howard Courtenay did in the great story that's coming out in the Weekly Budget. You've read it, haven't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think I have," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you ought to. It's tiptop. It's rather curious too that the lady looks just as Miranda does, in the same story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How is that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute, and I'll read the description."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benton pulled a paper from his pocket, —the last copy of the Weekly Budget,—and by the light of a street lamp read the following extract to his amused auditor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miranda was just eighteen. Her form was queenly and majestic. Tall and stately, she moved among her handmaidens with a dignity which revealed her superior rank. Her eyes were dark as night. Her luxuriant tresses,— there, the rest is torn off," said Mr. Benton, in a tone of vexation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is tall, then?" said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, just like Miranda."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then," said our hero, in some hesitation, "I should think she would not be very well suited to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?" asked Mr. Benton, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because," said Paul, "you're rather short, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm about the medium height," said Mr. Benton, raising himself upon his toes as he spoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite," said Paul, trying not to laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm as tall as Mr. Smith," resumed Mr. Benton, in a tone which warned Paul that this was a forbidden subject. "But you don't ask me who she is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know as you would be willing to tell."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shan't tell any one but you. It's Miss Hawkins,—firm of Hawkins &amp; Brewer. That is, her father belongs to the firm, not she. And Paul," here he clutched our hero's arm convulsively, "I've made a declaration of my love, and—and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She has answered my letter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has she?" asked Paul with some curiosity, "What did she say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She has written me to be under her window this evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why under her window? why didn't she write you to call?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably she will, but it's more romantic to say, `be under my window.' "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, perhaps it is; only you know I don't know much about such things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not, Paul," said Mr. Benton; "you're only a boy, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to be under her window, Nich,—I mean Mr. Benton?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course. Do you think I would miss the appointment? No earthly power could prevent my doing it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I had better leave you," said Paul, making a movement to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I want you to acompany me as far as the door. I feel—a little agitated. I suppose everybody does when they are in love," added Mr. Benton, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Paul, "I will see you to the door, but I can't stay, for they will wonder at home what has become of me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are we anywhere near the house?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it's only in the next street," said Mr. Benton, "O, Paul, how my heart beats! You can't imagine how I feel!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benton gasped for breath, and looked as if he had swallowed a fish bone, which he had some difficulty in getting down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll know how to understand my feelings sometime, Paul," said Mr. Benton; "when your time comes, I will remember your service of to-night, and I will stand by you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul inwardly hoped that he should never fall in love, if it was likely to affect him in the same way as his companion, but he thought it best not to say so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time they had come in sight of a three-story brick house, with Benjamin Hawkins on the door-plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the house," said Mr. Benton, in an agitated whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and that window on the left-hand side is the window of her chamber."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She told me in the letter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And where are you to stand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just underneath, as the clock strikes nine. It must be about the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment the city clock struck nine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benton left Paul, and crossing the street, took up his position beneath the window of his charmer, beginning to sing, in a thin, piping voice, as preconcerted between them—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ever of thee, I'm fo-o-ondly dreaming."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The song was destined never to be finished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From his post in a doorway opposite, Paul saw the window softly open. He could distinguish a tall female figure, doubtless Miss Hawkins herself. She held in her hand a pitcher of water, which she emptied with well-directed aim full upon the small person of her luckless admirer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The falling column struck upon his beaver, thence spreading on all sides. His carefully starched collar became instantly as limp as a rag, while his coat suffered severely from the shower.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His tuneful accents died away in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ow!" he exclaimed, jumping at least a yard, and involuntarily shaking himself like a dog, "who did that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer save a low, musical laugh from the window above, which was involuntarily echoed by Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean by laughing at me?" demanded Mr. Benton, smarting with mortification, as he strode across the street, trying to dry his hat with the help of his handkerchief, "Is this what you call friendship?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Excuse me," gasped Paul, "but I really couldn't help it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see anything to laugh at," continued Mr. Benton, in a resentful tone; "because I have been subjected to unmanly persecution, you must laugh at me, instead of extending to me the sympathy of a friend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you won't think of her any more," said Paul, recovering himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Think of her!" exclaimed Mr. Benton, "would you have me tear her from my heart, because her mercenary parent chooses to frown upon our love, and follow me with base persecution."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Her parent!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it was he who threw the water upon me. But it shall not avail," the young man continued, folding his arms, and speaking in a tone of resolution, "bolts and bars shall not keep two loving hearts asunder."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it wasn't her father," urged Paul, perceiving that Mr. Benton was under a mistake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was it, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was the young lady herself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who threw the water upon me? It is a base slander."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I saw her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Saw who?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A tall young lady with black hair."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And was it she who threw the water?" asked Mr. Benton, aghast at this unexpected revelation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then she did it at the command of her proud parent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul did not dispute this, since it seemed to comfort Mr. Benton. It is doubtful, however, whether the young man believed it himself, since he straightway fell into a fit of gloomy abstraction, and made no response when Paul bade him "good-night."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXIII. PAUL LOSES HIS SITUATION AND GAINS A FRIEND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PAUL had a presentiment that he should not long remain in the employ of Smith &amp; Thompson; it was not many weeks before this presentiment was verified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After having received such instruction as was necessary, the calico department was left in Paul's charge. One day a customer in turning over the patterns shown her took up a piece which Paul knew from complaints made by purchasers would not wash.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is pretty," said she, "it is just what I have been looking for. You may cut me off twelve yards."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute, though," interposed the lady, "will it wash?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think it will," said Paul, frankly, "there have been some complaints made about that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I shall not want it. Let me see what else you have got."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The customer finally departed, having found nothing to suit her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner had she left the store than Mr. Smith called Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, did you sell that lady anything?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not?" demanded Smith, harshly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because she did not like any of the pieces."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't she have ordered a dress pattern if you had not told her the calico would not wash?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I suppose so," said Paul, preparing for a storm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then why did you tell her?" demanded his employer, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because she asked me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Couldn't you have told her that it would wash?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That would not have been the truth," said Paul, sturdily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a mighty conscientious young man," sneered Smith, "You're altogether too pious to succeed in business. I discharge you from my employment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, sir," said Paul, his heart sinking, but keeping up a brave exterior, "then I have only to bid you good-morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, sir," said his employer with mock deference, "I advise you to study for the ministry, and no longer waste your talents in selling calico."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul made no reply, but putting on his cap walked out of the store. It was the middle of the week, and Mr. Smith was, of course, owing him a small sum for his services; but Paul was too proud to ask for his money, which that gentleman did not see fit to volunteer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sure I have done right," thought Paul. "I had no right to misrepresent the goods to that lady. I wonder what Uncle Hugh will say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did perfectly right," said the sexton, after Paul had related the circumstances of his dismissal. "I wouldn't have had you act differently for twenty situations. I have no doubt you will get a better position elsewhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so," said Paul. "Now that I have lost the situation, Uncle Hugh, I don't mind saying that I never liked it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now commenced a search for another place. Day after day Paul went out, and day after day he returned with the same want of success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, Paul," said the sexton encouragingly. "When you do succeed, perhaps you'll get something worth waiting for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One morning Paul went out feeling that something was going to happen,—he didn't exactly know what,—but he felt somehow that there was to be a change in his luck. He went out, therefore, with more hopefulness than usual; yet, when four o'clock came, and nothing had occurred except failure and disappointment, which unhappily were not at all out of the ordinary course, Paul began to think that he was very foolish to have expected anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was walking listlessly along a narrow street, when, on a sudden, he heard an exclamation of terror, of which, on turning round, he easily discovered the cause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two spirited horses, attached to an elegant carriage, had been terrified in some way, and were now running at the top of their speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no coachman on the box; he had dismounted in order to ring at some door, when the horses started. He was now doing his best to overtake the horses, but in a race between man and horse, it is easy to predict which will have the advantage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There seemed to be but one person in the carriage. It was a lady,—whose face, pale with terror, could be seen from the carriage window. Her loud cries of alarm no doubt terrified the horses still more, and, by accelerating their speed, tended to make matters worse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was roused from a train of despondent reflections by seeing the horses coming up the street. He instantly comprehended the whole danger of the lady's situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most boys would have thought of nothing but getting out of the way, and leaving the carriage and its inmate to their fate. What, indeed, could a boy do against a pair of powerful horses, almost beside themselves with fright?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But our hero, as we have already had occasion to see, was brave and self-possessed, and felt an instant desire to rescue the lady, whose glance of helpless terror, as she leaned her head from the window, he could see. Naturally quickwitted, it flashed upon him that the only way to relieve a horse from one terror, was to bring another to bear upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With scarcely a moment's premeditation, he rushed out into the middle of the street, full in the path of the furious horses, and with his cheeks pale, for he knew his danger, but with determined air, he waved his arms aloft, and cried "Whoa!" at the top of his voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horses saw the sudden movement. They saw the boy standing directly in front of them. They heard the word of command to which they had been used, and by a sudden impulse, relieved from the blind terror which had urged them on, they stopped suddenly, and stood still in the middle of the street, still showing in their quivering limbs the agitation through which they had passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then the coachman, panting with his hurried running, came up and seized them by the head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Youngster," said he, "you're a brave fellow. You've done us a good service to-day. You're a pretty cool hand, you are. I don't know what these foolish horses would have done with the carriage if it had not been for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me get out," exclaimed the lady, not yet recovered from her fright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will open the door," said Paul, observing that the coachman was fully occupied in soothing the horses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sprang forward, and opening the door of the carriage assisted the lady to descend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She breathed quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been very much frightened," she said; "and I believe I have been in very great danger. Are you the brave boy who stopped the horses?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul modestly answered in the affirmative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And how did you do it? I was so terrified that I was hardly conscious of what was passing, till the horses stopped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul modestly related his agency in the matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lady gazed at his flushed face admiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How could you have so much courage?" she asked. "You might have been trampled to death under the hoofs of the horses."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think of that. I only thought of stopping the horses."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a brave boy. I shudder when I think of your danger and mine. I shall not dare to get into the carriage again this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Allow me to accompany you home?" said Paul, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you; I will trouble you to go with me as far as Broadway, and then I can get into an omnibus."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned and addressed some words to the coachman, directing him to drive home as soon as the horses were quieted, adding that she would trust herself to the escort of the young hero, who had rescued her from the late peril.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a lucky boy," thought John, the coachman. "My mistress is one that never does anything by halves. It won't be for nothing that you have rescued her this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they walked along, the lady, by delicate questioning, succeeded in drawing from our hero his hopes and wishes for the future. Paul, who was of a frank and open nature, found it very natural to tell her all he felt and wished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He seems a remarkably fine boy," thought the lady to herself. "I should like to do something for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They emerged into Broadway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will detain you a little longer," said the lady; "and perhaps trouble you with a parcel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall be very glad to take it," said Paul, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appleton's bookstore was close at hand. Into this the lady went, followed by her young companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A clerk advanced, and inquired her wishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you show me some writing-desks?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to purchase a writing-desk for a young friend of mine," she explained to Paul; "as he is a boy, like yourself, perhaps you can guide me in the selection."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly," said Paul, unsuspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several desks were shown. Paul expressed himself admiringly of one made of rosewood inlaid with pearl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I will take it," said the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The price was paid, and the desk was wrapped up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Mrs. Danforth, for this proved to be her name, "I will trouble you, Paul, to take the desk for me, and acompany me in the omnibus, that is, if you have no other occupation for your time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am quite at leisure," said Paul. "I shall be most happy to do so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul left the lady at the door of her residence in Fifth Avenue, and promised to call on his new friend the next day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went home feeling that, though he had met with no success in obtaining a place, he had been very fortunate in rendering so important a service to a lady whose friendship might be of essential service to him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXIV. PAUL CALLS ON MRS. DANFORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"MRS. EDWARD DANFORTH," repeated the sexton, on hearing the story of Paul's exploit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, she attends our church."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know Mr. Danforth?" asked Paul, with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only by sight. I know him by reputation, however."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose he is very rich."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I should judge so. At any rate, he is doing an extensive business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is his business?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is a merchant."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A merchant," thought Paul; "that is just what I should like to be, but I don't see much prospect of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you like Mrs. Danforth?" inquired the sexton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very much," said Paul, warmly. "She was very kind, and made me feel quite at home in her company."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope she may be disposed to assist you. She can easily do so, in her position."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Paul did not as usual go out in search of a situation. His mind was occupied with thoughts of his coming interview with Mrs. Danforth, and he thought he would defer his business plans till the succeeding day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At an early hour in the evening, he paused before an imposing residence on Fifth Avenue, which he had seen but not entered the day previous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He mounted the steps and pulled the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A smart-looking man-servant answered his ring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mrs. Danforth at home?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I believe so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have called to see her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does she expect you?" asked the servant, looking surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I come at her appointment," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I suppose it's all right," said the man. "Will you come in?" he asked, a little doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul followed him into the house, and was shown into the drawing-room, the magnificence of which somewhat dazzled his eyes; accustomed only to the plain sitting-room of Mr. Cameron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The servant reappeared after a brief absence, and with rather more politeness than he had before shown, invited Paul to follow him to a private sitting-room upstairs, where he would see Mrs. Danforth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking at Paul's plain, though neat clothes, the servant was a little puzzled to understand what had obtained for Paul the honor of being on visiting terms with Mrs. Danforth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good evening, Paul," said Mrs. Danforth, rising from her seat and welcoming our hero with extended hand. "So you did not forget your appointment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There was no fear of that," said Paul, with his usual frankness. "I have been looking forward to coming all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you, indeed?" said the lady with a pleasant smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I must endeavor to make your visit agreeable to you. Do you recognize this desk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon a table close by, was the desk which had been purchased the day previous, at Appleton's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, "it is the one you bought yesterday. I think it is very handsome."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad you think so. I think I told you that I intended it for a present. I have had the new owner's name engraved upon it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul read the name upon the plate provided for the purpose. His face flushed with surprise and pleasure. That name was his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you really mean it for me" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you will accept it," said Mrs. Danforth, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall value it very much," said Paul, gratefully. "And I feel very much indebted to your kindness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We won't talk of indebtedness, for you remember mine is much the greater. If you will open the desk you will find that it is furnished with what will, I hope, prove of use to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The desk being opened, proved to contain a liberal supply of stationery, sealing wax, postage stamps, and pens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was delighted with his new present, and Mrs. Danforth seemed to enjoy the evident gratification with which it inspired him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said she, "tell me a little about yourself. Have you always lived in New York?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only about three years," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And where did you live before?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At Wrenville, in Connecticut."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have heard of the place. A small country town, is it not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul answered in the affirmative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you happen to leave Wrenville, and come to New York?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul blushed, and hesitated a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ran away," he said at length, determined to keep nothing back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ran away! Not from home, I hope."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had no home," said Paul, soberly. "I should never have left there, if my father had not died. Then I was thrown upon the world. I was sent to the Poorhouse. I did not want to go, for I thought I could support myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is a very honorable feeling. I suppose you did not fare very well at the Poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In reply, Paul detailed some of the grievances to which he had been subjected. Mrs. Danforth listened with sympathizing attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were entirely justified in running away," she said, as he concluded. "I can hardly imagine so great a lack of humanity as these people showed. You are now, I hope, pleasantly situated?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron treat me with as great kindness as if I were their own child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cameron! Is not that the name of the sexton of our church?" said Mrs. Danforth, meditatively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is with him that I have a pleasant home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed, I am glad to hear it. You have been attending school, I suppose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it is not more than two months since I left off school."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And now I suppose you are thinking of entering upon some business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I have been trying to obtain a place in some merchant's counting-room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think, then, that you would like the career of a merchant?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is nothing that would suit me better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have not succeeded in obtaining a place yet, I suppose?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. They are very difficult to get, and I have no influential friends to assist me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have heard Mr. Danforth say that he experienced equal difficulty when he came to New York, a poor boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see that you are surprised," said Mrs. Danforth, smiling. "You think, perhaps, judging from what you see, that my husband was always rich. But he was the son of a poor farmer, and was obliged to make his own way in the world. By the blessing of God, he has been prospered in business and become rich. But he often speaks of his early discouragements and small beginnings. I am sorry he is not here this evening. By the way, he left word for you to call at his counting-room to-morrow, at eleven o'clock. I will give you his address."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She handed Paul a card containing the specified number, and soon after he withdrew, bearing with him his handsome gift, and a cordial invitation to repeat his call.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked back at the elegant mansion which he had just left, and could not help feeling surprised that the owner of such a palace, should have started in life with no greater advantages than himself.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXV. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PAUL slept late the next morning. He did not hear the breakfast-bell, and when the sexton came up to awaken him he rubbed his eyes with such an expression of bewilderment that Mr. Cameron could not forbear laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must have had queer dreams, Paul," said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Uncle Hugh," said Paul, laughing, "I believe I have."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When you have collected your wits, which at present seem absent on a wool-gathering expedition, perhaps you will tell what you have been dreaming about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I will," said Paul, "and perhaps you can interpret it for me. I dreamed that I was back again at Mr. Mudge's, and that he sent me out into the field to dig potatoes. I worked away at the first hill, but found no potatoes. In place of them were several gold pieces. I picked them up in great surprise, and instead of putting them into the basket, concluded to put them in my pocket. But as all the hills turned out in the same way I got my pockets full, and had to put the rest in the basket. I was just wondering what they would do for potatoes, when all at once a great dog came up and seized me by the arm—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you opened your eyes and saw me," said the sexton, finishing out his narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Upon my word, that's very complimentary to me. However, some of our potatoes have escaped transformation into gold pieces, but I am afraid you will find them rather cold if you don't get down to breakfast pretty quick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Uncle Hugh. I'll be down in a jiffy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About half-past ten Paul started on his way to Mr. Danforth's counting-room. It was located on Wall Street, as he learned from the card which had been given him by Mrs. Danforth. He felt a little awkward in making this call. It seemed as if he were going to receive thanks for the service which he had rendered, and he felt that he had already been abundantly repaid. However, he was bound in courtesy to call, since he did so at the request of Mrs. Danforth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a large stone building, divided up into offices, to which Paul had been directed. Mr. Danforth's office he found after a little search, upon the second floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the door with a little embarrassment, and looked about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In one corner was a small room, used as a more private office, the door of which was closed. In the larger room the only one whom he saw, was a boy, apparently about his own age, who was standing at a desk and writing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This boy looked around as Paul entered, and he at once recognized in him an old acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"George Dawkins!" he exclaimed in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The latter answered in a careless indifferent tone, not exhibiting any very decided pleasure at meeting his old schoolmate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it's you, Prescott, is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, "I haven't met you since you left our school."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I believe we have not met," said Dawkins, in the same tone as before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long have you been in this office?" asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I really can't say," said Dawkins, not looking up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't say!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I'm rather forgetful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul could not help feeling chilled at the indifferent manner in which his advances were met. He had been really glad to see Dawkins, and had addressed him with cordiality. He could not conceal from himself that Dawkins did not seem inclined to respond to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still," thought Paul, extenuatingly, "perhaps that is his way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the conversation began to flag, Paul was reminded of his errand by Dawkins saying, in a tone which was half a sneer, "Have you any business with Mr. Danforth this morning, or did you merely come in out of curiosity?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have called to see Mr. Danforth," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is usually pretty busy in the morning," said Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He directed me to call in the morning," said Paul, sturdily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, indeed!" said Dawkins, a little surprised. "I wonder," he thought, "what business this fellow can have with Mr. Danforth. Can he be fishing for a place?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Danforth is engaged with a visitor just now," he at length condescended to say; "if your time is not too valuable to wait, you can see him by-and-by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Paul, rather nettled, "you are very polite."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this Dawkins made no reply, but resumed his pen, and for the next ten minutes seemed entirely oblivious of Paul's presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero took up the morning paper, and began, as he had so often done before, to look over the list of wants, thinking it possible he might find some opening for himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About ten minutes later the door of the inner office opened, and two gentlemen came out. One was a gentleman of fifty, a business friend of Mr. Danforth's, the other was Mr. Danforth himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The former remarked, on seeing Paul, "Is this your son, Danforth?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the merchant, nodding in a friendly manner to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good joke," thought Dawkins, chuckling to himself; "Mr. Danforth must be immensely flattered at having a sexton's adopted son taken for his."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a final word or two on business matters, and arrangements for another interview, the visitor departed, and Mr. Danforth, now at leisure, turned to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now my lad," he said kindly, "if you will follow me, we shall have a chance to talk a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul followed the merchant into his office, the door of which was closed, much to the regret of Dawkins, who had a tolerably large share of curiosity, and was very anxious to find out what business Paul could possibly have with his employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take that seat, if you please;" said Mr. Danforth, motioning Paul to an arm-chair, and sitting down himself, "Mrs. Danforth told me from how great a peril you rescued her. You are a brave boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Paul, modestly, "I didn't think of the danger. If I had, perhaps I should have hesitated."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you had not been brave you would have thought of your own risk. My wife and myself are under very great obligations to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That more than repays me for all I did," said Paul, in a tone of mingled modesty and manliness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like the boy," thought Mr. Danforth; "he is certainly quite superior to the common run."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you left school?" he inquired, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. Last term closed my school life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you have never been in a situation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! Before you left school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, since."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did not like it, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And was that the reason of your leaving?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; my employer was not satisfied with me," said Paul, frankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! I am surprised to hear this! If you have no objection, will you tell me the circumstances?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul related in a straightforward manner the difficulty he had had with Smith &amp; Thompson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you don't think I did wrong," he concluded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By no means," said Mr. Danforth, warmly. "Your conduct was entirely creditable. As for Smith, I know of him. He is a sharper. It would have done you no good to remain in his employ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was pleased with this commendation. He had thought it possible that his dismissal from his former situation might operate against him with the merchant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are your present plans and wishes?" asked Mr. Danforth, after a slight pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to enter a merchant's counting-room," said Paul, "but as such places are hard to get, I think I shall try to get into a store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth reflected a moment, then placing a piece of paper before our hero, he said, "Will you write your name and address on this piece of paper, that I may know where to find you, in case I hear of a place?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul did as directed. He had an excellent handwriting, a point on which the merchant set a high value.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The latter surveyed the address with approval, and said, "I am glad you write so excellent a hand. It will be of material assistance to you in securing a place in a counting-room. Indeed, it has been already, for I have just thought of a place which I can obtain for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you, sir?" said Paul, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In my own counting-room," said Mr. Danforth, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very much obliged to you," said Paul, hardly believing his ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was prepared to give it to you when you came in, in case I found you qualified. The superiority of your handwriting decides me. When can you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow, if you like, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like your promptness. As it is the middle of the week, however, you may take a vacation till Monday. Your salary will begin to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will give you five dollars per week at first, and more as your services become more valuable. Will that be satisfactory?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall feel rich, sir. Mr. Smith only gave me a dollar and a quarter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will find other differences between me and Mr. Smith," said the merchant, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These preliminaries over, Mr. Danforth opened the door, and glancing at Dawkins, said, "Dawkins, I wish you to become acquainted with your fellow clerk, Paul Prescott.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins looked surprised, and anything but gratified as he responded stiffly, "I have the honor of being already acquainted with Mr. Prescott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is a little jealous of an interloper," thought Mr. Danforth, noticing the repellent manner of young Dawkins. "Never mind, they will get acquainted after awhile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When George Dawkins went home to dinner, his father observed the dissatisfied look he wore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is anything amiss, my son?" he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think there was," grumbled his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We've got a new clerk, and who do you think it is?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The adopted son of old Cameron, the sexton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed," said Mrs. Dawkins. "I really wonder at Mr. Danforth's bad taste. There are many boys of genteel family, who would have been glad of the chance. This boy is a low fellow of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly," said her son, though he was quite aware that this was not true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What could have brought the boy to Danforth's notice?" asked Dawkins, senior.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, I'm sure. The boy has managed to get round him in some way. He is very artful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I really think, husband, that you ought to remonstrate with Mr. Danforth about taking such a low fellow into his counting-room with our George."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pooh!" said Mr. Dawkins, who was a shade more sensible than his wife, "he'd think me a meddler."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At any rate, George," pursued his mother, "there's one thing that is due to your family and bringing up,—not to associate with this low fellow any more than business requires."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I certainly shall not," said George, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was the worthy son of such a mother.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXVI. A VULGAR RELATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT the end of the first week, Paul received five dollars, the sum which the merchant had agreed to pay him for his services. With this he felt very rich. He hurried home, and displayed to the sexton the crisp bank note which had been given him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will soon be a rich man, Paul," said Mr. Cameron, with a benevolent smile, returning the bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I want you to keep it, Uncle Hugh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I put it in the Savings Bank, for you, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean that. You have been supporting me—giving me board and clothes—for three years. It is only right that you should have what I earn."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The offer is an honorable one on your part, Paul," said the sexton; "but I don't need it. If it will please you, I will take two dollars a week for your board, now, and out of the balance you may clothe yourself, and save what you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This arrangement seemed to be a fair one. Mr. Cameron deposited the five dollar note in his pocket-book, and passed one of three dollars to Paul. This sum our hero deposited the next Monday morning, in a savings bank. He estimated that he could clothe himself comfortably for fifty dollars a year. This would leave him one hundred towards the payment of the debt due to Squire Conant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By-and-by my salary will be raised," thought Paul. "Then I can save more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when he should be able to redeem his father's name, and no one would be entitled to cast reproach upon his memory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He endeavored to perform his duties faithfully in the office, and to learn as rapidly as he could the business upon which he had entered. He soon found that he must depend mainly upon himself. George Dawkins seemed disposed to afford him no assistance, but repelled scornfully the advances which Paul made towards cordiality. He was by no means as faithful as Paul, but whenever Mr. Danforth was absent from the office, spent his time in lounging at the window, or reading a cheap novel, with one of which he was usually provided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Paul became satisfied that Dawkins was not inclined to accept his overtures, he ceased to court his acquaintance, and confined himself to his own desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day as he was returning from dinner, he was startled by an unceremonious slap upon the shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking up in some surprise, he found that this greeting had come from a man just behind him, whose good-humored face and small, twinkling eyes, he at once recognized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Mr. Stubbs?" inquired Paul, his face lighting up with pleasure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm so's to be round. How be you?" returned the worthy pedler, seizing our hero's hand and shaking it heartily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stubbs was attired in all the glory of a blue coat with brass buttons and swallow tails.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When did you come to New York?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just arrived; that is, I got in this mornin'. But I say, how you've grown. I shouldn't hardly have known you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shouldn't you, though?" said Paul, gratified as most boys are, on being told that he had grown. "Have you come to the city on business?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, kinder on business, and kinder not. I thought I'd like to have a vacation. Besides, the old lady wanted a silk dress, and she was sot on havin' it bought in York. So I come to the city."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you stopping, Mr. Stubbs?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over to the Astor House. Pretty big hotel, ain't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I see you are traveling in style."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I suppose they charge considerable, but I guess I can stand it. I hain't been drivin' a tin-cart for nothin' the last ten years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How have you been enjoying yourself since you arrived?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, pretty well. I've been round seeing the lions, and came pretty near seeing the elephant at one of them Peter Funk places."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did! Tell me about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see I was walkin' along when a fellow came out of one of them places, and asked me if I wouldn't go in. I didn't want to refuse such a polite invitation, and besides I had a curiosity to see what there was to be seen, so I went in. They put up a silver watch, I could see that it was a good one, and so I bid on it. It ran up to eight dollars and a quarter. I thought it was a pity it should go off so cheap, so I bid eight and a half."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Eight and a half and sold,' said the man; `shall I put it up for you?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `No, I thank you,' said I, `I'll take it as it is.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `But I'll put it up in a nice box for you,' said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told him I didn't care for the box. He seemed very unwilling to let it go, but I took it out of his hand and he couldn't help himself. Well, when they made out the bill, what do you suppose they charged?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, eighteen and a half."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Look here,' said I, `I guess here's something of a mistake. You've got ten dollars too much.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I think you must be mistaken,' said he, smiling a foxy smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `You know I am not,' said I, rather cross.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can't let that watch go for any thing shorter,' said he, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just then a man that was present stepped up and said, `the man is right; don't attempt to impose upon him.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With that he calmed right down. It seems it was a policeman who was sent to watch them, that spoke. So I paid the money, but as I went out I heard the auctioneer say that the sale was closed for the day. I afterwards learned that if I had allowed them to put the watch in a box, they would have exchanged it for another that was only plated."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know anybody in the city?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got some relations, but I don't know where they live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the name?" asked Paul, "we can look into the directory."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The name is Dawkins," answered the pedler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dawkins!" repeated Paul, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, do you happen to know anybody of the name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but I believe it is a rich family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, so are my relations," said Jehoshaphat. "You didn't think Jehoshaphat Stubbs had any rich relations, did you? These, as I've heard tell, hold their heads as high as anybody."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I may be mistaken," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the name—the Christian name, I mean—of your relation?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"George."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must be he, then. There is a boy of about my own age of that name. He works in the same office."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say so! Well, that is curious, I declare. To think that I should have happened to hit upon you so by accident too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you related to them?" inquired Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you see, I'm own cousin to Mr. Dawkins. His father and my mother were brother and sister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was his father's business?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what his regular business was, but he was a sexton in some church."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This tallied with the account Paul had received from Mr. Cameron, and he could no longer doubt that, strange as it seemed, the wealthy Mr. Dawkins was own cousin to the pedler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you say the boy was in the same office with you, Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I've a great mind to go and see him, and find out where his father lives. Perhaps I may get an invite to his house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How shocked Dawkins will be!" thought Paul, not, it must be confessed, without a feeling of amusement. He felt no compunction in being the instrument of mortifying the false pride of his fellow clerk, and he accordingly signified to Mr. Stubbs that he was on his way to the counting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you, though? Well, I guess I'll go along with you. Is it far off?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only in the next street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pedler, it must be acknowledged, had a thoroughly countrified appearance. He was a genuine specimen of the Yankee,—a long, gaunt figure, somewhat stooping, and with a long aquiline nose. His dress has already been described.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Dawkins beheld him entering with Paul, he turned up his nose in disgust at what he considered Paul's friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What was his consternation when the visitor, approaching him with a benignant smile, extended his brown hand, and said, "How d'ye do, George? How are ye all to hum?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins drew back haughtily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean?" he said, pale with passion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Dawkins," said Paul, with suppressed merriment, "allow me to introduce your cousin, Mr. Stubbs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jehoshaphat Stubbs," explained that individual. "Didn't your father never mention my name to you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir," said Dawkins, darting a furious glance at Paul, "you are entirely mistaken if you suppose that any relationship exists between me and that—person."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it's you that are mistaken," said Mr. Stubbs, persevering, "My mother was Roxana Jane Dawkins. She was own sister to your grandfather. That makes me and your father cousins Don't you see?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see that you are intending to insult me," said Dawkins, the more furiously, because he began to fear there might be some truth in the man's claims. "Mr. Prescott, I leave you to entertain your company yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he threw on his hat and dashed out of the counting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said the pedler, drawing a long breath, "that's cool,—denyin' his own flesh and blood. Rather stuck up, ain't he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is, somewhat," said Paul; "if I were you, I shouldn't be disposed to own him as a relation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Darned ef I will!" said Jehoshaphat sturdily; "I have some pride, ef I am a pedler. Guess I'm as good as he, any day."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXVII. MR. MUDGE'S FRIGHT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SQUIRE NEWCOME sat in a high-backed chair before the fire with his heels on the fender. He was engaged in solemnly perusing the leading editorial in the evening paper, when all at once the table at his side gave a sudden lurch, the lamp slid into his lap, setting the paper on fire, and, before the Squire realized his situation, the flames singed his whiskers, and made his face unpleasantly warm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cre-a-tion!" he exclaimed, jumping briskly to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lamp had gone out, so that the cause of the accident remained involved in mystery. The Squire had little trouble in conjecturing, however, that Ben was at the bottom of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opening the door hastily, he saw, by the light in the next room, that young gentleman rising from his knees in the immediate vicinity of the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ben-ja-min," said the Squire, sternly,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What have you been a-doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben looked sheepish, but said nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I repeat, Benjamin, what have you been a-doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean to," said Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That does not answer my interrogatory. What have you been a-doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was chasing the cat," said Ben, "and she got under the table. I went after her, and somehow it upset. Guess my head might have knocked against the legs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you, Benjamin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifteen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A boy of fifteen is too old to play with cats. You may retire to your dormitory."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's only seven o'clock, father," said Ben, in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys that play with cats are young enough to retire at seven," remarked the Squire, sagaciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nothing for Ben but to obey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly with reluctant steps he went up to his chamber and went to bed. His active mind, together with the early hour, prevented his sleeping. Instead, his fertile imagination was employed in devising some new scheme, in which, of course, fun was to be the object attained. While he was thinking, one scheme flashed upon him which he at once pronounced "bully."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could do it to-night," he sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why can't I?" he thought, after a moment's reflection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The more he thought of it, the more feasible it seemed, and at length he decided to attempt it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rising from his bed he quickly dressed himself, and then carefully took the sheet, and folding it up in small compass put it under his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next, opening the window, he stepped out upon the sloping roof of the ell part, and slid down to the end where he jumped off, the height not being more than four feet from the ground. By some accident, a tub of suds was standing under the eaves, and Ben, much to his disgust, jumped into it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whew!" exclaimed he, "I've jumped into that plaguy tub. What possessed Hannah to put it in a fellow's way?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this moment the back door opened, and Hannah called out, in a shrill voice, "Who's there?" Ben hastily hid himself, and thought it best not to answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess 'twas the cat," said Hannah, as she closed the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A two-legged cat," thought Ben, to himself; "thunder, what sopping wet feet I've got. Well, it can't be helped."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the sheet still under his arm, Ben climbed a fence and running across the fields reached the fork of the road. Here he concealed himself under a hedge, and waited silently till the opportunity for playing his practical joke arrived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I regret to say that Mr. Mudge, with whom we have already had considerable to do, was not a member of the temperance society. Latterly, influenced perhaps by Mrs. Mudge's tongue, which made his home far from a happy one, he had got into the habit of spending his evenings at the tavern in the village, where he occasionally indulged in potations that were not good for him. Generally, he kept within the bounds of moderation, but occasionally he exceeded these, as he had done on the present occasion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some fifteen minutes after Ben had taken his station, he saw, in the moonlight, Mr. Mudge coming up the road, on his way home. Judging from his zigzag course, he was not quite himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben waited till Mr. Mudge was close at hand, when all at once he started from his place of concealment completely enveloped in the sheet with which he was provided. He stood motionless before the astounded Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are you?" exclaimed Mudge, his knees knocking together in terror, clinging to an overhanging branch for support.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are you?" he again asked in affright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sally Baker," returned Ben, in as sepulchral a voice as he could command.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sally Baker was an old pauper, who had recently died. The name occurred to Ben on the spur of the moment. It was with some difficulty that he succeeded in getting out the name, such was his amusement at Mr. Mudge's evident terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want of me?" inquired Mudge, nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You half starved me when I was alive," returned Ben, in a hollow voice, "I must be revenged."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying he took one step forward, spreading out his arms. This was too much for Mr. Mudge. With a cry he started and ran towards home at the top of his speed, with Ben in pursuit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I shall die of laughing, exclaimed Ben, pausing out of breath, and sitting down on a stone, "what a donkey he is, to be sure, to think there are such things as ghosts. I'd like to be by when he tells Mrs. Mudge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a moment's thought, Ben wrapped up the sheet, took it under his arm, and once more ran in pursuit of Mr. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Mrs. Mudge was sitting in the kitchen of the Poorhouse, mending stockings. She was not in the pleasantest humor, for one of the paupers had managed to break a plate at tea-table (if that can be called tea where no tea is provided), and trifles were sufficient to ruffle Mrs. Mudge's temper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's Mudge, I wonder?" she said, sharply; "over to the tavern, I s'pose, as usual. There never was such a shiftless, good-for-nothing man. I'd better have stayed unmarried all the days of my life than have married him. If he don't get in by ten, I'll lock the door, and it shall stay locked. 'Twill serve him right to stay out doors all night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Minutes slipped away, and the decisive hour approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go to the door and look out," thought Mrs. Mudge, "if he ain't anywhere in sight I'll fasten the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She laid down her work and went to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had not quite reached it when it was flung open violently, and Mr. Mudge, with a wild, disordered look, rushed in, nearly over-turning his wife, who gazed at him with mingled anger and astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean by this foolery, Mudge?" she demanded, sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do I mean?" repeated her husband, vaguely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I needn't ask you," said his wife, contemptuously. "I see how it is, well enough. You're drunk!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Drunk!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, drunk; as drunk as a beast."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Mrs. Mudge," hiccoughed her husband, in what he endeavored to make a dignified tone, "you'd be drunk too if you'd seen what I've seen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what have you seen, I should like to know?" said Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mudge rose with some difficulty, steadied himself on his feet, and approaching his wife, whispered in a tragic tone, "Mrs. Mudge, I've seen a sperrit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's plain enough that you've seen spirit," retorted his wife. " 'Tisn't many nights that you don't, for that matter. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mudge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't that," said her husband, shaking his hand, "it's a sperrit,—a ghost, that I've seen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" said Mrs. Mudge, sarcastically, "perhaps you can tell whose it is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was the sperrit of Sally Baker," said Mudge, solemnly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did she say?" demanded Mrs. Mudge, a little curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She said that I—that we, half starved her, and then she started to run after me—and— oh, Lordy, there she is now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mudge jumped trembling to his feet. Following the direction of his outstretched finger, Mrs. Mudge caught a glimpse of a white figure just before the window. I need hardly say that it was Ben, who had just arrived upon the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge was at first stupefied by what she saw, but being a woman of courage she speedily recovered herself, and seizing the broom from behind the door, darted out in search of the "spirit." But Ben, perceiving that he was discovered, had disappeared, and there was nothing to be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't I tell you so?" muttered Mudge, as his wife re-entered, baffled in her attempt, "you'll believe it's a sperrit, now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go to bed, you fool!" retorted his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was all that passed between Mr. and Mrs. Mudge on the subject. Mr. Mudge firmly believes, to this day, that the figure which appeared to him was the spirit of Sally Baker.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXVIII. HOW BEN GOT HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DELIGHTED with the complete success of his practical joke, Ben took his way homeward with the sheet under his arm. By the time he reached his father's house it was ten o'clock. The question for Ben to consider now was, how to get in. If his father had not fastened the front door he might steal in, and slip up stairs on tiptoe without being heard. This would be the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty, and Ben, perceiving that the light was still burning in the sitting-room, had some hopes that he would be able to adopt it. But while he was only a couple of rods distant he saw the lamp taken up by his father, who appeared to be moving from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's going to lock the front door," thought Ben, in disappointment; "if I had only got along five minutes sooner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From his post outside he heard the key turn in the lock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 'Squire little dreamed that the son whom he imagined fast asleep in his room was just outside the door he was locking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I'll go round to the back part of the house," thought Ben, "perhaps I can get in the same way I came out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly he went round and managed to clamber upon the roof, which was only four feet from the ground. But a brief trial served to convince our young adventurer that it is a good deal easier sliding down a roof than it is climbing up. The shingles being old were slippery, and though the ascent was not steep, Ben found the progress he made was very much like that of a man at the bottom of a well, who is reported as falling back two feet for every three that he ascended. What increased the difficulty of his attempt was that the soles of his shoes were well worn, and slippery as well as the shingles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never can get up this way," Ben concluded, after several fruitless attempts; "I know what I'll do," he decided, after a moment's perplexity; "I'll pull off my shoes and stockings, and then I guess I can get along better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben accordingly got down from the roof, and pulled off his shoes and stockings. As he wanted to carry these with him, he was at first a little puzzled by this new difficulty. He finally tied the shoes together by the strings and hung them round his neck. He disposed of the stockings by stuffing one in each pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," thought Ben, "I guess I can get along better. I don't know what to do with the plaguy sheet, though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But necessity is the mother of invention, and Ben found that he could throw the sheet over his shoulders, as a lady does with her shawl. Thus accoutered he recommenced the ascent with considerable confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found that his bare feet clung to the roof more tenaciously than the shoes had done, and success was already within his grasp, when an unforeseen mishap frustrated his plans. He had accomplished about three quarters of the ascent when all at once the string which united the shoes which he had hung round his neck gave way, and both fell with a great thump on the roof. Ben made a clutch for them in which he lost his own hold, and made a hurried de scent in their company, alighting with his bare feet on some flinty gravel stones, which he found by no means agreeable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ow!" ejaculated Ben, limping painfully, "them plaguy gravel stones hurt like thunder. I'll move 'em away the first thing to-morrow. If that confounded shoe-string hadn't broken I'd have been in bed by this time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Hannah had been sitting over the kitchen fire enjoying a social chat with a "cousin" of hers from Ireland, a young man whom she had never seen or heard of three months before. In what way he had succeeded in convincing her of the relationship I have never been able to learn, but he had managed to place himself on familiar visiting terms with the inmate of 'Squire Newcome's kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's only me cousin, sir," Hannah explained to the 'Squire, when he had questioned her on the subject; "he's just from Ireland, sir, and it seems like home to see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the present occasion Tim Flaherty had outstayed his usual time, and was still in the kitchen when Ben reached home. They did not at first hear him, but when he made his last abortive attempt, and the shoes came clattering down, they could not help hearing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" asked Hannah, listening attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She went to the door to look out, her cousin following.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nothing to be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you was dramin' Hannah," said Tim, "more by token, it's time we was both doin' that same, so I'll bid you good-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come again soon, Tim," said Hannah, preparing to close the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A new plan of entrance flashed upon Ben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He quickly put on his shoes and stockings, unfolded the sheet and prepared to enact the part of a ghost once more,—this time for the special benefit of Hannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After fully attiring himself he came to the back door which Hannah had already locked, and tapped three times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah was engaged in raking out the kitchen fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure it's Tim come back," thought she, as she went to the door. "Perhaps he's forgotten something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She opened the door unsuspiciously, fully expecting to see her Irish cousin standing before her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What was her terror on beholding a white-robed figure, with extended arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Howly virgin, defend me!" she exclaimed, in paralyzing terror, which was increased by a guttural sound which proceeded from the throat of the ghost, who at the same time waved his arms aloft, and made a step towards Hannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah, with a wild howl dropped the lamp and fed towards the sitting-room, where 'Squire Newcome was still sitting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben sped upstairs at the top of his speed, dashed into his own chamber, spread the sheet on the bed, and undressed so rapidly that he seemed only to shake his clothes off, and jumped into bed. He closed his eyes and appeared to be in a profound slumber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah's sudden appearance in the sitting-room in such a state naturally astonished the 'Squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he demanded of the affrighted servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, sir," she gasped, "I'm almost kilt entirely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you?" said the 'Squire, "you appear to be more frightened than hurt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, shure I am frightened, which indeed I couldn't help it, sir, for I never saw a ghost before in all my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A ghost! What nonsense are you talking, Hannah?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shure it's not nonsense, for it's just now that the ghost came to the door, sir, and knocked, and I went to the door thinking it might be me cousin, who's been passing the evening with me, when I saw a great white ghost, ten foot tall, standing forninst me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten feet tall?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, and he spread out his arms and spoke in a terrible voice, and was going to carry me off wid him, but I dropped the lamp, and O sir, I'm kilt entirely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is a strange story," said 'Squire Newcome, rather suspiciously; "I hope you have not been drinking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah protested vehemently that not a drop of liquor had passed her lips, which was true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go out and hunt for the ghost," said the 'Squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, don't sir. He'll carry you off," said Hannah, terrified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense!" exclaimed the 'Squire. "Follow me, or you may stay here if you are frightened."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Hannah would by no means do, since the 'Squire had taken the lamp and she would be left in the dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly she followed him with a trembling step, as he penetrated through the kitchen into the back room, ready to run at the least alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The back-door was wide open, but nothing was to be seen of the ghost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the ghost's up-stairs," said Hannah, "I can't sleep up there this night, shure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But something had attracted Squire Newcome's attention. It was quite muddy out of doors, and Ben had tracked in considerable mud with him. The footprints were very perceptible on the painted floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The ghost seems to have had muddy shoes," said the 'Squire dryly; "I guess I can find him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He followed the tracks which witnessed so strongly against Ben, to whose chamber they led.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ben, though still awake, appeared to be in a profound slumber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ben-ja-min!" said his father, stooping over the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ben-ja-min!" repeated his father, giving him a shake, "what does all this mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?" inquired Ben, opening his eyes, and looking very innocent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where have you been, to-night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You sent me to bed," said Ben, "and I came."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the 'Squire was not to be deceived. He was already in possession of too much information to be put off. So Ben, who with all his love of mischief was a boy of truth, finally owned up everything. His father said very little, but told him the next morning that he had made up his mind to send him to a military boarding-school, where the discipline was very strict. Ben hardly knew whether to he glad or sorry, but finally, as boys like change and variety, came to look upon his new prospects with considerable cheerfulness.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXIX. DAWKINS IN DIFFICULTIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGE DAWKINS was standing at his desk one morning, when a man entered the office, and stepping up to him, unceremoniously tapped him on the shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins turned. He looked extremely annoyed on perceiving his visitor, whose outward appearance was certainly far from prepossessing. His face exhibited unmistakable marks of dissipation, nor did the huge breast pin and other cheap finery which he wore conceal the fact of his intense vulgarity. His eyes were black and twinkling, his complexion very dark, and his air that of a foreigner. He was, in fact, a Frenchman, though his language would hardly have betrayed him, unless, as sometimes, he chose to interlard his discourse with French phrases.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you this morning, my friend?" said the newcomer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you here for?" asked Dawkins, roughly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That does not seem to me a very polite way of receiving your friends."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Friends!" retorted Dawkins, scornfully, "who authorized you to call yourself my friend?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Creditor, then, if it will suit you better, mon ami ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush," said Dawkins, in an alarmed whisper, "he will hear," here he indicated Paul with his finger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why should I care? I have no secrets from the young man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop, Duval," exclaimed Dawkins, in an angry whisper, "Leave the office at once. Your appearing here will injure me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I am not your friend; why should I care?" sneered Duval.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Listen to reason. Leave me now, and I will meet you when and where you will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, that sounds better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now go. I'm afraid Mr. Danforth will be in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he comes, introduce me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins would like to have knocked the fellow over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Name your place and time, and be quick about it," said he impatiently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eight o'clock this evening, you know where," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well. Good-morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind you bring some money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning," returned Dawkins, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length, much to his relief, Duval left the office. Dawkins stole a side glance at Paul, to see what impression the interview had made upon him, but our hero, who had overheard some portions of the dialogue, perceiving that Dawkins wished it to be private, took as little notice of the visitor as possible. He could not help thinking, however, that Duval was a man whose acquaintance was likely to be of little benefit to his fellow clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Throughout the day Dawkins appeared unusually nervous, and made several blunders which annoyed Mr. Danforth. Evidently he had something on his mind. Not to keep the reader in suspense, George had fallen among bad companions, where he had learned both to drink and to gamble. In this way he had made the acquaintance of Duval, an unscrupulous sharper, who had contrived to get away all his ready money, and persuading him to play longer in the hope of making up his losses had run him into debt one hundred and fifty dollars. Dawkins gave him an acknowledgment of indebtedness to that amount. This of course placed him in Duval's power, since he knew of no means of raising such a sum. He therefore kept out of the Frenchman's way, avoiding the old haunts where he would have been likely to meet him. Dawkins supposed Duval ignorant of the whereabouts of his employer's counting-room. So he had been, but he made it his business to ascertain where it was. He had no idea of losing sight of so valuable a prize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins would willingly have broken the appointment he had made with Duval, but he did not dare to do so. He knew that the man was well able to annoy him, and he would not on any account have had the affair disclosed to his father or Mr. Danforth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Trinity clock struck eight, he entered a low bar-room in the neighborhood of the docks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A young man with pale, sandy hair stood behind the counter with his sleeves rolled up. He was supplying the wants of a sailor who al ready appeared to have taken more drink than was good for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good evening, Mr. Dawkins," said he, "you're a stranger."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Duval in?" inquired Dawkins, coldly. His pride revolted at the place and company. He had never been here but once before, having met Duval elsewhere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's up in his room. John show the young gentleman up to No. 9. Won't you have a glass of something this evening?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dawkins, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy preceded him up a dark and dirty staircase.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the room, sir," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop a minute," said Dawkins, "he may not be in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He inwardly hoped he might not. But Duval answered his knock by coming to the door himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Delighted to see you, mon ami . John, may leave the lamp. That's all, unless Mr. Dawkins wishes to order something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want nothing," said Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They have some capital brandy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not in the mood for drinking tonight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As you please," said the Frenchman, disappointed; "be seated."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins sat down in a wooden rocking-chair, minus an arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Duval, "how much money have you brought me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Frenchman frowned and stroked his mustache, fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does all this mean? Are you going to put me off longer?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would pay it if I could," said Dawkins, "but I haven't got the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You could get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ask your father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father would rave if he knew that I had lost money in such a way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you need not tell him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I ask for money, he will be sure to ask what I want it for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell him you want clothes, or a watch, or a hundred things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins shook his head; "it won't do," said he. "He wouldn't give me a hundred and fifty dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then ask seventy-five, and I will wait a month for the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, Duval, you have no rightful claim to this money. You've got enough out of me. Just tear up the paper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duval laughed scornfully, "Aha, Mr. Dawkins," he said, "that would be a very pretty arrangement for you . But I don't see how it is going to benefit me. No, no, I can't afford to throw away a hundred and fifty dollars so easily. If I was a rich man like your father it would make a difference."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you won't remit the debt," said Dawkins, sullenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You would think me a great ninny, if I did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you may collect it the best way you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean by that?" demanded the Frenchman, his face darkening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean what I say," said Dawkins, desperately, "Gambling debts are not recognizable in law."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing is said about it's being a gambling debt. I have your note."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which is worth nothing, since I am a minor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duval's face became black with rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aha, my friend," said he showing his teeth, "this is a very nice game to cheat me out of my money. But it won't do, it won't do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why won't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall say a word in your father's ear, mon ami , and in the ear of your worthy employer whom you were so anxious for me not to see, and perhaps that would be worse for you than to pay me my money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins's brief exultation passed away. He saw that he was indeed in the power of an unscrupulous man, who was disposed to push his advantage to the utmost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He subsided into a moody silence, which Duval watched with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my friend, what will you do about it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what I can do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will think of something. You will find it best," said the Frenchman, in a tone which veiled a threat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will try," said Dawkins, gloomily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is well. I thought you would listen to reason, mon ami . Now we will have a pleasant chat. Hold, I will order some brandy myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not for me," said Dawkins, rising from his chair, "I must be going."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you not have one little game?" asked Duval, coaxingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no, I have had enough of that. Goodnight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you won't stop. And when shall I have the pleasure of seeing you at my little apartment once more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it is any trouble to you to come, I will call at your office," said Duval, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't trouble yourself," said Dawkins, hastily; "I will come here a week from today."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A week is a long time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Long or short, I must have it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, mon ami . A week let it be. Good-night. Mind the stairs as you go down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins breathed more freely as he passed out into the open air. He was beginning to realize that the way of the transgressor is hard.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXX. A TRAP IS LAID FOR PAUL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE months before, George Dawkins had made his first visit to a gambling house. At first, he had entered only from curiosity. He watched the play with an interest which gradually deepened, until he was easily persuaded to try his own luck. The stakes were small, but fortune favored him, and he came out some dollars richer than he entered. It would have been fortunate for him if he had failed. As it was, his good fortune encouraged him to another visit. This time he was less fortunate, but his gains about balanced his losses, so that he came out even. On the next occasion he left off with empty pockets. So it went on until at length he fell into the hands of Duval, who had no scruple in fleecing him to as great an extent as he could be induced to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Dawkins's reflections were not of the most cheerful character as, leaving Duval, he slowly pursued his way homeward. He felt that he had fallen into the power of an unscrupulous villain, who would have no mercy upon him. He execrated his own folly, without which all the machination of Duval would have been without effect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question now, however, was, to raise the money. He knew of no one to whom he could apply except his father, nor did he have much hope from that quarter. Still, he would make the effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reaching home he found his father seated in the library. He looked up from the evening paper as George entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only half-past nine," he said, with an air of sarcasm. "You spend your evenings out so systematically that your early return surprises me. How is it? Has the theater begun to lose its charm!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no great sympathy between father and son, and if either felt affection for the other, it was never manifested. Mutual recrimination was the rule between them, and George would now have made an angry answer but that he had a favor to ask, and felt it politic to be conciliatory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I had supposed you cared for my society, sir, I would have remained at home oftener."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Umph!" was the only reply elicited from his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"However, there was a good reason for my not going to the theater to-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had no money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your explanation is quite satisfactory," said his father, with a slight sneer. "I sympathize in your disappointment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is no occasion, sir," said George, good humoredly, for him. "I had no great desire to go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins took down a book from the library and tried to read, but without much success. His thoughts continually recurred to his pecuniary embarrassments, and the debt which he owed to Duval seemed to hang like a millstone around his neck. How should he approach his father on the subject? In his present humor he feared he would have little chance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As his father laid down the newspaper Dawkins said, "Wouldn't you like a game of checkers, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This, as he well knew, was a favorite game with his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but I should," said Mr. Dawkins, more graciously than was his wont.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The checker-board was brought, and the two commenced playing. Three games were played all of which his father won. This appeared to put him in a good humor, for as the two ceased playing, he drew a ten-dollar-bill from his pocket-book, and handed to his son, with the remark, "There, George, I don't want you to be penniless. You are a little extravagant, though, I think. Your pay from Mr. Danforth ought to keep you in spending money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I have been rather extravagant, but I am going to reform."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very glad to hear it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish, sir," said George a moment afterwards," that you would allow me to buy my own clothes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've no sort of an objection, I am sure. You select them now, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, but I mean to suggest that you should make me an allowance for that purpose, —about as much as it costs now,—and give me the money to spend where I please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Dawkins looked sharply at his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The result would probably be," he said, "that the money would be expended in other ways, and I should have to pay for the clothes twice over."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins would have indignantly disclaimed this, if he had not felt that he was not altogether sincere in the request he had made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," continued his father, "I don't like the arrangement you propose. When you need clothing you can go to my tailor and order it, of course not exceeding reasonable limits."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But," said Dawkins, desperately, "I don't like Bradshaw's style of making clothes. I would prefer trying some other tailor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What fault have you to find with Bradshaw? Is he not one of the most fashionable tailors in the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I suppose so, but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, sir, you are growing altogether too particular. All your garments set well, so far as I can judge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, but one likes a change sometimes," persisted George, a little embarrassed for further objections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Mr. Dawkins, after a pause, "If you are so strongly bent upon a new tailor, select one, and order what you need. You can tell him to send in his bill to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you sir," said his son, by no means pleased at the manner in which his request had been granted. He saw that it would in no manner promote the plan which he had in view, since it would give him no command of the ready money. It is hardly necessary to say that his alleged dissatisfaction with his father's tailor had all been trumped up for the occasion, and would never have been thought of but for the present emergency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What shall I do!" thought Dawkins, in perplexity, as he slowly undressed himself and retired to bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The only true course, undoubtedly, was to confess all to his father, to incur the storm of reproaches which would have followed as the just penalty of his transgression, and then the haunting fear of discovery would have been once and forever removed. But Dawkins was not brave enough for this. He thought only of escaping from his present difficulty without his father's knowledge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rose the next morning with the burden of care still weighing upon him. In the evening the thought occurred to him that he might retrieve his losses where he had incurred them, and again he bent his steps to the gambling house. He risked five dollars, being one-half of what he had. This was lost. Desperately he hazarded the remaining five dollars, and lost again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a muttered oath he sprang to his feet, and left the brilliant room, more gloomy and discouraged than ever. He was as badly off as before, and penniless beside. He would have finished the evening at the theater, but his recent loss prevented that. He lounged about the streets till it was time to go to bed, and then went home in a very unsatisfactory state of mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A day or two after, he met on Broadway the man whom of all others he would gladly have avoided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aha, my friend, I am glad to meet you," said Duval, for it was he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins muttered something unintelligible, and would have hurried on, but Duval detained him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why are you in such a hurry, my friend?" he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Business," returned Dawkins, shortly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That reminds me of the little business affair between us, mon ami . Have you got any money for me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not yet! It is three days since we saw each other. Could you not do something in three days?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told you I required a week," said Dawkins, roughly, "Let go my arm. I tell you I am in haste."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, mon ami ," said Duval, slowly relinquishing his hold, "take care that you do not forget. There are four days more to the week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins hurried on feeling very uncomfortable. He was quite aware that four days hence he would be as unprepared to encounter the Frenchman as now. Still, something might happen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Something, unfortunately, did happen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Mr. Danforth was counting a roll of bills which had been just paid in, when he was unexpectedly called out of the counting-room. He unguardedly left the bills upon his own desk. Dawkins saw them lying there. The thought flashed upon him, "There lies what will relieve me from all my embarrassment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Allowing himself scarcely a minute to think, he took from the roll four fifty dollar notes, thrust one into the pocket of Paul's overcoat, which hung up in the office, drew off his right boot and slipped the other three into the bottom of it, and put it on again. He then nervously resumed his place at his desk. A moment afterwards, Paul, who had been to the post-office, entered with letters which he carried into the inner office and deposited on Mr. Danforth's desk. He observed the roll of bills, and thought his employer careless in leaving so much money exposed, but said nothing on the subject to Dawkins, between whom and himself there was little communication.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXXI. CONVICTED OF THEFT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HALF an hour later Mr. Danforth returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has any one been here?" he asked as he passed through the outer office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Dawkins, with outward composure though his heart was beating rapidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While apparently intent upon his writing he listened attentively to what might be going on in the next room. One,—two,—three minutes passed. Mr. Danforth again showed himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you say that no one has been here?" he demanded, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have either of you been into my office since I have been out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have not, sir," said Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I went in to carry your letters," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you see a roll of bills lying on my desk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Paul, a little surprised at the question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have just counted it over, and find but six hundred dollars instead of eight hundred. Can you account for the discrepancy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth looked keenly at the two boys. Dawkins, who had schooled himself to the ordeal, maintained his outward calmness. Paul, beginning to perceive that his honesty was called in question, flushed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said the boys simultaneously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It can hardly be possible, that Mr. Thompson, who is a very careful man, should have made such a mistake in paying me," resumed Mr. Danforth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As we have been the only persons here," said Dawkins, "the only way to vindicate ourselves from suspicion is, to submit to a search."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Paul promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both boys turned their pockets inside out, but the missing money was not found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is my overcoat, sir," said Dawkins, "will you be kind enough to search it for yourself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next, of course, Paul's overcoat was searched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What was our hero's dismay when from one of the pockets Mr. Danforth produced a fifty dollar bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it possible?" he exclaimed in as much grief as surprise, "Unhappy boy, how came you by this money in your pocket?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, sir," returned Paul, his cheek alternately flushing and growing pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could believe you," said Mr. Danforth; "where have you put the other bills? Produce them, and I may overlook this first offense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed, sir," said Paul, in great distress, "I have not the slightest knowledge of how this bill came into my pocket. I hope you will believe me, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can I? The money evidently did not go into your pocket without hands."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sudden thought came to Paul. "Dawkins," said he, "did you put that money into my pocket?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean, sir?" returned Dawkins, haughtily. "Is it your intention to insult me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins could not prevent his face from flushing as he spoke, but this might easily be referred to a natural resentment of the imputation cast upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul," said his employer, coldly, "you will not help your own cause by seeking to involve another. After what has happened you can hardly expect me to retain you in my employment. I will not make public your disgrace, nor will I inquire farther for the remainder of the money for which you have been willing to barter your integrity. I will pay your wages up to the end of this week, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Danforth," said Paul, manfully, though the tears almost choked his utterance, "I am sorry that you have no better opinion of me. I do not want the balance of my wages. If I have taken so large a sum which did not belong to me, I have no claim to them. Good-morning, sir. Sometime I hope you will think better of me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul put on his coat, and taking his cap from the nail on which it hung, bowed respectfully to his employer and left the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth looked after him, and seemed perplexed. Could Paul be guilty after all?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never could have suspected him if I had not this evidence in my hand," said Mr. Danforth, to himself, fixing his eyes upon the bill which he had drawn from Paul's overcoat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dawkins, did you observe whether Paul remained long in the office?" he asked,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Longer than sufficient to lay the letters on the desk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I think he did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you notice whether he went to his overcoat after coming out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, he did," said Dawkins, anxious to fix in Mr. Danforth's mind the impression of Paul's guilt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I am afraid it is true," said his employer sadly. "And yet, what a fine, manly boy he is too. But it is a terrible fault."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth was essentially a kind-hearted man, and he cared much more for Paul's dereliction from honesty than for the loss of the money. Going home early to dinner, he communicated to his wife the unpleasant discovery which he had made respecting Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, from the first, Paul had been a great favorite with Mrs. Danforth, and she scouted at the idea of his dishonesty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Depend upon it, Mr. Danforth," she said decisively, "you have done the boy an injustice. I have some skill in reading faces, and I tell you that a boy with Paul Prescott's open, frank expression is incapable of such a crime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I should have said, my dear, but we men learn to be less trustful than you ladies, who stay at home and take rose-colored views of life. Unfortunately, we see too much of the dark side of human nature."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So that you conclude all to be dark."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not so bad as that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me all the circumstances, and perhaps a woman's wit may help you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth communicated all the details, with which the reader is already familiar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What sort of a boy is this Dawkins?" she asked, "Do you like him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not particularly. He does his duties passably well. I took him into my counting-room to oblige his father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps he is the thief."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To tell the truth I would sooner have suspected him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has he cleared himself from suspicion?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was the first to suggest a search."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Precisely the thing he would have done, if he had placed the bill in Paul's pocket. Of course he would know that the search must result favorably for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is something in that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Besides, what could have been more foolish, if Paul wished to hide the money, than to multiply his chances of detection by hiding it in two different places, especially where one was so obvious as to afford no concealment at all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Admitting this to be true, how am I to arrive at the proof of Paul's innocence?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My own opinion is, that George Dawkins has the greater part of the money stolen. Probably he has taken it for some particular purpose. What it is, you may learn, perhaps, by watching him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will be guided by your suggestion. Nothing would afford me greater pleasure than to find that I have been mistaken in assuming Paul's guilt, though on evidence that seemed convincing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This conversation took place at the dinner-table. Mr. Danforth understood that no time was to be lost if he expected to gain any information from the movements of his clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Dawkins had ventured upon a bold act, but he had been apparently favored by fortune, and had succeeded. That he should have committed this crime without compunction could hardly be expected. His uneasiness, however, sprang chiefly from the fear that in some way he might yet be detected. He resolved to get rid of the money which he had obtained dishonestly, and obtain back from Duval the acknowledgment of indebtedness which he had given him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will perhaps ask whether the wrong which he had done Paul affected him with uneasiness. On the contrary, it gratified the dislike which from the first he had cherished towards our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am well rid of him, at all events," he muttered to himself, "that is worth risking some thing for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When office hours were over Dawkins gladly threw down his pen, and left the counting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent his steps rapidly towards the locality where he had before met Duval. He had decided to wait some time before meeting that worthy. He had to wait till another day, when as he was emerging from the tavern he encountered the Frenchman on the threshold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aha, my good friend," said Duval, offering his hand, which Dawkins did not appear to see, "I am very glad to see you. Will you come in?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I have not time," said Dawkins, shortly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you brought me my money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aha, that is well. I was just about what you call cleaned out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you my note with you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duval fumbled in his pocket-book, and finally produced the desired document.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give it to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must have the money first," said the Frenchman, shrewdly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take it," said Dawkins contemptuously. "Do you judge me by yourself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He tore the note which he received into small pieces, and left Duval without another word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sheltered by the darkness, Mr. Danforth, who had tracked the steps of Dawkins, had been an unseen witness of this whole transaction.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXXII. RIGHT TRIUMPHANT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGE DAWKINS resumed his duties the next morning as usual. Notwithstanding the crime he had committed to screen himself from the consequences of a lighter fault, he felt immeasurably relieved at the thought that he had shaken himself free from the clutches of Duval. His satisfaction was heightened by the disgrace and summary dismissal of Paul, whom he had never liked. He decided to ask the place for a cousin of his own, whose society would be more agreeable to him than that of his late associate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, sir," he said, as Mr. Danforth entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning," returned his employer, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you selected any one in Prescott's place, yet, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why do you ask?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I have a cousin, Malcolm Harcourt, who would be glad to take it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" said Mr. Danforth, whose manner somewhat puzzled Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should enjoy having him with me," continued Dawkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you like Prescott?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir," said Dawkins, promptly, "I didn't want to say so before, but now, since he's turned out so badly, I don't mind saying that I never thought much of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On the contrary," said Mr. Danforth, "I liked him from the first. Perhaps we are wrong in thinking that he took the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think there could be no doubt of it," said Dawkins, not liking the sympathy and returning good feeling for Paul which his employer manifested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't agree with you," said Mr. Danforth, coldly. "I have decided to reinstate Paul in his former place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, if any more money is missing, you will know where it has gone," said Dawkins, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then there is no chance for my cousin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am expecting to have a vacancy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins looked up in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall require some one to fill your place," said Mr. Danforth, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir!" exclaimed Dawkins, in astonishment and dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His employer bent a searching glance upon him as he asked, sternly, "where did you obtain the money which you paid away last evening?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—don't—understand—you, sir," gasped Dawkins, who understood only too well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You met a man at the door of a low tavern in—Street, last evening, to whom you paid one hundred and fifty dollars, precisely the sum which I lost yesterday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who has been slandering me, sir?" asked Dawkins, very pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An eye-witness of the meeting, who heard the conversation between you. If you want more satisfactory proof, here it is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth took from his pocket-book the torn fragments of the note which Dawkins had given to Duval.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is an obligation to pay a certain Duval the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars. It bears your signature. How you could have incurred such a debt to him you best know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins maintained a sullen silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you wish me to leave your employment," he said at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are right. Hold," he added, as Dawkins was about leaving the room, "a word more. It is only just that you should make a restitution of the sum which you have taken. If you belonged to a poor family and there were extenuating circumstances, I might forego my claim. But your father is abundantly able to make good the loss, and I shall require you to lay the matter before him without loss of time. In consideration of your youth, I shall not bring the matter before the public tribunals, as I have a right to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dawkins turned pale at this allusion, and muttering some words to the effect that he would do what he could, left the counting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This threat proved not to be without its effect. The next day he came to Mr. Danforth and brought the sum for which he had become responsible. He had represented to his father that he had had his pocket picked of this sum belonging to Mr. Danforth, and in that manner obtained an equal amount to replace it. It was some time before Mr. Dawkins learned the truth. Then came a storm of reproaches in which all the bitterness of his father's nature was fully exhibited. There had never been much love between father and son. Henceforth there was open hatred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We must return to Paul, whom we left in much trouble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a sad walk which he took homeward on the morning of his dismissal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What brings you home so early?" asked Mrs. Cameron, looking up from her baking, as Paul entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul tried to explain, but tears came to his eyes, and sobs choked his utterance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sick, Paul?" exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Aunt Hester."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then what is the matter?" she asked anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have lost my place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor boy! I am very sorry to hear it. But it might have been worse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, not very well, Aunt Hester, for Mr. Danforth thinks I have taken some of his money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is very unjust!" exclaimed Aunt Hester, indignantly, "he ought to have known better than to think you would steal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no," said Paul, candidly, "I must confess the evidence was against me, and he doesn't know me as well as you do, Aunt Hester."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me all about it, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Hester sat down and listened attentively to our hero's story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you account for the money being found in your pocket?" she asked at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it must have been put there by some one else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any suspicions?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Paul, a little reluctantly, "but I don't know whether I ought to have. I may be wronging an innocent person."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At any rate it won't do any harm to tell me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've heard me speak of George Dawkins?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't help thinking that he put the fifty dollars into my pocket, and took the rest himself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How very wicked he must be!" exclaimed Mrs. Cameron, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't judge him too hastily; Aunt Hester, he may not be guilty, and I know from my own experience how hard it is to be accused when you are innocent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon after the sexton came in, and Paul of course, told his story over again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, Paul," said Uncle Hugh, cheerily. "You know your own innocence; that is the main thing. It's a great thing to have a clear conscience."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I liked Mr. Danforth and I think he liked me. It's hard to feel that he and Mrs. Danforth will both think me guilty, especially after the kindness which I have experienced from them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We all have our crosses, my boy,—some light and others heavy. Yours, I admit is a heavy one for a boy to bear. But when men are unjust there is One above who will deal justly with us. You have not forgotten him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Uncle Hugh," said Paul, reverently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Trust in him, Paul, and all will come out right at last. He can prove your innocence, and you may be sure he will, in his own good time. Only be patient, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will try to be, Uncle Hugh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The simple, hearty trust in God, which the sexton manifested, was not lost upon Paul. Sustained by his own consciousness of innocence, and the confidence reposed in him by those who knew him best, his mind soon regained its cheerful tone. He felt an inward conviction that God would vindicate his innocence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His vindication came sooner than he anticipated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day as the sexton's family were seated at their plain dinner, a knock was heard upon the outer door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit still, Hester," said Mr. Cameron. "I will go to the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opening the door he recognized Mr. Danforth, who attended the same church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Cameron, I believe," said Mr. Danforth, pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I come in? I am here on a little business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, Mr. Danforth. Excuse my not inviting you before; but in my surprise at seeing you, I forgot my politeness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sexton led the way into the plain sitting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe Paul Prescott is an inmate of your family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I am sorry—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know what you would say, sir; but it is needless. May I see Paul a moment?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul was surprised at the summons, and still more surprised at finding who it was that wished to see him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered the room slowly, uncertain how to accost Mr. Danforth. His employer solved the doubt in his mind by advancing cordially, and taking his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paul," he said pleasantly, "I have come here to ask your forgiveness for an injustice, and to beg you to resume your place in my counting-room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you found out who took the money, sir?" asked Paul, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was it, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was Dawkins."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Danforth explained how he had become acquainted with the real thief. In conclusion, he said, "I shall expect you back to-morrow morning, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dawkins of course leaves my employ. You will take his place, and receive his salary, seven dollars a week instead of five. Have you any friend whom you would like to have in your own place?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul reflected a moment and finally named a schoolmate of his, the son of poor parents, whom he knew to be anxiously seeking a situation, but without influential friends to help him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will take him on your recommendation," said Mr. Danforth, promptly. "Can you see him this afternoon?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Paul resumed his place in Mr. Danforth's counting-room.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXXIII. PAUL REDEEMS HIS PLEDGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TWO years passed, unmarked by any incident of importance. Paul continued in Mr. Danforth's employment, giving, if possible, increased satisfaction. He was not only faithful, but exhibited a rare aptitude for business, which made his services of great value to his employer. From time to time Mr. Danforth increased his salary, so that, though only nineteen, he was now receiving twelve dollars per week, with the prospect of a speedy increase. But with his increasing salary, he did not increase his expenses. He continued as economical as ever. He had not forgotten his father's dying injunction. He remained true to the charge which he had taken upon himself, that of redeeming his father's memory from reproach. This, at times subjected him to the imputation of meanness, but for this he cared little. He would not swerve from the line of duty which he had marked out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One evening as he was walking down Broadway with an acquaintance, Edward Hastings, who was employed in a counting-room near him, they paused before a transparency in front of a hall brilliantly lighted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Hutchinsons are going to sing to- night, Paul," said Hastings. "Did you ever hear them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but I have often wished to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then suppose we go in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I believe not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not. Paul? It seems to me you never go anywhere. You ought to amuse yourself now and then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some other time I will,—not now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not required to be at home in the evening, are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then why not come in now? It's only twenty-five cents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To tell the truth, Ned, I am saving up my money for a particular purpose; and until that is accomplished, I avoid all unnecessary expense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to invest in a house in Fifth Avenue? When you do, I'll call. However, never mind the expense. I'll pay you in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm much obliged to you, Ned, but I can't. accept."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because at present I can't afford to return the favor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I do mind it. By-and-by I shall feel more free. Good-night, if you are going in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a strange fellow," mused Hastings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's impossible to think him mean, and yet, it looks a great deal like it. He spends nothing for dress or amusements. I do believe that I've had three coats since he's been wearing that old brown one. Yet, he always looks neat. I wonder what he's saving up his money for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Paul went home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sexton and his wife looked the same as ever. Paul sometimes fancied that Uncle Hugh stooped a little more than he used to do; but his life moved on so placidly and evenly, that he grew old but slowly. Aunt Hester was the same good, kind, benevolent friend that she had always been. No mother could have been more devoted to Paul. He felt that he had much to be grateful for, in his chance meeting with this worthy couple.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the first of January,—a clear, cold day. A pleasant fire burned in the little stove. Mr. Cameron sat at one side, reading the evening paper; Mrs. Cameron at the other, knitting a stocking for Paul. A large, comfortable-looking cat was dozing tranquilly on the hearth-rug. Paul, who had been seated at the table, rose and lighted a candle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going, Paul?" asked Aunt Hester.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up-stairs for a moment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul speedily returned, bearing in his hand a small blue bank-book, with his name on the cover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took out his pencil and figured a few minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hugh," said he, looking up, "when I get a hundred dollars more, I shall have enough to pay father's debt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Principal and interest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, principal and interest; reckoning the interest for a year to come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did not suppose you had so much money, Paul. You must have been very economical."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Uncle Hugh more so than I have wanted to be, oftentimes; but whenever I have been tempted to spend a cent unnecessarily, I have always called to mind my promise made to father on his deathbed, and I have denied myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have done well, Paul. There are few who would have had the resolution to do as you have."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh yes, Uncle Hugh," said Paul, modestly, "I think there are a great many. I begin to feel repaid already. In a few months I shall be able to pay up the whole debt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this moment a knock was heard at the door. Mr. Cameron answered the summons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does Mr. Paul Prescott live here?" inquired a boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Do you want to see him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is a letter for him. There is no answer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The messenger departed, leaving the letter in Mr. Cameron's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somewhat surprised, he returned to the sitting-room and handed it to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul opened it hastily, and discovered inclosed, a bank-note for one hundred dollars. It was accompanied with a note from his employer, stating that it was intended as a New Year's gift, but in the hurry of business, he had forgotten to give it to him during the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul's face lighted up with joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Uncle Hugh!" he exclaimed, almost breathless with delight. "Don't you see that this will enable me to pay my debt at once?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So it will, Paul. I wish you joy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And my father's memory will be vindicated," said Paul, in a tone of deep satisfaction. "If he could only have lived to see this day!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A fortnight later, Paul obtained permission from his employer to be absent from the office for a week. It was his purpose to visit Cedarville and repay 'Squire Conant the debt due him: and then, to go across the country to Wrenville, thirty miles distant, to see Aunt Lucy Lee. First, however, he ordered a new suit of a tailor, feeling a desire to appear to the best advantage on his return to the scene of his former humiliation. I must not omit to say that Paul was now a fine-looking young fellow of nineteen, with a frank, manly face, that won favor wherever he went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due course of time, he arrived at Cedarville, and found his way without difficulty to the house of 'Squire Conant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a large house, rather imposing in its exterior, being quite the finest residence in the village.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul went up the walk, and rang the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I see 'Squire Conant?" he asked of the servant who answered the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll find him in that room," said the girl, pointing to a door on the left hand of the hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As he doesn't know me, perhaps you had better go before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened, and Paul found himself in the presence of his father's creditor. 'Squire Conant was looking pale and thin. He was just recovering from a severe sickness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I presume you don't recognize me, sir," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did I ever see you before?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir; my name is Paul Prescott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not the son of John Prescott?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same, sir. I believe my father died in your debt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I lent him five hundred dollars, which he never repaid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He tried to do so, sir. He had saved up a hundred and fifty dollars towards it, but sickness came upon him, and he was obliged to use it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Squire Conant's temper had been subdued by the long and dangerous illness through which he had passed. It had made him set a smaller value on his earthly possessions, from which he might be separated at any moment. When he answered Paul, it was in a manner which our hero did not expect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind. I can afford to lose it. I have no doubt he did what he could."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I have come to pay it, sir," said Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You!" exclaimed 'Squire Conant, in the greatest astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you get the money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I earned it, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you are very young. How could you have earned so much?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul frankly told the story of his struggles; how for years he had practised a pinching economy, in order to redeem his father's memory from reproach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Squire Conant listened attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a good boy," he said, at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall you have anything left after paying this money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; but I shall soon earn more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still, you ought to have something to begin the world with. You shall pay me half the money, and I will cancel the note."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, sir,—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a word. I am satisfied, and that is enough. If I hadn't lent your father the money, I might have invested it with the rest, and lost all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Squire Conant produced the note from a little trunk of papers, and handed it to Paul, who paid him the amount which he had stipulated, expressing at the same time his gratitude for his unexpected generosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind about thanks, my boy," said 'Squire Conant: "I am afraid I have loved money too well heretofore. I hope I am not too old to turn over a new leaf."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXXIV. HOW PAUL GOES BACK TO WRENVILLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHILE 'Squire Conant was speaking, Paul formed a sudden resolution. He remembered that Aunt Lucy Lee was a sister of 'Squire Conant. Perhaps, in his present frame of mind, it might be possible to induce him to do something for her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I am acquainted with a sister of yours, 'Squire Conant," he commenced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha!" exclaimed the 'Squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Lucy Lee."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," was the slow reply; "she is my sister. Where did you meet her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At the Wrenville Poorhouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long ago?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About six years since."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is she there, still?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. Since I have been in New York, I have heard from her frequently. I am going from here to visit her. Have you any message, sir? I am sure she would be glad to hear from you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She shall hear from me," said the 'Squire in a low voice. "Sit down, and I will write her a letter which, I hope, will not prove unwelcome."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes afterwards he handed Paul an open letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may read it," he said, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have been a better friend to my sister than I." "You shall witness my late reparation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The letter was as follows:— MY DEAR SISTER:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CEDARVILLE, JAN 13, 18—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hope you will forgive me for my long neglect. It is not fitting that while I am possessed of abundant means you should longer remain the tenant of an almshouse. I send you by the bearer of this note, Paul Prescott, who, I understand, is a friend of yours, the sum of three hundred dollars. The same sum will be sent you annually. I hope it will be sufficient to maintain you comfortably. I shall endeavor to call upon you soon, and meanwhile remain,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your affectionate brother EZEKIEL CONANT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul read this letter with grateful joy. It seemed almost to good to be true. Aunt Lucy would be released from the petty tyranny of Mrs. Mudge's household, and perhaps—he felt almost sure Aunt Hester would be willing to receive her as a boarder, thus insuring her a peaceful and happy home in her declining years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, sir," said he, seizing 'Squire Conant's hand, "you cannot tell how happy you have made me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is what I ought to have done before. Here is the money referred to in the letter,— three hundred dollars,—mind you don't lose it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will take every care, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may tell my sister that I shall be happy to have her write me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul left 'Squire Conant's house, feeling that he had great cause for joy. The 'Squire's refusal to receive more than half the debt, left him master of over three hundred dollars. But I am not sure whether he did not rejoice even more over the good fortune which had come to Aunt Lucy Lee, whose kindness to him, in his unfriended boyhood, he would ever hold in grateful remembrance. He enjoyed in anticipation the joy which he knew Aunt Lucy would feel when the change in her fortunes was communicated to her. He knew also how great would be the chagrin of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, when they found that the meek old lady whom they hated was about to be rescued from their clutches. On the whole, Paul felt that this was the happiest day of his life. It was a satisfaction to feel that the good fortune of his early friend was all due to his own intercession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was able to take the cars to a point four miles distant from Wrenville. On getting out on the platform he inquired whether there was a livery stable near by. He was directed to one but a few rods distant. Entering he asked, "Can you let me have a horse and chaise to go to Wrenville?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said the groom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me have the best horse in the stable," said Paul, "and charge me accordingly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said the groom, respectfully, judging from Paul's dress and tone that he was a young gentleman of fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A spirited animal was brought out, and Paul was soon seated in the chaise driving along the Wrenville road. Paul's city friends would hardly have recognized their economical acquaintance in the well-dressed young man who now sat behind a fast horse, putting him through his best paces. It might have been a weakness in Paul, but he remembered the manner in which he left Wrenville, an unfriended boy, compelled to fly from persecution under the cover of darkness, and he felt a certain pride in showing the Mudges that his circumstances were now entirely changed. It was over this very road that he had walked with his little bundle, in the early morning, six years before. It seemed to him almost like a dream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length he reached Wrenville. Though he had not been there for six years, he recognized the places that had once been familiar to him. But everything seemed to have dwindled. Accustomed to large city warehouses, the houses in the village seemed very diminutive. Even 'Squire Benjamin Newcome's house, which he had once regarded as a stately mansion, now looked like a very ordinary dwelling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he rode up the main street of the village, many eyes were fixed upon him and his carriage, but no one thought of recognizing, in the well-dressed youth, the boy who had run away from the Wrenville Poorhouse.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">XXXV. CONCLUSION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT the very moment that Paul was driving through the village street, Mr. Nicholas Mudge entered the Poorhouse in high spirits. Certainly ill-fortune must have befallen some one to make the good man so exhilarant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To explain, Mr. Mudge had just been to the village store to purchase some groceries. One of his parcels was tied up in a stray leaf of a recent New York Daily, in which he discovered an item which he felt sure would make Aunt Lucy unhappy. He communicated it to Mrs. Mudge, who highly approved his design. She called the old lady from the common room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, Aunt Lucy," she said, "is something that will interest you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy came in, wondering a little at such an unusual mark of attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge immediately commenced reading with malicious emphasis a paragraph concerning a certain Paul Prescott, who had been arrested for thieving, and sentenced to the House of Reformation for a term of months.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There," said Mrs. Mudge, triumphantly, "what do you say to your favorite now? Turned out well, hasn't he? Didn't I always say so? I always knew that boy was bad at heart. and that he'd come to a bad end."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe it's the same boy," declared Aunt Lucy, who was nevertheless unpleasantly affected by the paragraph. She thought it possible that Paul might have yielded to a powerful temptation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you think I've been making it up. If you don't believe it look at the paper for yourself," thrusting it into Aunt Lucy's hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said the old lady. "I see that the name is the same; but, for all that, there is a mistake somewhere. I do not believe it is the same boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't? Just as if there would be more than one boy of that name. There may be other Prescotts, but there isn't but one Paul Prescott, take my word for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it is he," said Aunt Lucy, indignantly, "is it Christianlike to rejoice over the poor boy's misfortune?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Misfortune!" retorted Mrs. Mudge with a sneer; "you call it a misfortune to steal, then! I call it a crime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's often misfortune that drives people to it, though," continued the old lady, looking keenly at Mrs. Mudge. "I have known cases where they didn't have that excuse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge colored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go back to your room," said she, sharply; "and don't stay here accusing me and Mr. Mudge of unchristian conduct. You're the most troublesome pauper we have on our hands; and I do wish the town would provide for you somewhere else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I," sighed the old lady to herself, though she did not think fit to give audible voice to her thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was at this moment that Paul halted his chaise at the gate, and lightly jumping out, fastened his horse to a tree, and walked up to the front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who can it be?" thought Mrs. Mudge, hastily adjusting her cap, and taking off her apron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, I'm sure," said Mr. Mudge, unsuspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I declare! I look like a fright."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No worse than usual," said her husband, gallantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time Paul had knocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good-morning, sir," said Mrs. Mudge, deferentially, her respect excited by Paul's dress and handsome chaise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mrs. Lee in?" inquired Paul, not caring to declare himself, yet, to his old enemy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Mrs. Mudge, obsequiously, though not overpleased to find that this was Aunt Lucy's visitor; "would you like to see her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can he want of the old lady?" thought Mrs. Mudge, as she went to summon her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A visitor for me?" asked Aunt Lucy, looking at Mrs. Mudge somewhat suspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; and as he's come in a carriage, you'd better slick up a little; put on a clean cap or something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lucy was soon ready.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked wonderingly at Paul, not recognizing him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not very good at remembering your old friends," said Paul, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What!" exclaimed Aunt Lucy, her face lighting up with joy; "are you little Paul?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not very little, now," said our hero, laughing; "but I'm the same Paul you used to know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mudge, who through the half open door had heard this revelation, was overwhelmed with astonishment and confusion. She hurried to her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wonders will never cease!" she exclaimed, holding up both hands. "If that doesn't turn out to be Paul Prescott. Of course he's up in the world, or he wouldn't dress so well, and ride in such a handsome carriage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say so!" returned Mr. Mudge, who looked as if he had heard of a heavy misfortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I do; I heard him say so with his own lips. It's a pity you showed that paragraph to Aunt Lucy, this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That you showed, you mean," retorted her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't. You know it was you that did it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush; they'll hear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile the two friends were conversing together happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm so glad you're doing so well, Paul," said Aunt Lucy. "It was a lucky day when you left the Poorhouse behind you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Aunt Lucy, and to-day is a lucky day for you. There's room for two in that chaise, and I'm going to take you away with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should enjoy a ride, Paul. It's a long time since I have taken one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't understand me. You're going away not to return."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old lady smiled sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no, Paul. I can't consent to become a burden upon your generosity. You can't afford it. and it will not be right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O," said Paul, smiling, "you give me credit for too much. I mean that you shall pay your board."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you know I have no money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't. I don't consider that a lady is penniless, who has an income of three hundred dollars a year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand you, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, perhaps you will understand this," said our hero, enjoying the old lady's astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew from his pocket a roll of bills, and passed them to Aunt Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old lady looked so bewildered, that he lost no time in explaining the matter to her. Then, indeed, Aunt Lucy was happy; not only because she had become suddenly independent, but, because after years of coldness and estrangement, her brother had at last become reconciled to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Aunt Lucy," resumed Paul, "I'll tell you what my plans are. You shall get into the chaise with me, and go at once to New York. I think Aunt Hester will be willing to receive you as a boarder; if not, I will find you a pleasant place near by. Will that suit you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will make me very happy; but I cannot realize it. It seems like a dream."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this moment Mrs. Mudge entered the room, and, after a moment's scrutiny, pretended to recognize Paul. Her husband followed close behind her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I believe my eyes?" she exclaimed. "Is this indeed Paul Prescott? I am very glad to see you back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only a visit, Mrs. Mudge," said Paul, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll stop to dinner, I hope?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul thought of the soup and dry bread which he used to find so uninviting, and said that he should not have time to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We've thought of you often," said Mr. Mudge, writhing his harsh features into a smile. "There's scarcely a day that we haven't spoken of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ought to feel grateful for your remembrance," said Paul, his eyes twinkling with mirth. "But I don't think, Mr. Mudge, you always thought so much of me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Mudge coughed in some embarrassment, and not thinking of anything in particular to say, said nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to take from you another of your boarders," said Paul. "Can you spare Aunt Lucy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For how long?" asked Mrs. Mudge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For all the time. She has just come into possession of a little property,—several hundred dollars a year,—and I have persuaded her to go to New York to board."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this true?" exclaimed Mrs. Mudge in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said the old lady, "God has been bountiful to me when I least expected it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I be of any service in assisting you to pack up, Mrs. Lee?" asked Mrs. Mudge, with new-born politeness. She felt that as a lady of property, Aunt Lucy was entitled to much greater respect and deference than before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mrs. Mudge," said Paul, answering for her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She won't have occasion for anything in this house. She will get a supply of new things when she gets to New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old lady looked very happy, and Mrs. Mudge, in spite of her outward deference, felt thoroughly provoked at her good fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will not dwell upon the journey to New York. Aunt Lucy, though somewhat fatigued, bore it much better than she had anticipated. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron entered very heartily into Paul's plans, and readily agreed to receive Aunt Lucy as an inmate of their happy and united household. The old lady felt it to be a happy and blessed change from the Poorhouse, where scanty food and poor accommodations had been made harder to bear by the ill temper of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, to a home whose atmosphere was peace and kindness. —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now, dear reader, it behooves us to draw together the different threads of our story, and bring all to a satisfactory</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. and Mrs. Mudge are no longer in charge of the Wrenville Poorhouse. After Aunt Lucy's departure, Mrs. Mudge became so morose and despotic, that her rule became intolerable. Loud complaints came to the ears of 'Squire Newcome, Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor. One fine morning he was compelled to ride over and give the interesting couple warning to leave immediately. Mr. Mudge undertook the charge of a farm, but his habits of intoxication increased upon him to such an extent, that he was found dead one winter night, in a snow-drift, between his own house and the tavern. Mrs. Mudge was not extravagant in her expressions of grief, not having a very strong affection for her husband. At last accounts, she was keeping a boarding-house in a manufacturing town. Some time since, her boarders held an indignation meeting, and threatened to leave in a body unless she improved her fare,—a course to which she was obliged to submit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George Dawkins, unable to obtain a recommendation from Mr. Danforth, did not succeed in securing another place in New York. He finally prevailed upon his father to advance him a sum of money, with which he went to California. Let us hope that he may "turn over a new leaf" there, and establish a better reputation than he did in New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stubbs is still in the tin business. He is as happy as the day is long, and so are his wife and children. Once a year he comes to New York and pays Paul a visit. This supplies him with something to talk about for the rest of the year. He is frugal in his expenses, and is able to lay up a couple of hundred dollars every year, which he confides to Paul, in whose financial skill he has the utmost confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am sure my boy readers would not forgive me for omitting to tell them something more about Ben Newcome. Although his mirthful spirit sometimes led him into mischief, he was good-hearted, and I have known him do many an act of kindness, even at considerable trouble to himself. It will be remembered that in consequence of his night adventure, during which he personated a ghost, much to the terror of Mr. Mudge his father determined to send him to a military school. This proved to be a wise arrangement. The discipline was such as Ben needed, and he soon distinguished himself by his excellence in the military drill. Soon after he graduated, the Rebellion broke out, and Ben was at once, in spite of his youth, elected Captain of the Wrenville company. At the battle of Antiatam he acquitted himself with so much credit that he was promoted to a major. He was again promoted, and when Richmond was evacuated, he was one of the first officers to enter the streets of the Rebel capital, a colonel in command of his regiment. I have heard on high authority, that he is considered one of the best officers in the service.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. and Mrs. Cameron are still living. They are happy in the success and increasing prosperity of Paul, whom they regard as a son. Between them and Aunt Lucy he would stand a very fair chance of being spoiled, if his own good sense and good judgment were not sufficient to save him from such a misfortune Paul is now admitted to a small interest in the firm, which entitles him to a share in the profits. As Danforth and Co. have done a very extensive business of late years, this interest brings him in a very handsome income. There is only one cause of difference between him and the sexton. He insists that Uncle Hugh, who is getting infirm, should resign his office, as he is abundantly able to support the whole family. But the good sexton loves his duties, and will continue to discharge them as long as he is able.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now we must bid farewell to Paul. He has battled bravely with the difficulties and discouragements that beset him in early life, he has been faithful to the charge which he voluntarily assumed, and his father's memory is free from reproach. He often wishes that his father could have lived to witness his prosperity? but God has decreed it otherwise. Happy in the love of friends, and in the enjoyment of all that can make life desirable, so far as external circumstances have that power, let us all wish him God speed!</field>
