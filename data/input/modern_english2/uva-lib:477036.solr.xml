      <field name="heading_text">THE SICK CHILD. BY HENOOK-MAKHEWE-KELENAKA (ANGEL DE CORA)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greyscale, horizontal oblong image of little girl's portrait in profile. In left foreground, she faces left across a slightly rolling plain, her gaze lifted. The back of her head is covered with a striped blanket. Her small right hand holds the edge of the blanket near her throat. Her dark hair is combed close to her head and then braided, one circular knot of braid just visible above her right ear. Some handwriting is visible in the bottom right-hand corner of the portrait, but is not decipherable. Illustration by the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about sunset when I, a little child, was sent with a handful of powdered tobacco leaves and red feathers to make an offering to the spirit who had caused the sickness of my little sister. It had been a long, hard winter, and the snow lay deep on the prairie as far as the eye could reach. The medicine-woman's directions had been that the offering must be laid upon the naked earth, and that to find it I must face toward the setting sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was taught the prayer: "Spirit grandfather, I offer this to thee. I pray thee restore my little sister to health." Full of reverence and a strong faith that I could appease the anger of the spirit, I started out to plead for the life of our little one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now where was a spot of earth to be found in all that white monotony? They had talked of death at the house. I hoped that my little sister would live, but I was afraid of nature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I reached a little spring. I looked down to its pebbly bottom, wondering whether I should leave my offering there, or keep on in search of a spot of earth. If I put my offering in the water, would it reach the bottom and touch the earth, or would it float away, as it had always done when I made my offering to the water spirit?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more I started on in my search of the bare ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The surface was crusted in some places, and walking was easy; in other places I would wade through a foot or more of snow. Often I paused, thinking to clear the snow away in some place and there lay my offering. But no, my faith must be in nature, and I must trust to it to lay bare the earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a hard struggle for so small a child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I went on and on; the reeds were waving their tasselled ends in the wind. I stopped and looked at them. A reed, whirling in the wind, had formed a space round its stem, making a loose socket. I stood looking into the opening. The reed must be rooted in the ground, and the hole must follow the stem to the earth. If I poured my offerings into the hole, surely they must reach the ground; so I said the prayer I had been taught, and dropped my tobacco and red feathers into the opening that nature itself had created.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner was the sacrifice accomplished than a feeling of doubt and fear thrilled me. What if my offering should never reach the earth? Would my little sister die?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not till I turned homeward did I realize how cold I was. When at last I reached the house they took me in and warmed me, but did not question me, and I said nothing. Every one was sad, for the little one had grown worse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day the medicine woman said my little sister was beyond hope; she could not live. Then bitter remorse was mine, for I thought I had been unfaithful, and therefore my little sister was to be called to the spirit-land. I was a silent child, and did not utter my feelings; my remorse was intense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My parents would not listen to what the medicine-woman had said, but clung to hope. As soon as she had gone, they sent for a medicine-man who lived many miles away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He arrived about dark. He was a large man, with a sad, gentle face. His presence had always filled me with awe, and that night it was especially so, for he was coming as a holy man. He entered the room where the baby lay, and took a seat, hardly noticing any one. There was silence saving only for the tinkling of the little tin ornaments on his medicine-bag. He began to speak: "A soul has departed from this house, gone to the spirit-land. As I came I saw luminous vapor above the house. It ascended, it grew less, it was gone on its way to the spirit-land. It was the spirit of the little child who is sick; she still breathes, but her spirit is beyond our reach. If medicine will ease her pain, I will do what I can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stood up and blessed the four corners Greyscale image of the inside of the narrator's house. At center sits an elderly woman, either the narrator's relative or the medicine woman, with an empty woven bassinette balanced on her outstretched legs. Left of center sits (presumably) the narrator's mother cross-legged, with the sick baby on her lap. Behind the mother stands a little girl of about 6 to 8 years old, possibly the narrator, looking on the scene. At front right sits a smaller girl, still a toddler, looking into the empty bassinette. The author has illustrated the scene with careful domestic detail: the viewer can see the woven reed carpet, the textiles hanging from textured walls, a straw woven chest, and a doll lying in the background. A source of light to the right of the image casts a glow that focuses on the mother and baby. of the earth with song. Then, according to the usual custom of medicine-doctors, he began reciting the vision that had given him the right to be a medicine-man. The ruling force of the vision had been in the form of a bear. To it he addressed his prayer, saying: "Inasmuch as thou hast given me power to cure the sick, and in one case allowing me to unite spirit and body again, if thou seest fit, allow me to recall the spirit of this child to its body once more." He asked that the coverings be taken off the baby, and that it be brought into the middle of the room. Then, as he sang, he danced slowly around the little form. When the song was finished, he blessed the child, and then prepared the medicine, stirring into water some ground herbs. This he took into his mouth and sprinkled it over the little body. Another mixture he gave her to drink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Almost instantly there was a change; the little one began to breathe more easily, and as the night wore on she seemed to suffer less. Finally she opened her eyes, looked into mother's face, and smiled. The medicine-man, seeing it, said that the end was near, and though he gave her more medicine, the spirit, he said, would never return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After saying words of comfort, he took his departure, refusing to take a pony and some blankets that were offered him, saying that he had been unable to hold the spirit back, and had no right to accept the gifts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning I found the room all cleared away, and my mother sat sewing on a little white gown. The bright red trimming caught my eye. I came to her and asked, "Please mother, tell me for whom is that, and why do you make it so pretty?" She made no answer, but bent over her work. I leaned forward that I might look into her face and repeat my question. I bent down, and, oh! the tears were falling fast down her cheeks. Then we were told that our little sister was gone to the spirit-land, and we must not talk about her. We felt of her and kissed her, but she made no response. Then I realized what death meant. Remorse again seized me, but I was silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Greyscale horizontal oblong portrait of the medicine man ("a large man, with a sad, gentle face") holding a staff. His head and shoulders are right of center and his eyes are fixed to the right of the viewer's right shoulder. His hair is long, dark, and loose, a large necklace encircles his neck and a twisted cloth is tied around his forehead. His right arm is bent at the elbow, his forearm is up and his right hand holds a long, narrow stick left of center. The background consists solely of roiling clouds and a clearing of light directly behind the subject's head.</field>
