      <field name="fulltext">My mother's` kiss, my mother's kiss, I feel its impress now; As in the bright and happy days She pressed it on my brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You say it is a fancied thing Within my memory fraught; To me it has a sacred place— The treasure house of thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again, I feel her fingers glide Amid my clustering hair; I see the love-light in her eyes, When all my life was fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again, I hear her gentle voice In warning or in love. How precious was the faith that taught My soul of things above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The music of her voice is stilled, Her lips are paled in death. As precious pearls I'll clasp her words Until my latest breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The world has scattered round my path Honor and wealth and fame; But naught so precious as the thoughts That gather round her name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And friends have placed upon my brow The laurels of renown; But she first taught me how to wear My manhood as a crown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My hair is silvered o'er with age, I'm longing to depart; To clasp again my mother's hand, And be a child at heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To roam with her the glory-land Where saints and angels greet; To cast our crowns with songs of love At our Redeemer's feet.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A GRAIN OF SAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you see this grain of sand Lying loosely in my hand? Do you know to me it brought Just a simple loving thought? When one gazes night by night On the glorious stars of light, Oh how little seems the span Measured round the life of man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! how fleeting are his years With their smiles and their tears; Can it be that God does care For such atoms as we are? Then outspake this grain of sand "I was fashioned by His hand In the star lit realms of space I was made to have a place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Should the ocean flood the world, Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled All the force they could employ Wouldn't a single grain destroy; And if I, a thing so light, Have a place within His sight; You are linked unto his throne Cannot live nor die alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the everlasting arms Mid life's dangers and alarms Let calm trust your spirit fill; Know He's God, and then be still." Trustingly I raised my head Hearing what the atom said; Knowing man is greater far Than the brightest sun or star.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE CROCUSES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They heard the South wind sighing A murmur of the rain; And they knew that Earth was longing To see them all again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the snow-drops still were sleeping Beneath the silent sod; They felt their new life pulsing Within the dark, cold clod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not a daffodil nor daisy Had dared to raise its head; Not a fairhaired dandelion Peeped timid from its bed;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though a tremor of the winter Did shivering through them run; Yet they lifted up their foreheads To greet the vernal sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the sunbeams gave them welcome. As did the morning air And scattered o'er their simple robes Rich tints of beauty rare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon a host of lovely flowers From vales and woodland burst; But in all that fair procession The crocuses were first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First to weave for Earth a chaplet To crown her dear old head; And to beautify the pathway Where winter still did tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And their loved and white haired mother Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch, When she knew her faithful children Were loving her so much.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE PRESENT AGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Say not the age is hard and cold— I think it brave and grand; When men of diverse sects and creeds Are clasping hand in hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Parsee from his sacred fires Beside the Christian kneels; And clearer light to Islam's eyes The word of Christ reveals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Brahmin from his distant home Brings thoughts of ancient lore; The Bhuddist breaking bonds of caste Divides mankind no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay Are welcome round the board; Not greed, nor malice drives away These children of our Lord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Judah from whose trusted hands Came oracles divine; Now sits with those around whose hearts The light of God doth shine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Japan unbars her long sealed gates From islands far away; Her sons are lifting up their eyes To greet the coming day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Indian child from forests wild Has learned to read and pray; The tomahawk and scalping knife From him have passed away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From centuries of servile toil The Negro finds release, And builds the fanes of prayer and praise Unto the God of Peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">England and Russia face to face With Central Asia meet; And on the far Pacific coast, Chinese and natives greet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Crusaders once with sword and shield The Holy Land to save; From Moslem hands did strive to clutch The dear Redeemer's grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A battle greater, grander far Is for the present age; A crusade for the rights of man To brighten history's page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where labor faints and bows her head, And want consorts with crime; Or men grown faithless sadly say That evil is the time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is the field, the vantage ground For every earnest heart; To side with justice, truth and right And act a noble part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To save from ignorance and vice The poorest, humblest child; To make our age the fairest one On which the sun has smiled;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To plant the roots of coming years In mercy, love and truth; And bid our weary, saddened earth Again renew her youth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope, 'Till darkness shrinks from light; To fill the earth with peace and joy, Let youth and age unite:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To stay the floods of sin and shame That sweep from shore to shore; And furl the banners stained with blood, 'Till war shall be no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Blame not the age, nor think it full Of evil and unrest; But say of every other age, "This one shall be the best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The age to brighten every path By sin and sorrow trod; For loving hearts to usher in The commonwealth of God.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">DEDICATION POEM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of Mr. Edward T. Parker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Outcast from her home in Syria In the lonely, dreary wild; Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken, Sat a mother and her child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was not a voice to cheer her Not a soul to share her fate; She was weary, he was fainting, And life seemed so desolate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Far away in sunny Egypt Was lone Hagar's native land; Where the Nile in kingly bounty Scatters bread with gracious hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the tents of princely Abram She for years had found a home; Till the stern decree of Sarah Sent her forth the wild to roam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hour by hour she journeyed onward From the shelter of their tent, Till her footsteps slowly faltered And the water all was spent;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then she veiled her face in sorrow, Feared her child would die of thirst Till her eyes with tears so holden Saw a sparkling fountain burst.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! how happy was that mother, What a soothing of her pain; When she saw her child reviving, Life rejoicing through each vein</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Does not life repeat this story, Tell it over day by day ? Of the fountains of refreshment Ever springing by our way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here is one by which we gather, On this bright and happy day, Just to bask beside a fountain Making gladder life's highway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bringing unto hearts now aged Who have borne life's burdens long, Such a gift of love and mercy As deserves our sweetest song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such a gift that even heaven May rejoice with us below, If the pure and holy angels Join us in our joy and woe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May the memory of the giver In this home where age may rest, Float like fragrance through the ages, Ever blessing, ever blest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the gates of pearl are opened May we there this friend behold, Drink with him from living fountains, Walk with him the streets of gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When life's shattered cords of music Shall again be sweetly sung; Then our hearts with life immortal, Shall be young, forever young.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">A DOUBLE STANDARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you blame me that I loved him? If when standing all alone I cried for bread a careless world Pressed to my lips a stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you blame me that I loved him, That my heart beat glad and free, When he told me in the sweetest tones He loved but only me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can you blame me that I did not see Beneath his burning kiss The serpent's wiles, nor even hear The deadly adder hiss?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can you blame me that my heart grew cold The tempted, tempter turned; When he was feted and caressed And I was coldly spurned?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you blame him, when you draw from me Your dainty robes aside, If he with gilded baits should claim Your fairest as his bride?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you blame the world if it should press On him a civic crown; And see me struggling in the depth Then harshly press me down?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Crime has no sex and yet to-day I wear the brand of shame; Whilst he amid the gay and proud Still bears an honored name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can you blame me if I've learned to think Your hate of vice a sham, When you so coldly crushed me down And then excused the man?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you blame me if to-morrow The coroner should say, A wretched girl, outcast, forlorn, Has thrown her life away?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, blame me for my downward course, But oh! remember well, Within your homes you press the hand That led me down to hell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I'm glad God's ways are not our ways He does not see as man; Within His love I know there's room For those whom others ban.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think before His great white throne, His throne of spotless light, That whited sepulchres shall wear The hue of endless night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That I who fell, and he who sinned, Shall reap as we have sown; That each the burden of his loss Must bear and bear alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No golden weights can turn the scale Of justice in His sight; And what is wrong in woman's life In man's cannot be right.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">OUR HERO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Onward to her destination, O'er the stream the Hannah sped, When a cry of consternation Smote and chilled our hearts with dread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wildly leaping, madly sweeping, All relentless in their sway, Like a band of cruel demons Flames were closing 'round our way</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! the horror of those moments; Flames above and waves below— Oh! the agony of ages Crowded in one hour of woe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fainter grew our hearts with anguish In that hour with peril rife, When we saw the pilot flying, Terror-stricken, for his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then a man uprose before us— We had once despised his race— But we saw a lofty purpose Lighting up his darkened face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the flames were madly roaring, With a courage grand and high, Forth he rushed unto our rescue, Strong to suffer, brave to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Helplessly the boat was drifting, Death was staring in each face, When he grasped the fallen rudder, Took the pilot's vacant place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Could he save us? Would he save us? All his hope of life give o'er? Could he hold that fated vessel 'Till she reached the nearer shore?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All our hopes and fears were centered 'Round his strong, unfaltering hand; If he failed us we must perish, Perish just in sight of land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Breathlessly we watched and waited While the flames were raging fast; When our anguish changed to rapture— We were saved, yes, saved at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Never strains of sweetest music Brought to us more welcome sound Than the grating of that steamer When her keel had touched the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But our faithful martyr hero Through a fiery pathway trod, Till he laid his valiant spirit On the bosom of his God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fame has never crowned a hero On the crimson fields of strife, Grander, nobler, than that pilot Yielding up for us his life.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE DYING BONDMAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Life was trembling, faintly trembling On the bondman's latest breath, And he felt the chilling pressure Of the cold, hard hand of Death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had been an Afric chieftain, Worn his manhood as a crown; But upon the field of battle Had been fiercely stricken down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had longed to gain his freedom, Waited, watched and hoped in vain, Till his life was slowly ebbing— Almost broken was his chain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By his bedside stood the master, Gazing on the dying one, Knowing by the dull grey shadows That life's sands were almost run.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Master," said the dying bondman, "Home and friends I soon shall see; But before I reach my country, Master write that I am free;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the spirits of my fathers Would shrink back from me in pride, If I told them at our greeting I a slave had lived and died;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give to me the precious token, That my kindred dead may see— Master! write it, write it quickly! Master! write that I am free!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At his earnest plea the master Wrote for him the glad release, O'er his wan and wasted features Flitted one sweet smile of peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eagerly he grasped the writing; "I am free!" at last he said. Backward fell upon the pillow, He was free among the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only a little scrap of blue Preserved with loving care, But earth has not a brilliant hue To me more bright and fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strong drink, like a raging demon, Laid on my heart his hand, When my darling joined with others The Loyal Legion * band.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But mystic angels called away My loved and precious child, And o'er life's dark and stormy way Swept waves of anguish wild.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* The Temperance Band,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This badge of the Loyal Legion We placed upon her breast, As she lay in her little coffin Taking her last sweet rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To wear that badge as a token She earnestly did crave, So we laid it on her bosom To wear it in the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where sorrow would never reach her Nor harsh words smite her ear; Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber Would ever shed a tear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What means this badge?" said her father, Whom we had tried to save; Who said, when we told her story, "Don't put it in the grave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We took the badge from her bosom And laid it on a chair; And men by drink deluded Knelt by that badge in prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And vowed in that hour of sorrow From drink they would abstain; And this little badge became the wedge Which broke their galling chain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And lifted the gloomy shadows That overspread my life, And flooding my home with gladness, Made me a happy wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And this is why this scrap of blue Is precious in my sight; It changed my sad and gloomy home From darkness into light.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE SPARROW'S FALL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Too frail to soar—a feeble thing— It fell to earth with fluttering wing; But God, who watches over all, Beheld that little sparrow's fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Twas not a bird with plumage gay, Filling the air with its morning lay; 'Twas not an eagle bold and strong, Borne on the tempest's wing along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only a brown and weesome thing, With drooping head and listless wing; It could not drift beyond His sight Who marshals the splendid stars of night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Its dying chirp fell on His ears, Who tunes the music of the spheres, Who hears the hungry lion's call, And spreads a table for us all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Its mission of song at last is done, No more will it greet the rising sun; That tiny bird has found a rest More calm than its mother's downy breast</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust In God, so tender, strong and just; In whose love and mercy everywhere His humblest children have a share.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If in love He numbers ev'ry hair, Whether the strands be dark or fair, Shall we not learn to calmly rest, Like children, on our Father's breast?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">GOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God bless our native land, Land of the newly free, Oh may she ever stand For truth and liberty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God bless our native land, Where sleep our kindred dead, Let peace at thy command Above their graves be shed.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"Build me a house," said the Master, "But not on the shifting sand, Mid the wreck and roar of tempests, A house that will firmly stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will bring thee windows of agates, And gates of carbuncles bright, And thy fairest courts and portals Shall be filled with love and light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thou shalt build with fadeless rubies, All fashioned around the throne, A house that shall last forever, With Christ as the cornerstone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It shall be a royal mansion, A fair and beautiful thing, It will be the presence-chamber Of thy Saviour, Lord and King.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thy house shall he bound with pinions To mansions of rest above, But grace shall forge all the fetters With the links and cords of love.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Sharers of a common country, They had met in deadly strife; Men who should have been as brothers Madly sought each other's life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the silence of the even, When the cannon's lips were dumb, Thoughts of home and all its loved ones To the soldier's heart would come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the margin of a river, 'Mid the evening's dews and damps, Could be heard the sounds of music Rising from two hostile camps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One was singing of its section Down in Dixie, Dixie's land, And the other of the banner Waved so long from strand to strand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the land where Dixie's ensign Floated o'er the hopeful slave, Rose the song that freedom's banner, Starry-lighted, long might wave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the fields of strife and carnage, Gentle thoughts began to roam, And a tender strain of music Rose with words of "Home, Sweet Home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the hearts of strong men melted, For amid our grief and sin Still remains that "touch of nature," Telling us we all are kin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In one grand but gentle chorus, Floating to the starry dome, Came the words that brought them nearer, Words that told of "Home, Sweet Home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For awhile, all strife forgotten, They were only brothers then, Joining in the sweet old chorus, Not as soldiers, but as men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men whose hearts would flow together, Though apart their feet might roam, Found a tie they could not sever, In the mem'ry of each home.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord, And gather the bruised grain; But the reapers had left the stubble bare, And I trod the soil in pain.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">My hands were weak, but I reached them out To feebler ones than mine, And over the shadows of my life Stole the light of a peace divine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! then my task was a sacred thing, How precious it grew in my eyes! 'Twas mine to gather the bruised grain For the "Lord of Paradise."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">There was grief within our household Because of a vacant chair. Our mother, so loved and precious, No longer was sitting there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow, Our eyes with tears were blind, And little Jamie was wondering, Why we were left behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We had told our little darling, Of the land of love and light, Of the saints all crowned with glory, And enrobed in spotless white.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We said that our precious mother, Had gone to that land so fair, To dwell with beautiful angels, And to be forever there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the child was sorely puzzled, Why dear grandmamma should go To dwell in a stranger city, When her children loved her so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But again the mystic angel Came with swift and silent tread, And our sister, Jamie's mother, Was enrolled among the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To us the mystery deepened, To Jamie it seemed more clear; Grandma, he said, must be lonesome, And mamma has gone to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the question lies unanswered In our little Jamie's mind, Why she should go to our mother, And leave her children behind;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To dwell in that lovely city, From all that was dear to part, From children who loved to nestle So closely around her heart.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A rock, for ages, stern and high, Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky, And never bowed his haughty crest When angry storms around him prest. Morn, springing from the arms of night, Had often bathed his brow with light. And kissed the shadows from his face With tender love and gentle grace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Day, pausing at the gates of rest, Smiled on him from the distant West, And from her throne the dark-browed Night Threw round his path her softest light. And yet he stood unmoved and proud, Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed; He bared his brow to every blast And scorned the tempest as it passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day a tiny, humble seed— The keenest eye would hardly heed— Fell trembling at that stern rock's base, And found a lowly hiding-place. A ray of light, and drop of dew, Came with a message, kind and true; They told her of the world so bright, Its love, its joy, and rosy light, And lured her from her hiding-place, To gaze upon earth's glorious face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So, peeping timid from the ground, She clasped the ancient rock around, And climbing up with childish grace, She held him with a close embrace; Her clinging was a thing of dread; Where'er she touched a fissure spread, And he who'd breasted many a storm Stood frowning there, a mangled form; A Truth, dropped in the silent earth, May seem a thing of little worth, Till, spreading round some mighty wrong, It saps its pillars proud and strong, And o'er the fallen ruin weaves The brightest blooms and fairest leaves.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The sea-king lay on his bed of death, Pale mourners around him bent; They knew the wild and fitful life Of their chief was almost spent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His ear was growing dull in death When the angry storm he heard, The sluggish blood in the old man's veins With sudden vigor stirred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hear them call," cried the dying man, His eyes grew full of light; "Now bring me here my warrior robes, My sword and armor bright.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Like Dives in the deeps of Hell I cannot break this fearful spell, Nor quench the fires I've madly nursed, Nor cool this dreadful raging thirst. Take back your pledge—ye come too late! Ye cannot save me from my fate, Nor bring me back departed joys; But ye can try to save the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ye bid me break my fiery chain, Arise and be a man again, When every street with snares is spread, And nets of sin where'er I tread. No; I must reap as I did sow. The seeds of sin bring crops of woe; But with my latest breath I'll crave That ye will try the boys to save.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These bloodshot eyes were once so bright; This sin-crushed heart was glad and light; But by the wine-cup's ruddy glow I traced a path to shame and woe. A captive to my galling chain, I've tried to rise, but tried in vain— The cup allures and then destroys. Oh! from its thraldom save the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Take from your streets those traps of hell Into whose gilded snares I fell. Oh! freemen, from these foul decoys Arise, and vote to save the boys.

      <field name="fulltext">It is nothing to me, the mother said; I have no fear that my boy will tread In the downward path of sin and shame, And crush my heart and darken his name. It was something to her when that only son From the path of right was early won, And madly cast in the flowing bowl A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is nothing to me, the young man cried: In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride; I heed not the dreadful things ye tell: I can rule myself I know full well. It was something to him when in prison he lay The victim of drink, life ebbing away; And thought of his wretched child and wife, And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is nothing to me, the merchant said, As over his ledger he bent his head; I'm busy to-day with tare and tret, And I have no time to fume and fret. It was something to him when over the wire A message came from a funeral pyre— A drunken conductor had wrecked a train, And his wife and child were among the slain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is nothing to me, the voter said, The party's loss is my greatest dread; Then gave his vote for the liquor trade, Though hearts were crushed and drunkards made. It was something to him in after life, When his daughter became a drunkard's wife And her hungry children cried for bread, And trembled to hear their father's tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is it nothing for us to idly sleep While the cohorts of death their vigils keep? To gather the young and thoughtless in, And grind in our midst a grist of sin? It is something, yes, all, for us to stand Clasping by faith our Saviour's hand; To learn to labor, live and fight On the side of God and changeless light.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">She plied her hands to life's homely tasks, And helped to build his fortunes up; While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet, Were mingled and mixed in her cup.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sowed in his fields of golden grain, All the strength of his manly prime; Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees, Was as sweet as the dollar's chime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She toiled and waited through weary years For the fortune that came at length; But toil and care and hope deferred, Had stolen and wasted her strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cabin changed to a stately home, Rich carpets were hushing her tread; But light was fading from her eye, And the bloom from her cheek had fled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slower and heavier grew her step, While his gold and his gains increased; But his proud domain had not the charm Of her humble home in the East.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within her eye was a restless light, And a yearning that never ceased, A longing to see the dear old home She had left in the distant East.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A longing to clasp her mother's hand, And nestle close to her heart, And to feel the heavy cares of life Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her husband was adding field to field, And new wealth to his golden store; And little thought the shadow of death Was entering in at his door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had no line to sound the depths Of her tears repressed and unshed; Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart Could be starving, but not for bread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hungry heart was stilled at last; Its restless, baffled yearning ceased. A lonely man sat by the bier Of a corpse that was going East.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE HERMIT'S SACRIFICE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Rome's palaces and villas Gaily issued forth a throng; From her humbler habitations Moved a human tide along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Haughty dames and blooming maidens, Men who knew not mercy's sway, Thronged into the Coliseum On that Roman holiday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the lonely wilds of Asia, From her jungles far away, From the distant torrid regions, Rome had gathered beasts of prey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lions restless, roaring, rampant, Tigers with their stealthy tread, Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery, Met in conflict wild and dread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fierce and fearful was the carnage Of the maddened beasts of prey, As they fought and rent each other Urged by men more fierce than they.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Till like muffled thunders breaking On a vast and distant shore, Fainter grew the yells of tigers, And the lions' dreadful roar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the crimson-stained arena Lay the victims of the fight; Eyes which once had glared with anguish, Lost in death their baleful light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then uprose the gladiators Armed for conflict unto death, Waiting for the prefect's signal, Cold and stern with bated breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ave Caesar, morituri, Te, salutant," rose the cry From the lips of men ill-fated, Doomed to suffer and to die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then began the dreadful contest, Lives like chaff were thrown away, Rome with all her pride and power Butchered for a holiday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eagerly the crowd were waiting, Loud the clashing sabres rang; When between the gladiators All unarmed a hermit sprang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cease your bloodshed," cried the hermit, "On this carnage place your ban;" But with flashing swords they answered, "Back unto your place, old man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From their path the gladiators Thrust the strange intruder back, Who between their hosts advancing Calmly parried their attack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All undaunted by their weapons, Stood the old heroic man; While a maddened cry of anger Through the vast assembly ran.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down with him," cried out the people, As with thumbs unbent they glared, Till the prefect gave the signal That his life should not be spared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men grew wild with wrathful passion, When his fearless words were said Cruelly they fiercely showered Stones on his devoted head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit, Victor in that hour of strife; Gaining in his death a triumph That he could not win in life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Had he uttered on the forum Struggling thoughts within him born, Men had jeered his words as madness, But his deed they could not scorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not in vain had been his courage, Nor for naught his daring deed; From his grave his mangled body Did for wretched captives plead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful, Ceased her sport in human gore; And into her Coliseum Gladiators came no more.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">SONGS FOR THE PEOPLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me make the songs for the people, Songs for the old and young; Songs to stir like a battle-cry Wherever they are sung.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not for the clashing of sabres, For carnage nor for strife; But songs to thrill the hearts of men With more abundant life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me make the songs for the weary, Amid life's fever and fret, Till hearts shall relax their tension, And careworn brows forget.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me sing for little children, Before their footsteps stray, Sweet anthems of love and duty, To float o'er life's highway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would sing for the poor and aged, When shadows dim their sight; Of the bright and restful mansions, Where there shall be no night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our world, so worn and weary, Needs music, pure and strong, To hush the jangle and discords Of sorrow, pain, and wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Music to soothe all its sorrow, Till war and crime shall cease; And the hearts of men grown tender Girdle the world with peace.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">LET THE LIGHT ENTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dying words of Goethe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Light! more light! the shadows deepen, And my life is ebbing low, Throw the windows widely open: Light! more light! before I go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Softly let the balmy sunshine Play around my dying bed, E'er the dimly lighted valley I with lonely feet must tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Light! more light! for Death is weaving Shadows 'round my waning sight, And I fain would gaze upon him Through a stream of earthly light."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not for greater gifts of genius; Not for thoughts more grandly bright, All the dying poet whispers Is a prayer for light, more light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Heeds he not the gathered laurels, Fading slowly from his sight; All the poet's aspirations Centre in that prayer for light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gracious Saviour, when life's day-dreams Melt and vanish from the sight, May our dim and longing vision Then be blessed with light, more light.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">AN APPEAL TO MY COUNTRYWOMEN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You can sigh o'er the sad-eyed Armenian Who weeps in her desolate home. You can mourn o'er the exile of Russia From kindred and friends doomed to roam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You can pity the men who have woven From passion and appetite chains To coil with a terrible tension Around their heartstrings and brains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You can sorrow o'er little children Disinherited from their birth, The wee waifs and toddlers neglected, Robbed of sunshine, music and mirth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For beasts you have gentle compassion; Your mercy and pity they share. For the wretched, outcast and fallen You have tenderness, love and care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But hark! from our Southland are floating Sobs of anguish, murmurs of pain, And women heart-stricken are weeping Over their tortured and their slain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On their brows the sun has left traces; Shrink not from their sorrow in scorn. When they entered the threshold of being The children of a King were born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each comes as a guest to the table The hand of our God has outspread, To fountains that ever leap upward, To share in the soil we all tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When ye plead for the wrecked and fallen, The exile from far-distant shores, Remember that men are still wasting Life's crimson around your own doors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Have ye not, oh, my favored sisters, Just a plea, a prayer or a tear, For mothers who dwell 'neath the shadows Of agony, hatred and fear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men may tread down the poor and lowly, May crush them in anger and hate, But surely the mills of God's justice Will grind out the grist of their fate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, people sin-laden and guilty, So lusty and proud in your prime, The sharp sickles of God's retribution Will gather your harvest of crime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Weep not, oh my well-sheltered sisters, Weep not for the Negro alone, But weep for your sons who must gather The crops which their fathers have sown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Go read on the tombstones of nations Of chieftains who masterful trod, The sentence which time has engraven, That they had forgotten their God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis the judgment of God that men reap The tares which in madness they sow, Sorrow follows the footsteps of crime, And Sin is the consort of Woe.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THEN AND NOW.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Build me a nation," said the Lord. The distant nations heard the word, Build me a nation true and strong, Bar out the old world's hate and wrong; For men had traced with blood and tears The trail of weary wasting years, And torn and bleeding martyrs trod Through fire and torture up to God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While in the hollow of his hand God hid the secret of our land, Men warred against their fiercest foes, And kingdoms fell and empires rose, Till, weary of the old world strife, Men sought for broader, freer life, And plunged into the ocean's foam To find another, better home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, like a vision fair and bright The new world broke upon their sight. Men grasped the prize, grew proud and strong, And cursed the land with crime and wrong. The Indian stood despoiled of lands, The Negro bound with servile bands, Oppressed through weary years of toil, His blood and tears bedewed the soil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then God arose in dreadful wrath, And judgment streamed around his path; His hand the captive's fetters broke, His lightnings shattered every yoke. As Israel through the Red sea trod, Led by the mighty hand of God, They passed to freedom through a flood, Whose every wave and surge was blood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And slavery, with its crime and shame, Went down in wrath and blood and flame The land was billowed-o'er with graves Where men had lived and died as slaves. Four and thirty years—what change since then! Beings once chattles now are men; Over the gloom of slavery's night, Has flashed the dawn of freedom's light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-day no mother with anguish wild Kneels and implores that her darling child Shall not be torn from her bleeding heart, With its quivering tendrils rent apart. The father may soothe his child to sleep, And watch his slumbers calm and deep. No tyrant's tread will disturb his rest Where freedom dwells as a welcome guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His walls may be bare of pictured grace, His fireside the lowliest place; But the wife and children sheltered there Are his to defend and guard with care. Where haughty tyrants once bore rule Are ballot-box and public school. The old slave-pen of former days Gives place to fanes of prayer and praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-night we would bring our meed of praise To noble friends of darker days; The men and women crowned with light, The true and tried in our gloomy night. To Lundy, whose heart was early stirred To speak for freedom an earnest word; To Garrison, valiant, true and strong, Whose face was as flint against our wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Phillips, the peerless, grand and brave, A tower of strength to the outcast slave. Earth has no marble too pure and white To enrol his name in golden light. Our Douglass, too, with his massive brain, Who plead our cause with his broken chain, And helped to hurl from his bloody seat The curse that writhed and died at his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Governor Andrew, who, looking back, Saw none he despised, though poor and black; And Harriet Beecher, whose glowing pen Corroded the chains of fettered men. To-night with greenest laurels we'll crown North Elba's grave where sleeps John Brown, Who made the gallows an altar high, And showed how a brave old man could die. And Lincoln, our martyred President, Who returned to his God with chains he had rent.* And Sumner, amid death's icy chill, Leaving to Hoar his Civil Rights Bill. And let us remember old underground, With all her passengers northward bound, The train that ran till it ceased to pay, With all her dividends given away. Nor let it be said that we have forgot The women who stood with Lucretia Mott; Nor her who to the world was known By the simple name of Lucy stone. A tribute unto a host of others Who knew that men though black were brothers, Who battled against our nation's sin, Whose graves are thick whose ranks are thin. Oh, people chastened in the fire, To nobler, grander things aspire; In the new era of your life, Bring love for hate, and peace for strife; Upon your hearts this vow record That ye will build unto the Lord A nobler future, true and grand, To strengthen, crown and bless the land. A higher freedom ye may gain Than that which comes from a riven chain; Freedom your native land to bless With peace, and love and righteousness, As dreams that are past, a tale all told, Are the days when men were bought and sold; Now God be praised from sea to sea, Our flag floats o'er a country free.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">He had clasped unto his bosom The sad fortunes of his land— Held the cause for which he perished With a firm, unfaltering hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his lips the name of freedom Fainted with his latest breath. Cuba Libre was his watchword Passing through the gates of death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the light of God around us, Why this agony and strife? With the cross of Christ before us, Why this fearful waste of life?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Must the pathway unto freedom Ever mark a crimson line, And the eyes of wayward mortals Always close to light divine?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Must the hearts of fearless valor Fail 'mid crime and cruel wrong, When the world has read of heroes Brave and earnest, true and strong?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men to stay the floods of sorrow Sweeping round each war-crushed heart; Men to say to strife and carnage— From our world henceforth depart.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Year by year the world grows weary 'Neath its weight of sin and strife, Though the hands once pierced and bleeding Offer more abundant life.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">I had a dream, a varied dream: Before my ravished sight The city of my Lord arose, With all its love and light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The music of a myriad harps Flowed out with sweet accord; And saints were casting down their crowns In homage to our Lord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My heart leaped up with untold joy, Life's toil and pain were o'er; My weary feet at last had found The bright and restful shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just as I reached the gates of light, Ready to enter in, From earth arose a fearful cry Of sorrow and of sin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I turned, and saw behind me surge A wild and stormy sea; And drowning men were reaching out Imploring hands to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread, And moaning for relief; The music of the golden harps Grew fainter for their grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me return, I quickly said, Close to the pearly gate; My work is with these wretched ones, So wrecked and desolate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An angel smiled and gently said: This is the gate of life, Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes, Its weariness and strife,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To comfort hearts that sigh and break, To dry the falling tear, Wilt thou forego the music sweet Entrancing now thy ear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must return, I firmly said, The strugglers in that sea Shall not reach out beseeching hands In vain for help to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I turned to go; but as I turned The gloomy sea grew bright, And from my heart there seemed to flow Ten thousand cords of light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And sin-wrecked men, with eager hands Did grasp each golden cord; And with my heart I drew them on To see my gracious Lord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again I stood beside the gate. My heart was glad and free; For with me stood a rescued throng The Lord had given me.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE LOST BELLS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Year after year the artist wrought With earnest, loving care, The music flooding all his soul To pour upon the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For this no metal was too rare, He counted not the cost; Nor deemed the years in which he toiled As labor vainly lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When morning flushed with crimson light The golden gates of day, He longed to fill the air with chimes Sweet as a matin's lay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when the sun was sinking low Within the distant West, He gladly heard the bells he wrought Herald the hour of rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The music of a thousand harps Could never be so dear As when those solemn chants and thrills Fell on his list'ning ear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He poured his soul into their chimes, And felt his toil repaid; He called them children of his soul, His home a'near them made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But evil days came on apace, War spread his banner wide, And from his village snatched away The artist's love and pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At dewy morn and stilly eve The chimes no more he heard; With dull and restless agony His spirit's depths was stirred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A weary longing filled his soul, It bound him like a spell; He left his home to seek the chimes— The chimes he loved so well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where lofty fanes in grandeur rose, Upon his ear there fell No music like the long lost chimes Of his beloved bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And thus he wandered year by year. Touched by the hand of time, Seeking to hear with anxious heart Each well remembered chime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And to that worn and weary heart There came a glad surcease: He heard again the dear old chimes, And smiled and uttered peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The chimes! the chimes!" the old man cried, "I hear their tones at last;" A sudden rapture filled his heart, And all his cares were past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, peace had come with death's sweet calm, His journeying was o'er, The weary, restless wanderer Had reached the restful shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may be that he met again, Enfolded in the air, The dear old chimes beside the gates Where all is bright and fair;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer, for men are dying From their distant homes in pain; And the restless sea is darkened By a flood of crimson rain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer, for anxious mothers Wait and watch in lonely dread; Vainly waiting for the footsteps Never more their paths to tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer, while little children Gather round the widowed wife, Wondering why an unknown people Sought their own dear father's life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer, for aged fathers Bend above their staves and weep, While the ocean sings the requiem Where their fallen children sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer, for lips are paling On which lay the mother's kiss; 'Mid the dreadful roar of battle How that mother's hand they miss!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer: once joyous maidens, Who the mazy dance did tread, Bow their heads in bitter anguish, Mourning o'er their cherished dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not cheer while maid and matron In this strife must bear a part; While the blow that strikes a soldier Reaches to some woman's heart.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens Of the black, the brown and white; But if we all clasped hands together The burdens would be more light. How to solve life's saddest problems, Its weariness, want and woe, Was answered by One who suffered In Palestine long ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gave from his heart this precept, To ease the burdens of men, "As ye would that others do to you Do ye even so to them." Life's heavy, wearisome burdens Will change to a gracious trust When men shall learn in the light of God To be merciful and just.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where war has sharpened his weapons, And slavery masterful had, Let white and black and brown unite To build the kingdom of God. And never attempt in madness To build a kingdom or state, Through greed of gold or lust of power, On the crumbling stones of hate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The burdens will always he heavy, The sunshine fade into night, Till mercy and justice shall cement The black, the brown and the white. And earth shall answer with gladness, The herald angel's refrain, When "Peace on earth, good will to men" Was the burden of their strain.</field>
