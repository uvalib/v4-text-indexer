      <field name="heading_text">THE RECALL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I AM the land of their fathers. In me the virtue stays. I will bring back my children, After certain days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under their feet in the grasses My clinging magic runs. They shall return as strangers, They shall remain as sons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over their heads in the branches Of their new-bought, ancient trees, I weave an incantation And draw them to my knees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scent of smoke in the evening. Smell of rain in the night, The hours, the days and the seasons, Order their souls aright;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Till I make plain the meaning Of all my thousand years-- Till I fill their hearts with knowledge. While I fill their eyes with tears.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PUCK'S SONG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SEE you the ferny ride that steals Into the oak-woods far? O that was whence they hewed the keels That rolled to Trafalgar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And mark you where the ivy clings To Bayham's mouldering walls? O there we cast the stout railings That stand around St. Paul's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See you the dimpled track that runs All hollow through the wheat? O that was where they hauled the guns That smote King Philip's fleet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out of the Weald, the secret Weald, Men sent in ancient years, The horse-shoes red at Flodden Field, The arrows at Poitiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See you our little mill that clacks, So busy by the brook? She has ground her corn and paid her tax Ever since Domesday Book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See you our stilly woods of oak? And the dread ditch beside? O that was where the Saxons broke On the day that Harold died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See you the windy levels spread About the gates of Rye? O that was where the Northmen fled, When Alfred's ships came by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See you our pastures wide and lone, Where the red oxen browse? O there was a City thronged and known. Ere London boasted a house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And see you, after rain, the trace Of mound and ditch and wall? O that was a Legion's camping-place, When Caesar sailed from Gaul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And see you marks that show and fade, Like shadows on the Downs? O they are the lines the Flint Men made, To guard their wondrous towns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trackway and Camp and City lost, Salt Marsh where now is corn; Old Wars, old Peace, old Arts that cease, And so was England born!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She is not any common Earth, Water or wood or air, But Merlin's Isle of Gramarye, Where you and I will fare.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEY shut the road through the woods Seventy years ago. Weather and rain have undone it again, And now you would never know There was once a road through the woods Before they planted the trees. It is underneath the coppice and heath, And the thin anemones. Only the keeper sees That, where the ring-dove broods. And the badgers roll at ease, There was once a road through the woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet, if you enter the woods Of a summer evening late, When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools Where the otter whistles his mate. (They fear not men in the woods. Because they see so few) You will hear the beat of a horse's feet, And the swish of a skirt in the dew, Steadily cantering through The misty solitudes, As though they perfectly knew The old lost road through the woods ... But there is no road through the woods!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A THREE-PART SONG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I'M just in love with all these three, The Weald and the Marsh and the Down countrie; Nor I don't know which I love the most, The Weald or the Marsh or the white chalk coast!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I've buried my heart in a ferny hill, Twix' a liddle low shaw an' a great high gill. Oh hop-bine yaller an' wood-smoke blue, I reckon you'll keep her middling true!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I've loosed my mind for to out and run On a Marsh that was old when Kings begun. Oh Romney Level and Brenzett reeds, I reckon you know what my mind needs!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I've given my soul to the Southdown grass, And sheep-bells tinkled where you pass. Oh Firle an' Ditchling an' sails at sea, I reckon you keep my soul for me!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE RUN OF THE DOWNS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Weald is good, the Downs are best -- I'll give you the run of 'em, East to West. Beachy Head and Winddoor Hill, They were once and they are still, Firle, Mount Caburn and Mount Harry Go back as far as sums'll carry. Ditchling Beacon and Chanctonbury Ring, They have looked on many a thing, And what those two have missed between 'em I reckon Truleigh Hill has seen 'em. Highden, Bignor and Duncton Down Knew Old England before the Crown. Linch Down, Treyford and Sunwood Knew Old England before the Flood. And when you end on the Hampshire side-- Butser's old as Time and Tide. The Downs are sheep, the Weald is corn, You be glad you are Sussex born!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BROOKLAND ROAD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was very well pleased with what I knowed, I reckoned myself no fool-- Till I met with a maid on the Brookland Road, That turned me back to school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Low down--low down! Where the liddle green lanterns shine-- O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one, And she can never be mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Twas right in the middest of a hot June night, With thunder duntin' round, And I see'd her face by the fairy light That beats from off the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She only smiled and she never spoke, She smiled and went away; But when she'd gone my heart was broke, And my wits was clean astray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O stop your ringing and let me be-- Let be, O Brookland bells! You'll ring Old Goodman [A] out of the sea, Before I wed one else!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Goodman's Farm is rank sea-sand, And was this thousand year: But it shall turn to rich plough land Before I change my dear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O, Fairfield Church is water-bound From autumn to the spring; But it shall turn to high hill ground Before my bells do ring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O, leave me walk on the Brookland Road, In the thunder and warm rain-- O, leave me look where my love goed, And p'raps I'll see her again!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Low down--low down! Where the liddle green lanterns shine-- O maids, I've done with 'ee all but one, And she can never be mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Footnote A: Earl Godwin of the Goodwin Sands?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE SACK OF THE GODS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strangers drawn from the ends of the earth, jewelled and plumed were we. I was Lord of the Inca race, and she was Queen of the Sea. Under the stars beyond our stars where the new-forged meteors glow Hotly we stormed Valhalla, a million years ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ever 'neath high Valhalla Hall the well-tuned horns begin When the swords are out in the underworld, and the weary Gods come in. Ever through high Valhalla Gate the Patient Angel goes; He opens the eyes that are blind with hate--he joins the hands of foes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dust of the stars was under our feet, glitter of stars above-- Wrecks of our wrath dropped reeling down as we fought and we spurned and we strove. Worlds upon worlds we tossed aside, and scattered them to and fro, The night that we stormed Valhalla, a million years ago!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They are forgiven as they forgive all those dark wounds and deep, Their beds are made on the lap of Time and they lie down and sleep. They are forgiven as they forgive all those old wounds that bleed, They shut their eyes from their worshippers. They sleep till the world has need.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She with the star I had marked for my own--I with my set desire-- Lost in the loom of the Night of Nights--lighted by worlds afire-- Met in a war against the Gods where the headlong meteors glow, Hewing our way to Valhalla, a million years ago!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They will come back--come back again, as long as the red Earth rolls. He never wasted a leaf or a tree. Do you think He would squander souls?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE KINGDOM</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now we are come to our Kingdom, And the State is thus and thus; Our legions wait at the Palace gate--- Little it profits us, Now we are come to our Kingdom!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now we are come to our Kingdom, And the Crown is ours to take-- With a naked sword at the Council board, And under the throne the Snake, Now we are come to our Kingdom!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now we are come to our Kingdom, And the Realm is ours by right, With shame and fear for our daily cheer, And heaviness at night, Now we are come to our Kingdom!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now we are come to our Kingdom, But my love's eyelids fall. All that I wrought for, all that I fought for, Delight her nothing at all. My crown is of withered leaves, For she sits in the dust and grieves. Now we are come to our Kingdom!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TARRANT MOSS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I closed and drew for my love's sake That now is false to me, And I slew the Reiver of Tarrant Moss And set Dumeny free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They have gone down, they have gone down, They are standing all arow-- Twenty knights in the peat-water, That never struck a blow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their armour shall not dull nor rust, Their flesh shall not decay, For Tarrant Moss holds them in trust, Until the Judgment Day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their soul went from them in their youth, Ah God, that mine had gone, Whenas I leaned on my love's truth And not on my sword alone!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whenas I leaned on lad's belief And not on my naked blade-- And I slew a thief, and an honest thief, For the sake of a worthless maid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They have laid the Reiver low in his place, They have set me up on high, But the twenty knights in the peat-water Are luckier than I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And ever they give me gold and praise And ever I mourn my loss-- For I struck the blow for my false love's sake And not for the Men of the Moss!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SIR RICHARD'S SONG (A.D. 1066)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I followed my Duke ere I was a lover, To take from England fief and fee; But now this game is the other way over-- But now England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I had my horse, my shield and banner, And a boy's heart, so whole and free; But now I sing in another manner-- But now England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for my Father in his tower, Asking news of my ship at sea; He will remember his own hour-- Tell him England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for my Mother in her bower, That rules my Father so cunningly, She will remember a maiden's power-- Tell her England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for my Brother in Rouen City, A nimble and naughty page is he, But he will come to suffer and pity-- Tell him England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for my little Sister waiting In the pleasant orchards of Normandie, Tell her youth is the time for mating-- Tell her England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for my Comrades in camp and highway, That lift their eyebrows scornfully, Tell them their way is not my way-- Tell them England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Kings and Princes and Barons famèd, Knights and Captains in your degree; Hear me a little before I am blamèd-- Seeing England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Howso great man's strength be reckoned, There are two things he cannot flee; Love is the first, and Death is the second-- And Love in England hath taken me!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A TREE SONG (A.D. 1200)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all the trees that grow so fair, Old England to adorn, Greater are none beneath the Sun, Than Oak, and Ash, and Thorn. Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs (All of a Midsummer morn)! Surely we sing no little thing, In Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oak of the Clay lived many a day Or ever Æneas began; Ash of the Loam was a lady at home When Brut was an outlaw man. Thorn of the Down saw New Troy Town (From which was London born); Witness hereby the ancientry Of Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yew that is old in churchyard mould, He breedeth a mighty bow; Alder for shoes do wise men choose, And beech for cups also. But when ye have killed, and your bowl is spilled, And your shoes are clean outworn, Back ye must speed for all that ye need, To Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ellum she hateth mankind, and waiteth Till every gust be laid, To drop a limb on the head of him That anyway trusts her shade: But whether a lad be sober or sad, Or mellow with ale from the horn, He will take no wrong when he lieth along 'Neath Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, do not tell the Priest our plight, Or he would call it a sin; But--we have been out in the woods all night, A-conjuring Summer in!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And we bring you news by word of mouth-- Good news for cattle and corn-- Now is the Sun come up from the South, With Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sing Oak, and Ash, and Thorn, good sirs (All of a Midsummer morn)! England shall bide till Judgment Tide, By Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CUCKOO SONG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spring begins in Southern England on the 14th April, on which date the Old Woman lets the Cuckoo out of her basket at Heathfield Fair--locally known as Heffle Cuckoo Fair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tell it to the locked-up trees, Cuckoo, bring your song here! Warrant, Act and Summons, please. For Spring to pass along here! Tell old Winter, if he doubt, Tell him squat and square--a! Old Woman! Old Woman! Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out At Heffle Cuckoo Fair--a!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March has searched and April tried-- 'Tisn't long to May now, Not so far to Whitsuntide, And Cuckoo's come to stay now! Hear the valiant fellow shout Down the orchard bare--a! Old Woman! Old Woman! Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out At Heffle Cuckoo Fair--a!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When your heart is young and gay And the season rules it-- Work your works and play your play 'Fore the Autumn cools it! Kiss you turn and turn about, But my lad, beware--a! Old Woman! Old Woman! Old Woman's let the Cuckoo out At Heffle Cuckoo Fair--a!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A CHARM</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Take of English earth as much As either hand may rightly clutch. In the taking of it breathe Prayer for all who lie beneath. Not the great nor well-bespoke, But the mere uncounted folk Of whose life and death is none Report or lamentation. Lay that earth upon thy heart, And thy sickness shall depart!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It shall sweeten and make whole Fevered breath and festered soul. It shall mightily restrain Over-busy hand and brain. It shall ease thy mortal strife 'Gainst the immortal woe of life, Till thyself restored shall prove By what grace the Heavens do move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Take of English flowers these-- Spring's full-facèd primroses, Summer's wild wide-hearted rose, Autumn's wall-flower of the close, And, thy darkness to illume, Winter's bee-thronged ivy-bloom. Seek and serve them where they bide From Candlemas to Christmas-tide, For these simples, used aright, Can restore a failing sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These shall cleanse and purify Webbed and inward-turning eye; These shall show thee treasure hid, Thy familiar fields amid; And reveal (which is thy need) Every man a King indeed!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE PRAIRIE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'I see the grass shake in the sun for leagues on either hand, I see a river loop and run about a treeless land-- An empty plain, a steely pond, a distance diamond-clear, And low blue naked hills beyond. And what is that to fear?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Go softly by that river-side or, when you would depart, You'll find its every winding tied and knotted round your heart. Be wary as the seasons pass, or you may ne'er outrun The wind that sets that yellowed grass a-shiver 'neath the Sun.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'I hear the summer storm outblown--the drip of the grateful wheat. I hear the hard trail telephone a far-off horse's feet. I hear the horns of Autumn blow to the wild-fowl overhead; And I hear the hush before the snow. And what is that to dread?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Take heed what spell the lightning weaves--what charm the echoes shape-- Or, bound among a million sheaves, your soul may not escape. Bar home the door of summer nights lest those high planets drown The memory of near delights in all the longed-for town.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'What need have I to long or fear? Now, friendly, I behold My faithful seasons robe the year in silver and in gold. Now I possess and am possessed of the land where I would be, And the curve of half Earth's generous breast shall soothe and ravish me!'</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER HEADINGS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PLAIN TALES FROM THE HILLS Look, you have cast out Love! What Gods are these You bid me please? The Three in One, the One in Three? Not so! To my own Gods I go. It may be they shall give me greater ease Than your cold Christ and tangled Trinities. Lispeth . When the Earth was sick and the Skies were grey, And the woods were rotted with rain, The Dead Man rode through the autumn day To visit his love again. His love she neither saw nor heard, So heavy was her shame; And tho' the babe within her stirred She knew not that he came. The Other Man. Cry 'Murder' in the market-place, and each Will turn upon his neighbour anxious eyes Asking;--'Art thou the man?' We hunted Cain Some centuries ago across the world. This bred the fear our own misdeeds maintain To-day. His Wedded Wife. Go, stalk the red deer o'er the heather, Ride, follow the fox if you can! But, for pleasure and profit together, Allow me the hunting of Man-- The chase of the Human, the search for the Soul To its ruin--the hunting of Man. Pig. 'Stopped in the straight when the race was his own! Look at him cutting it--cur to the bone!' Ask ere the youngster be rated and chidden What did he carry and how was he ridden? Maybe they used him too much at the start; Maybe Fate's weight-cloths are breaking his heart. In the Pride of his Youth. 'And some are sulky, while some will plunge. (So ho! Steady! Stand still, you!) Some you must gentle, and some you must lunge. (There! There! Who wants to kill you?) Some--there are losses in every trade-- Will break their hearts ere bitted and made, Will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard, And die dumb-mad in the breaking-yard.' Thrown Away. The World hath set its heavy yoke Upon the old white-bearded folk Who strive to please the King. God's mercy is upon the young, God's wisdom in the baby tongue That fears not anything. Tod's Amendment. Not though you die to-night, O Sweet, and wail, A spectre at my door, Shall mortal Fear make Love immortal fail-- I shall but love you more, Who, from Death's House returning, give me still One moment's comfort in my matchless ill. By Word of Mouth. They burnt a corpse upon the sand-- The light shone out afar; It guided home the plunging boats That beat from Zanzibar. Spirit of Fire, where'er Thy altars rise, Thou art the Light of Guidance to our eyes! In Error. Ride with an idle whip, ride with an unused heel. But, once in a way, there will come a day When the colt must be taught to feel The lash that falls, and the curb that galls, and the sting of the rowelled steel. The Conversion of Aurelian McGoggin. It was not in the open fight We threw away the sword, But in the lonely watching In the darkness by the ford. The waters lapped, the night-wind blew, Full-armed the Fear was born and grew, From panic in the night. The Rout of the White Hussars. In the daytime, when she moved about me, In the night, when she was sleeping at my side,-- I was wearied, I was wearied of her presence. Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her-- Would God that she or I had died! The Bronckhorst Divorce Case. A stone's throw out on either hand From that well-ordered road we tread, And all the world is wild and strange; Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite Shall bear us company to-night, For we have reached the Oldest Land Wherein the powers of Darkness range. In the House of Suddhoo. To-night, God knows what thing shall tide, The Earth is racked and fain-- Expectant, sleepless, open-eyed; And we, who from the Earth were made, Thrill with our Mother's pain. False Dawn. Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide, By the hot sun emptied, and blistered and dried; Log in the reh-grass, hidden and lone; Bund where the earth-rat's mounds are strown; Cave in the bank where the sly stream steals; Aloe that stabs at the belly and heels, Jump if you dare on a steed untried-- Safer it is to go wide--go wide! Hark, from in front where the best men ride;-- 'Pull to the off, boys! Wide! Go wide!' Cupid's Arrows. He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse; He purchased raiment and forbore to pay; He stuck a trusting junior with a horse, And won gymkhanas in a doubtful way. Then, 'twixt a vice and folly, turned aside To do good deeds and straight to cloak them, lied. A Bank Fraud.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">'Gold is for the mistress--silver for the maid-- Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade.' 'Good!' said the Baron, sitting in his hall, 'But Iron--Cold Iron--is master of them all.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he made rebellion 'gainst the King his liege, Camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege. 'Nay!' said the cannoneer on the castle wall, 'But Iron--Cold Iron--shall be master of you all!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Woe for the Baron and his knights so strong, When the cruel cannon-balls laid 'em all along! He was taken prisoner, he was cast in thrall, And Iron--Cold Iron--was master of it all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet his King spake kindly (Ah, how kind a Lord!) 'What if I release thee now and give thee back thy sword?' 'Nay!' said the Baron, 'mock not at my fall, For Iron--Cold Iron--is master of men all.'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">He took the Wine and blessed It. He blessed and brake the Bread. With His own Hands He served Them, and presently He said: 'See! These Hands they pierced with nails, outside My city wall, Show Iron--Cold Iron--to be master of men all!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Oh, light was the world that he weighed in his hands! Oh, heavy the tale of his fiefs and his lands! He has gone from the guddee and put on the shroud, And departed in guise of bairagi avowed!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Eddi, priest of St. Wilfrid In the chapel at Manhood End, Ordered a midnight service For such as cared to attend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the Saxons were keeping Christmas, And the night was stormy as well. Nobody came to service Though Eddi rang the bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Wicked weather for walking,' Said Eddi of Manhood End. 'But I must go on with the service For such as care to attend.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The altar-candles were lighted,-- An old marsh donkey came, Bold as a guest invited, And stared at the guttering flame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The storm beat on at the windows, The water splashed on the floor, And a wet, yoke-weary bullock Pushed in through the open door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'How do I know what is greatest, How do I know what is least? That is My Father's business,' Said Eddi, Wilfrid's priest.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Till the gale blew off on the marshes And the windows showed the day, And the Ox and the Ass together Wheeled and clattered away.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">SHIV AND THE GRASSHOPPER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow, Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago, Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate, From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate. All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,-- Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine, And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wheat he gave to rich folk, millet to the poor, Broken scraps for holy men that beg from door to door; Cattle to the tiger, carrion to the kite, And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night. Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low-- Parbati beside him watched them come and go; Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest-- Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast. So she tricked him, Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! turn and see! Tall are the camels, heavy are the kine, But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the dole was ended, laughingly she said, 'Master, of a million mouths is not one unfed?' Laughing, Shiv made answer, 'All have had their part, Even he, the little one, hidden 'neath thy heart.' From her breast she plucked it, Parbati the thief, Saw the Least of Little Things gnawed a new-grown leaf! Saw and feared and wondered, making prayer to Shiv, Who hath surely given meat to all that live. All things made he--Shiva the Preserver. Mahadeo! Mahadeo! He made all,-- Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine, And mother's heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">What is a woman that you forsake her, And the hearth-fire and the home-acre, To go with the old grey Widow-maker?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She has no house to lay a guest in-- But one chill bed for all to rest in, That the pale suns and the stray bergs nest in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She has no strong white arms to fold you, But the ten-times-fingering weed to hold you-- Out on the rocks where the tide has rolled you.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Sicken again for the shouts and the slaughters. You steal away to the lapping waters, And look at your ship in her winter quarters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You forget our mirth, and talk at the tables, The kine in the shed and the horse in the stables-- To pitch her sides and go over her cables.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then you drive out where the storm-clouds swallow, And the sound of your oar-blades, falling hollow. Is all we have left through the months to follow.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">One may fall but he falls by himself-- Falls by himself with himself to blame, One may attain and to him is pelf, Loot of the city in Gold or Fame. Plunder of earth shall be all his own Who travels the fastest and travels alone.</field>

Word they gave me overhead of quarry newly slain, Word I gave them underfoot of buck upon the plain. Here's an end of every trail--they shall not speak again!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They that called the hunting-cry--they that followed fast-- (For Chil! Look you, for Chil!) They that bade the sambhur wheel, or pinned him as he passed-- (Chil!

      <field name="fulltext">These were my companions. Pity 'twas they died! ( For Chil! Look you, for Chil! ') Now come I to comfort them that knew them in their pride. ( Chil!

      <field name="heading_text">THE CAPTIVE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not with an outcry to Allah nor any complaining He answered his name at the muster and stood to the chaining. When the twin anklets were nipped on the leg-bars that held them, He brotherly greeted the armourers stooping to weld them. Ere the sad dust of the marshalled feet of the chain-gang swallowed him, Observing him nobly at ease, I alighted and followed him. Thus we had speech by the way, but not touching his sorrow-- Rather his red Yesterday and his regal To-morrow, Wherein he statelily moved to the clink of his chains unregarded, Nowise abashed but contented to drink of the potion awarded. Saluting aloofly his Fate, he made swift with his story, And the words of his mouth were as slaves spreading carpets of glory Embroidered with names of the Djinns--a miraculous weaving-- But the cool and perspicuous eye overbore unbelieving. So I submitted myself to the limits of rapture-- Bound by this man we had bound, amid captives his capture-- Till he returned me to earth and the visions departed. But on him be the Peace and the Blessing; for he was great-hearted!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Celt in all his variants from Builth to Ballyhoo, His mental processes are plain--one knows what he will do, And can logically predicate his finish by his start; But the English--ah, the English--they are quite a race apart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their psychology is bovine, their outlook crude and raw. They abandon vital matters to be tickled with a straw, But the straw that they were tickled with--the chaff that they were fed with-- They convert into a weaver's beam to break their foeman's head with.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For undemocratic reasons and for motives not of State, They arrive at their conclusions--largely inarticulate. Being void of self-expression they confide their views to none; But sometimes in a smoking-room, one learns why things were done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, sometimes in a smoking-room, through clouds of 'Ers' and 'Ums,' Obliquely and by inference illumination comes, On some step that they have taken, or some action they approve-- Embellished with the argot of the Upper Fourth Remove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In telegraphic sentences, half nodded to their friends, They hint a matter's inwardness--and there the matter ends. And while the Celt is talking from Valencia to Kirkwall, The English--ah, the English!--don't say anything at all!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Who knows the heart of the Christian? How does he reason? What are his measures and balances? Which is his season For laughter, forbearance or bloodshed, and what devils move him When he arises to smite us? I do not love him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He invites the derision of strangers--he enters all places. Booted, bareheaded he enters. With shouts and embraces He asks of us news of the household whom we reckon nameless. Certainly Allah created him forty-fold shameless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it is not in the Desert. One came to me weeping-- The Avenger of Blood on his track--I took him in keeping. Demanding not whom he had slain, I refreshed him, I fed him As he were even a brother. But Eblis had bred him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was the son of an ape, ill at ease in his clothing, He talked with his head, hands and feet. I endured him with loathing. Whatever his spirit conceived his countenance showed it As a frog shows in a mud-puddle. Yet I abode it!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I fingered my beard and was dumb, in silence confronting him. His soul was too shallow for silence, e'en with Death hunting him. I said: 'Tis his weariness speaks,' but, when he had rested, He chirped in my face like some sparrow, and, presently, jested!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wherefore slew I that stranger? He brought me dishonour. I saddled my mare, Bijli, I set him upon her. I gave him rice and goat's flesh. He bared me to laughter. When he was gone from my tent, swift I followed after, Taking my sword in my hand. The hot wine had filled him. Under the stars he mocked me--therefore I killed him!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE NAULAHKA We meet in an evil land That is near to the gates of hell. I wait for thy command To serve, to speed or withstand. And thou sayest, I do not well? Oh Love, the flowers so red Are only tongues of flame, The earth is full of the dead, The new-killed, restless dead. There is danger beneath and o'erhead, And I guard thy gates in fear Of peril and jeopardy, Of words thou canst not hear, Of signs thou canst not see-- And thou sayest 'tis ill that I came? This I saw when the rites were done, And the lamps were dead and the Gods alone, And the grey snake coiled on the altar stone-- Ere I fled from a Fear that I could not see, And the Gods of the East made mouths at me. * * * * * Now it is not good for the Christian's health to hustle the Aryan brown, For the Christian riles, and the Aryan smiles and he weareth the Christian down; And the end of the fight is a tombstone white with the name of the late deceased, And the epitaph drear: 'A fool lies here who tried to hustle the East.' * * * * * Beat off in our last fight were we? The greater need to seek the sea. For Fortune changeth as the moon To caravel and picaroon. Then Eastward Ho! or Westward Ho! Whichever wind may meetest blow. Our quarry sails on either sea, Fat prey for such bold lads as we. And every sun-dried buccaneer Must hand and reef and watch and steer. And bear great wrath of sea and sky Before the plate-ships wallow by. Now, as our tall bows take the foam, Let no man turn his heart to home, Save to desire treasure more, And larger warehouse for his store, When treasure won from Santos Bay Shall make our sea-washed village gay. * * * * * Because I sought it far from men, In deserts and alone, I found it burning overhead, The jewel of a Throne. Because I sought--I sought it so And spent my days to find-- It blazed one moment ere it left The blacker night behind. When a lover hies abroad. Looking for his love, Azrael smiling sheathes his sword, Heaven smiles above. Earth and sea His servants be, And to lesser compass round, That his love be sooner found. * * * * * There was a strife 'twixt man and maid-- Oh that was at the birth of time! But what befell 'twixt man and maid, Oh that's beyond the grip of rhyme. 'Twas, 'Sweet, I must not bide with you,' And 'Love, I cannot bide alone'; For both were young and both were true, And both were hard as the nether stone. * * * * * There is pleasure in the wet, wet clay, When the artist's hand is potting it; There is pleasure in the wet, wet lay, When the poet's pad is blotting it; There is pleasure in the shine of your picture on the line At the Royal Acade-my; But the pleasure felt in these is as chalk to Cheddar cheese When it comes to a well-made Lie: To a quite unwreckable Lie, To a most impeccable Lie! To a water-tight, fire-proof, angle-iron, sunk-hinge, time-lock, steel-face Lie! Not a private hansom Lie, But a pair-and-brougham Lie, Not a little-place-at-Tooting, but a country-house-with-shooting And a ring-fence-deer-park Lie. * * * * * We be the Gods of the East-- Older than all-- Masters of Mourning and Feast How shall we fall? Will they gape for the husks that ye proffer Or yearn to your song? And we--have we nothing to offer Who ruled them so long-- In the fume of the incense, the clash of the cymbal, the blare of the conch and the gong? Over the strife of the schools Low the day burns-- Back with the kine from the pools Each one returns To the life that he knows where the altar-flame glows and the tulsi is trimmed in the urns. * * * * *</field>

Anything green that grew out of the mould Was an excellent herb to our fathers of old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wonderful tales had our fathers of old-- Wonderful tales of the herbs and the stars-- The Sun was Lord of the Marigold, Basil and Rocket belonged to Mars. Pat as a sum in division it goes-- (Every plant had a star bespoke)-- Who but Venus should govern the Rose? Who but Jupiter own the Oak? Simply and gravely the facts are told In the wonderful books of our fathers of old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wonderful little, when all is said, Wonderful little our fathers knew. Half their remedies cured you dead-- Most of their teaching was quite untrue-- 'Look at the stars when a patient is ill, (Dirt has nothing to do with disease,) Bleed and blister as much as you will, Blister and bleed him as oft as you please.' Whence enormous and manifold Errors were made by our fathers of old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet when the sickness was sore in the land, And neither planets nor herbs assuaged, They took their lives in their lancet-hand And, oh, what a wonderful war they waged!

None too learned, but nobly bold Into the fight went our fathers of old.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Youth's passion, manhood's fierce intent. With age's judgment wise, They spent, and counted not they spent. At daily sacrifice. Not lambs alone nor purchased doves Or tithe of trader's gold-- Their lives most dear, their dearer loves, They offered up of old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Refraining e'en from lawful things. They bowed the neck to bear The unadornèd yoke that brings Stark toil and sternest care. Wherefore through them is Freedom sure; Wherefore through them we stand From all but sloth and pride secure, In a delightsome land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, fretful, murmur not they gave So great a charge to keep. Nor dream that awestruck Time shall save Their labour while we sleep. Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year, Our fathers' title runs. Make we likewise their sacrifice, Defrauding not our sons.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">'BEAST AND MAN IN INDIA' They killed a child to please the Gods In earth's young penitence, And I have bled in that Babe's stead Because of innocence. I bear the sins of sinful men That have no sin of my own, They drive me forth to Heaven's wrath Unpastured and alone. I am the meat of sacrifice, The ransom of man's guilt, For they give my life to the altar-knife Wherever shrine is built. The Goat. Between the waving tufts of jungle-grass, Up from the river as the twilight falls, Across the dust-beclouded plain they pass On to the village walls. Great is the sword and mighty is the pen, But greater far the labouring ploughman's blade, For on its oxen and its husbandmen An Empire's strength is laid. The Oxen. The torn boughs trailing o'er the tusks aslant, The saplings reeling in the path he trod, Declare his might--our lord the Elephant, Chief of the ways of God. The black bulk heaving where the oxen pant, The bowed head toiling where the guns careen, Declare our might--our slave the Elephant And servant of the Queen. The Elephant. Dark children of the mere and marsh, Wallow and waste and lea, Outcaste they wait at the village gate With folk of low degree. Their pasture is in no man's land. Their food the cattle's scorn, Their rest is mire and their desire The thicket and the thorn. But woe to those who break their sleep, And woe to those who dare To rouse the herd-bull from his keep, The wild boar from his lair! Pigs and Buffaloes. The beasts are very wise, Their mouths are clean of lies, They talk one to the other, Bullock to bullock's brother Resting after their labours, Each in stall with his neighbours. But man with goad and whip, Breaks up their fellowship, Shouts in their silky ears Filling their souls with fears. When he has ploughed the land, He says: 'They understand.' But the beasts in stall together, Freed from the yoke and tether, Say as the torn flanks smoke: 'Nay, 'twas the whip that spoke.'</field>

      <field name="fulltext">When first by Eden Tree, The Four Great Rivers ran, To each was appointed a Man Her Prince and Ruler to be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But after this was ordained, (The ancient legends tell), There came dark Israel, For whom no River remained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then He Whom the Rivers obey Said to him: 'Fling on the ground A handful of yellow clay, And a Fifth Great River shall run, Mightier than these Four, In secret the Earth around; And Her secret evermore, Shall be shown to thee and thy Race.' So it was said and done. And deep in the veins of Earth, And, fed by a thousand springs That comfort the market-place, Or sap the power of Kings, The Fifth Great River had birth, Even as it was foretold-- The Secret River of Gold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Israel laid down His sceptre and his crown, To brood on that River's bank, Where the waters flashed and sank, And burrowed in earth and fell, And bided a season below, For reason that none might know, Save only Israel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He is Lord of the Last-- The Fifth, most wonderful, Flood. He hears Her thunder past And Her Song is in his blood. He can foresay: 'She will fall,' For he knows which fountain dries. Behind which desert-belt A thousand leagues to the South.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He can foresay: 'She will rise.' He knows what far snows melt; Along what mountain-wall A thousand leagues to the North. He snuffs the coming drouth As he snuffs the coming rain, He knows what each will bring forths And turns it to his gain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Ruler without a Throne, A Prince without a Sword, Israel follows his quest. In every land a guest, Of many lands a lord, In no land King is he. But the Fifth Great River keeps The secret of Her deeps For Israel alone, As it was ordered to be.</field>

Good luck to every sergeant, then, that lets us pick our road! Bad luck to all the driver-men that cannot pack a load!

      <field name="fulltext">The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons, The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes, The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame-- The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I met my mates in the morning (I'll never meet them more!); They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore. And through the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter-wheat so tall-- The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all! The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn! The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">We've sorrow enough in the natural way, When it comes to burying Christian clay. Our loves are not given, but only lent, At compound interest of cent per cent.

      <field name="fulltext">Let nothing linger after-- No whimpering ghost remain, In wall, or beam, or rafter, Of any hate or pain. Cleanse and call home thy spirit, Deny her leave to cast, On aught thy heirs inherit, The shadow of her past. For think, in all thy sadness, What road our griefs may take; Whose brain reflect our madness, Or whom our terrors shake. For think, lest any languish By cause of thy distress-- The arrows of our anguish Fly farther than we guess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our lives, our tears, as water, Are spilled upon the ground; God giveth no man quarter, Yet God a means hath found, Though faith and hope have vanished, And even love grows dim-- A means whereby His banished Be not expelled from Him.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Over the jewelled floor, nigh weeping, ran to them Mary the Mother, Kneeled and caressed and made promise with kisses, and drew them along to the gateway-- Yea, the all-iron unbribeable Door which Peter must guard and none other. Straightway She took the Keys from his keeping, and opened and freed them straightway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, to Her Son, Who had seen and smiled, She said: 'On the night that I bore Thee, What didst Thou care for a love beyond mine or a heaven that was not my arm? Didst Thou push from the nipple, O Child, to hear the angels adore Thee? When we two lay in the breath of the kine?' And He said:--'Thou hast done no harm.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So through the Void the Children ran homeward merrily hand in hand, Looking neither to left nor right where the breathless Heavens stood still.

Yes, here, or hereabouts, they met To hold their racial talks and such-- To barter beads for Whitby jet, And tin for gay shell torques and such. But long and long before that time (When bison used to roam on it) Did Taffy and her Daddy climb That Down, and had their home on it. Then beavers built in Broadstonebrook And made a swamp where Bramley stands; And bears from Shere would come and look For Taffimai where Shamley stands. The Wey, that Taffy called Wagai, Was more than six times bigger then; And all the Tribe of Tegumai They cut a noble figure then!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II Of all the Tribe of Tegumai Who cut that figure, none remain,-- On Merrow Down the cuckoos cry-- The silence and the sun remain. But as the faithful years return And hearts unwounded sing again, Comes Taffy dancing through the fern To lead the Surrey spring again. Her brows are bound with bracken-fronds, And golden elf-locks fly above; Her eyes are bright as diamonds And bluer than the sky above. In mocassins and deer-skin cloak, Unfearing, free and fair she flits, And lights her little damp-wood smoke To show her Daddy where she flits. For far--oh, very far behind, So far she cannot call to him, Comes Tegumai alone to find The daughter that was all to him.</field>

How the Whale got his Throat. The Camel's hump is an ugly lump Which well you may see at the Zoo; But uglier yet is the hump we get From having too little to do. Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo, If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo. We get the hump-- Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue! We climb out of bed with a frouzly head And a snarly-yarly voice. We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl At our bath and our boots and our toys; And there ought to be a corner for me (And I know there is one for you) When we get the hump-- Cameelious hump-- The hump that is black and blue! The cure for this ill is not to sit still, Or frowst with a book by the fire; But to take a large hoe and a shovel also, And dig till you gently perspire; And then you will find that the sun and the wind, And the Djinn of the Garden too, Have lifted the hump-- The horrible hump-- The hump that is black and blue! I get it as well as you-oo-oo-- If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo! We all get hump-- Cameelious hump-- Kiddies and grown-ups too! How the Camel got his Hump.

Let's--oh, anything , daddy, so long as it's you and me, And going truly exploring, and not being in till tea!

I keep six honest serving-men (They taught me all I knew); Their names are What and Why and When And How and Where and Who. I send them over land and sea, I send them east and west; But after they have worked for me, I give them all a rest. I let them rest from nine till five, For I am busy then, As well as breakfast, lunch, and tea, For they are hungry men. But different folk have different views; I know a person small-- She keeps ten million serving-men, Who get no rest at all! She sends 'em abroad on her own affairs, From the second she opens her eyes-- One million Hows, two million Wheres, And seven million Whys! The Elephant's Child. This is the mouth-filling song of the race that was run by a Boomer. Run in a single burst--only event of its kind-- Started by Big God Nqong from Warrigaborrigarooma, Old Man Kangaroo first, Yellow-Dog Dingo behind. Kangaroo bounded away, his back-legs working like pistons-- Bounded from morning till dark, twenty-five feet at a bound. Yellow-Dog Dingo lay like a yellow cloud in the distance-- Much too busy to bark. My! but they covered the ground! Nobody knows where they went, or followed the track that they flew in, For that Continent hadn't been given a name. They ran thirty degrees, from Torres Straits to the Leeuwin (Look at the Atlas, please), then they ran back as they came.

The Crab that Played with the Sea. Pussy can sit by the fire and sing, Pussy can climb a tree, Or play with a silly old cork and string To 'muse herself, not me. But I like Binkie my dog, because He knows how to behave; So, Binkie's the same as the First Friend was, And I am the Man in the Cave! Pussy will play man-Friday till It's time to wet her paw And make her walk on the window-sill (For the footprint Crusoe saw); Then she fluffles her tail and mews, And scratches and won't attend. But Binkie will play whatever I choose, And he is my true First Friend! Pussy will rub my knees with her head Pretending she loves me hard; But the very minute I go to my bed Pussy runs out in the yard, And there she stays till the morning-light; So I know it is only pretend; But Binkie , he snores at my feet all night, And he is my Firstest Friend! The Cat that Walked by Himself There was never a Queen like Balkis, From here to the wide world's end; But Balkis talked to a butterfly As you would talk to a friend. There was never a King like Solomon, Not since the world began; But Solomon talked to a butterfly As a man would talk to a man.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE 2 The pavilion in the Gardens. Enter Ferdinand and the King Ferdinand . Your tiercel's too long at hack. Sir. He's no eyass But a passage-hawk that footed ere we caught him. Dangerously free o' the air. Faith, were he mine (As mine's the glove he binds to for his tirings) I'd fly him with a make-hawk. He's in yarak Plumed to the very point. So manned, so weathered! Give him the firmament God made him for. And what shall take the air of him? The King . A young wing yet. Bold--overbold on the perch, but, think you, Ferdinand, He can endure the tall skies yonder? Cozen Advantage out of the teeth of the hurricane? Choose his own mate against the lammer-geier? Ride out a night-long tempest, hold his pitch Between the lightning and the cloud it leaps from, Never too pressed to kill? Ferdinand . I'll answer for him. Bating all parable, I know the Prince. There's a bleak devil in the young, my Lord; God put it there to save 'em from their elders And break their father's heart, but bear them scatheless Through mire and thorns and blood if need be. Think What our prime saw! Such glory, such achievements As now our children, wondering at, examine Themselves to see if they shall hardly equal. But what cared we while we wrought the wonders? Nothing! The rampant deed contented. The King . Little enough, God knows! But afterwards? After-- There comes the reckoning. I would save him that. Ferdinand . Save him dry scars that ache of winter-nights. Worn out self-pity and as much of knowledge As makes old men fear judgment? Then loose him--loose him, A' God's name loose him to adventure early! And trust some random pike, or half-backed horse, Besides what's caught in Italy, to save him. The King . I know. I know. And yet ... What stirs in the garden? Enter Gow and a Gardener bearing the Prince's body Ferdinand .(Gods give me patience!) Gow and a gardener Bearing some load along in the dusk to the dunghill. Nay--a dead branch--But as I said, the Prince---- The King. They've set it down. Strange that they work so late. Gow (setting down the body) . Heark, you unsanctified fool, while I set out our story. We found it, this side the North park wall which it had climbed to pluck nectarines from the alley. Heark again! There was a nectarine in its hand when we found it, and the naughty brick that slipped from the coping beneath its foot and so caused its death, lies now under the wall for the King to see. The King (above) . The King to see! Why should he? Who's the man? Gow . That is your tale. Swerve from it by so much as the breadth of my dagger and here's your instant reward. You heard not, saw not, and by the Horns of ninefold-cuckolded Jupiter you thought not nor dreamed not anything more or other! The King . Ninefold-cuckolded Jupiter. That's a rare oath! Shall we look closer? Ferdinand . Not yet, my Lord! (I cannot hear him breathe.) Gardener . The North park wall? It was so. Plucking nectarines. It shall be. But how shall I say if any ask why our Lady the Queen-- Gow (stabs him) . Thus! Hie after the Prince and tell him y'are the first fruits of his nectarine tree. Bleed there behind the laurels. The King . Why did Gow buffet the clown? What said he? I'll go look. Ferdinand (above) . Save yourself! It is the King! Enter the King and Ferdinand to Gow Gow . God save you! This was the Prince! The King . The Prince! Not a dead branch? ( Uncovers the face .) My flesh and blood! My son! my son! my son! Ferdinand ( to Gow ). I had feared something of this. And that fool yonder? Gow . Dead, or as good. He cannot speak. Ferdinand . Better so. The King . 'Loosed to adventure early!' Tell the tale. Gow . Saddest truth alack! I came upon him not a half hour since, fallen from the North park wall over against the Deerpark side--dead--dead!--a nectarine in his hand that the dear lad must have climbed for, and plucked the very instant, look you, that a brick slipped on the coping. 'Tis there now. So I lifted him, but his neck was as you see--and already cold. The King . Oh, very cold. But why should he have troubled to climb? He was free of all the fruit in my garden, God knows!... What, Gow? Gow . Surely, God knows! The King . A lad's trick. But I love him the better for it.... True, he's past loving.... And now we must tell our Queen. What a coil at the day's end! She'll grieve for him. Not as I shall; Ferdinand, but as youth for youth. They were much of the same age. Playmate for playmate. See, he wears her colours. That is the knot she gave him last--last.... Oh God! When was yesterday? Ferdinand . Come in! Come in, my Lord. There's a dew falling. The King . He'll take no harm of it. I'll follow presently..... He's all his mother's now and none of mine-- Her very face on the bride-pillow. Yet I tricked her. But that was later--and she never guessed. I do not think he sinned much--he's too young-- Much the same age as my Queen. God must not judge him Too hardly for such slips as youth may fall in. But I'll entreat that Throne. ( Prays by the body. ) Gow . The Heavens hold up still. Earth opens not and this dew's mere water. What shall a man think of it all? (To Gardener.) Not dead yet, sirrah? I bade you follow the Prince. Despatch! Gardener . Some kind soul pluck out the dagger. Why did you slay me? I'd done no wrong. I'd ha' kept it secret till my dying day. But not now--not now! I'm dying. The Prince fell from the Queen's chamber window. I saw it in the nut alley. He was---- Ferdinand . But what made you in the nut alley at that hour? Gardener . No wrong. No more than another man's wife. Jocasta of the still-room. She'd kissed me good-night too; but that's over with the rest.... I've stumbled on the Prince's beastly loves, and I pay for all. Let me pass! Gow . Count it your fortune, honest man. You would have revealed it to your woman at the next meeting. You fleshmongers are all one feather. (Plucks out the dagger.) Go in peace and lay your death to Fortune's door. He's sped--thank Fortune! Ferdinand . Who knows not Fortune, glutted on easy thrones, Stealing from feasts as rare to coney-catch Privily in the hedgerows for a clown. With that same cruel-lustful hand and eye, Those nails and wedges, that one hammer and lead, And the very gerb of long-stored lightning loosed. Yesterday 'gainst some King. The King . I have pursued with prayers where my heart warns me My soul shall overtake-- Enter the Queen The King . Look not! Wait till I tell you, dearest.... Air!... 'Loosed to adventure early' ... I go late. (Dies.) Gow . So! God hath cut off the Prince in his pleasures. Gow, to save the King, hath silenced one poor fool who knew how it befell, and now the King's dead, needs only that the Queen should kill Gow and all's safe for her this side o' the Judgment. ...Senor Ferdinand, the wind's easterly. I'm for the road. Ferdinand . My horse is at the gate. God speed you. Whither? Gow . To the Duke, if the Queen does not lay hands on me before. However it goes, I charge you bear witness, Senor Ferdinand, I served the old King faithfully. To the death, Senor Ferdinand--to the death!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">One moment past our bodies cast No shadow on the plain; Now clear and black they stride our track, And we run home again. In morning hush, each rock and bush Stands hard, and high, and raw: Then give the Call: ' Good rest to all That keep the Jungle Law!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now horn and pelt our peoples melt In covert to abide; Now, crouched and still, to cave and hill Our Jungle Barons glide. Now, stark and plain, Man's oxen strain, That draw the new-yoked plough; Now, stripped and dread, the dawn is red Above the lit talao .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ho! Get to lair! The sun's aflare Behind the breathing grass: And creaking through the young bamboo The warning whispers pass. By day made strange, the woods we range With blinking eyes we scan; While down the skies the wild duck cries: ' The Day--the Day to Man! '</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dew is dried that drenched our hide, Or washed about our way; And where we drank, the puddled bank Is crisping into clay. The traitor Dark gives up each mark Of stretched or hooded claw; Then hear the Call: ' Good rest to all That keep the Jungle Law! '</field>

The last ash fell from the withered log with the click of a falling spark, And the Only Son woke up again, and called across the dark:-- 'Now was I born of womankind and laid in a mother's breast? For I have dreamed of a shaggy hide whereon I went to rest? And was I born of womankind and laid on a father's arm? For I have dreamed of clashing teeth that guarded me from harm. And was I born an Only Son and did I play alone? For I have dreamed of comrades twain that bit me to the bone. And did I break the barley-cake and steep it in the tyre? For I have dreamed of a youngling kid new-riven from the byre. For I have dreamed of a midnight sky and a midnight call to blood, And red-mouthed shadows racing by, that thrust me from my food. 'Tis an hour yet and an hour yet to the rising of the moon, But I can see the black roof-tree as plain as it were noon. 'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the trooping blackbuck go; But I can hear the little fawn that bleats behind the doe. 'Tis a league and a league to the Lena Falls where the crop and the upland meet, But I can smell the wet dawn-wind that wakes the sprouting wheat.

Mowgli's Brothers. * * * * * His spots are the joy of the Leopard: his horns are the Buffalo's pride. Be clean, for the strength of the hunter is known by the gloss of his hide. If ye find that the bullock can toss you, or the heavy-browed Sambhur can gore; Ye need not stop work to inform us. We knew it ten seasons before. Oppress not the cubs of the stranger, but hail them as Sister and Brother, For though they are little and fubsy, it may be the Bear is their mother.

Kaa's Hunting. * * * * * The stream is shrunk--the pool is dry, And we be comrades, thou and I; With fevered jowl and dusty flank Each jostling each along the bank; And, by one drouthy fear made still, Foregoing thought of quest or kill. Now 'neath his dam the fawn may see, The lean Pack-wolf as cowed as he, And the tall buck, unflinching, note The fangs that tore his father's throat. The pools are shrunk--the streams are dry, And we be playmates, thou and I, Till yonder cloud--Good Hunting!--loose The rain that breaks our Water Truce. How Fear Came. * * * * * What of the hunting, hunter bold? Brother, the watch was long and cold. What of the quarry ye went to kill? Brother, he crops in the jungle still. Where is the power that made your pride? Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side. Where is the haste that ye hurry by? Brother, I go to my lair to die! 'Tiger-Tiger!' * * * * * Veil them, cover them, wall them round-- Blossom, and creeper, and weed-- Let us forget the sight and the sound, The smell and the touch of the breed!

For the cry of our mates when the sambhur has wheeled and is standing at bay! For the risk and the riot of night! For the sleep at the lair-mouth by day! It is met, and we go to the fight. Bay! O bay! Red Dog. Man goes to Man! Cry the challenge through the Jungle! He that was our Brother goes away.

I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane. I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs. I will go out until the day, until the morning break, Out to the winds' untainted kiss, the waters' clean caress. I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket-stake. I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates master-less! Toomai of the Elephants. The People of the Eastern Ice, they are melting like the snow-- They beg for coffee and sugar; they go where the white men go. The People of the Western Ice, they learn to steal and fight; They sell their furs to the trading-post; they sell their souls to the white. The People of the Southern Ice, they trade with the whaler's crew; Their women have many ribbons, but their tents are torn and few. But the People of the Elder Ice, beyond the white man's ken-- Their spears are made of the narwhal-horn, and they are the last of the Men! Quiquern. * * * * * When ye say to Tabaqui, 'My Brother!' when ye call the Hyena to meat, Ye may cry the Full Truce with Jacala--the Belly that runs on four feet. The Undertakers. The night we felt the earth would move We stole and plucked him by the hand, Because we loved him with the love That knows but cannot understand. And when the roaring hillside broke, And all our world fell down in rain, We saved him, we the Little Folk; But lo! he does not come again! Mourn now, we saved him for the sake Of such poor love as wild ones may. Mourn ye! Our brother will not wake, And his own kind drive us away! The Miracle of Purun Bhagat.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE KING'S TASK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the sack of the City, when Rome was sunk to a name, In the years that the lights were darkened, or ever St. Wilfrid came, Low on the borders of Britain (the ancient poets sing) Between the Cliff and the Forest there ruled a Saxon King. Stubborn all were his people from cottar to overlord-- Not to be cowed by the cudgel, scarce to be schooled by the sword; Quick to turn at their pleasure, cruel to cross in their mood, And set on paths of their choosing as the hogs of Andred's Wood. Laws they made in the Witan--the laws of flaying and fine-- Common, loppage and pannage, the theft and the track of kine-- Statutes of tun and market for the fish and the malt and the meal-- The tax on the Bramber packhorse and the tax on the Hastings keel. Over the graves of the Druids and under the wreck of Rome Rudely but surely they bedded the plinth of the days to come. Behind the feet of the Legions and before the Norseman's ire, Rudely but greatly begat they the framing of state and shire. Rudely but deeply they laboured, and their labour stands till now, If we trace on our ancient headlands the twist of their eight-ox plough. There came a king from Hamtun, by Bosenham he came. He filled Use with slaughter, and Lewes he gave to flame. He smote while they sat in the Witan--sudden he smote and sore, That his fleet was gathered at Selsea ere they mustered at Cymen's Ore. Blithe went the Saxons to battle, by down and wood and mere, But thrice the acorns ripened ere the western mark was clear. Thrice was the beechmast gathered, and the Beltane fires burned Thrice, and the beeves were salted thrice ere the host returned. They drove that king from Hamtun, by Bosenham o'erthrown, Out of Rugnor to Wilton they made his land their own. Camps they builded at Gilling, at Basing and Alresford, But wrath abode in the Saxons from cottar to overlord. Wrath at the weary war-game, at the foe that snapped and ran Wolf-wise feigning and flying, and wolf-wise snatching his man. Wrath for their spears unready, their levies new to the blades-- Shame for the helpless sieges and the scornful ambuscades. At hearth and tavern and market, wherever the tale was told, Shame and wrath had the Saxons because of their boasts of old. And some would drink and deny it, and some would pray and atone; But the most part, after their anger, avouched that the sin was their own. Wherefore, girding together, up to the Witan they came, And as they had shouldered their bucklers so did they shoulder their blame. For that was the wont of the Saxons (the ancient poets sing), And first they spoke in the Witan and then they spoke to the King: 'Edward King of the Saxons, thou knowest from sire to son, 'One is the King and his People--in gain and ungain one. 'Count we the gain together. With doubtings and spread dismays 'We have broken a foolish people--but after many days. 'Count we the loss together. Warlocks hampered our arms, 'We were tricked as by magic, we were turned as by charms. 'We went down to the battle and the road was plain to keep, 'But our angry eyes were holden, and we struck as they strike in sleep-- 'Men new shaken from slumber, sweating, with eyes a-stare 'Little blows uncertain dealt on the useless air. 'Also a vision betrayed us, and a lying tale made bold 'That we looked to hold what we had not and to have what we did not hold: 'That a shield should give us shelter--that a sword should give us power-- 'A shield snatched up at a venture and a hilt scarce handled an hour: 'That being rich in the open, we should be strong in the close-- 'And the Gods would sell us a cunning for the day that we met our foes. 'This was the work of wizards, but not with our foe they bide, 'In our own camp we took them, and their names are Sloth and Pride. 'Our pride was before the battle: our sloth ere we lifted spear, 'But hid in the heart of the people as the fever hides in the mere, 'Waiting only the war-game, the heat of the strife to rise 'As the ague fumes round Oxeney when the rotting reed-bed dries. 'But now we are purged of that fever--cleansed by the letting of blood, 'Something leaner of body--something keener of mood. 'And the men new-freed from the levies return to the fields again, 'Matching a hundred battles, cottar and lord and thane. 'And they talk aloud in the temples where the ancient wargods are. 'They thumb and mock and belittle the holy harness of war. 'They jest at the sacred chariots, the robes and the gilded staff. 'These things fill them with laughter, they lean on their spears and laugh. 'The men grown old in the war-game, hither and thither they range-- 'And scorn and laughter together are sire and dam of change; 'And change may be good or evil--but we know not what it will bring, 'Therefore our King must teach us. That is thy task, O King!'</field>

Them that asks no questions isn't told a lie, Watch the wall, my darling, while the Gentlemen go by!

      <field name="heading_text">KING HENRY VII. AND THE SHIPWRIGHTS (A.D. 1487)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry, our King in England, from London town is gone, And comen to Hamull on the Hoke in the countie of Suthampton. For there lay The Mary of the Tower , his ship of war so strong, And he would discover, certaynely, if his shipwrights did him wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He told not none of his setting forth, nor yet where he would go (But only my Lord of Arundel), and meanly did he show, In an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark; With his frieze hood and cloak above, he looked like any clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was at Hamull on the Hoke about the hour of the tide. And saw the Mary haled into dock, the winter to abide, With all her tackle and habiliments which are the King his own; But then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They heaved the main-mast overboard, that was of a trusty tree, And they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea. But they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go, To maken beds for their own wives and little children also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a knave called Slingawai, he crope beneath the deck. Crying: 'Good felawes, come and see! The ship is nigh a wreck! For the storm that took our tall main-mast, it blew so fierce and fell, Alack! it hath taken the kettles and pans, and this brass pott as well!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch, While all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch; All except Bob Brygandyne and he was a yeoman good, He caught Slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'I have taken plank and rope and nail, without the King his leave, After the custom of Portesmouth, but I will not suffer a thief. Nay, never lift up thy hand at me! There's no clean hands in the trade-- Steal in measure,' quo' Brygandyne. 'There's measure in all things made!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Gramercy, yeoman!' said our King. 'Thy council liketh me.' And he pulled a whistle out of his neck and whistled whistles three. Then came my Lord of Arundel pricking across the down, And behind him the Mayor and Burgesses of merry Suthampton town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They drew the naughty shipwrights up, with the kettles in their hands, And bound them round the forecastle to wait the King's commands. But 'Since ye have made your beds,' said the King, 'ye needs must lie thereon. For the sake of your wives and little ones--felawes, get you gone!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they had beaten Slingawai, out of his own lips Our King appointed Brygandyne to be Clerk of all his ships. 'Nay, never lift up thy hands to me--there's no clean hands in the trade. But steal in measure,' said Harry our King. 'There's measure in all things made!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God speed the 'Mary of the Tower,' the 'Sovereign,' and 'Grace Dieu,' The 'Sweepstakes' and the 'Mary Fortune,' and the 'Henry of Bristol' too! All tall ships that sail on, the sea, or in our harbours stand, That they may keep measure with Harry our King and peace in Engeland!</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE BALLAD OF MINEPIT SHAW</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About the time that taverns shut And men can buy no beer, Two lads went up to the keepers' hut To steal Lord Pelham's deer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Night and the liquor was in their heads-- They laughed and talked no bounds, Till they waked the keepers on their beds, And the keepers loosed the hounds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had killed a hart, they had killed a hind, Ready to carry away, When they heard a whimper down the wind And they heard a bloodhound bay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They took and ran across the fern, Their crossbows in their hand, Till they met a man with a green lantern That called and bade 'em stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'What are ye doing, O Flesh and Blood, And what's your foolish will, That you must break into Minepit Wood And wake the Folk of the Hill?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Oh, we've broke into Lord Pelham's park, And killed Lord Pelham's deer, And if ever you heard a little dog bark You'll know why we come here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'We ask you let us go our way, As fast as we can flee, For if ever you heard a bloodhound bay You'll know how pressed we be.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Oh, lay your crossbows on the bank And drop the knife from your hand, And though the hounds are at your flank I'll save you where you stand!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They laid their crossbows on the bank, They threw their knives in the wood, And the ground before them opened and sank And saved 'em where they stood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Oh, what's the roaring in our ears That strikes us well-nigh dumb?' 'Oh, that is just how things appears According as they come.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'What are the stars before our eyes That strike us well-nigh blind?' 'Oh, that is just how things arise According as you find.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'And why's our bed so hard to the bones Excepting where it's cold?' 'Oh, that's because it is precious stones Excepting where 'tis gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Think it over as you stand. For I tell you without fail, If you haven't got into Fairyland You're not in Lewes Gaol.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All night long they thought of it, And, come the dawn, they saw They'd tumbled into a great old pit, At the bottom of Minepit Shaw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the keepers' hound had followed 'em close, And broke her neck in the fall; So they picked up their knives and their crossbows And buried the dog. That's all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But whether the man was a poacher too Or a Pharisee [A] so bold-- I reckon there's more things told than are true, And more things true than are told!</field>
