      <field name="fulltext">Text Page with black and white illustration of cats: Tabitha Twitchit finding her kittens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent. She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten. She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages. Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase. Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night— especially cheese and bacon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted, and mewed dreadfully Watercolor of Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, the cat, dressed in an apron standing next to a window and curtain and stair-rail Text Page with black and white illustration of Moppet and Mittens, kittens, peeking out from behind a door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out. Text Page with black and white illustration of the kittens, Moppet and Mittens, getting into pie dough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They patted it with their little soft paws —“Shall we make dear little muffins?” said Mittens to Moppet Text Page with black and white illustration of a frightened Moppet kitten jumping into a barrel. We see her tail and back leg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright Text Page with black and white illustration of Mittens, the kitten, hiding in an empty jar next to milk pans. We see her tail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mittens ran away to the dairy, and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully—“Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down! I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby,” said Tabitha, shedding tears. “I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him.” She wiped her eyes with an apron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea. Where have you looked for him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All over the house! The rats are too many for me. What a thing it is to have an unruly family!” said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit. Watercolor of Cousin Ribby with bonnet and basket standing at the open door. She is a cat. Text Page with black and white illustration of Cousin Ribby, the cat, with umbrella looking for rats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him too! What is all that soot in the fender?” Text Page with black and white illustration of Tabitha Twitchit worrying over Moppet and Mittens, she is sitting in a rocking chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The chimney wants sweeping—Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby—now Moppet and Mittens are gone!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They have both got out of the cup- board!” Watercolor of Cousin Ribby and Tabitha Twitchit holding a candle and looking in a trunk for rats Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella, and they rummaged in cupboards. They even fetched a candle, and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics. They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, it is infested with rats,” said Tabitha tearfully, “I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday. And once I saw the old father rat—an enormous old rat, Cousin Ribby. I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby,” said Tabitha. Text Page with black and white illustration of Ribby and Tabitha, the cats, looking for rats with an umbrella.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched. They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor. But there was nothing to be seen. Text Page with black and white illustration of Ribby finding Moppet, the kitten, in the barrel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They returned to the kitchen. “Here's one of your kittens at least,” said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor. She seemed to be in a terrible fright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh! Mother, Mother,” said Moppet, “there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two cats ran to look at the dough pan. Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Which way did she go, Moppet?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search. Watercolor of an old woman rat with apron holding a dish full of stolen dough. Text Page with black and white illustration of cats and kittens: Ribby, Tabitha, and Moppet looking scared</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went into the dairy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar Text Page with black and white illustration of Mittens, the kitten (cat) tumbling out of the jar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They tipped up the jar, and she scrambled out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, Mother, Mother!” said Mittens— Watercolor of old man rat with green petticoat stealing a pat of butter on a dish Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh! Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy—a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling-pin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A rolling-pin and butter! Oh, my poor son Thomas!” exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A rolling-pin?” said Ribby. “Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again. Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor Text Page with black and white illustration of John Joiner, the dog, holding a basket in his mouth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is serious, Cousin Tabitha,” said Ribby. “We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw.” Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten, the cat, peeking from behind the door jamb</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard. When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up. It was a big old-fashioned fireplace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat Watercolor of Tom Kitten, the cat, in blue coat looking up the chimney he is about to climb into. Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten, the cat, ascending the chimney, we see his tail over the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs. Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten, the cat, sitting on a ledge above the fire in the chimney</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar, and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender. Watercolor of chimney with sparrows and a nice rural pastoral landscape Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I cannot go back. If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chimney was a very big old-fashioned one. It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain. Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten crawling up the chimney</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten was getting very frightened! He climbed up, and up, and up Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten amidst soot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he waded sideways through inches of soot. He was like a little sweep himself. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was most confusing in the dark. One flue seemed to lead into another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall. There were some mutton bones lying about—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This seems funny,” said Tom Kitten. “Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney? I wish I had never come! And what a funny smell! It is something like mouse; only dreadfully strong. It makes me sneeze,” said Tom Kitten. Watercolor of Tom Kitten in blue coat coming across bones in the chimney Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten's tail as he squeezes through a nook or cranny in the wall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He squeezed through the hole in the wall, and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light. Text Page with black and white illustration of the attic and skirting board</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting- board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture. Watercolor of Tom Kitten rolling in rags and Mr. Sam Whiskers, the rat, looking at him. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him—he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opposite to him—as far away as he could sit—was an enormous rat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?” said the rat, chattering his teeth. Text Page with black and white illustration of Tom Kitten sitting up in the rats' nest</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Please sir, the chimney wants sweeping,” said poor Tom Kitten. Text Page with black and white illustration of Sam Whiskers calling his wife, Anna Maria, the woman rat peeking in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Anna Maria! Anna Maria!” squeaked the rat. There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anna Maria did the tying. The old rat watched her and took snuff. When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Anna Maria,” said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers),— “Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It requires dough and a pat of butter, and a rolling-pin,” said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side. Watercolor of Anna Maria, the rat, tying Tom Kitten up as Sam Whiskers watches. Text Page with black and white illustration of the tied Tom Kitten</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” said Samuel Whiskers, “make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs.” Text Page with black and white illustration of Anna Maria and Sam Whiskers, the rats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nonsense! Butter and dough,” replied Anna Maria. Watercolor of Sam Whiskers with the rolling pin on the carpet Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot, and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter. He did not meet anybody.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made a second journey for the rolling- pin. He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They did not see him. Text Page with black and white illustration of Anna Maria, the rat, peeking behind a shutter and some geraniums are in the foreground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anna Maria went down by way of the skirting-board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough. Text Page with black and white illustration of Anna Maria, the rat, borrowing some dough and a small saucer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She borrowed a small saucer, and scooped up the dough with her paws.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She did not observe Moppet. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But his mouth was full of soot and cob- webs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Except a spider, which came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate blue-bottles. It did not offer to assist him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted. Watercolor of Tom Kitten, the cat, tied up with string and struggling to get free. Text Page with black and white illustration of Anna Maria and Sam Whiskers, the rats, spreading butter on the cat, Tom Kitten, to make him into a dumpling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling. First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?” inquired Samuel Whiskers. Text Page with black and white illustration of Anna Maria and Sam Whiskers, the rats, spreading the dough around Tom Kitten, the cat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry. She laid hold of his ears. Watercolor of Anna Maria and Sam Whiskers, the rats, rolling the dough over Tom Kitten, the cat, with a rolling pin. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom Kitten bit and spat, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling-pin went roly- poly, roly; roly, poly, roly. The rats each held an end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“His tail is sticking out! You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I fetched as much as I could carry,” replied Anna Maria.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do not think”—said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten—“I do not think it will be a good pudding. It smells sooty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anna Maria was about to argue the point, when all at once there began to be other sounds up above—the rasping noise of a saw; and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping! Black and white illustration of Anna Maria and Sam Whiskers, the rats, dropping the rolling pin on Tom Kitten, the cat because they hear something.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rats dropped the rolling-pin, and listened attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property,— and other people's,—and depart at once.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.” Black and white illustration of Sam Whiskers, the rat, running to get away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane,” said Anna Maria. “I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney.” Black and white illustration of John the Joiner, a dog, reaching through the floor to find Tom Kitten, the cat, rolled in dough with a rolling pin next to him</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up—there was nobody under the floor except the rolling-pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling! Black and white illustration of John the Joiner, a dog, reaching through the floor and his carpentry tools, a saw, and hammer, can be seen too</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet. Watercolor of all the cats, Ribby, John the Joiner, a dog, and Moppet and Mittens watching Miss Thatchit scrub the butter and dough off of Tom Kitten in a wash basin. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he nailed the plank down again, and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cat family had quite recovered. They invited him to stay to dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten, and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon—I looked up the lane from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheel-barrow, which looked very like mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath. Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am sure I never gave her leave to borrow my wheel-barrow! Watercolor of Sam Whiskers and Anna Maria, the rats, moving out with their luggage. Black and white illustration of Sam Whiskers hauling luggage up a string into the haymow in the barn</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went into the barn, arid hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow. Black and white illustration of Tabitha Twitchit sitting in her rocking chair asleep</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's. Watercolor illustration of Farmer Potatoes, a man in a hat, looking in his barn for rats. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn! They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers—children and grand-children and great great grand-children.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is no end to them! Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. They charge so much a dozen, and earn their living very comfortably. Watercolor illustration of Moppet and Mittens catching rats in the garden. Black and white illustration of Moppet and Mittens nailing rat tails to the barn door</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They hang up the rats' tails in a row or the barn door, to show how many they have caught—dozens and dozens of them. Black and white illustration of Tom Kitten afraid of a mouse</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than—</field>
