      <field name="fulltext">Cover of Ragged Dick Magenta cloth cover embossed with victorian design Spine of Ragged Dick Magenta cloth, gold embossed with title and image of the main character. Frontispiece of Ragged Dick Engraving of the main character, his shoe-shine box before him. He is standing outdoors, apparently in front of a public park. Title Page of Ragged Dick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WAKE up there, youngster," said a rough voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ragged Dick opened his eyes slowly, and stared stupidly in the face of the speaker, but did not offer to get up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wake up, you young vagabond!" said the man a little impatiently; "I suppose you'd lay there all day, if I hadn't called you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What time is it?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven o'clock! I oughter've been up an hour ago. I know what 'twas made me so precious sleepy. I went to the Old Bowery last night, and didn't turn in till past twelve."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You went to the Old Bowery? Where'd you get your money?" asked the man, who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on Spruce Street. "Made it by shines, in course. My guardian don't allow me no money for theatres, so I have to earn it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some boys get it easier than that," said the porter significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't catch me stealin', if that's what you mean," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you ever steal, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, and I wouldn't. Lots of boys does it, but I wouldn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. I believe there's some good in you, Dick, after all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm a rough customer!" said Dick. "But I wouldn't steal. It's mean."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you think so, Dick," and the rough voice sounded gentler than at first. "Have you got any money to buy your breakfast?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I'll soon get some."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this conversation had been going on, Dick had got up. His bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw, on which the young bootblack had reposed his weary limbs, and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down. He dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Getting up too was an equally short process. He jumped out of the box, shook himself, picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes, and, drawing a well-worn cap over his uncombed locks, he was all ready for the business of the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick's appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar. His pants were torn in several places, and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself. He wore a vest, all the buttons of which were gone except two, out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month. To complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him, dating back, if one might judge from its general appearance, to a remote antiquity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day, but Dick was above such refinement. He had no particular dislike to dirt, and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands. But in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about Dick that was attractive. It was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly good-looking. Some of his companions were sly, and their faces inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank, straight-forward manner that made him a favorite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick's business hours had commenced. He had no office to open. His little blacking-box was ready for use, and he looked sharply in the faces of all who passed, addressing each with, "Shine yer boots, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much?" asked a gentleman on his way to his office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten cents," said Dick, dropping his box, and sinking upon his knees on the sidewalk, flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten cents! Isn't that a little steep?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you know 'taint all clear profit," said Dick, who had already set to work. "There's the blacking costs something, and I have to get a new brush pretty often."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you have a large rent too," said the gentleman quizzically, with a glance at a large hole in Dick's coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Dick, always ready to joke; "I have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo, that I can't afford to take less than ten cents a shine. I'll give you a bully shine, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be quick about it, for I am in a hurry. So your house is on Fifth Avenue, is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't anywhere else, said Dick, and Dick spoke the truth there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What tailor do you patronize?" asked the gentleman, surveying Dick's attire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you like to go to the same one?" asked Dick, shrewdly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, no; it strikes me that he didn't give you a very good fit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This coat once belonged to General Washington," said Dick, comically. "He wore it all through the Revolution, and it got torn some, 'cause he fit so hard. When he died he told his widder to give it to some smart young feller that hadn't got none of his own; so she gave it to me. But if you'd like it, sir, to remember General Washington by, I'll let you have it reasonable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, but I wouldn't want to deprive you of it. And did your pants come from General Washington too?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon. Lewis had outgrown 'em and sent 'em to me,—he's bigger than me, and that's why they don't fit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems you have distinguished friends. Now, my lad, I suppose you would like your money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't have any objection," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe," said the gentleman, examining his pocket-book, "I haven't got anything short of twenty-five cents. Have you got any change?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a cent," said Dick. "All my money's invested in the Erie Railroad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's unfortunate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I get the money changed, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't wait; I've got to meet an appointment immediately. I'll hand you twenty-five cents, and you can leave the change at my office any time during the day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sir. Where is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. 125 Fulton Street. Shall you remember?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. What name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Greyson,—office on second floor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sir; I'll bring it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest," said Mr. Greyson to himself, as he walked away. "If he does, I'll give him my custom regularly. If he don't as is most likely, I shan't mind the loss of fifteen cents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Greyson didn't understand Dick. Our ragged hero wasn't a model boy in all respects. I am afraid he swore sometimes, and now and then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country, or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the city. A clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed to the Tombs Prison, and, following him unobserved, was highly delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps of the great stone building on Centre Street, and tried to obtain admission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess he wouldn't want to stay long if he did get in," thought Ragged Dick, hitching up his pants. "Leastways I shouldn't. They're so precious glad to see you that they won't let you go, but board you gratooitous, and never send in no bills."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another of Dick's faults was his extravagance. Being always wide-awake and ready for business, he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably. There were not a few young clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional capacity, who scarcely earned as much as he, greatly as their style and dress exceeded his. But Dick was careless of his earnings. Where they went he could hardly have told himself. However much he managed to earn during the day, all was generally spent before morning. He was fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre, and to Tony Pastor's, and if he had any money left afterwards, he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oyster stew; so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking. This cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars, and wouldn't smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal nature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of course the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently injured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon them. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out of his mother's sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their hard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have mentioned Dick's faults and defects, because I want it understood, to begin with, that I don't consider him a model boy. But there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above doing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat, or impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward, manly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved him from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as I do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was only a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers, I must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II JOHNNY NOLAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After Dick had finished polishing Mr. Greyson's boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers, two of them reporters in the Tribune establishment, which occupies the corner of Spruce Street and Printing House Square.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick had got through with his last customer the City Hall clock indicated eight o'clock. He had been up an hour, and hard at work, and naturally began to think of breakfast. He went up to the head of Spruce Street, and turned into Nassau. Two blocks further, and he reached Ann Street. On this street was a small, cheap restaurant, where for five cents Dick could get a cup of coffee, and for ten cents more, a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in. These Dick ordered, and sat down at a table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths, for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular. Our hero's breakfast was soon before him. Neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at Delmonico's; but then it is very doubtful whether, in the present state of his wardrobe, Dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant, even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door, looking wistfully into the restaurant. This was Johnny Nolan, a boy of fourteen, who was engaged in the same profession as Ragged Dick. His wardrobe was in very much the same condition as Dick's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Had your breakfast, Johnny?" inquired Dick, cutting off a piece of steak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in, then. Here's room for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't got no money," said Johnny, looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Haven't you had any shines?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I had one, but I shan't get any pay till to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you hungry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Try me, and see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in. I'll stand treat this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny Nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation, and was soon seated beside Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'll you have, Johnny?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Same as you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cup o' coffee and beefsteak," ordered Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These were promptly brought, and Johnny attacked them vigorously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, in the boot-blacking business, as well as in higher avocations, the same rule prevails, that energy and industry are rewarded, and indolence suffers. Dick was energetic and on the alert for business, but Johnny the reverse. The consequence was that Dick earned probably three times as much as the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you like it?" asked Dick, surveying Johnny's attacks upon the steak with evident complacency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's hunky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I don't believe "hunky" is to be found in either Webster's or Worcester's big dictionary; but boys will readily understand what it means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you come here often?" asked Johnny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Most every day. You'd better come too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't afford it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you'd ought to, then," said Dick. "What do you do I'd like to know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I don't get near as much as you, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well you might if you tried. I keep my eyes open,—that's the way I get jobs. You're lazy, that's what's the matter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge. Probably he felt the justice of it, and preferred to proceed with the breakfast, which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Breakfast over, Dick walked up to the desk, and settled the bill. Then, followed by Johnny, he went out into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going, Johnny?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up to Mr. Taylor's, on Spruce Street, to see if he don't want a shine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you work for him reg'lar?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Him and his partner wants a shine most every day. Where are you goin'?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down front of the Astor House. I guess I'll find some customers there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this moment Johnny started, and, dodging into an entry way, hid behind the door, considerably to Dick's surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter now?" asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has he gone?" asked Johnny, his voice betraying anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who gone, I'd like to know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That man in the brown coat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What of him. You ain't scared of him, are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he got me a place once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ever so far off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What if he did?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ran away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you like it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I had to get up too early. It was on a farm, and I had to get up at five to take care of the cows. I like New York best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't they give you enough to eat?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, plenty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you had a good bed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you'd better have stayed. You don't get either of them here. Where'd you sleep last night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up an alley in an old wagon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had a better bed than that in the country, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it was as soft as—as cotton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton, the recollection supplying him with a comparison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why didn't you stay?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I felt lonely," said Johnny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny could not exactly explain his feelings, but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets, though his food is uncertain, and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in, gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life, that he feels discontented in any other. He is accustomed to the noise and bustle and ever-varied life of the streets, and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city. He had a father living, but he might as well have been without one. Mr. Nolan was a confirmed drunkard, and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor. His potations made him ugly, and inflamed a temper never very sweet, working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that Johnny's life was in danger. Some months before, he had thrown a flat-iron at his son's head with such terrific force that unless Johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story. He fled the house, and from that time had not dared to re-enter it. Somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking, and he had set up in business on his own account. But he had not energy enough to succeed, as has already been stated, and I am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships, and suffered more than once from cold and hunger. Dick had befriended him more than once, and often given him a breakfast or dinner, as the case might be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How'd you get away?" asked Dick, with some curiosity. "Did you walk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I rode on the cars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where'd you get your money? I hope you didn't steal it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't have none."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got up about three o'clock, and walked to Albany."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's that?" asked Dick, whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up the river."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About a thousand miles," said Johnny, whose conceptions of distance were equally vague.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Go ahead. What did you do then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hid on top of a freight car, and came all the way without their seeing me. [26] That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place, and I'm afraid he'd want to send me back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Dick, reflectively, "I dunno as I'd like to live in the country. I couldn't go to Tony Pastor's or the Old Bowery. There wouldn't be no place to spend my evenings. But I say, it's tough in winter, Johnny, 'specially when your overcoat's at the tailor's, an' likely to stay there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so, Dick. But I must be goin', or Mr. Taylor'll get somebody else to shine his boots."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny walked back to Nassau Street, while Dick kept on his way to Broadway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy," soliloquized Dick, as Johnny took his departure, "ain't got no ambition. I'll bet he won't get five shines to-day. I'm glad I ain't like him. I couldn't go to the theatre, nor buy no cigars, nor get half as much as I wanted to eat.—Shine yer boots, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick always had an eye to business, and this remark was addressed to a young man, dressed in a stylish manner, who was swinging a jaunty cane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've had my boots blacked once already this morning, but this confounded mud has spoiled the shine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll make 'em all right, sir, in a minute."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go ahead, then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boots were soon polished in Dick's best style, which proved very satisfactory, our hero being a proficient in the art.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got any change," said the young man, fumbling in his pocket, "but here's a bill you may run somewhere and get changed. I'll pay you five cents extra for your trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He handed Dick a two-dollar bill, which our hero took into a store close by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you please change that, sir?" said Dick, walking up to the counter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill, and, slightly glancing at it, exclaimed angrily, "Be off, you young vagabond, or I'll have you arrested."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the row?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've offered me a counterfeit bill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know it," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't tell me. Be off, or I'll have you arrested."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[26] A fact.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III DICK MAKES A PROPOSITION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit, he stood his ground bravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Clear out of this shop, you young vagabond," repeated the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then give me back my bill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That you may pass it again? No, sir, I shall do no such thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It doesn't belong to me," said Dick. "A gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A likely story," said the clerk; but he seemed a little uneasy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go and call him," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went out, and found his late customer standing on the Astor House steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, youngster, have you brought back my change? You were a precious long time about it. I began to think you had cleared out with the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That ain't my style," said Dick, proudly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then where's the change?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's the bill then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got that either."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You young rascal!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on a minute, mister," said Dick, "and I'll tell you all about it. The man what took the bill said it wasn't good, and kept it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The bill was perfectly good. So he kept it, did he? I'll go with you to the store, and see whether he won't give it back to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick led the way, and the gentleman followed him into the store. At the reappearance of Dick in such company, the clerk flushed a little, and looked nervous. He fancied that he could browbeat a ragged boot-black, but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter. He did not seem to notice the newcomers, but began to replace some goods on the shelves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, said the young man, "point out the clerk that has my money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's him," said Dick, pointing out the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gentleman walked up to the counter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will trouble you," he said a little haughtily, "for a bill which that boy offered you, and which you still hold in your possession."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was a bad bill," said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his manner nervous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the matter be decided."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is the one he gave me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man looked doubtful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boy," he said to Dick, "is this the bill you gave to be changed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it isn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You lie, you young rascal!" exclaimed the clerk, who began to find himself in a tight place, and could not see the way out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store, and the proprietor walked up from the lower end, where he had been busy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's all this, Mr. Hatch?" he demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy," said the clerk, "came in and asked change for a bad bill. I kept the bill, and told him to clear out. Now he wants it again to pass on somebody else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Show the bill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The merchant looked at it. "Yes, that's a bad bill," he said. "There is no doubt about that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it is not the one the boy offered," said Dick's patron. "It is one of the same denomination, but on a different bank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you remember what bank it was on?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was on the Merchants' Bank of Boston."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may search me if you want to," said Dick, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He doesn't look as if he was likely to have any extra bills. I suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill, and has substituted the counterfeit note. It is a nice little scheme of his for making money "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't seen any bill on the Merchants' Bank," said the clerk, doggedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better feel in your pockets."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This matter must be investigated," said the merchant, firmly. "If you have the bill, produce it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got it," said the clerk; but he looked guilty notwithstanding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I demand that he be searched," said Dick's patron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tell you I haven't got it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I send for a police officer, Mr. Hatch, or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly?" said the merchant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alarmed at the threat implied in these words, the clerk put his hand into his vest-pocket, and drew out a two-dollar bill on the Merchants' Bank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this your note?" asked the shopkeeper, showing it to the young man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must have made a mistake," faltered the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ," said the merchant sternly. "You may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you. I shall have no further occasion for your services."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, youngster," said Dick's patron, as they went out of the store, after he had finally got the bill changed. "I must pay you something extra for your trouble. Here's fifty cents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir," said Dick. "You're very kind. Don't you want some more bills changed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not to-day," said he with a smile. "It's too expensive."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm in luck," thought our hero complacently. "I guess I'll go to Barnum's to-night, and see the bearded lady, the eight-foot giant, the two-foot dwarf, and the other curiosities, too numerous to mention."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the Astor House. He took his station on the sidewalk, and began to look about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just behind him were two persons,—one, a gentleman of fifty; the other, a boy of thirteen or fourteen. They were speaking together, and Dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry, Frank, that I can't go about, and show you some of the sights of New York, but I shall be full of business to-day. It is your first visit to the city, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's a good deal worth seeing here. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait to next time. You can go out and walk by yourself, but don't venture too far, or you will get lost."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked disappointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish Tom Miles knew I was here," he said. "He would go around with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where does he live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Somewhere up town, I believe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, unfortunately, he is not available. If you would rather go with me than stay here, you can, but as I shall be most of the time in merchants'-counting-rooms, I am afraid it would not be very interesting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think," said Frank, after a little hesitation, "that I will go off by myself. I won't go very far, and if I lose my way, I will inquire for the Astor House."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, anybody will direct you here. Very well, Frank, I am sorry I can't do better for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, never mind, uncle, I shall be amused in walking around, and looking at the shop-windows. There will be a great deal to see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Dick had listened to all this conversation. Being an enterprising young man, he thought he saw a chance for a speculation, and determined to avail himself of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as Frank's uncle was about leaving, and said, "I know all about the city, sir; I'll show him around, if you want me to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you are a city boy, are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Dick, "I've lived here ever since I was a baby."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you know all about the public buildings, I suppose?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And the Central Park?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. I know my way all round."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gentleman looked thoughtful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what to say, Frank," he remarked after a while. "It is rather a novel proposal. He isn't exactly the sort of guide I would have picked out for you. Still he looks honest. He has an open face, and I think can be depended upon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish he wasn't so ragged and dirty," said Frank, who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid you haven't washed your face this morning," said Mr. Whitney, for that was the gentleman's name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They didn't have no wash-bowls at the hotel where I stopped," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What hotel did you stop at?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Box Hotel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Box Hotel?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I slept in a box on Spruce Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank surveyed Dick curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you like it?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I slept bully."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose it had rained."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'd have wet my best clothes," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are these all the clothes you have?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Whitney spoke a few words to Frank, who seemed pleased with the suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Follow me, my lad," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick in some surprise obeyed orders, following Mr. Whitney and Frank into the hotel, past the office, to the foot of the staircase. Here a servant of the hotel stopped Dick, but Mr. Whitney explained that he had something for him to do, and he was allowed to proceed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They entered a long entry, and finally paused before a door. This being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in, my lad," said Mr. Whitney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick and Frank entered.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV DICK'S NEW SUIT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Mr. Whitney to Dick, "my nephew here is on his way to a boarding-school. He has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn. He is willing to give them to you. I think they will look better than those you have on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say. Presents were something that he knew very little about, never having received any to his knowledge. That so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clothes were brought out, and turned out to be a neat gray suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Before you put them on, my lad, you must wash yourself. Clean clothes and a dirty skin don't go very well together. Frank, you may attend to him. I am obliged to go at once. Have you got as much money as you require?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, uncle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One more word, my lad," said Mr. Whitney, addressing Dick; "I may be rash in trusting a boy of whom I know nothing, but I like your looks, and I think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I will, sir," said Dick, earnestly. "Honor bright!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well. A pleasant time to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The process of cleansing commenced. To tell the truth Dick needed it, and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant. Frank added to his gift a shirt, stockings, and an old pair of shoes. "I am sorry I haven't any cap," said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got one," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't so new as it might be," said Frank, surveying an old felt hat, which had once been black, but was now dingy, with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy, and I've kep' it ever since out of respect for his memory. But I'll get a new one now. I can buy one cheap on Chatham Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that near here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only five minutes' walk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we can get one on the way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick was dressed in his new attire, with his face and hands clean, and his hair brushed, it was difficult to imagine that he was the same boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He now looked quite handsome, and might readily have been taken for a young gentleman, except that his hands were red and grimy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look at yourself," said Frank, leading him before the mirror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By gracious!" said Dick, starting back in astonishment, "that isn't me, is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you know yourself?" asked Frank, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It reminds me of Cinderella," said Dick, "when she was changed into a fairy princess. I see it one night at Barnum's. What'll Johnny Nolan say when he sees me? He won't dare to speak to such a young swell as I be now. Ain't it rich?" and Dick burst into a loud laugh. His fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friend's surprise. Then the thought of the valuable gifts he had revived occurred to him, and he looked gratefully at Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a brick," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A brick! You're a jolly good fellow to give me such a present."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're quite welcome, Dick," said Frank, kindly. "I'm better off than you are, and I can spare the clothes just as well as not. You must have a new hat though. But that we can get when we go out. The old clothes you can make into a bundle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute till I get my handkercher," and Dick pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag, which might have been white once, though it did not look like it, and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mustn't carry that," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I've got a cold," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I don't mean you to go without a handkerchief. I'll give you one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank opened his trunk and pulled out two, which he gave to Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if I ain't dreamin'" said Dick, once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass. "I'm afraid I'm dreamin', and shall wake up in a barrel, as I did night afore last."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I pinch you so you can wake here?" asked Frank, playfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, seriously, "I wish you would."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket, and Frank pinched him pretty hard, so that Dick winced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I guess I'm awake," said Dick; "you've got a pair of nippers, you have. But what shall I do with my brush and blacking?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can leave them here till we come back," said Frank. "They will be safe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on a minute," said Dick, surveying Frank's boots with a professional eye, "you ain't got a good shine on them boots. I'll make 'em shine so you can see your face in 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he was as good as his word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Frank; "now you had better brush your own shoes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This had not occurred to Dick, for in general the professional boot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots, if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys now went downstairs together. They met the same servant who had spoken to Dick a few minutes before, but there was no recognition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He don't know me," said Dick. "He thinks I'm a young swell like you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's a swell?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, a feller that wears nobby clothes like you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you, too, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "who'd ever have thought as I should have turned into a swell?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had now got out on Broadway, and were slowly walking along the west side by the Park, when who should Dick see in front of him, but Johnny Nolan?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnny's amazement at his change in appearance. He stole up behind him, and struck him on the back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hallo, Johnny, how many shines have you had?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick, whose voice he recognized, but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick, but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What luck, Johnny?" repeated Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who be you?" he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's a good one," laughed Dick; "so you don't know Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where'd you get all them clothes?" asked Johnny. "Have you been stealin'?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say that again, and I'll lick you. No, I've lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin' to a party, and didn't have none fit to wear, and so I put on my second-best for a change."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without deigning any further explanation, Dick went off, followed by the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan, who could not quite make up his mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was really Ragged Dick or not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In order to reach Chatham Street it was necessary to cross Broadway. This was easier proposed than done. There is always such a throng of omnibuses, drays, carriages, and vehicles of all kinds in the neighborhood of the Astor House, that the crossing is formidable to one who is not used to it. Dick made nothing of it, dodging in and out among the horses and wagons with perfect self-possession. Reaching the opposite sidewalk, he looked back, and found that Frank had retreated in dismay, and that the width of the street was between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come across!" called out Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see any chance," said Frank, looking anxiously at the prospect before him. "I'm afraid of being run over."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are, you can sue 'em for damages," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finally Frank got safely over after several narrow escapes, as he considered them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it always so crowded?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A good deal worse sometimes," said Dick. "I knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross, and at last got run over by an omnibus, leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children. His widder, a beautiful young woman, was obliged to start a peanut and apple stand. There she is now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick pointed to a hideous old woman, of large proportions, wearing a bonnet of immense size, who presided over an apple-stand close by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If that is the case," he said, "I think I will patronize her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leave it to me," said Dick, winking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He advanced gravely to the apple-stand, and said, "Old lady, have you paid your taxes?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The astonished woman opened her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm a gov'ment officer," said Dick, "sent by the mayor to collect your taxes. I'll take it in apples just to oblige. That big red one will about pay what you're owin' to the gov'ment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know nothing about no taxes," said the old woman, in bewilderment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then," said Dick, "I'll let you off this time. Give us two of your best apples, and my friend here, the President of the Common Council, will pay you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank and Dick stand conversing with the woman who sells apples. In the foreground is a large basket containing apples. In the background a dense wood is pictured, the dome and spire of city hall in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank smiling, paid three cents apiece for the apples, and they sauntered on, Dick remarking, "If these apples ain't good, old lady, we'll return 'em, and get our money back." This would have been rather difficult in his case, as the apple was already half consumed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chatham Street, where they wished to go, being on the East side, the two boys crossed the Park. This is an enclosure of about ten acres, which years ago was covered with a green sward, but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings. Dick pointed out the City Hall, the Hall of Records, and the Rotunda. The former is a white building of large size, and surmounted by a cupola.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's where the mayor's office is," said Dick. "Him and me are very good friends. I once blacked his boots by partic'lar appointment. That's the way I pay my city taxes."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V CHATHAM STREET AND BROADWAY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were soon in Chatham Street, walking between rows of ready-made clothing shops, many of which had half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk. The proprietors of these establishments stood at the doors, watching attentively the passersby, extending urgent invitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Walk in, young gentlemen," said a stout man, at the entrance of one shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I thank you," replied Dick, "as the fly said to the spider."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're selling off at less than cost."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you be. That's where you makes your money," said Dick. "There ain't nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any profit on his goods."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Chatham Street trader looked after our hero as if he didn't quite comprehend him; but Dick, without waiting for a reply, passed on with his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am only offered two dollars, gentlemen, for this elegant pair of doeskin pants, made of the very best of cloth. It's a frightful sacrifice. Who'll give an eighth? Thank you, sir. Only seventeen shillings! Why the cloth cost more by the yard!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three men, holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in the legs, and presenting a cheap Bowery look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank and Dick paused before the shop door, and finally saw them knocked down to rather a verdant-looking individual at three dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Clothes seem to be pretty cheap here," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but Baxter Street is the cheapest place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Johnny Nolan got a whole rig-out there last week, for a dollar,—coat, cap, vest, pants, and shoes. They was very good measure, too, like my best clothes that I took off to oblige you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall know where to come for clothes next time," said Frank, laughing. "I had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country. I suppose the Baxter Street tailors are fashionable?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course they are. Me and Horace Greeley always go there for clothes. When Horace gets a new suit, I always have one made just like it; but I can't go the white hat. It ain't becomin' to my style of beauty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk, distributing small printed handbills. One was handed to Frank, which he read as follows,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"GRAND CLOSING-OUT SALE!—A variety of Beautiful and Costly Articles for Sale, at a Dollar apiece. Unparalleled Inducements! Walk in, Gentlemen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whereabouts is this sale?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In here, young gentlemen," said a black-whiskered individual, who appeared suddenly on the scene. "Walk in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall we go in, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a swindlin' shop," said Dick, in a low voice. "I've been there. That man's a regular cheat. He's seen me before, but he don't know me coz of my clothes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Step in and see the articles," said the man, persuasively. "You needn't buy, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are all the articles worth more'n a dollar?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said the other, "and some worth a great deal more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Such as what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, there's a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you sell it for a dollar. That's very kind of you," said Dick, innocently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Walk in, and you'll understand it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I guess not," said Dick. "My servants is so dishonest that I wouldn't like to trust 'em with a silver pitcher. Come along, Frank. I hope you'll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin' the public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they are worth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How does he manage, Dick?" asked Frank, as they went on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All his articles are numbered, and he makes you pay a dollar, and then shakes some dice, and whatever the figgers come to, is the number of the article you draw. Most of 'em ain't worth sixpence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A hat and cap store being close at hand, Dick and Frank went in. For seventy-five cents, which Frank insisted on paying, Dick succeeded in getting quite a neat-looking cap, which corresponded much better with his appearance than the one he had on. The last, not being considered worth keeping, Dick dropped on the sidewalk, from which, on looking back, he saw it picked up by a brother boot-black who appeared to consider it better than his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They retraced their steps and went up Chambers Street to Broadway. At the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street is a large white marble warehouse, which attracted Frank's attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What building is that?" he asked, with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That belongs to my friend A. T. Stewart," said Dick. "It's the biggest store on Broadway. [53] If I ever retire from boot-blackin', and go into mercantile pursuits, I may buy him out, or build another store that'll take the shine off this one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you ever in the store?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "but I'm intimate with one of Stewart's partners. He is a cash boy, and does nothing but take money all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A very agreeable employment," said Frank, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "I'd like to be in it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys crossed to the West side of Broadway, and walked slowly up the street. To Frank it was a very interesting spectacle. Accustomed to the quiet of the country, there was something fascinating in the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks, and the great variety of vehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street. Then again the shop-windows with their multifarious contents interested and amused him, and he was constantly checking Dick to look in at some well-stocked window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy of them," he said. "We haven't got but two stores in our village, and Broadway seems to be full of them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "and its pretty much the same in the avenoos, 'specially the Third, Sixth, and Eighth avenoos. The Bowery, too, is a great place for shoppin'. There everybody sells cheaper'n anybody else, and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's Barnum's Museum?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's down nearly opposite the Astor House," said Dick. "Didn't you see a great building with lots of flags?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's Barnum's. [55] That's where the Happy Family live, and the lions, and bears, and curiosities generally. It's a tip-top place. Haven't you ever been there? It's most as good as the Old Bowery, only the plays isn't quite so excitin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go if I get time," said Frank. "There is a boy at home who came to New York a month ago, and went to Barnum's, and has been talking about it ever since, so I suppose it must be worth seeing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They've got a great play at the Old Bowery now," pursued Dick. "'Tis called the `Demon of the Danube.' The Demon falls in love with a young woman, and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep rock where his castle stands."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a queer way of showing his love," said Frank, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She didn't want to go with him, you know, but was in love with another chap. When he heard about his girl bein' carried off, he felt awful, and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free. Well, at last he got into the castle by some underground passage, and he and the Demon had a fight. Oh, it was bully seein' 'em roll round on the stage, cuttin' and slashin' at each other."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And which got the best of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At first the Demon seemed to be ahead, but at last the young Baron got him down, and struck a dagger into his heart, sayin', `Die, false and perjured villain! The dogs shall feast upon thy carcass!' and then the Demon give an awful howl and died. Then the Baron seized his body, and threw it over the precipice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me the actor who plays the Demon ought to get extra pay, if he has to be treated that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," said Dick; "but I guess he's used to it. It seems to agree with his constitution."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What building is that?" asked Frank, pointing to a structure several rods back from the street, with a large yard in front. It was an unusual sight for Broadway, all the other buildings in that neighborhood being even with the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is the New York Hospital," said Dick. "They're a rich institution, and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever go in there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "there was a friend of mine, Johnny Mullen, he was a newsboy, got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin' Broadway down near Park Place. He was carried to the Hospital, and me and some of his friends paid his board while he was there. It was only three dollars a week, which was very cheap, considerin' all the care they took of him. I got leave to come and see him while he was here. Everything looked so nice and comfortable, that I thought a little of coaxin' a omnibus driver to run over me, so I might go there too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did your friend have to have his leg cut off?" asked Frank, interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "though there was a young student there that was very anxious to have it cut off; but it wasn't done, and Johnny is around the streets as well as ever."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this conversation was going on they reached No. 365, at the corner of Franklin Street. [58]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's Taylor's Saloon," said Dick. "When I come into a fortun' I shall take my meals there reg'lar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have heard of it very often," said Frank. "It is said to be very elegant. Suppose we go in and take an ice-cream. It will give us a chance to see it to better advantage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Dick; "I think that's the most agreeable way of seein' the place myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys entered, and found themselves in a spacious and elegant saloon, resplendent with gilding, and adorned on all sides by costly mirrors. They sat down to a small table with a marble top, and Frank gave the order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It reminds me of Aladdin's palace," said Frank, looking about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does it?" said Dick; "he must have had plenty of money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had an old lamp, which he had only to rub, when the Slave of the Lamp would appear, and do whatever he wanted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That must have been a valooable lamp. I'd be willin' to give all my Erie shares for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a tall, gaunt individual at the next table, who apparently heard this last remark of Dick's. Turning towards our hero, he said, "May I inquire, young man, whether you are largely interested in this Erie Railroad?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got no property except what's invested in Erie," said Dick, with a comical side-glance at Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! I suppose the investment was made by your guardian."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I manage my property myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I presume your dividends have not been large?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no," said Dick; "you're about right there. They haven't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As I supposed. It's poor stock. Now, my young friend, I can recommend a much better investment, which will yield you a large annual income. I am agent of the Excelsior Copper Mining Company, which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world. It's sure to yield fifty per cent. on the investment. Now, all you have to do is to sell out your Erie shares, and invest in our stock, and I'll insure you a fortune in three years. How many shares did you say you had?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't say, that I remember," said Dick. "Your offer is very kind and obligin', and as soon as I get time I'll see about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will," said the stranger. "Permit me to give you my card. `Samuel Snap, No.— Wall Street.' I shall be most happy to receive a call from you, and exhibit the maps of our mine. I should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends. I am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the stranger left the table, and walked up to the desk to settle his bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see what it is to be a man of fortun', Frank," said Dick, "and wear good clothes. I wonder what that chap'll say when he sees me blackin' boots to-morrow in the street?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does, after all," said Frank. "Some of these mining companies are nothing but swindles, got up to cheat people out of their money "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's welcome to all he gets out of me," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[53] Mr. Stewart's Tenth Street store was not open at the time Dick spoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since destroyed by fire, and rebuilt farther up Broadway, and again burned down in February.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI UP BROADWAY TO MADISON SQUARE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the boys pursued their way up Broadway, Dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement. Frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan Hotels, the former of white marble, the latter of a subdued brown hue, but not less elegant in its internal appointments. He was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right, and pointed out the Clinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library, comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes. [62]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues, and with one side on each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that building?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the Cooper Institute," said Dick; "built by Mr. Cooper, a particular friend of mine. Me and Peter Cooper used to go to school together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is there inside?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a hall for public meetin's and lectures in the basement, and a readin' room and a picture gallery up above," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Directly opposite Cooper Institute, Frank saw a very large building of brick, covering about an acre of ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that a hotel?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "that's the Bible House. It's the place where they make Bibles. I was in there once,—saw a big pile of 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever read the Bible?" asked Frank, who had some idea of the neglected state of Dick's education.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I've heard it's a good book, but I never read one. I ain't much on readin'. It makes my head ache."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you can't read very fast."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can read the little words pretty well, but the big ones is what stick me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I lived in the city, you might come every evening to me, and I would teach you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you take so much trouble about me?" asked Dick, earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly; I should like to see you getting on. There isn't much chance of that if you don't know how to read and write."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a good feller," said Dick, gratefully. "I wish you did live in New York. I'd like to knows omethin'. Whereabouts do you live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About fifty miles off, in a town on the left bank of the Hudson. I wish you'd come up and see me sometime. I would like to have you come and stop two or three days."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honor bright?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean it?" asked Dick, incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I do. Why shouldn't I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What would your folks say if they knowed you asked a boot-black to visit you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are none the worse for being a boot-black, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't used to genteel society," said Dick. "I shouldn't know how to behave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I could show you. You won't be a boot-black all your life, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I'm goin' to knock off when I get to be ninety."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Before that, I hope, said Frank, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I really wish I could get somethin' else to do," said Dick, soberly. "I'd like to be a office boy, and learn business, and grow up 'spectable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you try, and see if you can't get a place, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who'd take Ragged Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you ain't ragged now, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I look a little better than I did in my Washington coat and Louis Napoleon pants. But if I got in a office, they wouldn't give me more'n three dollars a week, and I couldn't live 'spectable on that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I suppose not," said Frank, thoughtfully. "But you would get more at the end of the first year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "but by that time I'd be nothin' but skin and bones."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank laughed. "That reminds me," he said, "of the story of an Irishman, who, out of economy, thought he would teach his horse to feed on shavings. So he provided the horse with a pair of green spectacles which made the shavings look eatable. But unfortunately, just as the horse got learned, he up and died."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur' by the time he got through," remarked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whereabouts are we now?" asked Frank, as they emerged from Fourth Avenue into Union Square.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is Union Park," said Dick, pointing to a beautiful enclosure, in the centre of which was a pond, with a fountain playing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that the statue of General Washington?" asked Frank, pointing to a bronze equestrian statue, on a granite pedestal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "he's growed some since he was President. If he'd been as tall as that when he fit in the Revolution, he'd have walloped the Britishers some, I reckon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked up at the statue, which is fourteen and a half feet high, and acknowledged the justice of Dick's remark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How about the coat, Dick?" he asked. "Would it fit you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it might be rather loose," said Dick, "I ain't much more'n ten feet high with my boots off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I should think not," said Frank, smiling. "You're a queer boy, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I've been brought up queer. Some boys is born with a silver spoon in their mouth. Victoria's boys is born with a gold spoon, set with di'monds; but gold and silver was scarce when I was born, and mine was pewter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by, Dick. Did you ever hear of Dick Whittington?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never did. Was he a Ragged Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't wonder if he was. At any rate he was very poor when he was a boy, but he didn't stay so. Before he died, he became Lord Mayor of London."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he?" asked Dick, looking interested. "How did he do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you see, a rich merchant took pity on him, and gave him a home in his own house, where he used to stay with the servants, being employed in little errands. One day the merchant noticed Dick picking up pins and needles that had been dropped, and asked him why he did it. Dick told him he was going to sell them when he got enough. The merchant was pleased with his saving disposition, and when soon after, he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts, he told Dick he might send anything he pleased in it, and it should be sold to his advantage. Now Dick had nothing in the world but a kitten which had been given him a short time before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much taxes did he have to pay on it?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not very high, probably. But having only the kitten, he concluded to send it along. After sailing a good many months, during which the kitten grew up to be a strong cat, the ship touched at an island never before known, which happened to be infested with rats and mice to such an extent that they worried everybody's life out, and even ransacked the king's palace. To make a long story short, the captain, seeing how matters stood, brought Dick's cat ashore, and she soon made the rats and mice scatter. The king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice, and resolved to have her at any price. So he offered a great quantity of gold for her, which, of course, the captain was glad to accept. It was faithfully carried back to Dick, and laid the foundation of his fortune. He prospered as he grew up, and in time became a very rich merchant, respected by all, and before he died was elected Lord Mayor of London."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a pretty good story" said Dick; "but I don't believe all the cats in New York will ever make me mayor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, probably not, but you may rise in some other way. A good many distinguished men have once been poor boys. There's hope for you, Dick, if you'll try."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody ever talked to me so before," said Dick. "They just called me Ragged Dick, and told me I'd grow up to be a vagabone (boys who are better educated need not be surprised at Dick's blunders) and come to the gallows."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Telling you so won't make it turn out so, Dick. If you'll try to be somebody, and grow up into a respectable member of society, you will. You may not become rich,—it isn't everybody that becomes rich, you know—but you can obtain a good position, and be respected."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try," said Dick, earnestly. "I needn't have been Ragged Dick so long if I hadn't spent my money in goin' to the theatre, and treatin' boys to oyster-stews, and bettin' money on cards, and such like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you lost money that way?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lots of it. One time I saved up five dollars to buy me a new rig-out, cos my best suit was all in rags, when Limpy Jim wanted me to play a game with him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Limpy Jim?" said Frank, interrogatively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he's lame; that's what makes us call him Limpy Jim."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you lost?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I lost every penny, and had to sleep out, cos I hadn't a cent to pay for lodgin'. 'Twas a awful cold night, and I got most froze."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't Jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I axed him for five cents, but he wouldn't let me have it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you get lodging for five cents?" asked Frank, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "but not at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. That's it right out there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[62] Now not far from one hundred thousand.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII THE POCKET-BOOK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had reached the junction of Broadway and of Fifth Avenue. Before them was a beautiful park of ten acres. On the left-hand side was a large marble building, presenting a fine appearance with its extensive white front. This was the building at which Dick pointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that the Fifth Avenue Hotel?" asked Frank. "I've heard of it often. My Uncle William always stops there when he comes to New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I once slept on the outside of it," said Dick. "They was very reasonable in their charges, and told me I might come again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps sometime you'll be able to sleep inside," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess that'll be when Queen Victoria goes to the Five Points to live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks like a palace," said Frank. "The queen needn't be ashamed to live in such a beautiful building as that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Frank did not know it, one of the queen's palaces is far from being as fine a looking building as the Fifth Avenue Hotel. St. James' Palace is a very ugly-looking brick structure, and appears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty. There are few hotels in the world as fine-looking as this democratic institution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk, who looked back at Dick, as if his face seemed familiar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that man," said Dick, after he had passed. "He's one of my customers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is his name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He looked back as if he thought he knew you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He would have knowed me at once if it hadn't been for my new clothes," said Dick. "I don't look much like Ragged Dick now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose your face looked familiar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All but the dirt," said Dick, laughing. "I don't always have the chance of washing my face and hands in the Astor House."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You told me," said Frank, "that there was a place where you could get lodging for five cents. Where's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the News-boys' Lodgin' House, on Fulton Street," said Dick, "up over the `Sun' office. It's a good place. I don't know what us boys would do without it. They give you supper for six cents, and a bed for five cents more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose some boys don't even have the five cents to pay,— do they?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They'll trust the boys," said Dick. "But I don't like to get trusted. I'd be ashamed to get trusted for five cents, or ten either. One night I was comin' down Chatham Street, with fifty cents in my pocket. I was goin' to get a good oyster-stew, and then go to the lodgin' house; but somehow it slipped through a hole in my trowses-pocket, and I hadn't a cent left. If it had been summer I shouldn't have cared, but it's rather tough stayin' out winter nights."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank, who had always possessed a good home of his own, found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home, or money to procure the common comfort of a bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do?" he asked, his voice full of sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I went to the `Times' office. I knowed one of the pressmen, and he let me set down in a corner , where I was warm, and I soon got fast asleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you get a room somewhere, and so always have a home to go to?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dunno," said Dick. "I never thought of it. P'rhaps I may hire a furnished house on Madison Square."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's where Flora McFlimsey lived."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know her," said Dick, who had never read the popular poem of which she is the heroine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this conversation was going on, they had turned into Twenty-fifth Street, and had by this time reached Third Avenue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just before entering it, their attention was drawn to the rather singular conduct of an individual in front of them. Stopping suddenly, he appeared to A street scene of Frank, Dick, and the man who found the wallet. Frank and Dick admiringly look on as the man shows it to them. By their gestures they appear to be discussing the find. pick up something from the sidewalk, and then looked about him in rather a confused way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know his game," whispered Dick. "Come along and you'll see what it is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hurried Frank forward until they overtook the man, who had come to a stand-still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you found anything?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said the man, "I've found this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills, to judge from its plethoric appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whew!" exclaimed Dick; "you're in luck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose somebody has lost it," said the man, "and will offer a handsome reward."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which you'll get."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Unfortunately I am obliged to take the next train to Boston. That's where I live. I haven't time to hunt up the owner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I suppose you'll take the pocket-book with you," said Dick, with assumed simplicity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it returned to the owner," said the man, glancing at the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm honest," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've no doubt of it," said the other. "Well, young man, "I'll make you an offer. You take the pocket-book—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Hand it over, then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute. There must be a large sum inside. I shouldn't wonder if there might be a thousand dollars. The owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you stay and get it?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would, only there is sickness in my family, and I must get home as soon as possible. Just give me twenty dollars, and I'll hand you the pocket-book, and let you make whatever you can out of it. Come, that's a good offer. What do you say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was well dressed, so that the other did not regard it as at all improbable that he might possess that sum. He was prepared, however, to let him have it for less, if necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Twenty dollars is a good deal of money," said Dick, appearing to hesitate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll get it back, and a good deal more," said the stranger, persuasively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but I shall. What would you do, Frank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but I would," said Frank, "if you've got the money." He was not a little surprised to think that Dick had so much by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but I will," said Dick, after some irresolution. "I guess I won't lose much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't lose anything," said the stranger briskly. "Only be quick, for I must be on my way to the cars. I am afraid I shall miss them now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick pulled out a bill from his pocket, and handed it to the stranger, receiving the pocket-book in return. At that moment a policeman turned the corner, and the stranger, hurriedly thrusting the bill into his pocket, without looking at it, made off with rapid steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is there in the pocket-book, Dick?" asked Frank in some excitement. "I hope there's enough to pay you for the money you gave him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll risk that," said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you gave him twenty dollars. That's a good deal of money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I had given him as much as that, I should deserve to be cheated out of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you did,—didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He thought so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was it, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was nothing but a dry-goods circular got up to imitate a bank-bill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked sober.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought not to have cheated him, Dick," he said, reproachfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't he want to cheat me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you s'pose there is in that pocket-book?" asked Dick, holding it up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank surveyed its ample proportions, and answered sincerely enough, "Money, and a good deal of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain't stamps enough in it to buy a oyster-stew" said Dick. "If you don't believe it, just look while I open it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying he opened the pocket-book, and showed Frank that it was stuffed out with pieces of blank paper, carefully folded up in the shape of bills. Frank, who was unused to city life, and had never heard anything of the "drop-game" looked amazed at this unexpected development.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knowed how it was all the time," said Dick. "I guess I got the best of him there. This wallet's worth somethin'. I shall use it to keep my stiffkit's of Erie stock in, and all my other papers what ain't of no use to anybody but the owner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the kind of papers it's got in it now," said Frank, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so!" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By hokey!" he exclaimed suddenly, "if there ain't the old chap comin' back ag'in. He looks as if he'd heard bad news from his sick family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the pocket-book dropper had come up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Approaching the boys, he said in an undertone to Dick, "Give me back that pocket-book, you young rascal!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beg your pardon, mister," said Dick, "but was you addressin' me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Cause you called me by the wrong name. I've knowed some rascals, but I ain't the honor to belong to the family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked significantly at the other as he spoke, which didn't improve the man's temper. Accustomed to swindle others, he did not fancy being practised upon in return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give me back that pocket-book," he repeated in a threatening voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Couldn't do it," said Dick, coolly. "I'm go'n' to restore it to the owner. The contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick, and he'll be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You gave me a bogus bill," said the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's what I use myself," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've swindled me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought it was the other way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None of your nonsense," said the man angrily. "If you don't give up that pocket-book, I'll call a policeman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would," said Dick. "They'll know most likely whether it's Stewart or Astor that's lost the pocket-book, and I can get 'em to return it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "dropper," whose object it was to recover the pocket-book, in order to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer, was irritated by Dick's refusal, and above all by the coolness he displayed. He resolved to make one more attempt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you want to pass the night in the Tombs?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you for your very obligin' proposal," said Dick; "but it ain't convenient to-day. Any other time, when you'd like to have me come and stop with you, I'm agreeable; but my two youngest children is down with the measles, and I expect I'll have to set up all night to take care of 'em. Is the Tombs, in gineral, a pleasant place of residence?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that Frank could scarcely forbear laughing, though it is hardly necessary to say that the dropper was by no means so inclined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll know sometime," he said, scowling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll make you a fair offer" said Dick. "If I get more'n fifty dollars as a reward for my honesty, I'll divide with you. But I say, ain't it most time to go back to your sick family in Boston?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finding that nothing was to be made out of Dick, the man strode away with a muttered curse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were too smart for him, Dick," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "I ain't knocked round the city streets all my life for nothin'."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII DICK'S EARLY HISTORY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you always lived in New York, Dick?" asked Frank, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ever since I can remember."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you'd tell me a little about yourself. Have you got any father or mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't got no mother. She died when I wasn't but three years old. My father went to sea; but he went off before mother died, and nothin' was ever heard of him. I expect he got wrecked, or died at sea."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what became of you when your mother died?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The folks she boarded with took care of me, but they was poor, and they couldn't do much. When I was seven the woman died, and her husband went out West, and then I had to scratch for myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At seven years old!" exclaimed Frank, in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "I was a little feller to take care of myself, but," he continued with pardonable pride, "I did it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What could you do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sometimes one thing, and sometimes another," said Dick. "I changed my business accordin' as I had to. Sometimes I was a newsboy, and diffused intelligence among the masses, as I heard somebody say once in a big speech he made in the Park. Them was the times when Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett made money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Through your enterprise?" suggested Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "but I give it up after a while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, they didn't always put news enough in their papers, and people wouldn't buy 'em as fast as I wanted 'em to. So one mornin' I was stuck on a lot of Heralds, and I thought I'd make a sensation. So I called out `GREAT NEWS! QUEEN VICTORIA ASSASSINATED!' All my Heralds went off like hot cakes, and I went off, too, but one of the gentlemen what got sold remembered me, and said he'd have me took up, and that's what made me change my business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That wasn't right, Dick," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it," said Dick; "but lots of boys does it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That don't make it any better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick, "I was sort of ashamed at the time, 'specially about one poor old gentleman,—a Englishman he was. He couldn't help cryin' to think the queen was dead, and his hands shook when he handed me the money for the paper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do next?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I went into the match business," said Dick; "but it was small sales and small profits. Most of the people I called on had just laid in a stock, and didn't want to buy. So one cold night, when I hadn't money enough to pay for a lodgin', I burned the last of my matches to keep me from freezin'. But it cost too much to get warm that way, and I couldn't keep it up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've seen hard times, Dick," said Frank, compassionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "I've knowed what it was to be hungry and cold, with nothin' to eat or to warm me; but there's one thing I never could do," he added, proudly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never stole," said Dick. "It's mean and I wouldn't do it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you ever tempted to?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lots of times. Once I had been goin' round all day, and hadn't sold any matches, except three cents' worth early in the mornin'. With that I bought an apple, thinkin' I should get some more bimeby. When evenin' come I was awful hungry. I went into a baker's just to look at the bread. It made me feel kind o' good just to look at the bread and cakes, and I thought maybe they would give me some. I asked 'em wouldn't they give me a loaf, and take their pay in matches. But they said they'd got enough matches to last three months; so there wasn't any chance for a trade. While I was standin' at the stove warmin' me, the baker went into a back room, and I felt so hungry I thought I would take just one loaf, and go off with it. There was such a big pile I don't think he'd have known it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you didn't do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I didn't and I was glad of it, for when the man came in ag'in, he said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in St. Mark's Place. His boy was sick, and he hadn't no one to send; so he told me he'd give me ten cents if I would go. My business wasn't very pressin' just then, so I went, and when I come back, I took my pay in bread and cakes. Didn't they taste good, though?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you didn't stay long in the match business, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I couldn't sell enough to make it pay. Then there was some folks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them; so I couldn't make any profit. There was one old lady—she was rich, too, for she lived in a big brick house—beat me down so, that I didn't make no profit at all; but she wouldn't buy without, and I hadn't sold none that day; so I let her have them. I don't see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a good deal of meanness in the world, I'm afraid, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If everybody was like you and your uncle," said Dick, "there would be some chance for poor people. If I was rich I'd try to help 'em along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you will be rich sometime, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid all my wallets will be like this," said Dick, indicating the one he had received from the dropper, "and will be full of papers what ain't of no use to anybody except the owner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That depends very much on yourself, Dick," said Frank. "Stewart wasn't always rich, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wasn't he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When he first came to New York as a young man he was a teacher, and teachers are not generally very rich. At last he went into business, starting in a small way, and worked his way up by degrees. But there was one thing he determined in the beginning: that he would be strictly honorable in all his dealings, and never overreach any one for the sake of making money. If there was a chance for him, Dick, there is a chance for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He knowed enough to be a teacher, and I'm awful ignorant," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you needn't stay so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can I help it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you learn at school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't go to school 'cause I've got my livin' to earn. It wouldn't do me much good if I learned to read and write, and just as I'd got learned I starved to death."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But are there no night-schools?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you go? I suppose you don't work in the evenings."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never cared much about it," said Dick, "and that's the truth. But since I've got to talkin' with you, I think more about it. I guess I'll begin to go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would, Dick. You'll make a smart man if you only get a little education."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think so?" asked Dick, doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know so. A boy who has earned his own living since he was seven years old must have something in him. I feel very much interested in you, Dick. You've had a hard time of it so far in life, but I think better times are in store. I want you to do well, and I feel sure you can if you only try."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a good fellow," said Dick, gratefully. "I'm afraid I'm a pretty rough customer, but I ain't as bad as some. I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up 'spectable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There've been a great many boys begin as low down as you, Dick, that have grown up respectable and honored. But they had to work pretty hard for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm willin' to work hard," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you must not only work hard, but work in the right way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the right way?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You began in the right way when you determined never to steal, or do anything mean or dishonorable, however strongly tempted to do so. That will make people have confidence in you when they come to know you. But, in order to succeed well, you must manage to get as good an education as you can. Until you do, you cannot get a position in an office or counting-room, even to run errands."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," said Dick, soberly. "I never thought how awful ignorant I was till now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That can be remedied with perseverance," said Frank. "A year will do a great deal for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go to work and see what I can do," said Dick, energetically.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX A SCENE IN A THlRD AVENUE CAR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys had turned into Third Avenue, a long street, which, commencing just below tbe Cooper Institute, runs out to Harlem. A man came out of a side street, uttering at intervals a monotonous cry which sounded like "glass puddin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glass pudding!" repeated Frank, looking in surprised wonder at Dick. "What does he mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you'd like some," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never heard of it before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you ask him what he charges for his puddin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank looked more narrowly at the man, and soon concluded that he was a glazier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I understand," he said. "He means `glass put in.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank's mistake was not a singular one. The monotonous cry of these men certainly sounds more like "glass puddin'," than the words they intend to utter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Dick, "where shall we go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to see Central Park," said Frank. "Is it far off?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is about a mile and a half from here," said Dick. "This is Twenty-ninth Street, and the Park begins at Fifty-ninth Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may be explained, for the benefit of readers who have never visited New York, that about a mile from the City Hall the cross-streets begin to be numbered in regular order. There is a continuous line of houses as far as One Hundred and Thirtieth Street, where may be found the terminus of the Harlem line of horse-cars. When the entire island is laid out and settled, probably the numbers will reach two hundred or more. Central Park, which lies between Fifty-ninth Street on the south, and One Hundred and Tenth Street on the north, is true to its name, occupying about the centre of the island. The distance between two parallel streets is called a block, and twenty blocks make a mile. It will therefore be seen that Dick was exactly right, when he said they were a mile and a half from Central Park.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is too far to walk," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Twon't cost but six cents to ride," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean in the horse-cars?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right then. We'll jump aboard the next car."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Third Avenue and Harlem line of horse-cars is better patronized than any other in New York, though not much can be said for the cars, which are usually dirty and overcrowded. Still, when it is considered that only seven cents are charged for the entire distance to Harlem, about seven miles from the City Hall, the fare can hardly be complained of. But of course most of the profit is made from the way-passengers who only ride a short distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A car was at that moment approaching, but it seemed pretty crowded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall we take that, or wait for another?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The next'll most likely be as bad," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys accordingly signalled to the conductor to stop, and got on the front platform. They were obliged to stand up till the car reached Fortieth Street, when so many of the passengers had got off that they obtained seats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank sat down beside a middle-aged woman, or lady, as she probably called herself, whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to promise a very pleasant disposition. When the two gentlemen who sat beside her arose, she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two seats. Disregarding this, the boys sat down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain 't room for two," she said, looking sourly at Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There were two here before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, there ought not to have been. Some people like to crowd in where they're not wanted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And some like to take up a double allowance of room," thought Frank; but he did not say so. He saw that the woman had a bad temper, and thought it wisest to say nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank had never ridden up the city as far as this, and it was with much interest that he looked out of the car windows at the stores on either side. Third Avenue is a broad street, but in the character of its houses and stores it is quite inferior to Broadway, though better than some of the avenues further east. Fifth Avenue, as most of my readers already know, is the finest street in the city, being lined with splendid private residences, occupied by the wealthier classes. Many of the cross streets also boast houses which may be considered palaces, so elegant are they externally and internally. Frank caught glimpses of some of these as he was carried towards the Park.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the first conversation, already mentioned, with the lady at his side, he supposed he should have nothing further to do with her. But in this he was mistaken. While he was busy looking out of the car window, she plunged her hand into her pocket in search of her purse, which she was unable to find. Instantly she jumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen, and her suspicions fastened upon Frank, with whom she was already provoked for "crowding her," as she termed it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Conductor!" she exclaimed in a sharp voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's wanted, ma'am?" returned that functionary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want you to come here right off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My purse has been stolen. There was four dollars and eighty cents in it. I know, because I counted it when I paid my fare."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who stole it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy," she said pointing to Frank, who listened to the charge in the most intense astonishment. "He crowded in here on purpose to rob me, and I want you to search him right off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a lie!" exclaimed Dick, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you're in league with him, I dare say," said the woman spitefully. "You're as bad as he is, I'll be bound."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a nice female, you be!" said Dick, ironically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare to call me a female, sir," said the lady, furiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you ain't a man in disguise, be you?" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very much mistaken, madam," said Frank, quietly. "The conductor may search me, if you desire it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A charge of theft, made in a crowded car, of course made quite a sensation. Cautious passengers instinctively put their hands on their pockets, to make sure that they, too, had not been robbed. As for Frank, his face flushed, and he felt very indignant that he should even be suspected of so mean a crime. He had been carefully brought up, and been taught to regard stealing as low and wicked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick, on the contrary, thought it a capital joke that such a charge should have been made against his companion. Though he had brought himself up, and known plenty of boys and men, too, who would steal, he had never done so himself. He thought it mean. But he could not be expected to regard it as Frank did. He had been too familiar with it in others to look upon it with horror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile the passengers rather sided with the boys. Appearances go a great ways, and Frank did not look like a thief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think you must be mistaken, madam," said a gentleman sitting opposite. "The lad does not look as if he would steal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't tell by looks," said the lady, sourly. "They're deceitful; villains are generally well dressed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be they?" said Dick. "You'd ought to see me with my Washington coat on. You'd think I was the biggest villain ever you saw."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've no doubt you are," said the lady, scowling in the direction of our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, ma'am," said Dick. "'Tisn't often I get such fine compliments."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None of your impudence," said the lady, wrathfully. "I believe you're the worst of the two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile the car had been stopped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long are we going to stop here?" demanded a passenger, impatiently. "I'm in a hurry, if none of the rest of you are."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want my pocket-book," said the lady, defiantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ma'am, I haven't got it, and I don't see as it's doing you any good detaining us all here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Conductor, will you call a policeman to search that young scamp?" continued the aggrieved lady. "You don't expect I'm going to lose my money, and do nothing about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll turn my pockets inside out if you want me to," said Frank, proudly. "There's no need of a policeman. The conductor, or any one else, may search me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, youngster," said the conductor, "if the lady agrees, I'll search you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lady signified her assent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank accordingly turned his pockets inside out, but nothing was revealed except his own porte-monnaie and a penknife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ma'am, are you satisfied?" asked the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I ain't," said she, decidedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't think he's got it still?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but he's passed it over to his confederate, that boy there that's so full of impudence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's me," said Dick, comically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He confesses it," said the lady; "I want him searched."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Dick, "I'm ready for the operation, only, as I've got valooable property about me, be careful not to drop any of my Erie Bonds."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conductor's hand forthwith dove into Dick's pocket, and drew out a rusty jack-knife, a battered cent, about fifty cents in change, and the capacious pocket-book which he had received from the swindler who was anxious to get back to his sick family in Boston.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that yours, ma'am?" asked the conductor, holding up the wallet which excited some amazement, by its size, among the other passengers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me you carry a large pocket-book for a young man of your age," said the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I carry my cash and valooable papers in," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that isn't yours, ma'am," said the conductor, turning to the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said she, scornfully. "I wouldn't carry round such a great wallet as that. Most likely he's stolen it from somebody else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a prime detective you'd be!" said Dick. "P'rhaps you know who I took it from."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but my money's in it," said the lady , sharply. "Conductor, will you open that wallet, and see what there is in it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't disturb the valooable papers," said Dick, in a tone of pretended anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The contents of the wallet excited some amusement among the passengers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There don't seem to be much money here," said the conductor, taking out a roll of tissue paper cut out in the shape of bills, and rolled up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "Didn't I tell you them were papers of no valoo to anybody but the owner? If the lady'd like to borrow, I won't charge no interest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is my money, then?" said the lady, in some discomfiture. "I shouldn't wonder if one of the young scamps had thrown it out of the window."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better search your pocket once more," said the gentleman opposite. "I don't believe either of the boys is in fault. They don't look to me as if they would steal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir" said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lady followed out the suggestion, and, plunging her hand once more into her pocket, drew out a small porte-monnaie. She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry at this discovery. It placed her in rather an awkward position after the fuss she had made, and the detention to which she had subjected the passengers, now, as it proved, for nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that the pocket-book you thought stolen?" asked the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said she, rather confusedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you've been keeping me waiting all this time for nothing," he said, sharply. "I wish you'd take care to be sure next time before you make such a disturbance for nothing. I've lost five minutes, and shall not be on time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't help it," was the cross reply; "I didn't know it was in my pocket."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me you owe an apology to the boys you accused of a theft which they have not committed," said the gentleman opposite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shan't apologize to anybody," said the lady, whose temper was not of the best; "least of all to such whipper-snappers as they are."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, ma'am," said Dick, comically; "your handsome apology is accepted. It ain't of no consequence, only I didn't like to expose the contents of my valooable pocket-book, for fear it might excite the envy of some of my poor neighbors."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a character," said the gentleman who had already spoken, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A bad character!" muttered the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were against the lady, and on the side of the boys who had been falsely accused, while Dick's drollery had created considerable amusement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cars had now reached Fifty-ninth Street, the southern boundary of the Park, and here our hero and his companion got off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better look out for pickpockets, my lad," said the conductor, pleasantly. "That big wallet of yours might prove a great temptation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," said Dick. "That's the misfortin' of being rich. Astor and me don't sleep much for fear of burglars breakin' in and robbin' us of our valooable treasures. Sometimes I think I'll give all my money to an Orphan Asylum, and take it out in board. I guess I'd make money by the operation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Dick was speaking, the car rolled away, and the boys turned up Fifty-ninth Street, for two long blocks yet separated them from the Park.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X INTRODUCES A VICTIM OF MISPLACED CONFIDENCE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a queer chap you are, Dick!" said Frank, laughing. "You always seem to be in good spirits."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I ain't always. Sometimes I have the blues."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, once last winter it was awful cold, and there was big holes in my shoes, and my gloves and all my warm clothes was at the tailor's. I felt as if life was sort of tough, and I'd like it if some rich man would adopt me, and give me plenty to eat and drink and wear, without my havin' to look so sharp after it. Then agin' when I've seen boys with good homes, and fathers, and mothers, I've thought I'd like to have somebody to care for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick's tone changed as he said this, from his usual levity, and there was a touch of sadness in it. Frank, blessed with a good home and indulgent parents, could not help pitying the friendless boy who had found life such up-hill work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't say you have no one to care for you, Dick," he said, lightly laying his hand on Dick's shoulder. "I will care for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you will let me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would," said Dick, earnestly. "I'd like to feel that I have one friend who cares for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Central Park was now before them, but it was far from presenting the appearance which it now exhibits. It had not been long since work had been commenced upon it, and it was still very rough and unfinished. A rough tract of land, two miles and a half from north to south, and a half a mile broad, very rocky in parts, was the material from which the Park Commissioners have made the present beautiful enclosure. There were no houses of good appearance near it, buildings being limited mainly to rude temporary huts used by the workmen who were employed in improving it. The time will undoubtedly come when the Park will be surrounded by elegant residences, and compare favorably in this respect with the most attractive parts of any city in the world. But at the time when Frank and Dick visited it, not much could be said in favor either of the Park or its neighborhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If this is Central Park," said Frank, who naturally felt disappointed, "I don't think much of it. My father's got a large pasture that is much nicer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It'll look better some time," said Dick. "There ain't much to see now but rocks. We will take a walk over it if you want to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Frank, "I've seen as much of it as I want to. Besides, I feel tired."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we'll go back. We can take the Sixth Avenue cars. They will bring us out at Vesey Street just beside the Astor House."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Frank. "That will be the best course. I hope," he added, laughing, "our agreeable lady friend won't be there. I don't care about being accused of stealing again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She was a tough one," said Dick. "Wouldn't she make a nice wife for a man that likes to live in hot water, and didn't mind bein' scalded two or three times a day?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I think she'd just suit him. Is that the right car, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, jump in, and I'll follow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sixth Avenue is lined with stores, many of them of very good appearance, and would make a very respectable principal street for a good-sized city. But it is only one of several long business streets which run up the island, and illustrate the extent and importance of the city to which they belong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No incidents worth mentioning took place during their ride down town. In about three-quarters of an hour the boys got out of the car beside the Astor House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you goin' in now, Frank?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That depends upon whether you have anything else to show me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't you like to go to Wall Street?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the street where there are so many bankers and brokers,—isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I s'pose you ain't afraid of bulls and bears,—are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bulls and bears?" repeated Frank, puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are they?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The bulls is what tries to make the stocks go up, and the bears is what try to growl 'em down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I see. Yes, I'd like to go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly they walked down on the west side of Broadway as far as Trinity Church, and then, crossing, entered a street not very wide or very long, but of very great importance. The reader would be astonished if he could know the amount of money involved in the transactions which take place in a single day in this street. It would be found that although Broadway is much seater in length, and lined with stores, it stands second to Wall Street in this respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that large marble building?" asked Frank, pointing to a massive structure on the corner of Wall and Nassau Streets. It was in the form of a parallelogram, two hundred feet long by ninety wide, and about eighty feet in height, the ascent to the entrance being by eighteen granite steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the Custom House," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks like pictures I've seen of the Parthenon at Athens," said Frank, meditatively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's Athens?" asked Dick. "It ain't in York State,—is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not the Athens I mean, at any rate. It is in Greece, and was a famous city two thousand years ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's longer than I can remember," said Dick. "I can't remember distinctly more'n about a thousand years."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a chap you are, Dick! Do you know if we can go in?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys ascertained, after a little inquiry, that they would be allowed to do so. They accordingly entered the Custom House and made their way up to the roof, from which they had a fine view of the harbor, the wharves crowded with shipping, and the neighboring shores of Long Island and New Jersey. Towards the north they looked down for many miles upon continuous lines of streets, and thousands of roofs, with here and there a church-spire rising above its neighbors. Dick had never before been up there, and he, as well as Frank, was interested in the grand view spread before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length they descended, and were going down the granite steps on the outside of the building, when they were addressed by a young man, whose appearance is worth describing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was tall, and rather loosely put together, with small eyes and rather a prominent nose. His clothing had evidently not been furnished by a city tailor. He wore a blue coat with brass buttons, and pantaloons of rather scanty dimensions, which were several inches too short to cover his lower limbs. He held in his hand a piece of paper, and his countenance wore a look of mingled bewilderment and anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be they a-payin' out money inside there?" he asked, indicating the interior by a motion of his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess so," said Dick. "Are you a-goin' in for some?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, yes. I've got an order here for sixty dollars,—made a kind of speculation this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How was it?" asked Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, you see I brought down some money to put in the bank, fifty dollars it was, and I hadn't justly made up my mind what bank to put it into, when a chap came up in a terrible hurry, and said it was very unfortunate, but the bank wasn't open, and he must have some money right off. He was obliged to go out of the city by the next train. I asked him how much he wanted. He said fifty dollars. I told him I'd got that, and he offered me a check on the bank for sixty, and I let him have it. I thought that was a pretty easy way to earn ten dollars, so I counted out the money and he went off. He told me I'd hear a bell ring when they began to pay out money. But I've waited most two hours, and I hain't heard it yet. I'd ought to be goin', for I told dad I'd be home to-night. Do you think I can get the money now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you show me the check?" asked Frank, who had listened attentively to the countryman's story, and suspected that he had been made the victim of a swindler. It was made out upon the "Washington Bank," in the sum of sixty dollars, and was signed "Ephraim Smith."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Washington Bank!" repeated Frank. "Dick, is there such a bank in the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not as I knows on," said Dick. "Leastways I don't own any shares in it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't this the Washington Bank?" asked the countryman, pointing to the building on the steps of which the three were now standing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it's the Custom House."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And won't they give me any money for this?" asked the young man, the perspiration standing on his brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid the man who gave it to you was a swindler," said Frank, gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And won't I ever see my fifty dollars again?" asked the youth in agony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'll dad say?" ejaculated the miserable youth. "It makes me feel sick to think of it. I wish I had the feller here. I'd shake him out of his boots."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did he look like? I'll call a policeman and you shall describe him. Perhaps in that way you can get track of your money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick called a policeman, who listened to the description, and recognized the operator as an experienced swindler. He assured the countryman that there was very little chance of his ever seeing his money again. The boys left the miserable youth loudly bewailing his bad luck, and proceeded on their way down the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a baby," said Dick, contemptuously. "He'd ought to know how to take care of himself and his money. A feller has to look sharp in this city, or he'll lose his eye-teeth before he knows it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you never got swindled out of fifty dollars, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't carry no such small bills. I wish I did," he added</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I, Dick. What's that building there at the end of the street?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the Wall-Street Ferry to Brooklyn."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long does it take to go across?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not more'n five minutes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose we just ride over and back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" said Dick. "It's rather expensive; but if you don't mind, I don't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, how much does it cost?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two cents apiece."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I can stand that. Let us go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They passed the gate, paying the fare to a man who stood at the entrance, and were soon on the ferry-boat, bound for Brooklyn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had scarcely entered the boat, when Dick, grasping Frank by the arm, pointed to a man just outside of the gentlemen's cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you see that man, Frank?" he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, what of him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's the man that cheated the country chap out of his fifty dollars."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI DICK AS A DETECTlVE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DICK'S ready identification of the rogue who had cheated the countryman, surprised Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think it is he?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I've seen him before, and I know he's up to them kind of tricks. When I heard how he looked, I was sure I knowed him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Our recognizing him won't be of much use," said Frank. "It won't give back the countryman his money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Dick, thoughtfully. "May be I can get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How?" asked Frank, incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute, and you'll see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick left his companion, and went up to the man whom he suspected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ephraim Smith," said Dick, in a low voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man turned suddenly, and looked at Dick uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you say?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe your name is Ephraim Smith," continued Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're mistaken," said the man, and was about to move off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop a minute," said Dick. "Don't you keep your money in the Washington Bank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know any such bank. I'm in a hurry, young man, and I can't stop to answer any foolish questions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boat had by this time reached the Brooklyn pier, and Mr. Ephraim Smith seemed in a hurry to land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here," said Dick, significantly; "you'd better not go on shore unless you want to jump into the arms of a policeman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean?" asked the man, startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That little affair of yours is known to the police," said Dick; "about how you got fifty dollars out of a greenhorn on a false check, and it mayn't be safe for you to go ashore."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what you're talking about," said the swindler with affected boldness, though Dick could see that he was ill at ease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes you do," said Dick. "There isn't but one thing to do. Just give me back that money, and I'll see that you're not touched. If you don't, I'll give you up to the first p'liceman we meet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick looked so determined, and spoke so confidently, that the other, overcome by his fears, no longer hesitated, but passed a roll of bills to Dick and hastily left the boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All this Frank witnessed with great amazement, not understanding what influence Dick could have obtained over the swindler sufficient to compel restitution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you do it?" he asked eagerly .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told him I'd exert my influence with the president to have him tried by habease corpus ," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And of course that frightened him. But tell me, without joking, how you managed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick gave a truthful account of what occurred, and then said, "Now we'll go back and carry the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose we don't find the poor countryman?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then the p'lice will take care of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They remained on board the boat, and in five minutes were again in New York. Going up Wall Street, they met the countryman a little distance from the Custom House. His face was marked with the traces of deep anguish; but in his case even grief could not subdue the cravings of appetite. He had purchased some cakes of one of the old women who spread out for the benefit of passers-by an array of apples and seed-cakes, and was munching them with melancholy satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hilloa!" said Dick. "Have you found your money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," ejaculated the young man, with a convulsive gasp. "I sha'n't ever see it again. The mean skunk's cheated me out of it. Consarn his picter! It took me most six months to save it up. I was workin' for Deacon Pinkham in our place. Oh, I wish I'd never come to New York! The deacon, he told me he'd keep it for me; but I wanted to put it in the bank, and now it's all gone, boo hoo!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the miserable youth, having despatched his cakes, was so overcome by the thought of his loss that he burst into tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say," said Dick, "dry up, and see what I've got here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The youth no sooner saw the roll of bills, and comprehended that it was indeed his lost treasure, than from the depths of anguish he was exalted to the most ecstatic joy. He seized Dick's hand, and shook it with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed for its safety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Pears to me you take my arm for a pump-handle," said he. "Couldn't you show your gratitood some other way? It's just possible I may want to use my arm ag'in some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man desisted, but invited Dick most cordially to come up and stop a week with him at his country home, assuring him that he wouldn't charge him anything for board.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" said Dick. "If you don't mind I'll bring my wife along, too. She's delicate, and the country air might do her good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonathan stared at him in amazement, uncertain whether to credit the fact of his marriage. Dick walked on with Frank, leaving him in an apparent state of stupefaction, and it is possible that he has not yet settled the affair to his satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said Frank, "I think I'll go back to the Astor House. Uncle has probably got through his business and returned."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys walked up to Broadway, just where the tall steeple of Trinity faces the street of bankers and brokers, and walked leisurely to the hotel. When they arrived at the Astor House, Dick said, "Good-by, Frank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not yet," said Frank; "I want you to come in with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick followed his young patron up the steps. Frank went to the reading-room, where, as he had thought probable, he found his uncle already arrived, and reading a copy of "The Evening Post," which he had just purchased outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, boys," he said, looking up, "have you had a pleasant jaunt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Frank. "Dick's a capital guide."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So this is Dick," said Mr. Whitney, surveying him with a smile. "Upon my word, I should hardly have known him. I must congratulate him on his improved appearance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Frank's been very kind to me," said Dick, who, rough street-boy as he was, had a heart easily touched by kindness, of which he had never experienced much. "He's a tip-top fellow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe he is a good boy," said Mr. Whitney. "I hope, my lad, you will prosper and rise in the world. You know in this free country poverty in early life is no bar to a man's advancement. I haven't risen very high myself," he added, with a smile, "but have met with moderate success in life; yet there was a time when I was as poor as you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you, sir," asked Dick, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, my boy, I have known the time I have been obliged to go without my dinner because I didn't have enough money to pay for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you get up in the world," asked Dick, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I entered a printing-office as an apprentice, and worked for some years. Then my eyes gave out and I was obliged to give that up. Not knowing what else to do, I went into the country, and worked on a farm. After a while I was lucky enough to invent a machine, which has brought me in a great deal of money. But there was one thing I got while I was in the printing-office which I value more than money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was that, sir?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A taste for reading and study. During my leisure hours I improved myself by study, and acquired a large part of the knowledge which I now possess. Indeed, it was one of my books that first put me on the track of the invention, which I afterwards made. So you see, my lad, that my studious habits paid me in money, as well as in another way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm awful ignorant," said Dick, soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you are young, and, I judge, a smart boy. If you try to learn, you can, and if you ever expect to do anything in the world, you must know something of books."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will," said Dick, resolutely. "I ain't always goin' to black boots for a livin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All labor is respectable, my lad, and you have no cause to be ashamed of any honest business; yet when you can get something to do that promises better for your future prospects, I advise you to do so. Till then earn your living in the way you are accustomed to, avoid extravagance, and save up a little money if you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you for your advice," said our hero. "There aint many that takes an interest in Ragged Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So that's your name," said Mr. Whitney. "If I judge you rightly, it won't be long before you change it. Save your money, my lad, buy books, and determine to be somebody, and you may yet fill an honorable position."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try," said Dick. "Good-night, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute, Dick," said Frank. "Your blacking-box and old clothes are upstairs. You may want them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course," said Dick. "I couldn't get along without my best clothes, and my stock in trade."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may go up to the room with him, Frank," said Mr. Whitney. "The clerk will give you the key. I want to see you, Dick, before you go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going to sleep to-night, Dick?" asked Frank, as they went upstairs together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P'r'aps at the Fifth Avenue Hotel—on the outside," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Haven't you any place to sleep, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I slept in a box, last night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In a box?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, on Spruce Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor fellow!" said Frank, compassionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, 'twas a bully bed—full of straw! I slept like a top."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you earn enough to pay for a room, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick; "only I spend my money foolish, goin' to the Old Bowery, and Tony Pastor's, and sometimes gamblin' in Baxter Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't gamble any more,—will you, Dick?" said Frank, laying his hand persuasively on his companion's shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I won't," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll promise?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and I'll keep it. You're a good feller. I wish you was goin' to be in New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to a boarding-school in Connecticut. The name of the town is Barnton. Will you write to me, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My writing would look like hens' tracks," said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind. I want you to write. When you write you can tell me how to direct, and I will send you a letter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would," said Dick. "I wish I was more like you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will make a much better boy, Dick. Now we'll go in to my uncle. He wishes to see you before you go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went into the reading-room. Dick had wrapped up his blacking-brush in a newspaper with which Frank had supplied him, feeling that a guest of the Astor House should hardly be seen coming out of the hotel displaying such a professional sign.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle, Dick's ready to go," said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, my lad," said Mr. Whitney. "I hope to hear good accounts of you sometime. Don't forget what I have told you. Remember that your future position depends mainly upon yourself, and that it will be high or low as you choose to make it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held out his hand, in which was a five-dollar bill. Dick shrunk back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like to take it," he said. "I haven't earned it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps not," said Mr. Whitney; "but I give it to you because I remember my own friendless youth. I hope it may be of service to you. Sometime when you are a prosperous man, you can repay it in the form of aid to some poor boy, who is struggling upward as you are now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, sir," said Dick, manfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He no longer refused the money, but took it gratefully, and, bidding Frank and his uncle good-by, went out into the street. A feeling of loneliness came over him as he left the presence of Frank, for whom he had formed a strong attachment in the few hours he had known him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII DICK HIRES A ROOM ON MOTT STREET</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Going out into the fresh air Dick felt the pangs of hunger. He accordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper. Perhaps it was the new clothes he wore, which made him feel a little more aristocratic. At all events, instead of patronizing the cheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals, he went into the refectory attached to Lovejoy's Hotel, where the prices were higher and the company more select. In his ordinary dress, Dick would have been excluded, but now he had the appearance of a very respectable, gentlemanly boy, whose presence would not discredit any establishment. His orders were therefore received with attention by the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could come here every day," thought Dick. "It seems kind o' nice and 'spectable, side of the other place. There's a gent at that other table that I've shined boots for more'n once. He don't know me in my new clothes. Guess he don't know his boot-black patronizes the same establishment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His supper over, Dick went up to the desk, and, presenting his check, tendered in payment his five-dollar bill, as if it were one of a large number which he possessed. Receiving back his change he went out into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two questions now arose: How should he spend the evening, and where should he pass the night? Yesterday, with such a sum of money in his possession, he would have answered both questions readily. For the evening, he would have passed it at the Old Bowery, and gone to sleep in any out-of-the-way place that offered. But he had turned over a new leaf, or resolved to do so. He meant to save his money for some useful purpose,—to aid his advancement in the world. So he could not afford the theatre. Besides, with his new clothes, he was unwilling to pass the night out of doors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should spile 'em," he thought, "and that wouldn't pay."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly, and consider as his own, where he could sleep nights, instead of depending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter. This would be the first step towards respectability, and Dick determined to take it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He accordingly passed through the City Hall Park, and walked leisurely up Centre Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek lodgings in Fifth Avenue, although his present cash capital consisted of nearly five dollars in money, besides the valuable papers contained in his wallet. Besides, he had reason to doubt whether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic street. He took his way to Mott Street, which is considerably less pretentious, and halted in front of a shabby brick lodging-house kept by a Mrs. Mooney, with whose son Tom, Dick was acquainted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick rang the bell, which sent back a shrill metallic response.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened by a slatternly servant, who looked at him inquiringly, and not without curiosity. It must be remembered that Dick was well dressed, and that nothing in his appearance bespoke his occupation. Being naturally a good-looking boy, he might readily be mistaken for a gentleman's son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Queen Victoria," said Dick, "is your missus at home?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name's Bridget," said the girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, indeed!" said Dick. "You looked so much like the queen's picter what she gave me last Christmas in exchange for mine, that I couldn't help calling you by her name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, go along wid ye!" said Bridget. "It's makin' fun ye are."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don't believe me," said Dick, gravely, "all you've got to do is to ask my partic'lar friend, the Duke of Newcastle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bridget!" called a shrill voice from the basement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The missus is calling me," said Bridget, hurriedly. "I'll tell her ye want her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The servant descended into the lower regions, and in a short time a stout, red-faced woman appeared on the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir, what's your wish?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got a room to let?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it for yourself you ask?" questioned the woman, in some surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick answered in the affirmative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got any very good rooms vacant. There's a small room in the third story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to see it," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know as it would be good enough for you," said the woman, with a glance at Dick's clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't very partic'lar about accommodations," said our hero. "I guess I'll look at it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick followed the landlady up two narrow stair-cases, uncarpeted and dirty, to the third landing, where he was ushered into a room about ten feet square. It could not be considered a very desirable apartment. It had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet, but this was now very ragged, and looked worse than none. There was a single bed in the corner, covered with an indiscriminate heap of bed-clothing, rumpled and not over-clean. There was a bureau, with the veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off, and a small glass, eight inches by ten, cracked across the middle; also two chairs in rather a disjointed condition. Judging from Dick's appearance, Mrs. Mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it must be remembered that Dick's past experience had not been of a character to make him fastidious. In comparison with a box, or an empty wagon, even this little room seemed comfortable. He decided to hire it if the rent proved reasonable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what's the tax?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ought to have a dollar a week," said Mrs. Mooney, hesitatingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say seventy-five cents, and I'll take it," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Every week in advance?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, as times is hard, and I can't afford to keep it empty, you may have it. When will you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-night," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It ain't lookin' very neat. I don't know as I can fix it up to-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll sleep here to-night, and you can fix it up tomorrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you'll excuse the looks. I'm a lone woman, and my help is so shiftless, I have to look after everythilng myself; so I can't keep things as straight as I want to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you pay me the first week in advance?" asked the landlady, cautiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick responded by drawing seventy-five cents from his pocket, and placing it in her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's your business, sir, if I may inquire?" said Mrs. Mooney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm professional!" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" said the landlady, who did not feel much enlightened by this answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How's Tom?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know my Tom?" said Mrs. Mooney in surprise. "He's gone to sea,—to Californy. He went last week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he?" said Dick. "Yes, I knew him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor, on finding that he was acquainted with her son, who, by the way, was one of the worst young scamps in Mott Street, which is saying considerable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll bring over my baggage from the Astor House this evening," said Dick in a tone of importance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"From the Astor House!" repeated Mrs. Mooney, in fresh amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I've been stoppin' there a short time with some friends," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that a guest from the Astor House was about to become one of her lodgers—such transfers not being common.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you say you was purfessional?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am," said Dick, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ain't a—a—" Mrs. Mooney paused, uncertain what conjecture to hazard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, nothing of the sort," said Dick, promptly. "How could you think so, Mrs. Mooney?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No offence, sir," said the landlady, more perplexed than ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not," said our hero. "But you must excuse me now, Mrs. Mooney, as I have business of great importance to attend to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll come round this evening?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick answered in the affirmative, and turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder what he is!" thought the landlady, following him with her eyes as he crossed the street. "He's got good clothes on, but he don't seem very particular about his room. Well; I've got all my rooms full now. That's one comfort."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step of hiring a lodging, and paying a week's rent in advance. For seven nights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in. The thought was a pleasant one to our young vagrant, who hitherto had seldom known when he rose in the morning where he should find a resting-place at night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must bring my traps round," said Dick to himself. "I guess I'll go to bed early to-night. It'll feel kinder good to sleep in a reg'lar bed. Boxes is rather hard to the back, and ain't comfortable in case of rain. I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if he knew I'd got a room of my own."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII MlCKY MAGUlRE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About nine o'clock Dick sought his new lodgings. In his hands he carried his professional wardrobe, namely, the clothes which he had worn at the commencement of the day, and the implements of his business. These he stowed away in the bureau drawers, and by the light of a flickering candle took off his clothes and went to bed. Dick had a good digestion and a reasonably good conscience; consequently he was a good sleeper. Perhaps, too, the soft feather bed conduced to slumber. At any rate his eyes were soon closed, and he did not awake until half-past six the next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted himself on his elbow, and stared around him in transient bewilderment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Blest if I hadn't forgot where I was," he said to himself. "So this is my room, is it? Well, it seems kind of 'spectable to have a room and a bed to sleep in. I'd orter be able to afford seventy-five cents a week. I've throwed away more money than that in one evenin'. There ain't no reason why I shouldn't live 'spectable. I wish I knowed as much as Frank. He's a tip-top feller. Nobody ever cared enough for me before to give me good advice. It was kicks, and cuffs, and swearin' at me all the time. I'd like to show him I can do something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Dick was indulging in these reflections, he had risen from bed, and, finding an accession to the furniture of his room, in the shape of an ancient wash-stand bearing a cracked bowl and broken pitcher, indulged himself in the rather unusual ceremony of a good wash. On the whole, Dick preferred to be clean, but it was not always easy to gratify his desire. Lodging in the street as he had been accustomed to do, he had had no opportunity to perform his toilet in the customary manner. Even now he found himself unable to arrange his dishevelled locks, having neither comb nor brush. He determined to purchase a comb, at least, as soon as possible, and a brush too, if he could get one cheap. Meanwhile he combed his hair with his fingers as well as he could, though the result was not quite so satisfactory as it might have been.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A question now came up for consideration. For the first time in his life Dick possessed two suits of clothes. Should he put on the clothes Frank had given him, or resume his old rags?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, twenty-four hours before, at the time Dick was introduced to the reader's notice, no one could have been less fastidious as to his clothing than he. Indeed, he had rather a contempt for good clothes, or at least he thought so. But now, as he surveyed the ragged and dirty coat and the patched pants, Dick felt ashamed of them. He was unwilling to appear in the streets with them. Yet, if he went to work in his new suit, he was in danger of spoiling it, and he might not have it in his power to purchase a new one. Economy dictated a return to the old garments. Dick tried them on, and surveyed himself in the cracked glass; but the reflection did not please him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They don't look 'spectable," he decided; and, forthwith taking them off again, he put on the new suit of the day before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must try to earn a little more," he thought, "to pay for my room, and to buy some new clo'es when these is wore out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the door of his chamber, and went downstairs and into the street, carrying his blacking-box with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Dick's custom to commence his business before breakfast; generally it must be owned, because he began the day penniless, and must earn his meal before he ate it. To-day it was different. He had four dollars left in his pocket-book; but this he had previously determined not to touch. In fact he had formed the ambitious design of starting an account at a savings' bank, in order to have something to fall back upon in case of sickness or any other emergency, or at any rate as a reserve fund to expend in clothing or other necessary articles when he required them. Hitherto he had been content to live on from day to day without a penny ahead; but the new vision of respectability which now floated before Dick's mind, owing to his recent acquaintance with Frank, was beginning to exercise a powerful effect upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Dick's profession as in others there are lucky days, when everything seems to flow prosperously. As if to encourage him in his new-born resolution, our hero obtained no less than six jobs in the course of an hour and a half. This gave him sixty cents, quite abundant to purchase his breakfast, and a comb besides. His exertions made him hungry, and, entering a small eating-house he ordered a cup of coffee and a beefsteak. To this he added a couple of rolls. This was quite a luxurious breakfast for Dick, and more expensive than he was accustomed to indulge himself with. To gratify the curiosity of my young readers, I will put down the items with their cost,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Coffee, . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5cts. Beefsteak,. . . . . . . . . . . . 15 A couple of rolls,. . . . . . . . 5 —25 cts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will thus be seen that our hero had expended nearly one-half of his morning's earnings. Some days he had been compelled to breakfast on five cents, and then he was forced to content himself with a couple of apples, or cakes. But a good breakfast is a good preparation for a busy day, and Dick sallied forth from the restaurant lively and alert, ready to do a good stroke of business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick's change of costume was liable to lead to one result of which he had not thought. His brother boot-blacks might think he had grown aristocratic, and was putting on airs,—that, in fact, he was getting above his business, and desirous to outshine his associates. Dick had not dreamed of this, because in fact, in spite of his new-born ambition, he entertained no such feeling. There was nothing of what boys call "big-feeling" about him. He was a borough democrat, using the word not politically, but in its proper sense, and was disposed to fraternize with all whom he styled "good fellows," without regard to their position. It may seem a little unnecessary to some of my readers to make this explanation; but they must remember that pride and "big-feeling" are confined to no age or class, but may be found in boys as well as men, and in boot-blacks as well as those of a higher rank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The morning being a busy time with the boot-blacks, Dick's changed appearance had not as yet attracted much attention. But when business slackened a little, our hero was destined to be reminded of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the down-town boot-blacks was one hailing from the Five Points,—a stout, red-haired, freckled-faced boy of fourteen, bearing the name of Micky Maguire. This boy, by his boldness and recklessness, as well as by his personal strength, which was considerable, had acquired an ascendency among his fellow professionals, and had a gang of subservient followers, whom he led on to acts of ruffianism, not unfrequently terminating in a month or two at Blackwell's Island. Micky himself had served two terms there; but the confinement appeared to have had very little effect in amending his conduct, except, perhaps, in making him a little more cautious about an encounter with the "copps," as the members of the city police are, for some unknown reason, styled among the Five-Point boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Micky was proud of his strength, and of the position of leader which it had secured him. Moreover he was democratic in his tastes, and had a jealous hatred of those who wore good clothes and kept their faces clean. He called it putting on airs, and resented the implied superiority. If he had been fifteen years older, and had a trifle more education, he would have interested himself in politics, and been prominent at ward meetings, and a terror to respectable voters on election day. As it was, he contented himself with being the leader of a gang of young ruffians, over whom he wielded a despotic power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it is only justice to Dick to say that, so far as wearing good clothes was concerned, he had never hitherto offended the eyes of Micky Maguire. Indeed, they generally looked as if they patronized the same clothing establishment. On this particular morning it chanced that Micky had not been very fortunate in a business way, and, as a natural consequence, his temper, never very amiable, was somewhat ruffled by the fact. He had had a very frugal breakfast,—not because he felt abstemious, but owing to the low state of his finances. He was walking along with one of his particular friends, a boy nicknamed Limpy Jim, so called from a slight peculiarity in his walk, when all at once he espied our friend Dick in his new suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My eyes!" he exclaimed, in astonishment; "Jim, just look at Ragged Dick. He' s come into a fortun', and turned gentleman. See his new clothes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So he has," said Jim. "Where'd he get 'em, I wonder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hooked 'em, p'raps. Let's go and stir him up a little. We don't want no gentlemen on our beat. So he's puttin' on airs,—is he? I'll give him a lesson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying the two boys walked up to our hero, who had not observed them, his back being turned, and Micky Maguire gave him a smart slap on the shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick turned round quickly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV A BATTLE AND A VICTORY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that for?" demanded Dick, turning round to see who had struck him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're gettin' mighty fine!" said Micky Maguire, surveying Dick's new clothes with a scornful air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something in his words and tone, which Dick, who was disposed to stand up for his dignity, did not at all relish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what's the odds if I am?" he retorted. "Does it hurt you any?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See him put on airs, Jim," said Micky, turning to his companion. "Where'd you get them clo'es?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind where I got 'em. Maybe the Prince of Wales gave 'em to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hear him, now, Jim," said Micky. "Most likely he stole 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stealin' ain't in my line."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It might have been unconscious the emphasis which Dick placed on the word "my." At any rate Micky chose to take offence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to say I steal?" he demanded, doubling up his fist, and advancing towards Dick in a threatening manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't say anything about it," answered Dick, by no means alarmed at this hostile demonstration. "I know you've been to the Island twice. P'r'aps 'twas to make a visit along of the Mayor and Aldermen. Maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression. I ain't a goin' to say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky's freckled face grew red with wrath, for Dick had only stated the truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to insult me?" he demanded shaking the fist already doubled up in Dick's face. "Maybe you want a lickin'?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't partic'larly anxious to get one," said Dick, coolly. "They don't agree with my constitution which is nat'rally delicate. I'd rather have a good dinner than a lickin' any time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're afraid," sneered Micky. "Isn't he, Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course he is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P'r'aps I am," said Dick, composedly, "but it don't trouble me much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you want to fight?" demanded Micky, encouraged by Dick's quietness, fancying he was afraid to encounter him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't," said Dick. "I ain't fond of fightin'. It's a very poor amusement, and very bad for the complexion, 'specially for the eyes and nose, which is apt to turn red, white, and blue."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky misunderstood Dick, and judged from the tenor of his speech that he would be an easy victim. As he knew, Dick very seldom was concerned in any street fight,—not from cowardice, as he imagined, but because he had too much good sense to do so. Being quarrelsome, like all bullies, and supposing that he was more than a match for our hero, being about two inches taller, he could no longer resist an inclination to assault him, and tried to plant a blow in Dick's face which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back just in time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, though Dick was far from quarrelsome, he was ready to defend himself on all occasions, and it was too much to expect that he would stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dropped his blacking-box on the instant, and returned Micky's blow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back, and would have fallen, if he had not been propped up by his confederate, Limpy Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go in, Micky!" shouted the latter, who was rather a coward on his own account, but liked to see others fight. "Polish him off, that's a good feller."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky was now boiling over with rage and fury, and required no urging. He was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor Dick. He threw himself upon him, and strove to bear him to the ground; but Dick, avoiding a close hug, in which he might possibly have got the worst of it, by an adroit movement, tripped up his antagonist, and stretched him on the side walk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hit him, Jim!" exclaimed Micky, furiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Limpy Jim did not seem inclined to obey orders. There was a quiet strength and coolness about Dick, which alarmed him. He preferred that Micky should incur all the risks of battle, and accordingly set himself to raising his fallen comrade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, Micky," said Dick, quietly, "you'd better give it up. I wouldn't have touched you if you hadn't hit me first. I don't want to fight. It's low business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're afraid of hurtin' your clo'es," said Micky, with a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I am," said Dick. "I hope I haven't hurt yours."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky's answer to this was another attack, as violent and impetuous as the first. But his fury was in the way. He struck wildly, not measuring his blows, and Dick had no difficulty in turning aside, so that his antagonist's blow fell upon the empty air, and his momentum was such that he nearly fell forward headlong. Dick might readily have taken advantage of his unsteadiness, and knocked him down; but he was not vindictive, and chose to act on the defensive, except when he could not avoid it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recovering himself, Micky saw that Dick was a more formidable antagonist than he had supposed, and was meditating another assault, better planned, which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the ground. But there was an unlooked-for interference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look out for the `copp,'" said Jim, in a low voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him, and thought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities. He accordingly picked up his black-box, and, hitching up his pants, walked off, attended by Limpy Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that chap been doing?" asked the policeman of Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was amoosin' himself by pitchin' into me," replied Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He didn't like it 'cause I patronized a different tailor from him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it seems to me you are dressed pretty smart for a boot-black," said the policeman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I wasn't a boot-black," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, my lad. It's an honest business," said the policeman, who was a sensible man and a worthy citizen. "It's an honest business. Stick to it till you get something better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean to," said Dick. "It ain't easy to get out of it, as the prisoner remarked, when he was asked how he liked his residence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you don't speak from experience."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I don't mean to get into prison if I can help it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you see that gentleman over there?" asked the officer, pointing to a well-dressed man who was walking on the other side of the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he was once a newsboy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what is he now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He keeps a bookstore, and is quite prosperous."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick looked at the gentleman with interest, wondering if he should look as respectable when he was a grown man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be seen that Dick was getting ambitious. Hitherto he had thought very little of the future, but was content to get along as he could, dining as well as his means would allow, and spending the evenings in the pit of the Old Bowery, eating peanuts between the acts if he was prosperous, and if unlucky supping on dry bread or an apple, and sleeping in an old box or a wagon. Now, for the first time, he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his life. In seven years he would be a man, and, since his meeting with Frank, he felt that he would like to be a respectable man. He could see and appreciate the difference between Frank and such a boy as Micky Maguire, and it was not strange that he preferred the society of the former.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the course of the next morning, in pursuance of his new resolutions for the future, he called at a savings bank, and held out four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change. There was a high railing, and a number of clerks busily writing at desks behind it. Dick, never having been in a bank before, did not know where to go. He went, by mistake, to the desk where money was paid out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's your book?" asked the clerk</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't got any."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any money deposited here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, I want to leave some here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then go to the next desk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick followed directions, and presented himself before an elderly man with gray hair, who looked at him over the rims of his spectacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want you to keep that for me," said Dick, awkwardly emptying his money out on the desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much is there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Five dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got an account here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you can write?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "of course" was said on account of Dick's neat dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have I got to do any writing?" asked our hero, a little embarrassed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We want you to sign your name in this book," and the old gentleman shoved round a large folio volume containing the names of depositors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick surveyed the book with some awe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't much on writin'," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; write as well as you can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pen was put into Dick's hand, and, after dipping it in the inkstand, he succeeded after a hard effort, accompanied by many contortions of the face, in inscribing upon the book of the bank the name</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DICK HUNTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick!—that means Richard, I suppose," said the bank officer, who had some difficulty in making out the signature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; Ragged Dick is what folks call me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't look very ragged."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I've left my rags to home. They might get wore out if I used 'em too common."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my lad, I'll make out a book in the name of Dick Hunter, since you seem to prefer Dick to Richard. I hope you will save up your money and deposit more with us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero took his bank-book, and gazed on the entry "Five Dollars" with a new sense of importance. He had been accustomed to joke about Erie shares, but now, for the first time, he felt himself a capitalist; on a small scale, to be sure, but still it was no small thing for Dick to have five dollars which he could call his own. He firmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare from his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more than money needed to win a respectable position in the world. He felt that he was very ignorant. Of reading and writing he only knew the rudiments, and that, with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic, was all he did know of books. Dick knew he must study hard, and he dreaded it. He looked upon learning as attended with greater difficulties than it really possesses. But Dick had good pluck. He meant to learn, nevertheless, and resolved to buy a book with his first spare earnings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick went home at night he locked up his bank-book in one of the drawers of the bureau. It was wonderful how much more independent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of that drawer, and with what an important air of joint ownership he regarded the bank building in which his small savings were deposited.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV DICK SECURES A TUTOR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning Dick was unusually successful, having plenty to do, and receiving for one job twentv-five cents,—the gentleman refusing to take change. Then flashed upon Dick's mind the thought that he had not yet returned the change due to the gentleman whose boots he had blacked on the morning of his introduction to the reader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'll he think of me?" said Dick to himself. "I hope he won't think I'm mean enough to keep the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Dick was scrupulously honest, and though the temptation to be otherwise had often been strong, he had always resisted it. He was not willing on any account to keep money which did not belong to him, and he immediately started for 125 Fulton Street (the address which had been given him) where he found Mr. Greyson's name on the door of an office on the first floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door being open, Dick walked in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Mr. Greyson in?" he asked of a clerk who sat on a high stool before a desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not just now. He'll be in soon. Will you wait?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; take a seat then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick sat down and took up the morning "Tribune," but presently came to a word of four syllables, which he pronounced to himself a "sticker," and laid it down. But he had not long to wait, for five minutes later Mr. Greyson entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you wish to speak to me, my lad?" said he to Dick, whom in his new clothes he did not recognize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Dick. "I owe you some money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" said Mr. Greyson, pleasantly; "that's an agreeable surprise. I didn't know but you had come for some. So you are a debtor of mine, and not a creditor?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I b'lieve that's right," said Dick, drawing fifteen cents from his pocket, and placing in Mr. Greyson's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifteen cents!" repeated he, in some surprise. "How do you happen to be indebted to me in that amount?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You gave me a quarter for a-shinin' your boots, yesterday mornin', and couldn't wait for the change. I meant to have brought it before, but I forgot all about it till this mornin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It had quite slipped my mind also. But you don't look like the boy I employed. If I remember rightly he wasn't as well dressed as you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "I was dressed for a party, then, but the clo'es was too well ventilated to be comfortable in cold weather."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're an honest boy," said Mr. Greyson. "Who taught you to be honest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody," said Dick. "But it's mean to cheat and steal. I've always knowed that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you've got ahead of some of our business men. Do you read the Bible?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "I've heard it's a good book, but I don't know much about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to go to some Sunday School. Would you be willing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, promptly. "I want to grow up 'spectable. But I don't know where to go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll tell you. The church I attend is at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-first Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've seen it," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a class in the Sunday School there. If you'll come next Sunday, I'll take you into my class, and do what I can to help you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Dick, "but p'r'aps you'll get tired of teaching me. I'm awful ignorant."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, my lad," said Mr.Greyson, kindly. "You evidently have some good principles to start with, as you have shown by your scorn of dishonesty. I shall hope good things of you in the future."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Dick," said our hero, apostrophizing himself, as he left the office; "you're gettin' up in the world. You've got money invested, and are goin' to attend church, by partic'lar invitation, on Fifth Avenue. I shouldn't wonder much if you should find cards, when you get home, from the Mayor, requestin' the honor of your company to dinner, along with other distinguished guests."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick felt in very good spirits. He seemed to be emerging from the world in which he had hitherto lived, into a new atmosphere of respectability, and the change seemed very pleasant to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At six o'clock Dick went into a restaurant on Chatham Street, and got a comfortable supper. He had been so successful during the day that, after paying for this, he still had ninety cents left. While he was despatching his supper, another boy came in, smaller and slighter than Dick, and sat down beside him. Dick recognized him as a boy who three months before had entered the ranks of the boot-blacks, but who, from a natural timidity, had not been able to earn much. He was ill-fitted for the coarse companionship of the street boys, and shrank from the rude jokes of his present associates. Dick had never troubled him; for our hero had a certain chivalrous feeling which would not allow him to bully or disturb a younger and weaker boy than himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Fosdick?" said Dick, as the other seated himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well," said Fosdick. "I suppose you're all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I'm right side up with care. I've been havin' a bully supper. What are you goin' to have?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some bread and butter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you get a cup o' coffee?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why," said Fosdick, reluctantly, "I haven't got money enough to-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," said Dick; "I'm in luck to-day, I'll stand treat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's kind in you," said Fosdick, gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, never mind that," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly he ordered a cup of coffee, and a plate of beefsteak, and was gratified to see that his young companion partook of both with evident relish. When the repast was over, the boys went out into the street together, Dick pausing at the desk to settle for both suppers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going to sleep to-night, Fosdick?" asked Dick, as they stood on the sidewalk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Fosdick, a little sadly. "In some doorway, I expect. But I'm afraid the police will find me out, and make me move on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you what," said Dick, "you must go home with me. I guess my bed will hold two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got a room?" asked the other, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, rather proudly, and with a little excusable exultation. "I've got a room over in Mott Street; there I can receive my friends. That'll be better than sleepin' in a door-way,— won't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, indeed it will," said Fosdick. "How lucky I was to come across you! It comes hard to me living as I do. When my father was alive I had every comfort."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's more'n I ever had," said Dick. "But I'm goin' to try to live comfortable now. Is your father dead?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick, sadly. "He was a printer; but he was drowned one dark night from a Fulton ferry-boat, and, as I had no relations in the city, and no money, I was obliged to go to work as quick as I could. But I don't get on very well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you have no brothers nor sisters?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Fosdick; "father and I used to live alone. He was always so much company to me that I feel very lonesome without him. There's a man out West somewhere that owes him two thousand dollars. He used to live in the city, and father lent him all his money to help him go into business; but he failed, or pretended to, and went off. If father hadn't lost that money he would have left me well off; but no money would have made up his loss to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the man's name that went off with your father's money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His name is Hiram Bates."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P'r'aps you'll get the money again, sometime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't much chance of it," said Fosdick. "I'd sell out my chances of that for five dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I'll buy you out sometime," said Dick. "Now, come round and see what sort of a room I've got. I used to go to the theatre evenings, when I had money; but now I'd rather go to bed early, and have a good sleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care much about theatres," said Fosdick. "Father didn't use to let me go very often. He said it wasn't good for boys."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like to go to the Old Bowery sometimes. They have tip-top plays there. Can you read and write well?" he asked, as a sudden thought came to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick. "Father always kept me at school when he was alive, and I stood pretty well in my classes. I was expecting to enter at the Free Academy [168] next year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll tell you what," said Dick; "I'll make a bargain with you. I can't read much more'n a pig; and my writin' looks like hens' tracks. I don't want to grow up knowin' no more'n a four-year-old boy. If you'll teach me readin' and writin' evenin's, you shall sleep in my room every night. That'll be better'n door-steps or old boxes, where I've slept many a time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you in earnest?" said Fosdick, his face lighting up hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course I am," said Dick. "It' s fashionable for young gentlemen to have private tootors to introduct 'em into the flower-beds of literatoor and science, and why shouldn't I foller the fashion? You shall be my perfessor; only you must promise not to be very hard if my writin' looks like a rail-fence on a bender."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try not to be too severe," said Fosdick, laughing. "I shall be thankful for such a chance to get a place to sleep. Have you got anything to read out of?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "My extensive and well-selected library was lost overboard in a storm, when I was sailin' from the Sandwich Islands to the desert of Sahara. But I'll buy a paper. That'll do me a long time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly Dick stopped at a paper-stand, and bought a copy of a weekly paper, filled with the usual variety of reading matter,— stories, sketches, poems, etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They soon arrived at Dick's lodging-house. Our hero, procuring a lamp from the landlady, led the way into his apartment, which he entered with the proud air of a proprietor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, how do you like it, Fosdick?" he asked, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time was when Fosdick would have thought it untidy and not particularly attractive. But he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets, and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter, and he was not disposed to be critical.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks very comfortable, Dick," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The bed ain't very large," said Dick; "but I guess we can get along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes," said Fosdick, cheerfully. "I don't take up much room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then that's all right. There's two chairs, you see, one for you and one for me. In case the mayor comes in to spend the evenin' socially, he can sit on the bed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys seated themselves, and five minutes later, under the guidance of his young tutor, Dick had commenced his studies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[168] Now the college of the city of New York.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI THE FlRST LESSON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fortunately for Dick, his young tutor was well qualified to instruct him. Henry Fosdick, though only twelve years old, knew as much as many boys of fourteen. He had always been studious and ambitious to excel. His father, being a printer, employed in an office where books were printed, often brought home new books in sheets, which Henry was always glad to read. Mr. Fosdick had been, besides, a subscriber to the Mechanics' Apprentices' Library, which contains many thousands of well-selected and instructive books. Thus Henry had acquired an amount of general information, unusual in a boy of his age. Perhaps he had devoted too much time to study, for he was not naturally robust. All this, however, fitted him admirably for the office to which Dick had appointed him,—that of his private instructor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table, and spread out the paper before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The exercises generally Commence with ringin' the bell," said Dick; "but as I ain't got none, we'll have to do without."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And the teacher is generally provided with a rod," said Fosdick. "Isn't there a poker handy, that I can use in case my scholar doesn't behave well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tain't lawful to use fire-arms," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Dick," said Fosdick, "before we begin, I must find out how much you already know. Can you read any?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not enough to hurt me," said Dick. "All I know about readin' you could put in a nutshell, and there'd be room left for a small family."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you know your letters?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick, "I know 'em all, but not intimately. I guess I can call 'em all by name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you learn them? Did you ever go to school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I went two days."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why did you stop?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It didn't agree with my constitution."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't look very delicate," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick, "I ain't troubled much that way; but I found lickin's didn't agree with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you get punished?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Awful," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For indulgin' in a little harmless amoosement," said Dick. "You see the boy that was sittin' next to me fell asleep, which I considered improper in school-time; so I thought I'd help the teacher a little by wakin' him up. So I took a pin and stuck into him; but I guess it went a little too far, for he screeched awful. The teacher found out what it was that made him holler, and whipped me with a ruler till I was black and blue. I thought 'twas about time to take a vacation; so that's the last time I went to school."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't learn to read in that time, of course?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "but I was a newsboy a little while; so I learned a little, just so's to find out what the news was. Sometimes I didn't read straight and called the wrong news. One mornin' I asked another boy what the paper said, and he told me the King of Africa was dead. I thought it was all right till folks began to laugh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Dick, if you'll only study well, you won't be liable to make such mistakes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so," said Dick. "My friend Horace Greeley told me the other day that he'd get me to take his place now and then when he was off makin' speeches if my edication hadn't been neglected."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must find a good piece for you to begin on," said Fosdick, looking over the paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Find an easy one," said Dick, "with words of one story."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick at length found a piece which he thought would answer. He discovered on trial that Dick had not exaggerated his deficiencies. Words of two syllables he seldom pronounced right, and was much surprised when he was told how "through" was sounded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seems to me it's throwin' away letters to use all them," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How would you spell it?" asked his young teacher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"T-h-r-u," Said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Fosdick, "there's a good many other words that are spelt with more letters than they need to have. But it's the fashion, and we must follow it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But if Dick was ignorant, he was quick, and had an excellent capacity. Moreover he had perseverance, and was not easily discouraged. He had made up his mind he must know more, and was not disposed to complain of the difficulty of his task. Fosdick had occasion to laugh more than once at his ludicrous mistakes; but Dick laughed too, and on the whole both were quite interested in the lesson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the end of an hour and a half the boys stopped for the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're learning fast, Dick," said Fosdick. "At this rate you will soon learn to read well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will I?" asked Dick with an expression of satisfaction. "I'm glad of that. I don't want to be ignorant. I didn't use to care, but I do now. I want to grow up 'spectable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I, Dick. We will both help each other, and I am sure we can accomplish something. But I am beginning to feel sleepy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I," said Dick. "Them hard words make my head ache. I wonder who made 'em all?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's more than I can tell. I suppose you've seen a dictionary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's another of 'em. No, I can't say I have, though I may have seen him in the street without knowin' him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dictionary is a book containing all the words in the language."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many are there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't rightly know; but I think there are about fifty thousand."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a pretty large family," said Dick. "Have I got to learn 'em all?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will not be necessary. There are a large number which you would never find occasion to use."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad of that," said Dick; "for I don't expect to live to be more'n a hundred, and by that time I wouldn't be more'n half through."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the flickering lamp gave a decided hint to the boys that unless they made haste they would have to undress in the dark. They accordingly drew off their clothes, and Dick jumped into bed. But Fosdick, before doing so, knelt down by the side of the bed, and said a short prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that for?" asked Dick, curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was saying my prayers," said Fosdick, as he rose from his knees. "Don't you ever do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "Nobody ever taught me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll teach you. Shall I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know," said Dick, dubiously. "What's the good?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick explained as well as he could, and perhaps his simple explanation was better adapted to Dick's comprehension than one from an older person would have been. Dick felt more free to ask questions, and the example of his new friend, for whom he was beginning to feel a warm attachment, had considerable effect upon him. When, therefore, Fosdick asked again if he should teach him a prayer, Dick consented, and his young bedfellow did so. Dick was not naturally irreligious. If he had lived without a knowledge of God and of religious things, it was scarcely to be wondered at in a lad who, from an early age, had been thrown upon his own exertions for the means of living, with no one to care for him or give him good advice. But he was so far good that he could appreciate goodness in others, and this it was that had drawn him to Frank in the first place, and now to Henry Fosdick. He did not, therefore, attempt to ridicule his companion, as some boys better brought up might have done, but was willing to follow his example in what something told him was right. Our young hero had taken an important step toward securing that genuine respectability which he was ambitious to attain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Weary with the day's work, and Dick perhaps still more fatigued by the unusual mental effort he had made, the boys soon sank into a deep and peaceful slumber, from which they did not awaken till six o'clock the next morning. Before going out Dick sought Mrs. Mooney, and spoke to her on the subject of taking Fosdick as a room-mate. He found that she had no objection, provided he would allow her twenty-five cents a week extra, in consideration of the extra trouble which his companion might be expected to make. To this Dick assented, and the arrangement was definitely concluded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This over, the two boys went out and took stations near each other. Dick had more of a business turn than Henry, and less shrinking from publicity, so that his earnings were greater. But he had undertaken to pay the entire expenses of the room, and needed to earn more. Sometimes, when two customers presented themselves at the same time, he was able to direct one to his friend. So at the end of the week both boys found themselves with surplus earnings. Dick had the satisfaction of adding two dollars and a half to his deposits in the Savings Bank, and Fosdick commenced an account by depositing seventy-five cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Sunday morning Dick bethought himself of his promise to Mr. Greyson to come to the church on Fifth Avenue. To tell the truth, Dick recalled it with some regret. He had never been inside a church since he could remember, and he was not much attracted by the invitation he had received. But Henry, finding him wavering, urged him to go, and offered to go with him. Dick gladly accepted the offer, feeling that he required someone to lend him countenance under such unusual circumstances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick dressed himself with scrupulous care, giving his shoes a "shine" so brilliant that it did him great credit in a professional point of view, and endeavored to clean his hands thoroughly; but, in spite of all he could do, they were not so white as if his business had been of a different character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having fully completed his preparations, he descended into the street, and, with Henry by his side, crossed over to Broadway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys pursued their way up Broadway, which on Sunday presents a striking contrast in its quietness to the noise and confusion of ordinary week-days, as far as Union Square, then turned down Fourteenth Street, which brought them to Fifth Avenue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose we dine at Delmonico's," said Fosdick, looking towards that famous restaurant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd have to sell some of my Erie shares," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A short walk now brought them to the church of which mention has already been made. They stood outside, a little abashed, watching the fashionably attired people who were entering, and were feeling a little undecided as to whether they had better enter also, when Dick felt a light touch upon his shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning round, he met the smiling glance of Mr. Greyson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So, my young friend, you have kept your promise," he said. "And whom have you brought with you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A friend of mine," said Dick. "His name is Henry Fosdick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad you have brought him. Now follow me, and I will give you seats."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII DICK'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOCIETY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the hour for morning service. The boys followed Mr. Greyson into the handsome church, and were assigned seats in his own pew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were two persons already seated in it,—a good-looking lady of middle age, and a pretty little girl of nine. They were Mrs. Greyson and her only daughter Ida. They looked pleasantly at the boys as they entered, smiling a welcome to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The morning service commenced. It must be acknowledged that Dick felt rather awkward. It was an unusual place for him, and it need not be wondered at that he felt like a cat in a strange garret. He would not have known when to rise if he had not taken notice of what the rest of the audience did, and followed their example. He was sitting next to Ida, and as it was the first time he had ever been near so well-dressed a young lady, he naturally felt bashful. When the hymns were announced, Ida found the place, and offered a hymn-book to our hero. Dick took it awkwardly, but his studies had not yet been pursued far enough for him to read the words readily. However, he resolved to keep up appearances, and kept his eyes fixed steadily on the hymn-book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length the service was over. The people began to file slowly out of church, and among them, of course, Mr. Greyson's family and the two boys. It seemed very strange to Dick to find himself in such different companionship from what he had been accustomed, and he could not help thinking, "Wonder what Johnny Nolan 'ould say if he could see me now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Johnny's business engagements did not often summon him to Fifth Avenue, and Dick was not likely to be seen by any of his friends in the lower part of the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We have our Sunday school in the afternoon," said Mr. Greyson. "I suppose you live at some distance from here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In Mott Street, sir," answered Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is too far to go and return. Suppose you and your friend come and dine with us, and then we can come here together in the afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was as much astonished at this invitation as if he had really been invited by the Mayor to dine with him and the Board of Aldermen. Mr. Greyson was evidently a rich man, and yet he had actually invited two boot-blacks to dine with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess we'd better go home, sir," said Dick, hesitating.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think you can have any very pressing engagements to interfere with your accepting my invitation," said Mr. Greyson, good-humoredly, for he understood the reason of Dick's hesitation. "So I take it for granted that you both accept."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before Dick fairly knew what he intended to do, he was walking down Fifth Avenue with his new friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, our young hero was not naturally bashful; but he certainly felt so now, especially as Miss Ida Greyson chose to walk by his side, leaving Henry Fosdick to walk with her father and mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your name?" asked Ida, pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero was about to answer "Ragged Dick," when it occurred to him that in the present company he had better forget his old nickname.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick Hunter," he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick!" repeated Ida. "That means Richard, doesn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Everybody calls me Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a cousin Dick," said the young lady, sociably. "His name is Dick Wilson. I suppose you don't know him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like the name of Dick," said the young lady, with charming frankness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without being able to tell why, Dick felt rather glad she did. He plucked up courage to ask her name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Ida," answered the young lady. "Do you like it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick. "It's a bully name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick turned red as soon as he had said it, for he felt that he had not used the right expression.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl broke into a silvery laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a funny boy you are!" she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean it," said Dick, stammering. "I meant it's a tip-top name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Ida laughed again, and Dick wished himself back in Mott Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you?" inquired Ida, continuing her examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm fourteen,—goin' on fifteen," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a big boy of your age," said Ida. "My cousin Dick is a year older than you, but he isn't as large."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick looked pleased. Boys generally like to be told that they are large of their age.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old be you?" asked Dick, beginning to feel more at his ease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm nine years old," said Ida. "I go to Miss Jarvis's school. I've just begun to learn French. Do you know French?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not enough to hurt me," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ida laughed again, and told him that he was a droll boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you like it?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like it pretty well, except the verbs. I can't remember them well. Do you go to school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm studying with a private tutor," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you? So is my cousin Dick. He's going to college this year. Are you going to college?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not this year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because, if you did, you know you'd be in the same class with my cousin. It would be funny to have two Dicks in one class."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They turned down Twenty-fourth Street, passing the Fifth Avenue Hotel on the left, and stopped before an elegant house with a brown stone front. The bell was rung, and the door being opened, the boys, somewhat abashed, followed Mr. Greyson into a handsome hall. They were told where to hang their hats, and a moment afterwards were ushered into a comfortable dining-room, where a table was spread for dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick took his seat on the edge of a sofa, and was tempted to rub his eyes to make sure that he was really awake. He could hardly believe that he was a guest in so fine a mansion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ida helped to put the boys at their ease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you like pictures?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very much," answered Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl brought a book of handsome engravings, and, seating herself beside Dick, to whom she seemed to have taken a decided fancy, commenced showing them to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There are the Pyramids of Egypt," she said, pointing to one engraving.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are they for?" asked Dick, puzzled. "I don't see any winders."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Ida, "I don't believe anybody lives there. Do they, papa?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, my dear. They were used for the burial of the dead. The largest of them is said to be the loftiest building in the world with one exception. The spire of the Cathedral of Strasburg is twenty-four feet higher, if I remember rightly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Egypt near here?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, it's ever so many miles off; about four or five hundred. Didn't you know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "I never heard."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't appear to be very accurate in your information, Ida," said her mother. "Four or five thousand miles would be considerably nearer the truth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a little more conversation they sat down to dinner. Dick seated himself in an embarrassed way. He was very much afraid of doing or saying something which would be considered an impropriety, and had the uncomfortable feeling that everybody was looking at him, and watching his behavior.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you live, Dick?" asked Ida, familiarly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In Mott Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"More than a mile off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it a nice street?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not very," said Dick. "Only poor folks live there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you poor?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Little girls should be seen and not heard," said her mother, gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are," said Ida, "I'll give you the five-dollar gold-piece aunt gave me for a birthday present."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick cannot be called poor, my child," said Mrs. Greyson, "since he earns his living by his own exertions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you earn your living?" asked Ida, who was a very inquisitive young lady, and not easily silenced. "What do you do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick blushed violently. At such a table, and in presence of the servant who was standing at that moment behind his chair, he did not like to say that he was a shoe-black, although he well knew that there was nothing dishonorable in the occupation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Greyson perceived his feelings, and to spare them, said, "You are too inquisitive, Ida. Sometime Dick may tell you, but you know we don't talk of business on Sundays."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick in his embarrassment had swallowed a large spoonful of hot soup, which made him turn red in the face. For the second time, in spite of the prospect of the best dinner he had ever eaten, he wished himself back in Mott Street. Henry Fosdick was more easy and unembarrassed than Dick, not having led such a vagabond and neglected life. But it was to Dick that Ida chiefly directed her conversation, having apparently taken a fancy to his frank and handsome face. I believe I have already said that Dick was a very good-looking boy, especially now since he kept his face clean. He had a frank, honest expression, which generally won its way to the favor of those with whom he came in contact.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick got along pretty well at the table by dint of noticing how the rest acted, but there was one thing he could not manage, eating with his fork, which, by the way, he thought a very singular arrangement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length they arose from the table, somewhat to Dick's relief. Again Ida devoted herself to the boys, and exhibited a profusely illustrated Bible for their entertainment. Dick was interested in looking at the pictures, though he knew very little of their subjects. Henry Fosdick was much better informed, as might have been expected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the boys were about to leave the house with Mr. Greyson for the Sunday school, Ida placed her hand in Dick's, and said persuasively. "You'll come again, Dick, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Dick, "I'd like to," and he could not help thinking Ida the nicest girl he had ever seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Mrs. Greyson, hospitably, "we shall be glad to see you both here again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you very much," said Henry Fosdick, gratefully. "We shall like very much to come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will not dwell upon the hour spent in Sunday school, nor upon the remarks of Mr. Greyson to his class. He found Dick's ignorance of religious subjects so great that he was obliged to begin at the beginning with him. Dick was interested in hearing the children sing, and readily promised to come again the next Sunday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the service was over Dick and Henry walked homewards. Dick could not help letting his thoughts rest on the sweet little girl who had given him so cordial a welcome, and hoping that he might meet her again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Greyson is a nice man,—isn't he, Dick?" asked Henry, as they were turning into Mott Street, and were already in sight of their lodging-house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't he, though?" said Dick. "He treated us just as if we were young gentlemen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ida seemed to take a great fancy to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's a tip-top girl," said Dick, "but she asked so many questions that I didn't know what to say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had scarcely finished speaking, when a stone whizzed by his head, and, turning quickly, he saw Micky Maguire running round the corner of the street which they had just passed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII MICKY MAGUIRE'S SECOND DEFEAT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was no coward. Nor was he in the habit of submitting passively to an insult. When, therefore, he recognized Micky as his assailant, he instantly turned and gave chase. Micky anticipated pursuit, and ran at his utmost speed. It is doubtful if Dick would have overtaken him, but Micky had the ill luck to trip just as he had entered a narrow alley, and, falling with some violence, received a sharp blow from the hard stones, which made him scream with pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ow!" he whined. "Don't you hit a feller when he's down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What made you fire that stone at me?" demanded our hero, looking down at the fallen bully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just for fun," said Micky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would have been a very agreeable s'prise if it had hit me," said Dick. "S'posin' I fire a rock at you jest for fun."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't!" exclaimed Micky, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems you don't like agreeable s'prises," said Dick, "any more'n the man did what got hooked by a cow one mornin', before breakfast. It didn't improve his appetite much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've most broke my arm," said Micky, ruefully, rubbing the affected limb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it's broke you can't fire no more stones, which is a very cheerin' reflection," said Dick. "Ef you haven't money enough to buy a wooden one I'll lend you a quarter. There's one good thing about wooden ones, they ain't liable to get cold in winter, which is another cheerin' reflection."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want none of yer cheerin' reflections," said Micky, sullenly. "Yer company ain't wanted here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you for your polite invitation to leave," said Dick, bowing ceremoniously. "I'm willin' to go, but ef you throw any more stones at me, Micky Maguire, I'll hurt you worse than the stones did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The only answer made to this warning was a scowl from his fallen opponent. It was quite evident that Dick had the best of it, and he thought it prudent to say nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As I've got a friend waitin' outside, I shall have to tear myself away," said Dick. "You'd better not throw any more stones, Micky Maguire, for it don't seem to agree with your constitution."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Micky muttered something which Dick did not stay to hear. He backed out of the alley, keeping a watchful eye on his fallen foe, and rejoined Henry Fosdick, who was awaiting his return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was it, Dick?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A partic'lar friend of mine, Micky Maguire," said Dick. "He playfully fired a rock at my head as a mark of his 'fection. He loves me like a brother, Micky does."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather a dangerous kind of a friend, I should think," said Fosdick. "He might have killed you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've warned him not to be so 'fectionate another time," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know him," said Henry Fosdick. "He's at the head of a gang of boys living at the Five-Points. He threatened to whip me once because a gentleman employed me to black his boots instead of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's been at the Island two or three times for stealing," said Dick. "I guess he won't touch me again. He'd rather get hold of small boys. If he ever does anything to you, Fosdick, just let me know, and I'll give him a thrashing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was right. Micky Maguire was a bully, and like most bullies did not fancy tackling boys whose strength was equal or superior to his own. Although he hated Dick more than ever, because he thought our hero was putting on airs, he had too lively a remembrance of his strength and courage to venture upon another open attack. He contented himself, therefore, whenever he met Dick, with scowling at him. Dick took this very philosophically, remarking that, "if it was soothin' to Micky's feelings, he might go ahead, as it didn't hurt him much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will not be necessary to chronicle the events of the next few weeks. A new life had commenced for Dick. He no longer haunted the gallery of the Old Bowery; and even Tony Pastor's hospitable doors had lost their old attractions. He spent two hours every evening in study. His progress was astonishingly rapid. He was gifted with a natural quickness; and he was stimulated by the desire to acquire a fair education as a means of "growin' up 'spectable," as he termed it. Much was due also to the patience and perseverance of Henry Fosdick, who made a capital teacher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're improving wonderfully, Dick," said his friend, one evening, when Dick had read an entire paragraph without a mistake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Am I?" said Dick, with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. If you'll buy a writing-book to-morrow, we can begin writing to-morrow evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What else do you know, Henry?" asked Dick</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Arithmetic, and geography, and grammar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a lot you know!" said Dick, admiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know any of them," said Fosdick. "I've only studied them. I wish I knew a great deal more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be satisfied when I know as much as you," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems a great deal to you now, Dick, but in a few months you'll think differently. The more you know, the more you'll want to know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then there ain't any end to learnin'?" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Dick, "I guess I'll be as much as sixty before I know everything."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; as old as that, probably," said Fosdick, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anyway, you know too much to be blackin' boots. Leave that to ignorant chaps like me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't be ignorant long, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd ought to get into some office or countin'-room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could," said Fosdick, earnestly. "I don't succeed very well at blacking boots. You make a great deal more than I do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's cause I ain't troubled with bashfulness," said Dick. "Bashfulness ain't as natural to me as it is to you. I'm always on hand, as the cat said to the milk. You'd better give up shines, Fosdick, and give your 'tention to mercantile pursuits."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've thought of trying to get a place," said Fosdick; "but no one would take me with these clothes;" and he directed his glance to his well-worn suit, which he kept as neat as he could, but which, in spite of all his care, began to show decided marks of use. There was also here and there a stain of blacking upon it, which, though an advertisement of his profession, scarcely added to its good appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I almost wanted to stay at home from Sunday school last Sunday," he continued, "because I thought everybody would notice how dirty and worn my clothes had got to be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If my clothes wasn't two sizes too big for you," said Dick, generously, "I'd change. You'd look as if you'd got into your great-uncle's suit by mistake."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're very kind, Dick, to think of changing," said Fosdick, "for your suit is much better than mine; but I don't think that mine would suit you very well. The pants would show a little more of your ankles than is the fashion, and you couldn't eat a very hearty dinner without bursting the buttons off the vest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That wouldn't be very convenient," said Dick. "I ain't fond of lacin' to show my elegant figger. But I say," he added with a sudden thought, "how much money have we got in the savings' bank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick took a key from his pocket, and went to the drawer in which the bank-books were kept, and, opening it, brought them out for inspection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was found that Dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety cents placed to his credit, while Fosdick had six dollars and forty-five cents. To explain the large difference, it must be remembered that Dick had deposited five dollars before Henry deposited anything, being the amount he had received as a gift from Mr. Whitney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much does that make, the lot of it?" asked Dick. "I ain't much on figgers yet, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It makes twenty-five dollars and thirty-five cents, Dick," said his companion, who did not understand the thought which suggested the question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take it, and buy some clothes, Henry," said Dick, shortly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, your money too?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Dick, you are too generous. I couldn't think of it. Almost three-quarters of the money is yours. You must spend it on yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't need it," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may not need it now, but you will some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall have some more then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That may be; but it wouldn't be fair for me to use your money, Dick. I thank you all the same for your kindness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll lend it to you, then," persisted Dick, "and you can pay me when you get to be a rich merchant."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it isn't likely I ever shall be one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How d'you know? I went to a fortun' teller once, and she told me I was born under a lucky star with a hard name, and I should have a rich man for my particular friend, who would make my fortun'. I guess you are going to be the rich man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick laughed, and steadily refused for some time to avail himself of Dick's generous proposal; but at length, perceiving that our hero seemed much disappointed, and would be really glad if his offer were accepted, he agreed to use as much as might be needful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This at once brought back Dick's good-humor, and he entered with great enthusiasm into his friend's plans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day they withdrew the money from the bank, and, when business got a little slack, in the afternoon set out in search of a clothing store. Dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a place where a good bargain could be obtained. He was determined that Fosdick should have a good serviceable suit, even if it took all the money they had. The result of their search was that for twenty-three dollars Fosdick obtained a very neat outfit, including a couple of shirts, a hat, and a pair of shoes, besides a dark mixed suit, which appeared stout and of good quality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I sent the bundle home?" asked the salesman, impressed by the off-hand manner in which Dick drew out the money in payment for the clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Dick, "you're very kind, but I'll take it home myself, and you can allow me something for my trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said the clerk, laughing; "I'll allow it on your next purchase."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Proceeding to their apartment in Mott Street, Fosdick at once tried on his new suit, and it was found to be an excellent fit. Dick surveyed his new friend with much satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look like a young gentleman of fortun'" he said, "and do credit to your governor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that means you, Dick," said Fosdick, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course it does."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You should say of course," said Fosdick, who, in virtue of his position as Dick's tutor, ventured to correct his language from time to time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How dare you correct your gov'nor?" said Dick, with comic indignation. "`I'll cut you off with a shillin', you young dog,' as the Markis says to his nephew in the play at the Old Bowery."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX FOSDICK CHANGES HIS BUSINESS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his business. This he felt would have been wasteful extravagance. About ten o' clock in the morning, when business slackened, he went home, and dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of the "Morning Herald" and "Sun," and, noting down the places where a boy was wanted, went on a round of applications. But he found it no easy thing to obtain a place. Swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment, and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was another difficulty. It was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents. When Fosdick, on being questioned, revealed the fact of his having no parents, and being a boy of the street, this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal. Merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life. Dick, who was always ready for an emergency, suggested borrowing a white wig, and passing himself off for Fosdick's father or grandfather. But Henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain. After fifty applications and as many failures, Fosdick began to get discouraged. There seemed to be no way out of his present business, for which he felt unfitted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know but I shall have to black boots all my life," he said, one day, despondently, to Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep a stiff upper lip," said Dick. "By the time you get to be a gray-headed veteran, you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the Bowery, which is a very cheerin' reflection."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up Fosdick's courage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As for me," said Dick, "I expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun' out of shines, and live in princely style on the Avenoo."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But one morning, Fosdick, straying into French's Hotel, discovered the following advertisement in the columns of "The Herald,"—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WANTED—A smart, capable boy to run errands, and make himself generally useful in a hat and cap store. Salary three dollars a week at first. Inquire at No. — Broadway, after ten o'clock, A.M."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He determined to make application, and, as the City Hall clock just then struck the hour indicated, lost no time in proceeding to the store, which was only a few blocks distant from the Astor House. It was easy to find the store, as from a dozen to twenty boys were already assembled in front of it. They surveyed each other askance, feeling that they were rivals, and mentally calculating each other's chances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't much chance for me," said Fosdick to Dick, who had accompanied him. "Look at all these boys. Most of them have good homes, I suppose, and good recommendations, while I have nobody to refer to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go ahead," said Dick. "Your chance is as good as anybody's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this was passing between Dick and his companion, one of the boys, a rather supercilious-looking young gentleman, genteelly dressed, and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and himself turned suddenly to Dick, and remarked,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've seen you before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, have you?" said Dick, whirling round; "then p'r'aps you'd like to see me behind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the exception of the questioner, who, evidently, considered that Dick had been disrespectful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've seen you somewhere," he said, in a surly tone, correcting himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Most likely you have," said Dick. "That's where I generally keep myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was another laugh at the expense of Roswell Crawford, for that was the name of the young aristocrat. But he had his revenge ready. No boy relishes being an object of ridicule, and it was with a feeling of satisfaction that he retorted,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know you for all your impudence. You're nothing but a boot-black."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This information took the boys who were standing around by surprise, for Dick was well-dressed, and had none of the implements of his profession with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"S'pose I be," said Dick. "Have you got any objection?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all," said Roswell, curling his lip; "only you'd better stick to blacking boots, and not try to get into a store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you for your kind advice," said Dick. "Is it gratooitous, or do you expect to be paid for it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're an impudent fellow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a very cheerin' reflection," said Dick, good-naturedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you expect to get this place when there's gentlemen's sons applying for it? A boot-black in a store! That would be a good joke."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boys as well as men are selfish, and, looking upon Dick as a possible rival, the boys who listened seemed disposed to take the same view of the situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I say," said one of them, taking sides with Roswell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't trouble yourselves," said Dick. "I ain't agoin' to cut you out. I can't afford to give up a independent and loocrative purfession for a salary of three dollars a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hear him talk!" said Roswell Crawford, with an unpleasant sneer. "If you are not trying to get the place, what are you here for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I came with a friend of mine," said Dick, indicating Fosdick, "who's goin' in for the situation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he a boot-black, too?" demanded Roswell, superciliously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He!" retorted Dick, loftily. "Didn't you know his father was a member of Congress, and intimately acquainted with all the biggest men in the State?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys surveyed Fosdick as if they did not quite know whether to credit this statement, which, for the credit of Dick's veracity, it will be observed he did not assert, but only propounded in the form of a question. There was no time for comment, however, as just then the proprietor of the store came to the door, and, casting his eyes over the waiting group, singled out Roswell Crawford, and asked him to enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my lad, how old are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fourteen years old," said Roswell, consequentially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are your parents living?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only my mother. My father is dead. He was a gentleman," he added, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, was he?" said the shop-keeper. "Do you live in the city?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. In Clinton Place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you ever been in a situation before?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Roswell, a little reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where was it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In an office on Dey Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long were you there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me that was a short time. Why did you not stay longer?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because," said Roswell, loftily, "the man wanted me to get to the office at eight o'clock, and make the fire. I'm a gentleman's son, and am not used to such dirty work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed!" said the shop-keeper. "Well, young gentleman, you may step aside a few minutes. I will speak with some of the other boys before making my selection."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several other boys were called in and questioned. Roswell stood by and listened with an air of complacency. He could not help thinking his chances the best. "The man can see I'm a gentleman, and will do credit to his store," he thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length it came to Fosdick's turn. He entered with no very sanguine anticipations of success. Unlike Roswell, he set a very low estimate upon his qualifications when compared with those of other applicants. But his modest bearing, and quiet, gentlemanly manner, entirely free from pretension, prepossessed the shop-keeper, who was a sensible man, in his favor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you reside in the city?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your age?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Twelve."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you ever been in any situation?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to see a specimen of your handwriting. Here, take the pen and write your name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry Fosdick had a very handsome handwriting for a boy of his age, while Roswell, who had submitted to the same test, could do little more than scrawl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you reside with your parents?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, they are dead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you live, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In Mott Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Roswell curled his lip when this name was pronounced, for Mott Street, as my New York readers know, is in the immediate neighborhood of the Five-Points, and very far from a fashionable locality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any testimonials to present?" asked Mr. Henderson, for that was his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick hesitated. This was the question which he had foreseen would give him trouble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But at this moment it happened most opportunely that Mr. Greyson entered the shop with the intention of buying a hat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick, promptly; "I will refer to this gentleman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Fosdick?" asked Mr. Greyson, noticing him for the first time. "How do you happen to be here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am applying for a place, sir," said Fosdick. "May I refer the gentleman to you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, I shall be glad to speak a good word for you. Mr. Henderson, this is a member of my Sunday-school class, of whose good qualities and good abilities I can speak confidently."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will be sufficient," said the shop-keeper, who knew Mr. Greyson's high character and position. "He could have no better recommendation. You may come to the store to-morrow morning at half past seven o'clock. The pay will be three dollars a week for the first six months. If I am satisfied with you, I shall then raise it to five dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other boys looked disappointed, but none more so than Roswell Crawford. He would have cared less if any one else had obtained the situation; but for a boy who lived in Mott Street to be preferred to him, a gentleman's son, he considered indeed humiliating. In a spirit of petty spite, he was tempted to say,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a boot-black. Ask him if he isn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's an honest and intelligent lad," said Mr. Greyson. "As for you, young man, I only hope you have one-half his good qualities."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Roswell Crawford left the store in disgust, and the other unsuccessful applicants with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What luck, Fosdick?" asked Dick, eagerly, as his friend came out of the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got the place," said Fosdick, in accents of satisfaction; "but it was only because Mr. Greyson spoke up for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a trump," said Dick, enthusiastically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gentleman, so denominated, came out before the boys went away, and spoke with them kindly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both Dick and Henry were highly pleased at the success of the application. The pay would indeed be small, but, expended economically, Fosdick thought he could get along on it, receiving his room rent, as before, in return for his services as Dick's private tutor. Dick determined, as soon as his education would permit, to follow his companion's example.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know as you'll be willin' to room with a boot-black," he said, to Henry, "now you're goin' into business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't room with a better friend, Dick," said Fosdick, affectionately, throwing his arm round our hero. "When we part, it'll be because you wish it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Fosdick entered upon a new career.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX NINE MONTHS LATER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning Fosdick rose early, put on his new suit, and, after getting breakfast, set out for the Broadway store in which he had obtained a position. He left his little blacking-box in the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It'll do to brush my own shoes," he said. "Who knows but I may have to come back to it again?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No danger," said Dick; "I'll take care of the feet, and you'll have to look after the heads, now you're in a hat-store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you had a place too," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know enough yet," said Dick. "Wait till I've gradooated."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And can put A. B. after your name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It stands for Bachelor of Arts. It's a degree that students get when they graduate from college."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh," said Dick, "I didn't know but it meant A Boot-black. I can put that after my name now. Wouldn't Dick Hunter, A.B., sound tip-top?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must be going," said Fosdick. "It won't do for me to be late the very first morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the difference between you and me," said Dick. "I'm my own boss, and there ain't no one to find fault with me if I'm late. But I might as well be goin' too. There's a gent as comes down to his store pretty early that generally wants a shine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys parted at the Park. Fosdick crossed it, and proceeded to the hat-store, while Dick, hitching up his pants, began to look about him for a customer. It was seldom that Dick had to wait long. He was always on the alert, and if there was any business to do he was always sure to get his share of it. He had now a stronger inducement than ever to attend strictly to business; his little stock of money in the savings bank having been nearly exhausted by his liberality to his room-mate. He determined to be as economical as possible, and moreover to study as hard as he could, that he might be able to follow Fosdick's example, and obtain a place in a store or counting-room. As there were no striking incidents occurring in our hero's history within the next nine months, I propose to pass over that period, and recount the progress he made in that time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick was still at the hat-store, having succeeded in giving perfect satisfaction to Mr. Henderson. His wages had just been raised to five dollars a week. He and Dick still kept house together at Mrs. Mooney's lodging-house, and lived very frugally, so that both were able to save up money. Dick had been unusually successful in business. He had several regular patrons, who had been drawn to him by his ready wit, and quick humor, and from two of them he had received presents of clothing, which had saved him any expense on that score. His income had averaged quite seven dollars a week in addition to this. Of this amount he was now obliged to pay one dollar weekly for the room which he and Fosdick occupied, but he was still able to save one half the remainder. At the end of nine months therefore, or thirty-nine weeks, it will be seen that he had accumulated no less a sum than one hundred and seventeen dollars. Dick may be excused for feeling like a capitalist when he looked at the long row of deposits in his little bank-book. There were other boys in the same business who had earned as much money, but they had had little care for the future, and spent as they went along, so that few could boast a bank-account, however small.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll be a rich man some time, Dick," said Henry Fosdick, one evening."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And live on Fifth Avenoo," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps so. Stranger things have happened."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Dick, "if such a misfortin' should come upon me I should bear it like a man. When you see a Fifth Avenoo manshun for sale for a hundred and seventeen dollars, just let me know and I'll buy it as an investment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two hundred and fifty years ago you might have bought one for that price, probably. Real estate wasn't very high among the Indians."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just my luck," said Dick; "I was born too late. I'd orter have been an Indian, and lived in splendor on my present capital."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid you'd have found your present business rather unprofitable at that time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Dick had gained something more valuable than money. He had studied regularly every evening, and his improvement had been marvellous. He could now read well, write a fair hand, and had studied arithmetic as far as Interest. Besides this he had obtained some knowledge of grammar and geography. If some of my boy readers, who have been studying for years, and got no farther than this, should think it incredible that Dick, in less than a year, and studying evenings only, should have accomplished it, they must remember that our hero was very much in earnest in his desire to improve. He knew that, in order to grow up respectable, he must be well advanced, and he was willing to work. But then the reader must not forget that Dick was naturally a smart boy. His street education had sharpened his faculties, and taught him to rely upon himself. He knew that it would take him a long time to reach the goal which he had set before him, and he had patience to keep on trying. He knew that he had only himself to depend upon, and he determined to make the most of himself,—a resolution which is the secret of success in nine cases out of ten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick," said Fosdick, one evening, after they had completed their studies, "I think you'll have to get another teacher soon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?" asked Dick, in some surprise. "Have you been offered a more loocrative position?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Fosdick, "but I find I have taught you all I know myself. You are now as good a scholar as I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that true?" said Dick, eagerly, a flush of gratification coloring his brown cheek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick. "You've made wonderful progress. I propose, now that evening schools have begun, that we join one, and study together through the winter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Dick. "I'd be willin' to go now; but when I first began to study I was ashamed to have anybody know that I was so ignorant. Do you really mean, Fosdick, that I know as much as you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Dick, it's true."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I've got you to thank for it," said Dick, earnestly. "You've made me what I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And haven't you paid me, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By payin' the room-rent," said Dick, impulsively. "What's that? It isn't half enough. I wish you'd take half my money; you deserve it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Dick, but you're too generous. You've more than paid me. Who was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me? And who gave me money to buy clothes, and so got me my situation?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's nothing!" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a great deal, Dick. I shall never forget it. But now it seems to me you might try to get a situation yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do I know enough?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know as much as I do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll try," said Dick, decidedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish there was a place in our store," said Fosdick. "It would be pleasant for us to be together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," said Dick; "there'll be plenty of other chances. P'r'aps A. T. Stewart might like a partner. I wouldn't ask more'n a quarter of the profits."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which would be a very liberal proposal on your part," said Fosdick, smiling. "But perhaps Mr. Stewart might object to a partner living on Mott Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd just as lieves move to Fifth Avenoo," said Dick. "I ain't got no prejudices in favor of Mott Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor I," said Fosdick, "and in fact I have been thinking it might be a good plan for us to move as soon as we could afford. Mrs. Mooney doesn't keep the room quite so neat as she might."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick. "She ain't got no prejudices against dirt. Look at that towel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick held up the article indicated, which had now seen service nearly a week, and hard service at that,—Dick's avocation causing him to be rather hard on towels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick, "I've got about tired of it. I guess we can find some better place without having to pay much more. When we move, you must let me pay my share of the rent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll see about that," said Dick. "Do you propose to move to Fifth Avenoo?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not just at present, but to some more agreeable neighborhood than this. We'll wait till you get a situation, and then we can decide."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few days later, as Dick was looking about for customers in the neighborhood of the Park, his attention was drawn to a fellow boot-black, a boy about a year younger than himself, who appeared to have been crying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter, Tom?" asked Dick. "Haven't you had luck to-day?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty good," said the boy; "but we're havin' hard times at home. Mother fell last week and broke her arm, and to-morrow we've got to pay the rent, and if we don't the landlord says he'll turn us out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Haven't you got anything except what you earn?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Tom, "not now. Mother used to earn three or four dollars a week; but she can't do nothin' now, and my little sister and brother are too young."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick had quick sympathies. He had been so poor himself, and obliged to submit to so many privations that he knew from personal experience how hard it was. Tom Wilkins he knew as an excellent boy who never squandered his money, but faithfully carried it home to his mother. In the days of his own extravagance and shiftlessness he had once or twice asked Tom to accompany him to the Old Bowery or Tony Pastor's, but Tom had always steadily refused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry for you, Tom," he said. "How much do you owe for rent?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two weeks now," said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much is it a week?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two dollars a week—that makes four."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got anything towards it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I've had to spend all my money for food for mother and the rest of us. I've had pretty hard work to do that. I don't know what we'll do. I haven't any place to go to, and I'm afraid mother'll get cold in her arm."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you borrow the money somewhere?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom shook his head despondingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All the people I know are as poor as I am," said he. "They'd help me if they could, but it's hard work for them to get along themselves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you what, Tom," said Dick, impulsively, "I'll stand your friend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got any money?" asked Tom, doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got any money!" repeated Dick. "Don't you know that I run a bank on my own account? How much is it you need?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Four dollars," said Tom. "If we don't pay that before to-morrow night, out we go. You haven't got as much as that, have you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here are three dollars," said Dick, drawing out his pocket-book. "I'll let you have the rest to-morrow, and maybe a little more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a right down good fellow, Dick," said Tom; "but won't you want it yourself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I've got some more," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I'll never be able to pay you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"S'pose you don't," said Dick; "I guess I won't fail."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't forget it, Dick. I hope I'll be able to do somethin' for you sometime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Dick. "I'd ought to help you. I haven't got no mother to look out for. I wish I had."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a tinge of sadness in his tone, as he pronounced the last four words; but Dick's temperament was sanguine, and he never gave way to unavailing sadness. Accordingly he began to whistle as he turned away, only adding, "I'll see you to-morrow, Tom."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three dollars which Dick had handed to Tom Wilkins were his savings for the present week. It was now Thursday afternoon. His rent, which amounted to a dollar, he expected to save out of the earnings of Friday and Saturday. In order to give Tom the additional assistance he had promised, Dick would be obliged to have recourse to his bank-savings. He would not have ventured to trench upon it for any other reason but this. But he felt that it would be selfish to allow Tom and his mother to suffer when he had it in his power to relieve them. But Dick was destined to be surprised, and that in a disagreeable manner, when he reached home.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI DICK LOSES HIS BANK-BOOK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was hinted at the close of the last chapter that Dick was destined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having agreed to give further assistance to Tom Wilkins, he was naturally led to go to the drawer where he and Fosdick kept their bank-books. To his surprise and uneasiness the drawer proved to be empty!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come here a minute, Fosdick," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter, Dick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't find my bank-book, nor yours either. What's `come of them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I took mine with me this morning, thinking I might want to put in a little more money. I've got it in my pocket, now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But where's mine?" asked Dick, perplexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. I saw it in the drawer when I took mine this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, positive, for I looked into it to see how much you had got."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you lock it again?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; didn't you have to unlock it just now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I did," said Dick. "But it's gone now. Somebody opened it with a key that fitted the lock, and then locked it ag'in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That must have been the way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's rather hard on a feller," said Dick, who, for the first time since we became acquainted with him, began to feel downhearted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't give it up, Dick. You haven't lost the money, only the bank-book."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't that the same thing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. You can go to the bank to-morrow morning, as soon as it opens, and tell them you have lost the book, and ask them not to pay the money to any one except yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I can," said Dick, brightening up. "That is, if the thief hasn't been to the bank to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he has, they might detect him by his handwriting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to get hold of the one that stole it," said Dick, indignantly. "I'd give him a good lickin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must have been somebody in the house. Suppose we go and see Mrs. Mooney. She may know whether anybody came into our room to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys went downstairs, and knocked at the door of a little back sitting-room where Mrs. Mooney generally spent her evenings. It was a shabby little room, with a threadbare carpet on the floor, the walls covered with a certain large-figured paper, patches of which had been stripped off here and there, exposing the plaster, the remainder being defaced by dirt and grease. But Mrs. Mooney had one of those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt, and didn't mind it in the least. She was seated beside a small pine work-table, industriously engaged in mending stockings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening, Mrs. Mooney," said Fosdick, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening," said the landlady. "Sit down, if you can find chairs. I'm hard at work as you see, but a poor lone widder can't afford to be idle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can't stop long, Mrs. Mooney, but my friend here has had something taken from his room to-day, and we thought we'd come and see you about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" asked the landlady. "You don't think I'd take anything? If I am poor, it's an honest name I've always had, as all my lodgers can testify."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not, Mrs. Mooney; but there are others in the house that may not be honest. My friend has lost his bank-book. It was safe in the drawer this morning, but tonight it is not to be found."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much money was there in it?" asked Mrs. Mooney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over a hundred dollars," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was my whole fortun'," said Dick. "I was goin' to buy a house next year."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of Dick's wealth, and was disposed to regard him with increased respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was the drawer locked?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it couldn't have been Bridget. I don't think she has any keys."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She wouldn't know what a bank-book was," said Fosdick. "You didn't see any of the lodgers go into our room today, did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't wonder if it was Jim Travis," said Mrs. Mooney, suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This James Travis was a bar-tender in a low groggery in Mulberry Street, and had been for a few weeks an inmate of Mrs. Mooney's lodging-house. He was a coarse-looking fellow who, from his appearance, evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out to others. He occupied a room opposite Dick's, and was often heard by the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication, uttering shocking oaths.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Travis had made several friendly overtures to Dick and his room-mate, and had invited them to call round at the bar-room where he tended, and take something. But this invitation had never been accepted, partly because the boys were better engaged in the evening, and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to Mr. Travis; which certainly was not strange, for nature had not gifted him with many charms, either of personal appearance or manners. The rejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike to Dick and Henry, whom he considered stiff and unsocial.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think it was Travis?" asked Fosdick. "He isn't at home in the daytime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he was to-day. He said he had got a bad cold, and had to come home for a clean handkerchief."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you see him?" asked Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Mrs. Mooney. "Bridget was hanging out clothes, and I went to the door to let him in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Mrs. Mooney. "The bureaus in the two rooms are just alike. I got 'em at auction, and most likely the locks is the same."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must have been he," said Dick, looking towards Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick, "it looks like it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's to be done? That's what I'd like to know," said Dick. "Of course he'll say he hasn't got it; and he won't be such a fool as to leave it in his room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he hasn't been to the bank, it's all right," said Fosdick. "You can go there the first thing tomorrow morning, and stop their paying any money on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I can't get any money on it myself," said Dick. "I told Tom Wilkins I'd let him have some more money tomorrow, or his sick mother'll have to turn out of their lodgin's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much money were you going to give him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I gave him three dollars to-day, and was goin' to give him two dollars tomorrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got the money, Dick. I didn't go to the bank this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. I'll take it, and pay you back next week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Dick; if you've given three dollars, you must let me give two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Fosdick, I'd rather give the whole. You know I've got more money than you. No, I haven't, either," said Dick, the memory of his loss flashing upon him. "I thought I was rich this morning, but now I'm in destitoot circumstances."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cheer up, Dick; you'll get your money back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so," said our hero, rather ruefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fact was, that our friend Dick was beginning to feel what is so often experienced by men who do business of a more important character and on a larger scale than he, the bitterness of a reverse of circumstances. With one hundred dollars and over carefully laid away in the savings bank, he had felt quite independent. Wealth is comparative, and Dick probably felt as rich as many men who are worth a hundred thousand dollars. He was beginning to feel the advantages of his steady self-denial, and to experience the pleasures of property. Not that Dick was likely to be unduly attached to money. Let it be said to his credit that it had never given him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help Tom Wilkins in his trouble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides this, there was another thought that troubled him. When he obtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was now making from blacking boots,—probably not more than three dollars a week,—while his expenses without clothing would amount to four dollars. To make up the deficiency he had confidently relied upon his savings, which would be sufficient to carry him along for a year, if necessary. If he should not recover his money, he would be compelled to continue a boot-black for at least six months longer; and this was rather a discouraging reflection. On the whole it is not to be wondered at that Dick felt unusually sober this evening, and that neither of the boys felt much like studying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to Travis about it. It was not altogether easy to decide. Fosdick was opposed to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will only put him on his guard," said he, "and I don't see as it will do any good. Of course he will deny it. We'd better keep quiet, and watch him, and, by giving notice at the bank, we can make sure that he doesn't get any money on it. If he does present himself at the bank, they will know at once that he is a thief, and he can be arrested."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This view seemed reasonable, and Dick resolved to adopt it. On the whole, he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at first supposed, and his spirits rose a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How'd he know I had any bank-book? That's what I can't make out," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you remember?" said Fosdick, after a moment's thought, "we were speaking of our savings, two or three evenings since?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Our door was a little open at the time, and I heard somebody come upstairs, and stop a minute in front of it. It must have been Jim Travis. In that way he probably found out about your money, and took the opportunity to-day to get hold of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This might or might not be the correct explanation. At all events it seemed probable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys were just on the point of going to bed, later in the evening, when a knock was heard at the door, and, to their no little surprise, their neighbor, Jim Travis, proved to be the caller. He was a sallow-complexioned young man, with dark hair and bloodshot eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered, which did not escape the boys' notice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are ye, to-night?" he said, sinking into one of the two chairs with which the room was scantily furnished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jolly," said Dick. "How are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tired as a dog," was the reply. "Hard work and poor pay; that's the way with me. I wanted to go to the theater, to-night, but I was hard up, and couldn't raise the cash."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here he darted another quick glance at the boys; but neither betrayed anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't go out much, do you?" he said</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much," said Fosdick. "We spend our evenings in study."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's precious slow," said Travis, rather contemptuously. "What's the use of studying so much? You don't expect to be a lawyer, do you, or anything of that sort?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe," said Dick. "I haven't made up my mind yet. If my feller-citizens should want me to go to Congress some time, I shouldn't want to disapp'int 'em; and then readin' and writin' might come handy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Travis, rather abruptly, "I'm tired and I guess I'll turn in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He came in to see if we'd missed the bank-book," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And to turn off suspicion from himself, by letting us know he had no money," added Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," said Dick. "I'd like to have searched them pockets of his."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII TRACKING THE THlEF</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fosdick was right in supposing that Jim Travis had stolen the bank-book. He was also right in supposing that that worthy young man had come to the knowledge of Dick's savings by what he had accidentally overheard. Now, Travis, like a very large number of young men of his class, was able to dispose of a larger amount of money than he was able to earn. Moreover, he had no great fancy for work at all, and would have been glad to find some other way of obtaining money enough to pay his expenses. He had recently received a letter from an old companion, who had strayed out to California, and going at once to the mines had been lucky enough to get possession of a very remunerative claim. He wrote to Travis that he had already realized two thousand dollars from it, and expected to make his fortune within six months.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two thousand dollars! This seemed to Travis a very large sum, and quite dazzled his imagination. He was at once inflamed with the desire to go out to California and try his luck. In his present situation he only received thirty dollars a month, which was probably all that his services were worth, but went a very little way towards gratifying his expensive tastes. Accordingly he determined to take the next steamer to the land of gold, if he could possibly manage to get money enough to pay the passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The price of a steerage passage at that time was seventy-five dollars,—not a large sum, certainly,—but it might as well have been seventy-five hundred for any chance James Travis had of raising the amount at present. His available funds consisted of precisely two dollars and a quarter; of which sum, one dollar and a half was due to his washerwoman. This, however, would not have troubled Travis much, and he would conveniently have forgotten all about it; but, even leaving this debt unpaid, the sum at his command would not help him materially towards paying his passage money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis applied for help to two or three of his companions; but they were all of that kind who never keep an account with savings banks, but carry all their spare cash about with them. One of these friends offered to lend him thirty-seven cents, and another a dollar; but neither of these offers seemed to encourage him much. He was about giving up his project in despair, when he learned, accidentally, as we have already said, the extent of Dick's savings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One hundred and seventeen dollars! Why, that would not only pay his passage, but carry him up to the mines, after he had arrived in San Francisco. He could not help thinking it over, and the result of this thinking was that he determined to borrow it of Dick without leave. Knowing that neither of the boys were in their room in the daytime, he came back in the course of the morning, and, being admitted by Mrs. Mooney herself, said, by way of accounting for his presence, that he had a cold, and had come back for a handkerchief. The landlady suspected nothing, and, returning at once to her work in the kitchen, left the coast clear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis at once entered Dick's room, and, as there seemed to be no other place for depositing money, tried the bureau-drawers. They were all readily opened, except one, which proved to be locked. This he naturally concluded must contain the money, and going back to his own chamber for the key of the bureau, tried it on his return, and found to his satisfaction that it would fit. When he discovered the bank-book, his joy was mingled with disappointment. He had expected to find bank-bills instead. This would have saved all further trouble, and would have been immediately available. Obtaining money at the savings bank would involve fresh risk. Travis hesitated whether to take it or not; but finally decided that it would be worth the trouble and hazard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He accordingly slipped the book into his pocket, locked the drawer again, and, forgetting all about the handkerchief for which he had come home went downstairs, and into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There would have been time to go to the savings bank that day, but Travis had already been absent from his place of business some time, and did not venture to take the additional time required. Besides, not being very much used to savings banks, never having had occasion to use them, he thought it would be more prudent to look over the rules and regulations, and see if he could not get some information as to the way he ought to proceed. So the day passed, and Dick's money was left in safety at the bank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the evening, it occurred to Travis that it might be well to find out whether Dick had discovered his loss. This reflection it was that induced the visit which is recorded at the close of the last chapter. The result was that he was misled by the boys' silence on the subject, and concluded that nothing had yet been discovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good!" thought Travis, with satisfaction. "If they don't find out for twenty-four hours, it'll be too late, then, and I shall be all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There being a possibility of the loss being discovered before the boys went out in the morning, Travis determined to see them at that time, and judge whether such was the case. He waited, therefore, until he heard the boys come out, and then opened his own door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Morning, gents," said he, sociably. "Going to business?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Dick. "I'm afraid my clerks'll be lazy if I ain't on hand."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good joke!" said Travis. "If you pay good wages, I'd like to speak for a place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I pay all I get myself," said Dick. "How's business with you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So so. Why don't you call round, some time?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All my evenin's is devoted to literatoor and science," said Dick. "Thank you all the same."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you hang out?" inquired Travis, in choice language, addressing Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At Henderson's hat and cap store, on Broadway."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll look in upon you some time when I want a tile," said Travis. "I suppose you sell cheaper to your friends."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be as reasonable as I can," said Fosdick, not very cordially; for he did not much fancy having it supposed by his employer that such a disreputable-looking person as Travis was a friend of his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, Travis had no idea of showing himself at the Broadway store, and only said this by way of making conversation, and encouraging the boys to be social.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't any of you gents seen a pearl-handled knife, have you?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Fosdick; "have you lost one?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Travis, with unblushing falsehood. "I left it on my bureau a day or two since. I've missed one or two other little matters. Bridget don't look to me any too honest. Likely she's got 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you goin' to do about it?" said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll keep mum unless I lose something more, and then I'll kick up a row, and haul her over the coals. Have you missed anything?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Fosdick, answering for himself, as he could do without violating the truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of Travis, as he heard this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They haven't found it out yet," he thought. "I'll bag the money to-day, and then they may whistle for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys, he bade them good-morning, and turned down another street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's mighty friendly all of a sudden," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Fosdick; "it's very evident what it all means. He wants to find out whether you have discovered your loss or not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he didn't find out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; we've put him on the wrong track. He means to get his money to-day, no doubt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My money," suggested Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I accept the correction," said Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, Dick, you'll be on hand as soon as the bank opens."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In course I shall. Jim Travis'll find he's walked into the wrong shop."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The bank opens at ten o'clock, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be there on time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys separated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good luck, Dick," said Fosdick, as he parted from him. "It'll all come out right, I think."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope 'twill," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had recovered from his temporary depression, and made up his mind that the money would be recovered. He had no idea of allowing himself to be outwitted by Jim Travis, and enjoyed already, in anticipation, the pleasure of defeating his rascality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It wanted two hours and a half yet to ten o'clock, and this time to Dick was too precious to be wasted. It was the time of his greatest harvest. He accordingly repaired to his usual place of business, succeeded in obtaining six customers, which yielded him sixty cents. He then went to a restaurant, and got some breakfast. It was now half-past nine, and Dick, feeling that it wouldn't do to be late, left his box in charge of Johnny Nolan, and made his way to the bank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The officers had not yet arrived, and Dick lingered on the outside, waiting till they should come. He was not without a little uneasiness, fearing that Travis might be as prompt as himself, and finding him there, might suspect something, and so escape the snare. But, though looking cautiously up and down the street, he could discover no traces of the supposed thief. In due time ten o'clock struck, and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown open, and our hero entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last nine months, the cashier had come to know him by sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're early, this morning, my lad," he said, pleasantly. "Have you got some more money to deposit? You'll be getting rich, soon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know about that," said Dick. "My bank-book's been stole."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stolen!" echoed the cashier. "That's unfortunate. Not so bad as it might be, though. The thief can't collect the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I came to see about," said Dick. "I was afraid he might have got it already."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He hasn't been here yet. Even if he had, I remember you, and should have detected him. When was it taken?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yesterday," said Dick. "I missed it in the evenin' when I got home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any suspicion as to the person who took it?" asked the cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and suspicious conduct of Jim Travis, and the cashier agreed with him that he was probably the thief. Dick also gave his reason for thinking that he would visit the bank that morning, to withdraw the funds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good," said the cashier. "We'll be ready for him. What is the number of your book?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. 5,678," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now give me a litttle description of this Travis whom you suspect."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of Travis, not particularly complimentary to the latter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will answer. I think I shall know him," said the cashier. "You may depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Considerably relieved in mind, our hero turned towards the door, thinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer, while he would of course lose time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had just reached the doors, which were of glass, when through them he perceived James Travis himself just crossing the street, and apparently coming towards the bank. It would not do, of course, for him to be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here he is," he exclaimed, hurrying back. "Can't you hide me somewhere? I don't want to be seen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cashier understood at once how the land lay. He quickly opened a little door, and admitted Dick behind the counter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stoop down," he said, "so as not to be seen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick had hardly done so when Jim Travis opened the outer door, and, looking about him in a little uncertainty, walked up to the cashier' s desk.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII TRAVIS lS ARRESTED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim Travis advanced into the bank with a doubtful step, knowing well that he was on a dishonest errand, and heartily wishing that he were well out of it. After a little hesitation, he approached the paying-teller, and, exhibiting the bank-book, said, "I want to get my money out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bank-officer took the book, and, after looking at it a moment, said, "How much do you want?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The whole of it," said Travis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can draw out any part of it, but to draw out the whole requires a week's notice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll take a hundred dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you the person to whom the book belongs?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," said Travis, without hesitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your name is—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hunter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bank-clerk went to a large folio volume, containing the names of depositors, and began to turn over the leaves. While he was doing this, he managed to send out a young man connected with the bank for a policeman. Travis did not perceive this, or did not suspect that it had anything to do with himself. Not being used to savings banks, he supposed the delay only what was usual. After a search, which was only intended to gain time that a policeman might be summoned, the cashier came back, and, sliding out a piece of paper to Travis, said, "It will be necessary for you to write an order for the money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis took a pen, which he found on the ledge outside, and wrote the order, signing his name "Dick Hunter," having observed that name on the outside of the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your name is Dick Hunter, then?" said the cashier, taking the paper, and looking at the thief over his spectacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Travis, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But," continued the cashier, "I find Hunter's age is put down on the bank-book as fourteen. Surely you must be more than that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis would gladly have declared that he was only fourteen; but, being in reality twenty-three, and possessing a luxuriant pair of whiskers, this was not to be thought of. He began to feel uneasy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dick Hunter's my younger brother," he said. "I'm getting out the money for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you said your own name was Dick Hunter," said the cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I said my name was Hunter," said Travis, ingeniously. "I didn't understand you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you've signed the name of Dick Hunter to this order. How is that?" questioned the troublesome cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis saw that he was getting himself into a tight place; but his self-possession did not desert him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought I must give my brother's name," he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your own name?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Henry Hunter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you bring any one to testify that the statement you are making is correct?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, a dozen if you like," said Travis, boldly. "Give me the book, and I'll come back this afternoon. I didn't think there'd be such a fuss about getting out a little money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a moment. Why don't your brother come himself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because he's sick. He's down with the measles," said Travis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the cashier signed to Dick to rise and show himself. Our hero accordingly did so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will be glad to find that he has recovered," said the cashier, pointing to Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With an exclamation of anger and dismay, Travis, who saw the game was up, started for the door, feeling that safety made such a course prudent. But he was too late. He found himself confronted by a burly policeman, who seized him by the arm, saying, "Not so fast, my man. I want you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me go," exclaimed Travis, struggling to free himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry I can't oblige you," said the officer. "You'd better not make a fuss, or I may have to hurt you a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis sullenly resigned himself to his fate, darting a look of rage at Dick, whom he considered the author of his present misfortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is your book," said the cashier, handing back his rightful property to our hero. "Do you wish to draw out any money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two dollars," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well. Write an order for the amount."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before doing so, Dick, who now that he saw Travis in the power of the law began to pity him, went up to the officer, and said,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you let him go? I've got my bank-book back, and I don't want anything done to him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sorry I can't oblige you," said the officer; "but I'm not allowed to do it. He'll have to stand his trial."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry for you, Travis," said Dick. "I didn't want you arrested. I only wanted my bank-book back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Curse you!" said Travis, scowling vindictively. "Wait till I get free. See if I don't fix you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You needn't pity him too much," said the officer. "I know him now. He's been to the Island before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a lie," said Travis, violently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be too noisy, my friend," said the officer. "If you've got no more business here, we'll be going."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He withdrew with the prisoner in charge, and Dick, having drawn his two dollars, left the bank. Notwithstanding the violent words the prisoner had used towards himself, and his attempted robbery, he could not help feeling sorry that he had been instrumental in causing his arrest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll keep my book a little safer hereafter," thought Dick. "Now I must go and see Tom Wilkins."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before dismissing the subject of Travis and his theft, it may be remarked that he was duly tried, and, his guilt being clear, was sent to Blackwell's Island for nine months. At the end of that time, on his release, he got a chance to work his passage on a ship to San Francisco, where he probably arrived in due time. At any rate, nothing more has been heard of him, and probably his threat of vengence against Dick will never be carried into effect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Returning to the City Hall Park, Dick soon fell in with Tom Wilkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Tom?" he said. "How's your mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's better, Dick, thank you. She felt worried about bein' turned out into the street; but I gave her that money from you, and now she feels a good deal easier."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got some more for you, Tom," said Dick, producing a two-dollar bill from his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ought not to take it from you, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it's all right, Tom. Don't be afraid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you may need it yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's plenty more where that came from."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Any way, one dollar will be enough. With that we can pay the rent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll want the other to buy something to eat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're very kind, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd ought to be. I've only got myself to take care of."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll take it for my mother's sake. When you want anything done just call on Tom Wilkins."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Next week, if your mother doesn't get better, I'll give you some more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom thanked our hero very gratefully, and Dick walked away, feeling the self-approval which always accompanies a generous and disinterested action. He was generous by nature, and, before the period at which he is introduced to the reader's notice, he frequently treated his friends to cigars and oyster-stews. Sometimes he invited them to accompany him to the theatre at his expense. But he never derived from these acts of liberality the same degree of satisfaction as from this timely gift to Tom Wilkins. He felt that his money was well bestowed, and would save an entire family from privation and discomfort. Five dollars would, to be sure, make something of a difference in the mount of his savings. It was more than he was able to save up in a week. But Dick felt fully repaid for what he had done, and he felt prepared to give as much more, if Tom's mother should continue to be sick, and should appear to him to need it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides all this, Dick felt a justifiable pride in his financial ability to afford so handsome a gift. A year before, however much he might have desired to give, it would have been quite out of his power to give five dollars. His cash balance never reached that amount. It was seldom, indeed, that it equalled one dollar. In more ways than one Dick was beginning to reap the advantage of his self-denial and judicious economy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be remembered that when Mr. Whitney at parting with Dick presented him with five dollars, he told him that he might repay it to some other boy who was struggling upward. Dick thought of this, and it occurred to him that after all he was only paying up an old debt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Fosdick came home in the evening, Dick announced his success in recovering his lost money, and described the manner it had been brought about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're in luck," said Fosdick. "I guess we'd better not trust the bureau-drawer again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean to carry my book round with me," said Dick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So shall I, as long as we stay at Mrs. Mooney's. I wish we were in a better place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must go down and tell her she needn't expect Travis back. Poor chap, I pity him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Travis was never more seen in Mrs. Mooney's establishment. He was owing that lady for a fortnight's rent of his room, which prevented her feeling much compassion for him. The room was soon after let to a more creditable tenant who proved a less troublesome neighbor than his predecessor.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV DICK RECEIVES A LETTER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about a week after Dick's recovery of his bank-book, that Fosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the "Daily Sun." "Would you like to see your name in print, Dick?" he asked. "Yes," said Dick, who was busy at the wash-stand, endeavoring to efface the marks which his day's work had left upon his hands. "They haven't put me up for mayor, have they? 'Cause if they have, I shan't accept. It would interfere too much with my private business." "No," said Fosdick, "they haven't put you up for office yet, though that may happen sometime. But if you want to see your name in print, here it is." Dick was rather incredulous, but, having dried his hands on the towel, took the paper, and following the directions of Fosdick's finger, observed in the list of advertised letters the name of "RAGGED DICK." "By gracious, so it is," said he. "Do you s'poseit means me?" "I don't know of any other Ragged Dick,—do you?" "No," said Dick, reflectively; "it must be me. But I don't know of anybody that would be likely to write to me." "Perhaps it is Frank Whitney," suggested Fosdick, after a little reflection. "Didn't he promise to write to you?" "Yes," said Dick, "and he wanted me to write to him." "Where is he now?" "He was going to a boarding-school in Connecticut, he said. The name of the town was Barnton." "Very likely the letter is from him." "I hope it is. Frank was a tip-top boy, and he was the first that made me ashamed of bein' so ignorant and dirty." "You had better go to the post-office to-morrow morning, and ask for the letter." "P'r'aps they won't give it to me." "Suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago, when Frank first saw you? They won't have any doubt of your being Ragged Dick then." "I guess I will. I'll be sort of ashamed to be seen in 'em though," said Dick, who had considerable more pride in a neat personal appearance than when we were first introduced to him. "It will be only for one day, or one morning," said Fosdick. "I'd do more'n that for the sake of gettin' a letter from Frank. I'd like to see him." The next morning, in accordance with the suggestion of Fosdick, Dick arrayed himself in the long disused Washington coat and Napoleon pants, which he had carefully preserved, for what reason he could hardly explain. When fairly equipped, Dick surveyed himself in the mirror,— if the little seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass, with which the room was furnished, deserved the name. The result of the survey was not on the whole a pleasing one. To tell the truth, Dick was quite ashamed of his appearance, and, on opening the chamber-door, looked around to see that the coast was clear, not being willing to have any of his fellow-boarders see him in his present attire He managed to slip out into the street unobserved, and, after attending to two or three regular customers who came down-town early in the morning, he made his way down Nassau Street to the post-office. He passed along until he came to a compartment on which he read ADVERTISED LETTERS, and, stepping up to the little window, said,— "There's a letter for me. I saw it advertised in the `Sun' yesterday." "What name?" demanded the clerk. "Ragged Dick," answered our hero. "That's a queer name," said the clerk, surveying him a little curiously. "Are you Ragged Dick?" "If you don't believe me, look at my clo'es," said Dick. "That's pretty good proof, certainly," said the clerk, laughing. "If that isn't your name, it deserves to be." "I believe in dressin' up to your name," said Dick. "Do you know any one in Barnton, Connecticut?" asked the clerk, who had by this time found the letter. "Yes," said Dick. "I know a chap that's at boardin'-school there." "It appears to be in a boy's hand. I think it must be yours." The letter was handed to Dick through the window. He received it eagerly, and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng who were constantly applying for letters, or slipping them into the boxes provided for them, hastily opened it, and began to read. As the reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well as Dick, we transcribe it below. It was dated Barnton, Conn., and commenced thus,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"DEAR DICK,— You must excuse my addressing this letter to `Ragged Dick'; but the fact is, I don't know what your last name is, nor where you live. I am afraid there is not much chance of your getting this letter; but I hope you will. I have thought of you very often, and wondered how you were getting along, and I should have written to you before if I had known where to direct. "Let me tell you a little about myself. Barnton is a very pretty country town, only about six miles from Hartford. The boarding-school which I attend is under the charge of Ezekiel Munroe, A.M. He is a man of about fifty, a graduate of Yale College, and has always been a teacher. It is a large two-story house, with an addition containing a good many small bed-chambers for the boys. There are about twenty of us, and there is one assistant teacher who teaches the English branches. Mr. Munroe, or Old Zeke, as we call him behind his back, teaches Latin and Greek. I am studying both these languages, because father wants me to go to college. "But you won't be interested in hearing about our studies. I will tell you how we amuse ourselves. There are about fifty acres of land belonging to Mr. Munroe; so that we have plenty of room for play. About a quarter of a mile from the house there is a good-sized pond. There is a large, round-bottomed boat, which is stout and strong. Every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, when the weather is good, we go out rowing on the pond. Mr.Barton, the assistant teacher, goes with us, to look after us. In the summer we are allowed to go in bathing. In the winter there is splendid skating on the pond. "Besides this, we play ball a good deal, and we have various other plays. So we have a pretty good time, although we study pretty hard too. I am getting on very well in my studies. Father has not decided yet where he will send me to college. "I wish you were here, Dick. I should enjoy your company, and besides I should like to feel that you were getting an education. I think you are naturally a pretty smart boy; but I suppose, as you have to earn your own living, you don't get much chance to learn. I only wish I had a few hundred dollars of my own. I would have you come up here, and attend school with us. If I ever have a chance to help you in any way, you may be sure that I will. "I shall have to wind up my letter now, as I have to hand in a composition to-morrow, on the life and character of Washington. I might say that I have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged to the general. But I suppose that coat must be worn out by this time. I don't much like writing compositions. I would a good deal rather write letters. "I have written a longer letter than I meant to. I hope you will get it, though I am afraid not. If you do, you must be sure to answer it, as soon as possible. You needn't mind if your writing does look like `hens-tracks,' as you told me once. "Good-by, Dick. You must always think of me, as your very true friend, "FRANK WHITNEY."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick read this letter with much satisfaction. It is always pleasant to be remembered, and Dick had so few friends that it was more to him than to boys who are better provided. Again, he felt a new sense of importance in having a letter addressed to him. It was the first letter he had ever received. If it had been sent to him a year before, he would not have been able to read it. But now, thanks to Fosdick's instructions, he could not only read writing, but he could write a very good hand himself. There was one passage in the letter which pleased Dick. It was where Frank said that if he had the money he would pav for his education himself. "He's a tip-top feller," said Dick. "I wish I could see him ag'in." There were two reasons why Dick would like to have seen Frank. One was, the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend; but he felt also that he would like to have Frank witness the improvement he had made in his studies and mode of life. "He'd find me a little more 'spectable than when he first saw me," thought Dick. Dick had by this time got up to Printing House Square. Standing on Spruce Street, near the "Tribune" office, was his old enemy, Micky Maguire. It has already been said that Micky felt a natural enmity towards those in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than himself. For the last nine months, Dick's neat appearance had excited the ire of the young Philistine. To appear in neat attire and with a clean face Micky felt was a piece of presumption, and an assumption of superiority on the part of our hero, and he termed it "tryin' to be a swell." Now his astonished eyes rested on Dick in his ancient attire, which was very similar to his own. It was a moment of triumph to him. He felt that "pride had had a fall," and he could not forbear reminding Dick of it. "Them's nice clo'es you've got on," said he, sarcastically, as Dick came up. "Yes," said Dick, promptly. "I've been employin' your tailor. If my face was only dirty we'd be taken for twin brothers." "So you've give up tryin' to be a swell?" "Only for this partic'lar occasion," said Dick. "I wanted to make a fashionable call, so I put on my regimentals." "I don't b'lieve you've got any better clo'es," said Micky. "All right," said Dick, "I won't charge you nothin' for what you believe." Here a customer presented himself for Micky, and Dick went back to his room to change his clothes, before resuming business.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV DICK WRITES HIS FIRST LETTER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Fosdick reached home in the evening, Dick displayed his letter with some pride. "It's a nice letter," said Fosdick, after reading it "I should like to know Frank." "I'll bet you would," said Dick. "He's a trump." "When are you going to answer it?" "I don't know," said Dick, dubiously. "I never writ a letter." "That's no reason why you shouldn't. There's always a first time, you know." "I don't know what to say," said Dick. "Get some paper and sit down to it, and you'll find enough to say. You can do that this evening instead of studying." "If you'll look it over afterwards, and shine it up a little." "Yes, if it needs it; but I rather think Frank would like it best just as you wrote it." Dick decided to adopt Fosdick's suggestion. He had very serious doubts as to his ability to write a letter. Like a good many other boys, he looked upon it as a very serious job, not reflecting that, after all, letter-writing is nothing but talking upon paper. Still, in spite of his misgivings, he felt that the letter ought to be answered, and he wished Frank to hear from him. After various preparations, he at last got setttled down to his task, and, before the evening was over, a letter was written. As the first letter which Dick had ever produced, and because it was characteristic of him, my readers may like to read it. Here it is,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"DEAR FRANK,— I got your letter this mornin', and was very glad to hear you hadn't forgotten Ragged Dick. I ain't so ragged as I was. Openwork coats and trowsers has gone out of fashion. I put on the Washington coat and Napoleon pants to go to the post-office, for fear they wouldn't think I was the boy that was meant. On my way back I received the congratulations of my intimate friend, Micky Maguire, on my improved appearance. "I've give up sleepin' in boxes, and old wagons, findin' it didn't agree with my constitution. I've hired a room in Mott Street, and have got a private tooter, who rooms with me and looks after my studies in the evenin'. Mott Street ain't very fashionable; but my manshun on Fifth Avenoo isn't finished yet, and I'm afraid it won't be till I'm a gray-haired veteran. I've got a hundred dollars towards it, which I've saved up from my earnin's. I haven't forgot what you and your uncle said to me, and I'm tryin' to grow up 'spectable. I haven't been to Tony Pastor's, or the Old Bowery, for ever so long. I'd rather save up my money to support me in my old age. When my hair gets gray, I'm goin' to knock off blackin' boots, and go into some light, genteel employment, such as keepin' an apple-stand, or disseminatin' pea-nuts among the people. "I've got so as to read pretty well, so my tooter says. I've been studyin' geography and grammar also. I've made such astonishin' progress that I can tell a noun from a conjunction as far away as I can see 'em. Tell Mr. Munroe that if he wants an accomplished teacher in his school, he can send for me, and I'll come on by the very next train. Or, if he wants to sell out for a hundred dollars, I'll buy the whole concern, and agree to teach the scholars all I know myself in less than six months. Is teachin' as good business, generally speakin', as blackin' boots? My private tooter combines both, and is makin' a fortun' with great rapidity. He'll be as rich as Astor some time, if he only lives long enough. "I should think you'd have a bully time at your school. I should like to go out in the boat, or play ball with you. When are you comin' to the city? I wish you'd write and let me know when you do, and I'll call and see you. I'll leave my business in the hands of my numerous clerks, and go round with you. There's lots of things you didn't see when you was here before. They're getting on fast at the Central Park. It looks better than it did a year ago. "I ain't much used to writin' letters. As this is the first one I ever wrote, I hope you'll excuse the mistakes. I hope you'll write to me again soon. I can't write so good a letter as you; but, I'll do my best, as the man said when he was asked if he could swim over to Brooklyn backwards. Good-by, Frank. Thank you for all your kindness. Direct your next letter to No. — Mott Street. "Your true friend, "DICK HUNTER,"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick had written the last word, he leaned back in his chair, and surveyed the letter with much satisfaction. "I didn't think I could have wrote such a long letter, Fosdick," said he. "Written would be more grammatical, Dick," suggested his friend. "I guess there's plenty of mistakes in it," said Dick. "Just look at it, and see." Fosdick took the letter, and read it over carefully. "Yes, there are some mistakes," he said; "but it sounds so much like you that I think it would be better to let it go just as it is. It will be more likely to remind Frank of what you were when he first saw you." "Is it good enough to send?" asked Dick, anxiously. "Yes; it seems to me to be quite a good letter. It is written just as you talk. Nobody but you could have written such a letter, Dick. I think Frank will be amused at your proposal to come up there as teacher." "P'r'aps it would be a good idea for us to open a seleck school here in Mott Street," said Dick, humorously. "We could call it `Professor Fosdick and Hunter's Mott Street Seminary.' Boot-blackin' taught by Professor Hunter." The evening was so far advanced that Dick decided to postpone copying his letter till the next evening. By this time he had come to have a very fair handwriting, so that when the letter was complete it really looked quite creditable, and no one would have suspected that it was Dick's first attempt in this line. Our hero surveyed it with no little complacency. In fact, he felt rather proud of it, since it reminded him of the great progress he had made. He carried it down to the post-office, and deposited it with his own hands in the proper box. Just on the steps of the building, as he was coming out, he met Johnny Nolan, who had been sent on an errand to Wall Street by some gentleman, and was just returning. "What are you doin' down nere, Dick?" asked Johnny. "I've been mailin' a letter." "Who sent you?" "Nobody." "I mean, who writ the letter?" "I wrote it myself." "Can you write letters?" asked Johnny, in amazement. "Why shouldn't I?" "I didn't know you could write. I can't." "Then you ought to learn." "I went to school once; but it was too hard work, so I give it up." "You're lazy, Johnny,—that's what's the matter. How'd you ever expect to know anything, if you don't try?" "I can't learn." "You can, if you want to." Johnny Nolan was evidently of a different opinion. He was a good-natured boy, large of his age, with nothing particularly bad about him, but utterly lacking in that energy, ambition, and natural sharpness, for which Dick was distinguished. He was not adapted to succeed in the life which circumstances had forced upon him; for in the street-life of the metropolis a boy needs to be on the alert, and have all his wits about him, or he will find himself wholly distanced by his more enterprising competitors for popular favor. To succeed in his profession, humble as it is, a boot-black must depend upon the same qualities which gain success in higher walks in life. It was easy to see that Johnny, unless very much favored by circumstances, would never rise much above his present level. For Dick, we cannot help hoping much better things.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI AN EXCITING ADVENTURE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick now began to look about for a position in a store or counting-room. Until he should obtain one he determined to devote half the day to blacking boots, not being willing to break in upon his small capital. He found that he could earn enough in half a day to pay all his necessary expenses, including the entire rent of the room. Fosdick desired to pay his half; but Dick steadily refused, insisting upon paying so much as compensation for his friend's services as instructor. It should be added that Dick's peculiar way of speaking and use of slang terms had been somewhat modified by his education and his intimacy with Henry Fosdick. Still he continued to indulge in them to some extent, especially when he felt like joking, and it was natural to Dick to joke, as my readers have probably found out by this time. Still his manners were considerably improved, so that he was more likely to obtain a situation than when first introduced to our notice. Just now, however, business was very dull, and merchants, instead of hiring new assistants, were disposed to part with those already in their employ. After making several ineffectual applications, Dick began to think he should be obliged to stick to his profession until the next season. But about this time something occurred which considerably improved his chances of preferment. This is the way it happened. As Dick, with a balance of more than a hundred dollars in the savings bank, might fairly consider himself a young man of property, he thought himself justified in occasionally taking a half holiday from business, and going on an excursion. On Wednesday afternoon Henry Fosdick was sent by his employer on an errand to that part of Brooklyn near Greenwood Cemetery. Dick hastily dressed himself in his best, and determined to accompany him. The two boys walked down to the South Ferry, and, paying their two cents each, entered the ferry boat. They remained at the stern, and stood by the railing, watching the great city, with its crowded wharves, receding from view. Beside them was a gentleman with two children,—a girl of eight and a little boy of six. The children were talking gayly to their father. While he was pointing out some object of interest to the little girl, the boy managed to creep, unobserved, beneath the chain that extends across the boat, for the protection of passengers, and, stepping incautiously to the edge of the boat, fell over into the foaming water. At the child's scream, the father looked up, and, with a cry of horror, sprang to the edge of the boat. He would have plunged in, but, being unable to swim, would only have endangered his own life, without being able to save his child. "My child!" he exclaimed in anguish,— "who will save my child? A thousand—ten thousand dollars to any one who will save him!" There chanced to be but few passengers on board at the time, and nearly all these were either in the cabins or standing forward. Among the few who saw the child fall was our hero. Now Dick was an expert swimmer. It was an accomplishment which he had possessed for years, and he no sooner saw the boy fall than he resolved to rescue him. His determination was formed before he heard the liberal offer made by the boy's father. Indeed, I must do Dick the justice to say that, in the excitement of the moment, he did not hear it at all, nor would it have stimulated the alacrity with which he sprang to the rescue of the little boy. Little Johnny had already risen once, and gone under for the second time, when our hero plunged in. He was obliged to strike out for the boy, and this took time. He reached him none too soon. Just as he was sinking for the third and last time, he caught him by the jacket. Dick was stout and strong, but Johnny clung to him so tightly, that it was with great difficulty he was able to sustain himself. "Put your arms round my neck," said Dick. The little boy mechanically obeyed, and clung with a grasp strengthened by his terror. In this position Dick could bear his weight better. But the ferry-boat was receding fast. It was quite impossible to reach it. The father, his face pale with terror and anguish, and his hands clasped in suspense, saw the brave boy's struggles, and prayed with agonizing fervor that he might be successful. But it is probable, for they were now midway of the river, that both Dick and the little boy whom he had bravely undertaken to rescue would have been drowned, had not a row-boat been fortunately near. The two men who were in it witnessed the accident, and hastened to the rescue of our hero. "Keep up a little longer," they shouted, bending to their oars, "and we will save you." Dick heard the shout, and it put fresh strength into him. He battled manfully with the treacherous sea, his eyes fixed longingly upon the approaching boat. "Hold on tight, little boy," he said. "There's a boat coming." The little boy did not see the boat. His eyes were closed to shut out the fearful water, but he clung the closer to his young preserver. Six long, steady strokes, and the boat dashed along side. Strong hands seized Dick and his youthful burden, and drew them into the boat, both dripping with water. "God be thanked!" exclaimed the father, as from the steamer he saw the child's rescue. "That brave boy shall be rewarded, if I sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it." "You've had a pretty narrow escape, young chap," said one of the boatmen to Dick. "It was a pretty tough job you undertook." "Yes," said Dick. "That's what I thought when I was in the water. If it hadn't been for you, I don't know what would have 'come of us." "Anyhow you're a plucky boy, or you wouldn't have dared to jump into the water after this little chap. It was a risky thing to do." "I'm used to the water," said Dick, modestly. "I didn't stop to think of the danger, but I wasn't going to see that little fellow drown without tryin' to save him." The boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the Brooklyn side. The captain of the ferry-boat, seeing the rescue, did not think it necessary to stop his boat, but kept on his way. The whole occurrence took place in less time than I have occupied in telling it. The father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy, with what feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood. With a burst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms. Dick was about to withdraw modestly, but the gentleman perceived the movement, and, putting down the child, came forward, and, clasping his hand, said with emotion, "My brave boy, I owe you a debt I can never repay. But for your timely service I should now be plunged into an anguish which I cannot think of without a shudder." Our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions, but always felt awkward when he was praised. "It wasn't any trouble," he said, modestly. "I can swim like a top." "But not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger," said the gentleman. "But," he added with a sudden thought, as his glance rested on Dick's dripping garments, "both you and my little boy will take cold in wet clothes. Fortunately I have a friend living close at hand, at whose house you will have an opportunity of taking off your clothes, and having them dried." Dick protested that he never took cold; but Fosdick, who had now joined them, and who, it is needless to say, had been greatly alarmed at Dick's danger, joined in urging compliance with the gentleman's proposal, and in the end our hero had to yield. His new friend secured a hack, the driver of which agreed for extra recompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage, and they were whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street, where matters were quickly explained, and both boys were put to bed. "I ain't used to goin' to bed quite so early," thought Dick. "This is the queerest excursion I ever took." Like most active boys Dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending half a day in bed; but his confinement did not last as long as he anticipated. In about an hour the door of his chamber was opened, and a servant appeared, bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout. "You are to put on these," said the servant to Dick; "but you needn't get up till you feel like it." "Whose clothes are they?" asked Dick. "They are yours." "Mine! Where did they come from?" "Mr.Rockwell sent out and bought them for you. They are the same size as your wet ones." "Is he here now?" "No. He bought another suit for the little boy, and has gone back to New York. Here's a note he asked me to give you." Dick opened the paper, and read as follows,—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of a debt which I can never repay. I have asked to have your wet suit dried, when you can reclaim it. Will you oblige me by calling to-morrow at my counting room, No. —, Pearl Street. "Your friend, "JAMES ROCKWELL."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII CONCLUSlON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick was dressed in his new suit, he surveyed his figure with pardonable complacency. It was the best he had ever worn, and fitted him as well as if it had been made expressly for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's done the handsome thing," said Dick to himself; "but there wasn't no 'casion for his givin' me these clothes. My lucky stars are shinin' pretty bright now. Jumpin' into the water pays better than shinin' boots; but I don't think I'd like to try it more'n once a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About eleven o'clock the next morning Dick repaired to Mr. Rockwell's counting-room on Pearl Street. He found himself in front of a large and handsome warehouse. The counting-room was on the lower floor. Our hero entered, and found Mr. Rockwell sitting at a desk. No sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose, and, advancing, shook Dick by the hand in the most friendly manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My young friend," he said, "you have done me so great service that I wish to be of some service to you in return. Tell me about yourself, and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick frankly related his past history, and told Mr. Rockwell of his desire to get into a store or counting-room, and of the failure of all his applications thus far. The merchant listened attentively to Dick's statement, and, when he had finished, placed a sheet of paper before him, and, handing him a pen, said, "Will you write your name on this piece of paper?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick wrote in a free, bold hand, the name Richard Hunter. He had very much improved in his penmanship, as has already been mentioned, and now had no cause to be ashamed of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Rockwell surveyed it approvingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How would you like to enter my counting-room as clerk, Richard?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was about to say "Bully," when he recollected himself, and answered, "Very much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you know something of arithmetic, do you not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a week. You may come next Monday morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten dollars!" repeated Dick, thinking he must have misunderstood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; will that be sufficient?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's more than I can earn," said Dick, honestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it is at first," said Mr. Rockwell, smiling; "but I am willing to pay you that. I will besides advance you as fast as your progress will justify it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some demonstration which would have astonished the merchant; but he exercised self-control, and only said, "I'll try to serve you so faithfully, sir, that you won't repent having taken me into your service."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I think you will succeed," said Mr. Rockwell, encouragingly. "I will not detain you any longer, for I have some important business to attend to. I shall expect to see you on Monday morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick left the counting-room, hardly knowing whether he stood on his head or his heels, so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his fortunes. Ten dollars a week was to him a fortune, and three times as much as he had expected to obtain at first. Indeed he would have been glad, only the day before, to get a place at three dollars a week. He reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now on hand, he could save up at least half of it, and even then live better than he had been accustomed to do; so that his little fund in the savings bank, instead of being diminished, would be steadily increasing. Then he was to be advanced if he deserved it. It was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who, only a year before, could neither read nor write, and depended for a night's lodging upon the chance hospitality of an alley-way or old wagon. Dick's great ambition to "grow up 'spectable" seemed likely to be accomplished after all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish Fosdick was as well off as I am," he thought generously. But he determined to help his less fortunate friend, and assist him up the ladder as he advanced himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dick entered his room on Mott Street, he discovered that some one else had been there before him, and two articles of wearing apparel had disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By gracious!" he exclaimed; "somebody's stole my Washington coat and Napoleon pants. Maybe it's an agent of Barnum's, who expects to make a fortun' by exhibitin' the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman of fashion."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dick did not shed many tears over his loss, as, in his present circumstances, he never expected to have any further use for the well-worn garments. It may be stated that he afterwards saw them adorning the figure of Micky Maguire; but whether that estimable young man stole them himself, he never ascertained. As to the loss. Dick was rather pleased that it had occurred. It seemed to cut him off from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume. Henceforward he meant to press onward, and rise as high as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although it was yet only noon, Dick did not go out again with his brush. He felt that it was time to retire from business. He would leave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate than himself. That evening Dick and Fosdick had a long conversation. Fosdick rejoiced heartily in his friend's success, and on his side had the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced to six dollars a week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think we can afford to leave Mott Street now," he continued. "This house isn't as neat as it might be, and I shall like to live in a nicer quarter of the city."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Dick. "We'll hunt up a new room to-morrow. I shall have plenty of time, having retired from business. I'll try to get my reg'lar customers to take Johnny Nolan in my place. That boy hasn't any enterprise. He needs some body to look out for him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You might give him your box and brush, too, Dick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said Dick; "I'll give him some new ones, but mine I want to keep, to remind me of the hard times I've had, when I was an ignorant boot-black, and never expected to be anything better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When, in short, you were `Ragged Dick.' You must drop that name, and think of yourself now as"—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Richard Hunter, Esq.," said our hero, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune," added Fosdick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here ends the story of Ragged Dick. As Fosdick said, he is Ragged Dick no longer. He has taken a step upward, and is determined to mount still higher. There are fresh adventures in store for him, and for others who have been introduced in these pages.
