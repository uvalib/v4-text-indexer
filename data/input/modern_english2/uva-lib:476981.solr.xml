      <field name="heading_text">The Death of Goody Nurse [July 19, 1692]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chill New England sunshine Lay on the kitchen floor; The wild New England north wind Came rattling at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And by the wide old fire-place, Deep in her cushioned chair, Lay back an ancient woman, With shining snow-white hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The peace of God was on her face, Her eyes were sweet and calm, And when you heard her earnest voice It sounded like a psalm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In all the land they loved her well; From country and from town Came many a heart for counsel, And many a soul cast down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her hands had fed the hungry poor With blessing and with bread; Her face was like a comforting From out the Gospel read.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So weak and silent as she lay, Her warm hands clasped in prayer, A sudden knocking at the door Came on her unaware.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And as she turned her hoary head, Beside her chair there stood Four grim and grisly Puritans— No visitants for good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They came upon her like a host, And bade her speak and tell Why she had sworn a wicked oath To serve the powers of hell;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To work the works of darkness On children of the light, A witch they might not suffer here Who read the Word aright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like one who sees her fireside yawn, A pit of black despair, Or one who wakes from quiet dreams Within a lion’s lair,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She glared at them with starting eyes, Her voice essayed no sound; She gasped like any hunted deer The eager dogs surround.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Answer us!” hoarse and loud they cry; She looked from side to side— No human help—“Oh, gracious God!” In agony she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, calling back her feeble life, The white lips uttered slow, “I am as pure as the babe unborn From this foul thing, ye know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If God doth visit me for sin, Beneath His rod I bend,” But pitiless and wroth were they, And bent upon their end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They tortured her with taunt and jeer, They vexed her night and day— No husband’s arm nor sister’s tears Availed their rage to stay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before the church they haled her then; The minister arose And poured upon her patient head The worst of all its woes:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bade her be accused of God Forever here and there; He cursed her with a heavy curse No mortal man may bear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood among the cowering crowd As calm as saints in heaven, Her eyes as sweet as summer skies, Her face like summer’s even.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The devils wrought their wicked will On matron and on maid. “Thou hast bewitched us!”cried they all, But not a word she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They fastened chains about her feet, And carried her away; For many days in Salem jail Alone and ill she lay</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She heard the scythe along the field Ring through the fragrant air, She smelt the wild-rose on the wind That bloweth everywhere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reviled and hated and bereft, The soul had plenteous rest, Though sorrow like a frantic flood Beat sore upon her breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last the prison door stood wide, They led the saint abroad; By many an old familiar place Her trembling footsteps trod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Till faint with weakness and distress, She climbed a hillside bleak, And faced the gallows built thereon, Still undisturbed and meek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They hanged this weary woman there, Like any felon stout; Her white hairs on the cruel rope Were scattered all about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The body swung upon the tree In every flitting wind, Reviled and mocked by passengers And folk of evil mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A woman old and innocent, To die a death of shame, With kindred, neighbors, friends thereby, And none to utter blame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, God, that such a thing should be On earth which Thou hast made! A voice from heaven answered me, “Father forgive,”He said.</field>
