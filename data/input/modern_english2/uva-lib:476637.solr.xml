      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I. OUT IN A STORM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WHAT do you think of this storm, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it is going to be a heavy one, Ned. I wish we were back home,'' replied Joe Bodley, as he looked at the heavy clouds which overhung Lake Tandy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think we+'ll catch much rain before we get back?'' And Ned, who was the son of a rich man and well dressed, looked at the new suit of clothes that he wore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m afraid we shall, Ned. Those black clouds back of Mount Sam mean something.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If this new suit gets soaked it will be ruined,'' grumbled Ned, and gave a sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry for the suit, Ned; but I did+n't think it was going to rain when we started.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I am not blaming you, Joe. It looked clear enough this morning. Can't we get to some sort of shelter before the rain reaches us?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can try.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which is the nearest shelter?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe Bodley mused for a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The nearest that I know of is over at yonder point, Ned. It+'s an old hunting lodge that used to belong to the Cameron family. It has been deserted for several years.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then let us row for that place, and be quick about it,'' said Ned Talmadge. "I am not going to get wet if I can help it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he spoke he took up a pair of oars lying in the big rowboat he and Joe Bodley occupied. Joe was already rowing and the rich boy joined in, and the craft was headed for the spot Joe had pointed out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lake was one located in the central part of the State of Pennsylvania. It was perhaps a mile wide and more than that long, and surrounded by mountains and long ranges of hills. At the lower end of the lake was a small settlement of scant importance and at the upper end, where there was a stream of no mean size, was the town of Riverside. At Riverside were situated several summer hotels and boarding houses, and also the elegant mansion in which Ned Talmadge resided, with his parents and his four sisters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe Bodley was as poor as Ned Talmadge was rich, yet the two lads were quite friendly. Joe knew a good deal about hunting and fishing, and also knew all about handling boats. They frequently went out together, and Ned insisted upon paying the poorer boy for all extra services.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe's home was located on the side of the mountain which was just now wrapped in such dark and ominous looking clouds. He lived with Hiram Bodley, an old man who was a hermit. The home consisted of a cabin of two rooms, scantily furnished. Hiram Bodley had been a hunter and guide, but of late years rheumatism had kept him from doing work and Joe was largely the support of the pair,—taking out pleasure parties for pay whenever he could, and fishing and hunting in the between times, and using or selling what was gained thereby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a good deal of a mystery surrounding Joe's parentage. It was claimed that he was a nephew of Hiram Bodley, and that, after the death of his mother and sisters, his father had drifted out to California and then to Australia. What the real truth concerning him was we shall learn later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was a boy of twelve, but constant life in the open air had made him tall and strong and he looked to be several years older. He had dark eyes and hair, and was much tanned by the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rowboat had been out a good distance on the lake and a minute before the shore was gained the large drops of rain began to fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are going to get wet after all!'' cried Ned, chagrined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pull for all you are worth and we+'ll soon be under the trees,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They bent to the oars, and a dozen more strokes sent the rowboat under a clump of pines growing close to the edge of the lake. Just as the boat struck the bank and Ned leaped out there came a great downpour which made the surface of Lake Tandy fairly sizzle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Run to the lodge, Ned; I+'ll look after the boat!'' shouted Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you+'ll get wet.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind; run, I tell you!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus admonished, Ned ran for the old hunting lodge, which was situated about two hundred feet away. Joe remained behind long enough to secure the rowboat and the oars and then he followed his friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just as one porch of the old lodge was reached there came a flash of lightning, followed by a clap of thunder that made Ned jump. Then followed more thunder and lightning, and the rain came down steadily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ugh! I must say I don't like this at all,'' remarked Ned, as he crouched in a corner of the shelter. "I hope the lightning does+n't strike this place.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can be thankful that we were not caught out in the middle of the lake, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agree on that, Joe,—but it does+n't help matters much. Oh, dear me!'' And Ned shrank down, as another blinding flash of lightning lit up the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not a comfortable situation and Joe did not like it any more than did his friend. But the hermit's boy was accustomed to being out in the elements, and therefore was not so impressed by what was taking place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The rain will fill the boat,'' said Ned, presently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, we can easily bail her out or turn her over.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When do you think this storm will stop?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In an hour or two, most likely. Such storms never last very long. What time is it, Ned?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Half-past two,'' answered Ned, after consulting the handsome watch he carried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, if it clears in two hours, we+'ll have plenty of time to get home before dark.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care to stay here two hours,'' grumbled Ned. "It+'s not a very inviting place.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s better than being out under the trees,'' answered Joe, cheerfully. The hermit's boy was always ready to look on the brighter side of things.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, of course.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And we have a fine string of fish, don't forget that, Ned. We were lucky to get so many before the storm came up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you want the fish, or are you going to let me take them?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like to have one fish. You may take the others.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not unless you let me pay for them, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you need+n't mind about paying me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I insist,'' came from Ned. "I won't touch them otherwise.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, you can pay me for what I caught.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I want to pay for all of them. Your time is worth something, and I know you have to support your—the old hermit now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Ned, have your own way. Yes, I admit, I need all the money I get.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is the old hermit very sick?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not so sick, but his rheumatism keeps him from going out hunting or fishing, so all that work falls to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s a good deal on your shoulders, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I make the best of it, for there is nothing else to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the way, Joe, you once spoke to me about—well, about yourself,'' went on Ned, after some hesitation. "Did you ever learn anything more. You need not tell me if you don't care to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At these words Joe's face clouded for an instant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I have+n't learned a thing more, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you don't really know if you are the hermit's nephew or not?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I think I am, but I don't know whatever became of my father.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does the hermit think he is alive?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He does+n't know, and he has+n't any means of finding out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if I were you, I+'d find out, some way or other.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m going to find out—some day,'' replied Joe. "But, to tell the truth, I don't know how to go at it. Uncle Hiram does+n't like to talk about it. He thinks my father did wrong to go away. I imagine they had a quarrel over it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has he ever heard from your father since?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a word.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he write?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He did+n't know where to write to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! It is certainly a mystery, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You are right, Ned; and as I said before, I am going to solve it some time, even if it takes years of work to do it,'' replied the hermit's boy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. A MYSTERIOUS CONVERSATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE old hunting lodge where the two boys had sought shelter was a rambling affair, consisting of a square building built of logs, and half a dozen wings, running to the rear and to one side. There were also two piazzas, and a shed, where wood had been kept for winter use.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In another year or two this old lodge will fall down,'' remarked Ned, as he gazed around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must have been a nice place in its day,'' returned Joe. "What a pity to let it run down in this fashion.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The rain is coming around on this side now, Joe; let us shift to the other.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hermit's boy was willing, and watching their chance, between the downpours, they ran around to another portion of the old lodge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It certainly is a little better here,'' observed Joe, as he dashed the water from his cap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A minute later the rumbling of the thunder ceased for the time being, and they heard a murmur of voices coming from one of the rooms of the lodge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, somebody must be here!'' ejaculated Ned. "Who can it be?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two men, by their voices,'' answered the hermit's boy. "Wait till I take a look at them?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not go in?'' questioned the rich youth, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They may not be persons that we would care to meet, Ned. You know there are some undesirable characters about the lake.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s true.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not far off was a narrow window, the panes of glass of which had long since been broken out. Moving toward this, Joe peered into the apartment beyond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Close to an old fireplace, in which a few sticks of half-green timber were burning, sat two men. Both were well dressed, and Joe rightfully surmised that they were from the city. Each wore a hunting outfit and had a gun, but neither had any game.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We came on a wild-goose chase,'' grumbled one, as he stirred the fire. "Got nothing but a soaking for our pains.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, Malone,'' returned the other, who was evidently the better educated of the two. "As we had to make ourselves scarce in the city this was as good a place to come to as any.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you think they+'ll look for us here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why should they? We were sharp enough not to leave any trail behind—at least, I was.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Reckon I was just as sharp, Caven.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had to be—otherwise you would have been nabbed.'' Gaff Caven chuckled to himself. "We outwitted them nicely, I must say. We deserve credit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve spent more than half of what I got out of the deal,'' went on Pat Malone, for such was the full name of one of the speakers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve spent more than that. But never mind, my boy, fortune will favor us again in the near future.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A crash of thunder drowned out the conversation following, and Joe hurried back to where he had left Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, have you found out who they are?'' demanded the rich youth, impatiently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Ned, but I am sure of one thing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are two bad men.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They said something about having to get out of the city, and one spoke about being nabbed. Evidently they went away to avoid arrest.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this announcement Ned Talmadge whistled softly to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Phew! What shall we do about it?'' he asked, with a look of concern on his usually passive face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let us listen to what they have to say. Maybe we+'ll strike some clew to what they have been doing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would that be fair—to play the eaves-dropper?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly—if they are evildoers. Anybody who has done wrong ought to be locked up for it,'' went on Ned boldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With caution the two boys made their way to the narrow window, and Ned looked in as Joe had done. The backs of the two men were still towards the opening, so the lads were not discovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is this new game?'' they heard the man called Malone ask, after a peal of thunder had rolled away among the mountains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s the old game of a sick miner with some valuable stocks to sell,'' answered Gaff Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got the stocks?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure—one thousand shares of the Blue Bell Mine, of Montana, said to be worth exactly fifty thousand dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Phew! You+'re flying high, Gaff!'' laughed Pat Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not, so long as I sell the stocks?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did they cost you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, they did+n't cost me fifty thousand dollars,'' and Gaff Caven closed one eye suggestively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet they did+n't! More than likely they did+n't cost you fifty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, such elegantly engraved stocks as those?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pooh! I can buy a bushel-basket full of worthless stocks for a dollar,'' came from Pat Malone. "But that isn+'t here nor there. I go into the deal if you give me my fair share of the earnings.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll give you one-third, Pat, and that+'s a fair share, I think.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not make it half?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I+'ll do the most of the work. It+'s no easy matter to find a victim.'' And Gaff Caven laughed broadly. He had a good-appearing face, but his eyes were small and not to be trusted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, I+'ll go in for a third then. But how soon is the excitement to begin?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, in a week or so. I+'ve got the advertisements in the papers already.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not in New York?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it+'s Philadelphia this time. Perhaps I+'ll land one of our Quaker friends.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be so sure. The Quakers may be slow but they generally know what they are doing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More thunder interrupted the conversation at this point, and when it was resumed the two men talked in such low tones that only an occasional word could be caught by the two boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They surely must be rascals,'' remarked Ned, in a whisper. "I+'m half of a mind to have them locked up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s easier said than done,'' answered Joe. "Besides, we have+n't any positive proofs against them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wind was now rising, and it soon blew so furiously that the two boys were forced to seek the shelter of the woodshed, since they did not deem it wise to enter the lodge so long as the two men were inside. They waited in the shed for fully half an hour, when, as suddenly as it had begun, the storm let up and the sun began to peep forth from between the scattering clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now we can go home if we wish,'' said Joe. "But for my part, I+'d like to stay and see what those men do, and where they go to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, let us stay by all means,'' answered the rich youth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They waited a few minutes longer and then Ned suggested that they look into the window of the lodge once more. The hermit's boy was willing, and they approached the larger building with caution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much to their astonishment the two strangers had disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo! what do you make of that?'' cried Ned, in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps they are in one of the other rooms,'' suggested Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the risk of being caught, they entered the lodge and looked into one room after another. Every apartment was vacant, and they now saw that the fire in the fireplace had been stamped out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They must have left while we were in the woodshed,'' said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe they are out on the lake,'' answered the hermit's boy, and he ran down to the water's edge, followed by his companion. But though they looked in every direction, not a craft of any kind was to be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe, they did+n't take to the water, consequently they must have left by one of the mountain paths.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is true, and if they did they+'ll have no nice time in getting through. All the bushes are sopping wet, and the mud is very slippery in places.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They walked to the rear of the lodge and soon found the footprints of the two strangers. They led through the bushes and were lost at a small brook that ran into the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is no use of our trying to follow this any further,'' said Joe. "You+'ll get your clothing covered with water and mud.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't intend to follow,'' answered Ned. "Just the same, I should like to know more about those fellows.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I had seen their faces.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it+'s a pity we didn+'t get a better look at them. But I+'d know their voices.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the time they gave up the hunt the sun was shining brightly. Both walked to where the boat had been left, and Joe turned the craft over so that the water might run out. Then he mopped off the seats as best he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned wanted to go directly home, and he and Joe rowed the craft in the direction of Riverside. As they passed along the lake shore the hermit's boy noted that several trees had been struck by lightning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m glad the lightning did+n't strike the lodge while we were there,'' said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was certainly a severe storm while it lasted, Joe. By the way, shall I say anything about those two men?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it won't do any harm to tell your father, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, I+'ll do it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon Riverside was reached, and having paid for the fish and the outing, Ned Talmadge walked in the direction of his residence. Joe shoved off from the tiny dock and struck out for his home. He did not dream of the calamity that awaited him there.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III. A HOME IN RUINS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Joe rowed toward his home on the mountain side, a good mile from Riverside, he could not help but think of the two mysterious men and of what they had said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They were certainly rascals,'' he mused. "And from their talk they must have come from New York and are now going to try some game in Philadelphia.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hermit's boy was tired out by the day's outing, yet he pulled a fairly quick stroke and it was not long before he reached the dock at which he and Hiram Bodley were in the habit of leaving their boat. He cleaned the craft out, hid the oars in the usual place, and then, with his fishing lines in one hand and a good sized fish in the other, started up the trail leading to the place that he called home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a place to come to, alongside of the one Ned lives in,'' he said to himself. "I suppose the Talmadges think this is a regular hovel. I wish we could afford something better,—or at least live in town. It+'s lonesome here with nobody but old Uncle Hiram around.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Joe neared the cabin something seemed to come over him and, for some reason he could not understand, he felt very much depressed in spirits. He quickened his pace, until a turn of the trail brought the homestead into view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A cry of alarm broke from his lips and with good reason. The little shelter had stood close to a large hemlock tree. The lightning had struck the tree, causing it to topple ever. In falling, it had landed fairly and squarely upon the cabin, smashing it completely. One corner of the cabin was in ashes, but the heavy rain had probably extinguished the conflagration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hiram!'' cried the boy, as soon as he recovered from his amazement. "Uncle Hiram, where are you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer to this call and for the moment Joe's heart seemed to stop beating. Was the old hermit under that pile of ruins? If so it was more than likely he was dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dropping his fish and his lines, the youth sprang to the front of the cabin. The door had fallen to the ground and before him was a mass of wreckage with a small hollow near the bottom. He dropped on his knees and peered inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hiram!'' he called again</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer, and he listened with bated breath. Then he fancied he heard a groan, coming from the rear of what was left of the cabin. He ran around to that point and pulled aside some boards and a broken window sash.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hiram, are you here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe!'' came in a low voice, full of pain The man tried to say more but could not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hauling aside some more boards, Joe now beheld the hermit, lying flat on his back, with a heavy beam resting on his chest. He was also suffering from a cut on the forehead and from a broken ankle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is too bad, Uncle Hiram!'' he said, in a trembling voice. "I+'ll get you out just as soon as I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be—be careful, Joe—I—I—my ribs must be broken,'' gasped the hermit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll be careful,'' answered the boy, and began to pull aside one board after another. Then he tugged away at the beam but could not budge it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Raise it up Joe—it—is—crushing the life ou—out of me,'' said the hermit faintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll pry it up,'' answered the boy, and ran off to get a block of wood. Then he procured a stout pole and with this raised the heavy beam several inches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you crawl out, Uncle Hiram?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer, and Joe saw that the man had fainted from exhaustion. Fixing the pole so it could not slip, he caught hold of the hermit and dragged him to a place of safety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had never had to care for a hurt person before and he scarcely knew how to proceed. He laid the hermit on the grass and washed his face with water. Soon Hiram Bodley opened his eyes once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My chest!'' he groaned. "All of my ribs must be broken! And my ankle is broken, too!'' And he groaned again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had better get a doctor, Uncle Hiram.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A doctor can't help me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps he can.'' RAISE IT UP, JOE—IT—IS—CRUSHING THE LIFE OU—OUT OF ME.— Page 22. Illustration bu Nuttall. Hiram Bodley trapped under a collapsed cabin in the woods. Joe is standing behind Uncle Hiram, his hands grasping the old man's shoulders, in an attempt to pull him from the debris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have+n+'t any faith in doctors. A doctor operated on my mother and killed her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But Doctor Gardner is a nice man. He will do all he can for you, I am sure,'' urged Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Dr. Gardner is a good fellow I admit. If you—can—can get him—I+'ll—I+'ll —'' The sufferer tried to go on but could not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I can get him. But I hate to leave you alone.'' And Joe stared around helplessly. He wished he had Ned with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind—give me a drink—then go,'' answered Hiram Bodley. He had often taken Doctor Gardner out to hunt with him and liked the physician not a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Inside of five minutes Joe was on the way to the doctor's residence, which was on the outskirts of Riverside. He had left the hermit as comfortable as possible, on a mattress and covered with a cloth to keep off the night air,— for it was now growing late and the sun had set behind the mountains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tired though he was the boy pulled with might and main, and so reached the dock of the physician's home in a short space of time. Running up the walk of the neatly-kept garden, he mounted the piazza and rang the bell several times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the matter?'' asked Doctor Gardner, who came himself to answer the summons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Our cabin is in ruins, because of the storm, and Mr. Bodley is badly hurt,'' answered Joe, and related some of the particulars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is certainly too bad, my boy,'' said the physician. "I+'ll come at once and do what I can for him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ran for a case of instruments and also for some medicines, and then followed Joe back to the boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You act as if you were tired,'' said the doctor, after he had watched Joe at the oars for several minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am tired, sir—I+'ve been rowing a good deal to-day. But I guess I can make it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me row,'' said the physician, and took the oars. He was a fine oarsman, and the trip was made in half the time it would have taken Joe to cover the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the dock there was a lantern, used by Joe and the hermit when they went fishing at night. This was lit, and the two hurried up the trail to the wreck of the cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hiram Bodley was resting where Joe had left him. He was breathing with difficulty and did not at first recognize the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take it off!'' he murmured. "Take it off! It is—is crushing th—the life out of—of me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Bodley—Hiram, don't you know me?'' asked Doctor Gardner, kindly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! So it+'s you? I guess you can't do much, doctor, can you? I—I+'m done for!'' And a spasm of pain crossed the sufferer's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"While there is life there is hope,'' answered the physician, noncommittally. He recognized at once that Hiram Bodley's condition was critical.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'ll get over it, won't he?'' questioned Joe, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor did not answer, but turned to do what he could for the hurt man. He felt of his chest and listened to his breathing, and then administered some medicine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His ankle is hurt, too,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind the ankle just now, Joe,'' was the soft answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something in the tone that alarmed the boy and he caught the physician by the arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Doctor, tell me the truth!'' he cried. "Is he is he going to die?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid so, my lad. His ribs are crushed and one of them has stuck into his right lung.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At these words the tears sprang into the boy's eyes and it was all he could do to keep from crying outright. Even though the old hermit had been rough in his ways, Joe thought a good deal of the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cannot you do something, doctor,'' he pleaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not here. We might do something in a hospital, but he would not survive the journey. He is growing weaker every moment. Be brave, my lad. It is a terrible trial, I know, but you must remember that all things are for the best.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe knelt beside the sufferer and took hold of his hand. Hiram Bodley looked at him and then at the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I can't live—I know it,'' he said hoarsely. "Joe, stay by me till I die, won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes!'' faltered the boy. "Oh, this is awful!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m sorry to leave you so soon, Joe—I— I thought I+'d be—be able to do something for you some day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have done something for me, Uncle Hiram.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I+'ve got goes to you, Joe. Doctor, do you hear that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It—it ain't much, but it+'s something. The blue box—I put it in the blue box—'' Here the sufferer began to cough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The blue box?'' came from Joe questioningly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Joe, all in the blue box—the papers and the money—And the blue box is—is—'' Again the sufferer began to cough. "I—I want water!'' he gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The water was brought and he took a gulp. Then he tried to speak again, but the effort was in vain. The doctor and Joe raised him up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hiram! Speak to me!'' cried the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Hiram Bodley was past speaking. He had passed to the Great Beyond.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV. THE SEARCH FOR THE BLUE BOX.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE days after his tragic death Hiram Bodley was buried. Although he was fairly well known in the lake region only a handful of people came to his funeral. Joe was the chief mourner, and it can honestly be said that he was much downcast when he followed the hermit to his last resting place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the funeral several asked Joe what he intended to do. He could not answer the question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you found that blue box?'' questioned Doctor Gardner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, I have not thought of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably it contains money and papers of value, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to look for it to-day,'' said the boy. "I—I could+n't look for it while— while—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand. Well, I trust you locate the box and that it contains all you hope for,'' added the physician.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As luck would have it, Ned Talmadge's family had just gone away on a trip to the West, so Mr. Talmadge could offer the boy no assistance. But Ned was on hand and did what he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know what you+'ll do next, do you, Joe?'' asked Ned, as he and Joe returned to the wreck of the cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you have+n't any money I+'ll do what I can for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Ned; you are very kind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must be hard to be thrown out on the world in this fashion,'' went on the rich boy, sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is hard. After all, I thought a good deal of Uncle Hiram. He was strange in his ways, but he had a good heart.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was+n't he shot in the head once by accident in the woods?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe that made him queer at times.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got six dollars and a half of my spending money saved up. You may have that if you wish,'' continued Ned, generously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d rather not take it, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I can, I want to be independent. Besides, I think there is money around somewhere,'' and Joe mentioned the missing blue box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must hunt for that blue box by all means!'' cried the rich boy. "I+'ll help you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the death of Hiram Bodley, Joe and two of the lake guides had managed to repair one room of the broken-down cabin, and from this the funeral had taken place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room contained a bed, a table, two benches and a few dishes and cooking utensils The floor was bare and the window was broken out. It was truly a most uninviting home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you are not going to stay here, now you are alone?'' said Ned, after a look around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know where else to go, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not move into town!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I will. But I want to find that blue box before I decide on anything.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without delay the two boys set to work among the ruins, looking into every hole and corner they could think of and locate. They pulled away heavy boards and logs, and Joe even got a spade and dug up the ground at certain points.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It does+n't seem to be here,'' said Ned, after an hour had passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must be here,'' cried Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it was buried under a tree.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That may be true. Anyway, I am certain it is somewhere around this cabin.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After that the hunt was continued for another hour, and they visited several spots in that locality where Joe thought the blue box might have been placed. But it was all to no purpose, the box failed to come to light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last the two boys sat down on a bench in front of the cabin. Both were tired out, Ned especially so. Joe was much downcast and his friend did what he could to cheer him up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The box is bound to come to light some day,'' said Ned. "That is, unless some of those men carried it off.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What men, Ned?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The fellows who helped to mend the cabin just before the funeral.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I don't think they would steal the box. Bart Andrews and Jack Thompson are as honest as the day is long.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it+'s mighty queer you can+'t find some trace of the blue box.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys talked the matter over for some time, and then Ned announced that he must go home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can go with me if you wish,'' he said. "It will be better than staying here all alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Joe declined the offer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I+'ll stay here, and begin the hunt again the first thing in the morning,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you want anything, come and see me, Joe; won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned had come over in his own boat and now Joe walked down to the lake with him. His friend gone, the hermit's boy returned to the dilapidated cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was hungry but he had no heart to eat. He munched some bread and cheese which a neighbor had brought over. He felt utterly alone in the great worlds and when he thought of this a strange feeling came over him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a bitter night for the poor boy, but when morning came his mind was made up. He would make his own way in the world, asking aid from no one, not even Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And if I can't find the blue box I+'ll get along without it,'' he told himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as it was light he procured breakfast and then started on another hunt for the missing box. The entire day was spent in the search, but without results. Towards night, Joe went down to the lake. Here he caught a couple of small fish, which he fried for his supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All told, Joe had exactly a dollar and a half of his own and nine dollars which he had found in the hermit's pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten dollars and a half,'' he mused, as he counted the amount over. "Not very much to go out into the world with. If I want to do anything in town I+'ll have to buy some clothes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From this it will be surmised that Joe was thinking of giving up his roving life around the lake and mountains, and this was true. Hunting and fishing appealed to him only in an uncertain way, and he longed to go forth into the busy world and make something of himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had two suits of clothing, but both were very much worn, and so were his shoes and his cap. Hiram Bodley had left some old clothing, but they were too big for the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I+'ll get Jasok the peddler to come up here and make me an offer for what is here,'' he told himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jasok was a Hebrew peddler who drove around through the lake region, selling tinware and doing all sorts of trading. It was time for him to visit that neighborhood and Joe went to the nearest house on the main road and asked about the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He will most likely be along to-morrow, Joe,'' said the neighbor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he comes, Mr. Smith, will you send him over to my place? Tell him I want an offer for the things.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to sell out, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you going to do after that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Try for some job in town.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s a good idea. Hunting and fishing is+n't what it used to be. What do you want for the things?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I can get,'' and a brief smile hovered on Joe's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would+n't sell out too cheap. Jasok is a great fellow to drive a bargain.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he won't give me a fair price, I+'ll load the things on the rowboat and sell them in town.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s an idea. Do you want to sell Hiram's double-barrel shot gun?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll give you ten dollars for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was going to ask twelve, Mr. Smith. It+'s a pretty good gun.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So it is, although it is a little bit old-fashioned. Well, bring it over and I+'ll allow you twelve dollars,'' answered the neighbor, who was willing to assist Joe all he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe went back for the gun without delay, and received his money. Then he returned to the cabin and brought out all the goods he wished to sell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the middle of the next day the Hebrew peddler appeared. At first he declared that all of the things Joe had to sell were not worth two dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, if you think that, we won't talk about it,'' said Joe, briefly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Da vos all vorn out,'' said Jasok. "De clothes vos rags, and de furniture an' dishes was kracked.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don't want them, I+'ll take them to town and sell them. I am sure Moskowsky will buy them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it happened that Moskowsky was a rival peddler who also boasted of the ownership of a second-hand store. To think that the goods might go to this man nettled Jasok exceedingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Vell, I likes you, Cho,'' he said. "I vos your friend, an' I gif you dree dollars for dem dings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can have them for ten dollars,'' answered the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A long talk followed, and in the end the Hebrew peddler agreed to pay seven dollars and a half, providing Joe would help to carry the goods to the main road, where the wagon had been left. The money was paid over, and by nightfall all of the goods were on the wagon, and Joe was left at the cabin with nothing but the suit on his back. But he had thirty dollars in his pocket, which he counted over with great satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ought to be able to get something to do before that is gone,'' he told himself. "If I don't, it will be my own fault.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V. A NEW SUIT OF CLOTHES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON the following day it rained early in the morning, so Joe had to wait until noon before he left the old cabin. He took with him all that remained of his possessions, including the precious pocketbook with the thirty dollars. When he thought of the blue box he sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it will never come to light,'' he told himself. "Well, if it does not I+'ll have to make the best of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two o'clock found him on the streets of Riverside, which was a town of fair size. During the summer months many visitors were in the place and the hotels and boarding houses were crowded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one very fine clothing store in Riverside, but Joe did not deem it best, with his limited capital, to go there for a suit. In- stead he sought out a modest establishment on one of the side streets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just ahead of him was an Irish couple who had evidently not been in this country many years. The man entered the store awkwardly, as if he did not feel at home. Not so his wife, who walked a little in advance of her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got any men's coats?'' said she to the clerk who came forward to wait on the pair. "If I can get one cheap for me husband here I+'ll buy one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, madam,'' was the ready reply. "We have the best stock in town, by all odds. You can't fail to be suited.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying, he led the way to a counter piled high with the articles called for, and hauled them over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There,'' said he, pulling out one of a decidedly ugly pattern. "There is one of first quality cloth. It was made for a gentleman of this town, but did not exactly fit him, and so we+'ll sell it cheap.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what is the price?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three dollars!'' exclaimed the Irish lady, lifting up her hands in extreme astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three dollars! You+'ll be afther thinkin' we+'re made of money, sure! I+'ll give you a dollar and a half.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, ma'am, we don't trade in that way. We don't very often take half what we ask for an article.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mike,'' said she, "pull off yer coat an' thry it on. Three dollars, and it looks as if it was all cotton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a thread of cotton in that,'' was the clerk's reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not wan, but a good many, I+'m thinkin','' retorted the Irish lady, as she helped her husband draw on the coat. It fitted tolerably well and Mike seemed mightily pleased with his transformation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come,'' said the wife. "What will ye take?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As it+'s you, I+'ll take off twenty-five cents,'' replied the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And sell it to me for two dollars?'' inquired his customer, who had good cause for her inaccurate arithmetic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For two dollars and seventy-five cents.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two dollars and seventy-five cents! It+'s taking the bread out of the childer's mouths you+'d have us, paying such a price as that! I+'ll give you two twenty-five, an' I+'ll be coming again some time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We could+n't take so low as two twenty-five, ma'am. You may have it for two dollars and a half.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After another ineffectual attempt to get it for two dollars and a quarter, the Irish woman finally offered two dollars and forty-five cents, and this offer was accepted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pulled out a paper of change and counted out two dollars and forty cents, when she declared that she had not another cent. But the clerk understood her game and coolly proceeded to put the coat back on the pile. Then the woman very opportunely found another five-cent piece stored away in the corner of her pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s robbin' me, ye are,'' said she as she paid it over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, ma'am, you are getting a great bargain,'' answered the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had witnessed the bargaining with a good deal of quiet amusement. As soon as the Irish couple had gone the clerk came toward the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, young man, what can I do for you?'' he asked, pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want a suit of clothing. Not an expensive suit, but one guaranteed to be all wool.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A light or a dark suit?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dark gray.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can fit you out in a fine suit of this order,'' and the clerk pointed to several lying in a heap nearby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want that sort. I want something on the order of those in the window marked nine dollars and a half.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, all right.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several suits were brought forth, and one was found that fitted Joe exceedingly well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You guarantee this to be all wool?'' asked the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Every thread of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'ll take it''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; the price is twelve dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is+n't it like that in the window?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On that order, but a trifle better.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me to be about the same suit. I+'ll give you nine dollars and a half.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't take it. I+'ll give it to you for eleven and a half. That is our best figure.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'ll go elsewhere for a suit,'' answered Joe, and started to leave the clothing establishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on, don't be so fast!'' cried the clerk, catching him by the arm. "I+'ll make it eleven and a quarter.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a cent more than the advertised price, nine and a half,'' replied Joe, firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but this is+n't the same suit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s just like it, to my eye. But you need+n't sell it for that if you don't want it. Mason &amp; Harris are offering some bargains, I believe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can get a better bargain here than anywhere in this town, or in Philadelphia either,'' answered the clerk, who did not intend to let his prospective customer get away. "We+'ll make it an even eleven dollars and say no more about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of answering Joe started once more for the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have+n't got time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make it ten and a half. At that price we are losing exactly half a dollar on that suit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a cent over what I offered.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can't sell suits at such a loss. It would ruin us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then don't do it. I think Mason &amp; Harris have some good suits very cheap. And they are quite up-to-date, too,'' added Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Our suits are the best in town, young man. Take this one for an even ten dollar bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will if you+'ll throw in one of those half dollar caps,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, have your own way, but it+'s a sacrifice,'' grumbled the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He wanted to wrap up the suit, but, afraid he might substitute something else, Joe insisted upon donning the suit then and there and likewise the new cap. Then he had the old articles of wearing apparel done up into a bundle and paid over the ten dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re pretty smart after a bargain,'' said the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got to be—when I strike such fellows as you,'' was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You got a better bargain than that Irish woman did.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did—if the suit is all wool. But if it+'s cotton, I+'m stuck,'' returned our hero, and with his bundle under his arm he walked from the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had left his rowboat in charge of an old boatman named Ike Fairfield, and now he walked down to the boathouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just in time, Joe,'' said the old boatman. "Want to earn a dollar?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure I do,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A party of ladies want a long row around the lake. You can have the job.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Ike.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I charged them a dollar and a quarter. I+'ll keep the quarter for my commission.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is fair.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One of the ladies said she wanted somebody that looked pretty decent. I think you+'ll fill the bill with that new suit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did+n't expect to wear the suit out on the lake, but in this case I+'ll keep it on,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I find it pays to keep well dressed, when you take out the summer boarders,'' answered the old boatman. "And it pays to keep the boats in good shape, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where am I to get the party?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over to the dock of Mallison's Hotel. One of the ladies is Mallison's niece.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't they take a hotel boat?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All engaged, two days ago. It+'s a busy season. But I+'ve got to be going. You had better go over to the dock at once. They want to go out at three o'clock sharp.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, I+'ll be on hand,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI. AN ACCIDENT ON THE LAKE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOE certainly presented a neat appearance when he rowed over to the hotel dock. Before going he purchased a new collar and a dark blue tie, and these, with his new suit and new cap, set him off very well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boat had been cleaned in the morning, and when the ladies appeared they inspected the craft with satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a nice clean boat,'' said Mabel Mallison, the niece of the proprietor of the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And a nice clean boatman, too,'' whispered one of her friends. "I could+n't bear that man we had day before yesterday, with his dirty hands and the tobacco juice around his mouth.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ladies to go out were four in number, and two sat in the bow and two in the stern. It made quite a heavy load, but as they were not out for speed our hero did not mind it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We wish to go up to Fern Rock,'' said Mabel Mallison. "They tell me there are some beautiful ferns to be gathered there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There are,'' answered Joe. "I saw them last week.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I wish to get some nice birch bark if I can,'' said another of the ladies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can get you plenty of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe rowed along in his best style, and while doing so the ladies of the party asked him numerous questions concerning the lake and vicinity. When Fern Rock was reached, all went ashore, and our hero pointed out the ferns he had seen, and dug up such as the others wished to take along. An hour was spent over the ferns, and in getting some birch bark, and then they started on the return for the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like to row,'' cried one of the ladies, a rather plump personage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jennie, I don't think you can!'' cried another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I can,'' answered Jennie, and sprang up from her seat to take the oars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be careful!'' came in a warning from Joe, as the boat began to rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I+'m not afraid!'' said the plump young lady, and leaned forward to catch hold of one oar. Just then her foot slipped and she fell on the gunwale, causing the boat to tip more than ever. As she did this, Mabel Mallison, who was leaning over the side, gazing down into the clear waters of the lake, gave a shriek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, save me!'' came from her, and then she went over, with a loud splash.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was startled, and the ladies left in the boat set up a wail of terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She will be drowned!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, save her! Save her, somebody!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is my fault!'' shrieked the plump young lady. "I tipped the boat over!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe said nothing, but looked over the side of the boat. He saw the body of Mabel Mallison not far away. But it was at the lake bottom and did not offer to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s queer she does+n't come up,'' he thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he gave a second look and saw that the dress of the unfortunate one was caught in some sharp rocks. Without hesitation he dived overboard, straight for the bottom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was no easy matter to unfasten the garment. which was caught in a crack between two heavy stones. But at the second tug it came free, and a moment later both our hero and Mabel Mallison came to the surface.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!'' cried two of the ladies in the row-boat. "Is she drowned?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I trust not,'' answered Joe. "Sit still, please, or the boat will surely go over.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As best he could Joe hoisted Mabel into the craft and then clambered in himself. As he did so the unfortunate girl gave a gasp and opened her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!'' she murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are safe now, Mabel!'' said one of her companions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And to think it was my fault!'' murmured the plump young lady. "I shall never forgive myself as long as I live!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mabel Mallison had swallowed some water, but otherwise she was unhurt. But her pretty blue dress was about ruined, and Joe's new suit did not look near as well as it had when he had donned it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let us row for the hotel,'' said one of the young ladies. "Are you all right?'' she asked of Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am, barring the wetting.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was brave of you to go down after Mabel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed it was!'' cried that young lady. "If it had+n't been for you I might have been drowned.'' And she gave a deep shudder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw she was caught and that+'s why I went over after her,'' answered our hero simply. "It was+n't so much to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All dripping as he was, Joe caught up the oars of the boat and sent the craft in the direction of the hotel at a good speed. That she might not take cold, a shawl was thrown over Mabel's wet shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The arrival of the party at the hotel caused a mild sensation. Mabel hurried to her room to put on dry clothing, and Joe was directed to go around to the kitchen. But when the proprietor of the place had heard what Joe had done for his niece he sent the lad to a private apartment and provided him with dry clothing belonging to another who was of our hero's size.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was a fine thing to do, young man,'' said the hotel proprietor, when Joe appeared, dressed in the dry garments, and his own clothing had been sent to the laundry to be dried and pressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m glad I was there to do it, Mr. Mallison.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me see, are+n't you Hiram Bodley's boy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I lived with Mr. Bodley, yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I mean. It was a terrible accident that killed him. Are you still living at the tumbled-down cabin?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir. I+'ve just sold off the things, and I am going to settle in town.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have+n't decided that yet. I was going to hunt up a place when Ike Fairfield gave me the job of rowing out the young ladies.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see. You own the boat, eh?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to be able to make a fair living, taking out summer boarders.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose so, but that won't give me anything to do this winter.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, perhaps something else will turn up by that time.'' Andrew Mallison drew out a fat wallet. "I want to reward you for saving Mabel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew out two ten-dollar bills and held them towards our hero. But Joe shook his head and drew back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you very much, Mr. Mallison, but I don'+t want any reward.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you have earned it fairly, my lad.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't touch it. If you want to help me you can throw some odd rowing jobs from the hotel in my way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you won't really touch the money?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How would you like to work for the hotel regularly?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like it first-rate if it paid.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can guarantee you regular work so long as the summer season lasts.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what would it pay?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At least a dollar a day, and your board.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'ll accept and with thanks for your kindness.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When can you come?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m here already.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That means that you can stay from now on?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't suppose you want the job of haul- ing somebody from the lake every day,'' said Andrew Mallison, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not unless I was dressed for it, Mr. Mallison. Still, it has been the means of getting me a good position.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall feel safe in sending out parties with you for I know you will do your best to keep them from harm.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll certainly do that, I can promise you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow you can take out two old ladies who wish to be rowed around the whole lake and shown every point of interest. Of course you know all the points.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I know every foot of ground around the lake, and I know the mountains, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then there will be no difficulty in keeping you busy. I am glad to take you on. I am short one man—or will be by to-night. I am going to let Sam Cullum go, for he drinks too much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you won't have any trouble with me on that score.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you drink?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a drop, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to hear it, and it is to your credit,'' concluded the hotel proprietor.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII. BLOWS AND KIND DEEDS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SEVERAL days passed and Joe went out half a dozen times on the lake with parties from the hotel. All whom he served were pleased with him and treated him so nicely that, for the time being, his past troubles were forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the beginning of the week Ned Talmadge came to see him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going away to join the folks out West,'' said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will have a good time,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I+'m sure to have that, Joe. By the way, you are nicely settled here, it would seem.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and I am thankful for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Mallison is a fine man to work for, so I have been told. You had better stick to him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall—as long as the work holds out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe he will give you something else to do, after the boating season is over.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few more words passed, and then Ned took his departure. It was to be a long time before the two friends would meet again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So far Joe had had no trouble with anybody around the hotel, but that evening, when he was cleaning out his boat, a man approached him and caught him rudely by the shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you+'re the feller that+'s took my job from me, eh?'' snarled the newcomer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero looked up and recognized Sam Cullum, the boatman who had been discharged for drinking. Even now the boatman was more than half under the influence of intoxicants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have+n't taken anybody's job from him,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say yer did!'' growled Cullum. "It ain't fair, nuther!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this our hero did not reply, but went on cleaning out his boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fer two pins I+'d lick yer!'' went on the tipsy boatman, lurching forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, Sam Cullum, I want you to keep your distance,'' said Joe, sharply. "Mr. Mallison discharged you for drinking. I had nothing to do with it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't drink; leastwise, I don't drink no more+'n I need.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you do. It would be the best thing in the world for you if you+'d leave liquor alone entirely.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! don't you preach to me, you little imp!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then leave me alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You stole the job from me an' I+'m going to lick you for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you touch me you+'ll get hurt,'' said Joe, his eyes flashing. "Leave me alone and I+'ll leave you alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bah!'' snarled the other, and struck out awkwardly. He wanted to hit Joe on the nose, but the boy dodged with ease, and Sam Cullum fell sprawling over the rowboat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi! what did ye trip me up for?'' spluttered the half-intoxicated man, as he rose slowly. "Don't you do that ag+'in, do yer hear?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then don't try to strike me again.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a moment of silence and then Sam Cullum gathered himself for another blow. By this time a small crowd of boys and hotel helpers began to collect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sam Cullum's going to fight Joe Bodley!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sam+'ll most kill Joe!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With all his strength the man rushed at Joe. But the boy dodged again and put out his foot and the man went headlong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now will you let me alone?'' asked our hero, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I won't!'' roared Sam Cullum. "Somebody give me a club! I+'ll show him!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arising once more, he caught up an oar and launched a heavy blow at Joe's head. For a third time our hero dodged, but the oar struck him on the arm, and the blow hurt not a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was now angry and believed it was time to defend himself. He edged towards the end of the dock and Sam Cullum followed. Then, of a sudden the boy ducked under the man's arm, turned, and gave him a quick shove that sent him with a splash into the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah! score one for Joe!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will cool Sam Cullum's temper.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and perhaps it will sober him a little,'' came from a man standing by, who had witnessed the quarrel from the beginning. "He brought this on himself; the boy had nothing to do with it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam Cullum floundered around in the water like a whale cast up in the shallows. The lake at that point was not over four feet deep, but he did not know enough to stand upright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Save me!'' he bellowed. "Save me! I don't want to drown!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Swallow a little water, it will do you good!'' said a bystander, with a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Walk out and you+'ll be all right,'' added another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last Sam Cullum found his feet and walked around the side of the dock to the shore. A crowd followed him and kept him from going at Joe again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll fix him another time,'' growled the intoxicated one, and shuffled off, with some small boys jeering him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You treated him as he deserved,'' said one of the other boatmen to Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose he+'ll try to square up another time,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I would+n+'t take water for him, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't intend to. If he attacks me I+'ll do the best I can to defend myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has made a nuisance of himself for a long time. It+'s a wonder to me that Mr. Mallison put up with it so long.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was short of help, that+'s why. It is+n't so easy to get new help in the height of the summer season.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is true.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe expected to have more trouble with Sam Cullum the next day but it did not come. Then it leaked out that Cullum had gotten into a row with his wife and some of her relatives that night and was under arrest. When the boatman was brought up for trial the Judge sentenced him to six months' imprisonment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And it serves him right,'' said the man who brought the news to Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must be hard on his wife.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it is, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have they any children?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Four—a boy of seven and three little girls.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are they well of?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, with such a father? No, they are very poor. She used to go out washing, but now she has to stay at home to take care of the baby. Sam was a brute to strike her. I don+'t wonder the relatives took a hand.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the relatives can help her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They can't do much, for they are all as poor as she is, and one of them is just getting over an operation at the hospital.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do the Cullums live?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down on Railroad Alley, not far from the water tower. It+'s a mite of a cottage.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe said no more, but what he had been told him set him to thinking, and that evening, after his work was over, he took a walk through the town and in the direction of Railroad Alley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not far from the water station he found the Cullum homestead, a mite of a cottage, as the man had said, with a tumbled-down chimney and several broken-out windows. He looked in at one of the windows and by the light of a smoking kerosene lamp beheld a woman in a rocking-chair, rocking a baby to sleep. Three other youngsters were standing around, knowing not what to do. On a table were some dishes, all bare of food.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mamma, I want more bread,'' one of the little ones was saying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can have more in the morning, Johnny,'' answered the mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I want it now,'' whimpered the youngster. "I+'m hungry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m hungry, too,'' put in another little one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't give you any more to-night, for I have+n't it,'' said the mother, with a deep sigh. "Now, be still, or you+'ll wake the baby.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't dad come home?'' asked the boy of seven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He can't come home, Bobby—he—had to go away,'' faltered the mother. "Now all be still, and you shall have more bread in the morning.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The children began to cry, and unable to stand the sight any longer Joe withdrew. Up the Alley was a grocery store and he almost ran to this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give me some bread,'' he said, "and some cake, and a pound of cheese, and some smoked beef, and a pound of good tea, and some sugar. Be quick, please.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The goods were weighed out and wrapped up, and with his arms full he ran back to the cottage and kicked on the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is there?'' asked Mrs. Cullum, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here are some groceries for you!'' cried Joe. "All paid for!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, look!'' screamed the boy of seven. "Bread, and cheese!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And sugar!'' came from one of the little girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And tea! Mamma, just what you like!'' said another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did this come from?'' asked Mrs. Cullum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A friend,'' answered Joe. "It+'s all paid for.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very thankful.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now we can have some bread, can't we?'' queried the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and a bit of smoked beef and cheese, too,'' said the mother, and placing the sleeping baby on a bed, she proceeded to deal out the good things to her children.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII. THE TIMID MR. GUSSING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was not until the children had been satisfied and put to bed that Joe had a chance to talk to Mrs. Cullum. She was greatly astonished when she learned who he was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did+n't expect this kindness,'' said she. "I understand that my husband treated you shamefully.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was the liquor made him do it ma'am,'' answered our hero. "I think he+'d be all right if he+'d leave drink alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I am sure of it!'' She gave a long sigh. "He was very kind and true when we were first married. But then he got to using liquor and—and—this is the result.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps he will turn over a new leaf when he comes out of jail.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope he does. If he does+n't, I don't know what I am going to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you anything to do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I used to wash for two families in town but they have regular hired help now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you can get more work, if you advertise. If you+'ll allow me, I+'ll put an advertisement in the Riverside News for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you. I don't see what makes you so kind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I have been down in the world myself, Mrs. Cullum, so I know how to feel for others.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you say you used to live with Bodley, the hermit?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My folks used to know him. He was rather a strange man after he got shot by accident.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but he was kind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you his son?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. He said I was his nephew. But I never found out much about that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I remember something about that. He had a brother who lost his wife and several children. Are you that man's son?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I am.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you have never heard from your father?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a word.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is hard on you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to look for my father some day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If so, I hope you will find him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I.'' Joe arose. "I must be going.'' He paused. "Mrs. Cullum, will you let me help you?'' he added, earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you have helped me a good deal already. Not one in a thousand would do what you have done—after the way my husband treated you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought that you might be short of money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must confess I am.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not rich but, if you can use it, I can let you have five dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll accept it as a loan. I don't want you to give me the money,'' answered the poor woman. She thought of the things she absolutely needed, now that her husband was gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The money was handed over, and a few minutes later Joe took his departure. Somehow his heart felt very light because of his generosity. He had certainly played the part of a friend in need.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But he did not stop there. Early in the morning he sought out Andrew Mallison and told the hotel proprietor of Mrs. Cullum's condition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was thinking that you might be able to give her work in the hotel laundry,'' he continued.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hotel man called up the housekeeper and from her learned that another woman could be used to iron.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can let her come and we+'ll give her a trial,'' said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did not take Joe long to communicate with the poor woman, and she was overjoyed to see work in sight, without waiting for an advertisement in the newspaper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll go at once,'' said she. "I+'ll get a neighbor's girl to mind the children.'' And she was as good as her word. As it happened, she proved to be a good laundress, and Mr. Mallison gave her steady employment until her husband came from jail. Then, much to his wife's satisfaction, Sam Cullum turned over a new leaf and became quite sober and industrious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was now becoming well acquainted around the hotel and took an interest in many of the boarders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the number was a young man named Felix Gussing. He was a nice individual in his way, but had certain peculiarities. One was that he was exceedingly afraid of horses and at every possible opportunity he gave them as wide a berth as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't like them at all, don't you know,'' he said, to Joe, during a boat ride. "Can't understand them at all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I think a good horse is very nice,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But they are so—so balkish—so full of kicking,'' insisted Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I admit some of them are,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were two young ladies stopping at the hotel and the young man had become quite well acquainted with both of them. One he thought was very beautiful and was half tempted to propose to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the day after the boat ride with Joe, Felix Gussing took the ladies to have some ice cream, and during the conversation all spoke of a certain landmark of interest located about three miles from Riverside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have seen it and it is—aw—very interesting,'' drawled Felix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we must see it, Belle,'' said one of the young ladies, to her companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I+'m not going to walk that far,'' answered Belle, with a bewitching look at the young man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You might drive over,'' suggested Felix, without stopping to think twice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I love driving!'' cried one of the girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And so do I!'' answered the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will find out what can be done about a conveyance,'' answered Felix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Being a good deal of a dude, and dressing very fastidiously, he did not much relish visiting the livery stable attached to the hotel. But, early on the following morning, he walked down to the place, and ordered a horse and carriage, to be ready at ten o'clock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it must be known that Felix did not intend to drive the carriage. He thought the young ladies would drive for themselves, since both had said that they loved driving. Unfortunate man! he knew not the snare he had laid for himself!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Punctual to the minute the carriage drove up to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Felix was on hand, standing on the steps, with politeness in his air, though with trembling in his heart because so near the horses. He assisted the ladies in. Then he handed the reins to Miss Belle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you wish me to hold the horses while you get in?'' she asked sweetly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Till I get in!'' ejaculated Felix, taken aback.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly! You don't think we are going to drive ourselves, do you? Of course you are going with us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Felix! He was "in for it'' now, decidedly. It required a good deal of moral courage, a quality in which he was deficient, to resist a lady's demand. His knees trembled with fear as he scrambled in. Joe, who was standing not far away, looked on with a quiet smile on his face. He realized what was passing in the dude's mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'d give ten dollars to get out of it,'' our hero told himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy who had brought the turnout around looked at Felix Gussing earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take care of that horse, mister,'' said he, warningly. "He+'s young and a little bit wild.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wild?'' gasped the dude. "I—I don't want to drive a wild horse.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, he+'ll be all right if you keep an eye on him,'' went on the stable boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Young and a little bit wild!'' thought Felix to himself. "Oh, dear, what in the world shall I do?'' I never drove a horse before. If I get back with less than a broken neck I+'ll be lucky! I+'d give a thousand to be out of this pickle.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Had+n't we better start, Mr. Gussing?'' asked one of the young ladies, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes—certainly!'' he stammered. "But —er—you can drive if you wish.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, but I would prefer that you drive.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you drive?'' he asked of the other young lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, not to-day. But I+'ll use the whip if you say so,'' she answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not for the world!'' cried the unhappy Felix. "He is a bit wild already and there is no telling what he+'d do if he felt the whip.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last the carriage drove off. Joe gazed after it thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Unless I miss my guess, there is going to be trouble before that drive is over,'' he thought. And there was trouble, as we shall soon learn.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX. AN UNFORTUNATE OUTING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FORTUNATELY for the unhappy Felix the horse walked away from the hotel in an orderly fashion, and soon they gained the highway leading to the resort the party wished to visit. Had the dude left the horse alone all might have gone well. But he deemed it necessary to pull on first one line and then the other, which kept the carriage in a meandering course. "I don't think, Mr. Gussing, that you can be much used to driving,'' said one of the young ladies, presently. "That+'s a fact,'' answered the dude. "Why don't you keep to the right of the road?'' "Well,—er—the fact is, this horse is a very difficult one to drive. I don't believe I ever drove one which was more so.'' As this was the first horse Mr. Gussing had ever driven, this assertion was true in every particular. "Oh, I can't travel so slow!'' cried one of the young ladies, and seized the whip, and before Felix could stop her, used it on the steed. The effect was magical. The horse started up like a racer, and tore through the street as if trying to win a race for a thousand dollars. The dude clung to the reins in the wildest terror. To his frenzied imagination it seemed that his final hour was approaching. "Whoa!'' he screamed, jerking on the lines. "Stop, you crazy beast! Stop, before we all get killed!'' But the horse only went the faster. And now, to increase his alarm, he saw a buggy approaching from the opposite direction. It contained one of the town lawyers, Silas Simms by name. "We shall run into that buggy!'' screamed the fair Belle. "Oh, Mr. Gussing, be careful!'' A moment later the two turnouts came together with a crash, and one wheel was torn from the buggy and the town lawyer pitched out headlong to the ground. Then on went the carriage with the dude and the two young ladies, at a faster pace than ever. "Let me jump out!'' screamed one of the ladies. "No, not yet! You+'ll be killed, Grace,'' answered Belle. "Then stop the carriage!'' Alas, the poor Felix was already doing his best to stop the horse. But his jerkings on the reins only added to the horse's wildness. Not far along the road was a good sized brook, spanned by a neat wooden bridge. As the carriage neared the bridge, Felix pulled on the wrong rein once again. The horse turned from the road proper, and descended full speed into the stream itself. "Oh, now we+'ll be drowned!'' shrieked Grace. But she was mistaken. The stream was easily fordable, so there was no danger on that score. But the rate at which they were impelled through the water naturally created no inconsiderable splashing, so that on emerging on the other side the dude, as well as the young ladies, were well drenched. To the great joy of Felix the contact with the water cooled the ardor of the steed, so that he resumed the journey at a far more moderate rate of speed. "Was+n't it just glorious!'' cried Belle, who, after the danger seemed past, grew enthusiastic. "What a noble animal!'' "Glorious?'' echoed the dude. "I don't care much about such glory. As for the noble animal—I—er—I wish he was hung! That+'s the best he deserves.'' The dude spoke bitterly, for the spell of terror was still on him. Had he consulted his own wishes he would have leaped from the carriage and left the ladies to their fate. But the thought of the bewitching Belle made him keep his seat, and he resolved that if he must die he would do it like a martyr. The horse went on, and at last they neared the end of the short journey. But here a new obstacle presented itself. There was a big fence and a gate, and the gate was tight shut. As they could not enter the grounds without opening the gate, the dude got down out of the carriage. He did not hand the reins to either of the ladies but laid them over the dashboard. The instant the gate was swung open the steed darted forward, and brought up with a jerk against a post that happened to be in the way. Here he reared and plunged, causing the young ladies to scream "murder'' at the top of their voices. "Oh, my! Oh, dear me!'' bawled Felix, and took refuge behind a neighboring hedge. "The horse has gone crazy! He+'ll bite somebody next!'' The cries reached some men who were not far off, and they came running to the assistance of the party. One caught the steed by the bridle and soon had him quieted down. "I+'ll never drive that horse again!'' said the dude. "Not for a million dollars!'' "How are we to get home?'' queried Belle. "I+'ll drive you,'' said one of the men. "I know this horse. He used to belong to Bill Perkins. I know how to handle him.'' "Then do so,'' answered Felix, "and I+'ll pay you two dollars.'' The man was as good as his word, and to Felix's astonishment he made the horse go back to the hotel without the slightest mishap. Then the horse was put in the stable, the dude paid the bill, and the party separated. "I shall never drive again, never!'' declared the dude to himself, and it may be added that he kept his word. "I hope you had a nice drive,'' said Joe, when he met Felix that evening. "It was beastly, don't you know,'' was the answer. "That horse was a terribly vicious creature.'' "He looked to be gentle enough when he started off.'' "I think he is a crazy horse.'' "By the way, Mr. Gussing, Mr. Silas Simms was looking for you.'' "You mean that lawyer who drives the spotted white horse?'' "Yes.'' Felix gave a groan. "He says he wants damages.'' "It was+n't my fault that the horse ran into him.'' "Well, he is very angry about it, anyway,'' said our hero. Early the next morning Felix Gussing received a communication from the lawyer. It was in the following terms:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"MR. GUSSING. Sir: —In consequence of your reckless driving yesterday, I was thrown from my carriage, receiving a contusion on my shoulder and other injuries. My carriage was also nearly ruined. If you choose to make a race-course of the public highways you must abide the consequences. The damage I have sustained I cannot estimate at less than one hundred and fifty dollars. Indemnify me for that and I will go no further. Otherwise, I shall be compelled to resort to legal action. "SILAS SIMMS, Atty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Felix read the letter several times and his knees shook visibly. He did not want to pay over such an amount, yet it struck him with terror when he thought he might possibly be arrested for fast driving. He went to see Mr. Silas Simms. "I am very sorry,'' he began. "Have you come to pay?'' demanded the attorney, curtly. "Well—er—the fact is—don't you think you are asking rather a stiff price, Mr. Simms?'' "Not at all! Not at all, sir! I ought to have placed the damages at three hundred!'' "I+'ll give you fifty dollars and call it square.'' "No, sir, a hundred and fifty! Not a penny less, not one penny! Look at my nose, sir— all scratched! And my ear! Not a penny less than one hundred and fifty dollars!'' And the lawyer pounded on his desk with his fist. "All right then, I+'ll pay you, but you must give me a receipt in full,'' answered the dude. He had to wait until the bank opened, that he might cash a check, and then he paid over the amount demanded. The lawyer drew up a legal paper discharging him from all further obligations. Felix read it with care and stowed it in his pocket. "And now let me give you some advice, Mr. Gussing,'' said the lawyer, after the transaction was concluded. "Don't drive such a wild horse again.'' "Depend upon it, I never shall,'' answered the dude. "It costs too much!'' he added, with a faint smile. "Are you well acquainted with horses?'' "No.'' "Then you had better leave them alone altogether.'' "I have already made up my mind to do so.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X. DAVID BALL FROM MONTANA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FINDING that Joe could be depended upon, Mr. Mallison put him in charge of all of the boats at the hotel, so that our hero had almost as much work ashore as on the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the week following, the events just narrated, many visitors left the hotel and others came in. Among those to go were Felix Gussing and the two young ladies. The dude bid our hero a cordial good-bye, for he now knew Joe quite well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-bye, Mr. Gussing,'' said Joe. "I hope we meet again.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps we shall, although I generally go to a different place each summer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I don't expect to stay in Riverside all my life.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see. If you make a move, I hope you do well,'' returned Felix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the day after the dude left, a man came to the hotel who, somehow, looked familiar to our hero. He came dressed in a light overcoat and a slouch hat, and carried a valise and a suit case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve seen him before, but where?'' Joe asked himself not once but several times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man registered as David Ball, and put down his address as Butte, Montana. He said he was a mining expert, but added that he was sick and the doctors had ordered him to come East for a rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve heard of Riverside being a nice place,'' said he, "so I came on right after striking Pittsburg.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We shall do all we can to make your stay a pleasant one,'' said the hotel proprietor, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I want is a nice sunny room, where I can get fresh air and take it easy,'' said the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was willing to pay a good price, and so obtained one of the best rooms in the house, one overlooking the river and the lake. He ate one meal in the dining room, but after that he had his meals sent to his apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he sick?'' asked Joe, after watching the man one day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He certainly does+n't seem to be well,'' answered Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It runs in my mind that I have seen him before, but I can't place him,'' went on our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must be mistaken, Joe. I questioned him and he says this is his first trip to the East, although he has frequently visited St. Louis and Chicago.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the following day the man called for a physician and Doctor Gardner was sent for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got pains here,'' said the man from the West, and pointed to his chest. "Do you think I am getting consumption?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Riverside physician made a careful examination and then said the man had probably strained himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Reckon I did,'' was the ready answer. "I was in the mine and a big rock came down on me. I had to hold it up for ten minutes before anybody came to my aid I thought I was a dead one sure.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will give you some medicine and a lini- ment,'' said the doctor. "Perhaps you+'ll feel better after a good rest.'' And then he left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That afternoon Joe had to go up into the hotel for something and passed the room of the new boarder. He saw the man standing by the window, gazing out on the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m dead certain I+'ve seen him before,'' mused our hero. "It is queer I can't think where.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Doctor Gardner wanted to be taken across the lake and Joe himself did the job. As he was rowing he asked about the man who had signed the hotel register as David Ball from Montana.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he very sick, doctor?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I can't say that he is,'' was the physician's answer. "He looks to be as healthy as you or I.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s queer he keeps to his room.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps something happened out at his mine to unsettle his nerves. He told me of some sort of an accident.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he a miner?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is a mine owner, so Mr. Mallison told me, but he never heard of the man before.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stranger received several letters the next day and then a telegram. Shortly after that he took to his bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am feeling worse,'' said he to the bell boy who answered his ring. "I want you to send for that doctor again. Ask him to call about noon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir,'' answered the boy, and Doctor Gardner was sent for without delay. He came and made another examination and left some medicine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll take the medicine regularly,'' said the stranger, who was in bed. But when the doctor had left he quietly poured half of the contents of the bottle into the wash bowl, where it speedily drained from sight!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't catch me drinking such rot,'' he muttered to himself. "I+'d rather have some good liquor any day,'' and he took a long pull from a black bottle he had in his valise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About noon a carriage drove up to the hotel and two men alighted. One led the way into the hotel and asked to see the register.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like to see Mr. David Ball,'' said he to the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Ball is sick.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I have heard and that is why I wish to see him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll send up your card.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't happen to have a card. Tell him Mr. Anderson is here, from Philadelphia, with a friend of his.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The message was sent to the sick man's room, and word came down that he would see the visitors in a few minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He says he is pretty sick and he can't talk business very long,'' said the bell boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We won't bother him very much,'' answered the man who had given his name as Anderson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe happened to be close by during this conversation and he looked the man called Anderson over with care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve seen that man, too!'' he declared to himself. "But where? I declare he is as much of a mystery as the sick one!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero's curiosity was now aroused to the highest pitch, and when the two men walked up to David Ball's room he followed to the very doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in,'' came from the room, and a deep groan followed. On the bed lay the man from Montana, wrapped in several blankets and with a look of anguish on his features.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Feeling pretty bad, eh?'' said Anderson, as he stalked in. "I am downright sorry for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m afraid I am going to die,'' groaned the man in bed. "The doctor says I am in bad shape. He wants me to take a trip to Europe, or somewhere else.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is Mr. Maurice Vane,'' went on Anderson. "We won't trouble you any more than is necessary, Mr. Ball.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry to disturb you,'' said Maurice Vane. He was a kindly looking gentleman. "Perhaps we had better defer this business until some other time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, one time is as bad as another,'' came with another groan from the bed. "Besides, I admit I need money badly. If it was+n't for that—''. The man in bed began to cough. "Say, shut the door,'' he went on, to the first man who had come in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was closed, and for the time being Joe heard no more of the conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It must be admitted that our hero was perplexed, and with good reason. He felt certain that the man in bed was shamming, that he was hardly sick at all. If so, what was his game?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Something is surely wrong somewhere, he reasoned. "I wish I could get to the bottom of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room next to the one occupied by David Ball was empty and he slipped into this. The room contained a closet, and on the other side was another closet, opening into the room the men were in. The partition between was of boards, and as the other door stood wide open, Joe, by placing his head to the boards, could hear fairly well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have the stock?'' he heard Maurice Vane ask.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, in my valise. Hand me the bag and I+'ll show you,'' answered the man in bed. "Oh, how weak I feel!'' he sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a silence and then the rustling of papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what is your bottom price for these?'' went on Maurice Vane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty thousand dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told Mr. Vane you might possibly take twenty-five thousand,'' came from the man called Anderson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They ought to be worth face value—fifty thousand dollars,'' said the man in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A talk in a lower tone followed, and then more rustling of papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will call to-morrow with the cash,'' said Maurice Vane, as he prepared to leave. "In the meantime, you promise to keep these shares for me?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll keep them until noon. I+'ve got another offer,'' said the man in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'ll be back,'' put in the man called Anderson. "So don't you sell to anybody else.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the two visitors left and went downstairs. Five minutes later they were driving away in the direction of the railroad station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This certainly beats anything I ever met before,'' said Joe, to himself as he watched them go. "I+'ll wager all I am worth that I+'ve met that Anderson before, and that he is a bad man. I do wish I could get at the bottom of what is going on.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the evening he had occasion to go upstairs in the hotel once more. To his surprise he saw Mr. David Ball sitting in a rocking-chair, calmly smoking a cigar and reading a paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is+n't as sick as he was this morning,'' he mused. "In fact, I don't think he is sick at all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He wished to be on hand the following morning, when the strangers came back, but an errand took him up the lake. He had to stop at several places, and did not start on the return until four in the afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his way back Joe went ashore close to where the old lodge was located, and something, he could not tell what, made him run over and take a look at the spot that had proved a shelter for Ned and himself during the heavy storm. How many things had occurred since that fatal day!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As our hero looked into one of the rooms he remembered the strange men he had seen there —the fellows who had talked about mining stocks. Then, of a sudden, a revelation came to him, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got it! I+'ve got it!'' he cried. "Mr. David Ball is that fellow who called himself Malone, and Anderson is the man named Caven! They are both imposters!''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI. A FRUITLESS CHASE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE more Joe thought over the matter the more he became convinced that he was right. He remembered a good deal of the talk he had overheard during the storm, although such talk had, for the time being, been driven from his mind by the tragic death of old Hiram Bodley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If they are working some game what can this Maurice Vane have to do with it?'' he asked himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He thought it best to get back to the hotel at once, and tell Mr. Mallison of his suspicions. But, as luck would have it, scarcely had he started to row his boat again when an oarlock broke, and so it took him the best part of an hour to make the trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is Mr. Mallison?'' he asked of the clerk of the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Out in the stable, I believe,'' was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without waiting, our hero ran down to the stable and found the hotel proprietor inspecting some hay that had just been unloaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like to speak to you a moment, Mr. Mallison,'' he said. "It+'s important,'' and he motioned for the man to follow him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s about those men who called to see that sick man, and about the sick man, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has gone—all of them have gone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What!'' ejaculated our hero. "The sick man, too?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly. But he did+n't go with the others. While they were here he was in bed, but right after they left he arose, dressed himself, and drove away.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did he go to?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know what became of the other two men?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not. But what+'s up?'' Is there anything wrong?'' questioned the hotel proprietor, with a look of concern on his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid there is,'' answered Joe, and told his tale from beginning to end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s an odd sort of a yarn, Joe. It+'s queer you did+n+'t recognize the men before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is queer, sir, but I can't help that. It flashed over me just as I looked into the window of the old lodge.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have+n+'t made any mistake?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!'' Andrew Mallison mused for a moment. "I don't really see what I can do in the matter. We can't prove that those men are wrongdoers, can we?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not unless they tried some game on this Mr. Maurice Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They may have sold him some worthless mining shares. That sort of a trick is rather old.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think we ought to make a search for this David Ball, or Malone, or whatever his name is.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m willing to do that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After questioning half a dozen people they learned that the pretended sick man had driven off in the direction of a village called Hopedale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What made him go there, do you think?'' questioned Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, excepting that he thought of getting a train on the other line.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A horse and buggy were procured, and in this Mr. Mallison and our hero drove over to Hopedale. They were still on the outskirts of the village when they heard a locomotive whistle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There+'s the afternoon train now!'' cried Joe. "Perhaps it+'s the one he wants to catch.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horse was touched up and the buggy drove up to the railroad platform at breakneck speed. But the train was gone and all they could see of it was the last car as it swung around one of the mountain bends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Too late, Mr. Mallison!'' sang out the station master. "If I had known ye was comin' I might have held her up a bit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did+n+'t want the train, Jackson. Who got on board?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two ladies, a man and a boy—Dick Fadder.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you know the man?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did he have with him?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dress suit case.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was he dressed in a dark blue suit and wear a slouch hat?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and had a light overcoat with him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was our man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anything wrong with him?'' asked the station master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps,'' answered the hotel proprietor. "Anyway, we wanted to see him. Did he buy a ticket?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, to Snagtown.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can he want in Snagtown?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that might have been a blind, Joe. He could easily go through to Philadelphia or some other place, if he wanted to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first they thought of telegraphing ahead to stop the man, but soon gave that plan up. They had no evidence, and did not wish to make trouble unless they knew exactly what they were doing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope it turns out all right,'' observed Andrew Mallison, when they were driving back to Riverside. "If there was a swindle it would give my hotel a black eye.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s one reason why I wanted that man held,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day and that following passed quietly, and our hero began to think that he had made a mistake and misjudged the men. He was kept very busy and so almost forgot the incident.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the new boarders was a fussy old man named Chaster, who was speedily nicknamed by the bell boys Chestnuts. He was a particular individual, and made everybody as uncomfortable as he possibly could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day Wilberforce Chaster—to use his full name,—asked Joe to take him out on the lake for a day's fishing. Our hero readily complied, and was in hot water from the time they went out until they returned. Nothing suited the old man, and as he caught hardly any fish he was exceedingly put out when he came back to the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your boatman is of no account,'' he said to Andrew Mallison. "I have spent a miserable day,'' and he stamped off to his room in high anger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was not my fault, Mr. Mallison,'' said Joe, with burning cheeks. "I did my level best by him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That man has been making trouble for us ever since he come,'' answered the hotel proprietor. "I am going to ask him to go elsewhere when his week is up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The insults that Joe had received that day from Wilberforce Chaster rankled in his mind, and he determined to square accounts with the boarder if he possibly could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Towards evening he met a bell boy named Harry Ross who had also had trouble with Chaster, and the two talked the matter over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We ought to get square,'' said Harry Ross. "I wish I could souse him with a pitcher of ice water.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got a plan,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stopping at the hotel was a traveling doctor, who came to Riverside twice a year, for a stay of two weeks each time. He sold some patent medicines, and had in his room several skulls and also a skeleton strung on wires.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That doctor is away,'' said our hero. "I wonder if we can't smuggle the skulls and the skeleton into Mr. Chaster+'s room?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just the cheese!'' cried the bell boy, enthusiastically. "And let us rub the bones with some of those matches that glow in the dark!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The plan was talked over, and watching their chance the two transferred the skeleton and the skulls to the apartment occupied by Wilberforce Chaster. Then they rubbed phosphorus on the bones, and hung them upon long strings, running over a doorway into the next room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That evening Wilberforce Chaster remained in the hotel parlor until ten o 'clock. Then he marched off to his room in his usual ill humor. The gas was lit and he went to bed without delay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as the light went out and they heard the man retire, Joe and the bell boy began to groan in an ominous manner. As they did so, they worked the strings to which the skulls and the skeleton were attached, causing them to dance up and down in the center of the old man's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hearing the groans, Wilberforce Chaster sat up in bed and listened. Then he peered around in the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha! what is that?'' he gasped, as he caught sight of the skulls. "Am I dreaming—or is that—Oh!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He started and began to shake from head to foot, for directly in front of him was the skele- ton, moving up and down in a jerky fashion and glowing with a dull fire. His hair seemed to stand on end. He dove under the coverings of the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The room is haunted!'' he moaned. "Was ever such a thing seen before! This is wretched! Whatever shall I do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The groans continued, and presently he gave another look from under the bed clothes. The skeleton appeared to be coming nearer. He gave a loud yell of anguish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go away! Go away! Oh, I am haunted by a ghost! This is awful! I cannot stand it!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He fairly tumbled out of bed and caught up his clothing in a heap. Then, wrapped in some comfortables, he burst out of the room and ran down the hallway like a person possessed of the evil spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come be quick, or we+'ll get caught!'' whispered Joe, and ran into the room, followed by the bell boy. In a trice they pulled loose the strings that held the skulls and the skeleton, and restored the things to the doctor's room from which they had been taken. Then they went below by a back stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The whole hotel was in an alarm, and soon Mr. Mallison came upon the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the meaning of this?'' he demanded, severely, of Wilberforce Chaster.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The meaning is, sir, that your hotel is haunted,'' was the answer, which startled all who heard it. "YOUR HOTEL IS HAUNTED,'' WAS THE ANSWER.— Page 100 Illustration by Nuttall. A hotel corridor at night. Wilberforce Chaster, wrapped in a blanket, wearing slippers, points off right as he tells the hotel manager that his room is haunted. A maid and a bellman look on.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII. THE PARTICULARS OF A SWINDLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"THIS hotel haunted?'' gasped the proprietor. "Sir, you are mistaken. Such a thing is impossible.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is true,'' insisted Mr. Wilberforce Chaster. "I shall not stay here another night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think it is haunted?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is a ghost in my room.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!'' shrieked a maid who had come on the scene. "A ghost! I shall not stay either!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What kind of a ghost?'' demanded Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A—er—a skeleton—and some skulls! I saw them with my own eyes,'' went on the victim. "Come and see them for yourself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is nonsense,'' said the hotel proprietor. "I will go and convince you that you are mistaken.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led the way and half a dozen followed, including Wilberforce Chaster, who kept well to the rear. Just as the party reached the door of the apartment Joe and the bell boy came up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without hesitation Andrew Mallison threw open the door of the room and looked inside. Of course he saw nothing out of the ordinary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is your ghost?'' he demanded. "I see nothing of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't—don't you see—er—a skeleton?'' demanded the man who had been victimized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trembling in every limb Wilberforce Chaster came forward and peered into the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?'' demanded the hotel proprietor, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I certainly saw them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then where are they now?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I don't know.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time others were crowding into the apartment. All gazed around, and into the clothes closet, but found nothing unusual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must be the victim of some hallucination, sir,'' said the hotel proprietor, severely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hated to have anything occur which might give his establishment a bad reputation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, I saw the things with my own eyes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The matter was talked over for several minutes longer and then the hired help was ordered away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall not stay in this room,'' insisted Wilberforce Chaster.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You need not remain in the hotel,'' answered Andrew Mallison, quickly. "You can leave at once. You have alarmed the whole establishment needlessly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some warm words followed, and the upshot of the matter was that the fussy old boarder had to pack his things and seek another hotel that very night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to get rid of him,'' said the hotel proprietor, after Wilberforce Chaster had departed. "He was making trouble all the time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We fixed him, did+n't we?'' said the bell boy to Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope it teaches him a lesson to be more considerate in the future,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several days passed and Joe had quite a few parties to take out on the lake. The season was now drawing to a close, and our hero began to wonder what he had best do when boating was over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if I could+n't strike something pretty good in Philadelphia?'' he asked himself. The idea of going to one of the big cities appealed to him strongly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One afternoon, on coming in from a trip across the lake, Joe found Andrew Mallison in conversation with Mr. Maurice Vane, who had arrived at the hotel scarcely an hour before. The city man was evidently both excited and disappointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is the boy now,'' said the hotel proprietor, and called Joe up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, young man, I guess you have hit the truth,'' were Maurice Vane's first words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About those other fellows?'' asked our hero, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did they swindle you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They did.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By selling you some worthless mining stocks?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. If you will, I+'d like you to tell me all you can about those two men.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will,'' answered Joe, and told of the strange meeting at the old lodge and of what had followed. Maurice Vane drew a long breath and shook his head sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was certainly a green one, to be taken in so slyly,'' said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did they happen to hear of you?'' questioned Joe, curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I answered an advertisement in the daily paper,'' said Maurice Vane. "Then this man, Caven, or whatever his right name may be, came to me and said he had a certain plan for making a good deal of money. All I had to do was to invest a certain amount and inside of a few days I could clear fifteen or twenty thousand dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was surely a nice proposition,'' said Joe, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agreed to go into the scheme if it was all plain sailing and then this Caven gave me some of the details. He said there was a demand for a certain kind of mining shares. He knew an old miner who was sick and who was willing to sell the shares he possessed for a reasonable sum of money. The plan was to buy the shares and then sell them to another party —a broker—at a big advance in price.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was simple enough,'' put in Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Caven took me to see a man who called himself a broker. He had an elegant office and looked prosperous. He told us he would be glad to buy certain mining shares at a certain figure if he could get them in the near future. He said a client was red-hot after the shares. I questioned him closely and he appeared to be a truthful man. He said some folks wanted to buy out the mine and consolidate it with another mine close by.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And then you came here and bought the stock of Malone?'' queried Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Caven made me promise to give him half the profits and I agreed. I came here, and as you know, Malone, or Ball, or whatever his name is, pretended to be very sick and in need of money. He set his price, and I came back with the cash and took the mining stock. I was to meet Caven, alias Anderson, the next day and go to the broker with him, but Caven did not appear. Then I grew suspicious and went to see the broker alone. The man was gone and the office locked up. After that I asked some other brokers about the stock, and they told me it was not worth five cents on the dollar.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is+n't there any such mine at all?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, there is such a mine, but it was abandoned two years ago, after ten thousand dollars had been sunk in it. They said it paid so little that it was not worth considering.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is certainly too bad for you,'' said Joe. "And you can't find any trace of Caven or Malone?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, both of the rascals have disappeared completely. I tried to trace Caven and his broker friend in Philadelphia but it was of no use. More than likely they have gone to some place thousands of miles away.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and probably this Ball, or Malone, has joined them,'' put in Andrew Mallison. "Mr. Vane, I am exceedingly sorry for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry for myself, but I deserve my loss, for being such a fool,'' went on the victim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you notified the police?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, and I have hired a private detective to do what he can, too. But I am afraid my money is gone for good.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You might go and reopen the mine, Mr. Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, but I have lost enough already, without throwing good money after bad, as the saying is.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It may be that that detective will find the swindlers, sooner or later.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Such a thing is, of course, possible, but I am not over sanguine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid your money is gone for good,'' broke in Andrew Mallison. "I wish I could help you, but I don't see how I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The matter was talked over for a good hour, and all three visited the room Malone had occupied, which had been vacant ever since. But a hunt around revealed nothing of value, and they returned to the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can do nothing more for you, Mr. Vane,'' said Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could do something,'' said Joe. Something about Maurice Vane was very attractive to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you ever hear of these rascals let me know,'' continued the hotel proprietor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will do so,'' was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With that the conversation on the subject closed. Maurice Vane remained at the hotel overnight and left by the early train on the following morning.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. OFF FOR THE CITY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"JOE, our season ends next Saturday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, Mr. Mallison.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are going to close the house on Tuesday. It won't pay to keep open after our summer boarders leave.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any idea what you intend to do?'' went on the hotel proprietor. He was standing down by the dock watching Joe clean out one of the boats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m thinking of going to Philadelphia.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On a visit?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, to try my luck.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I see. It+'s a big city, my lad.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, but, somehow, I feel I might do better there than in such a town as this,—and I am getting tired of hanging around the lake.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is more money in Philadelphia than there is here, that is certain, Joe. But you can't always get hold of it. The big cities are crowded with people trying to obtain situations.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m sure I can find something to do, Mr. Mallison. And, by the way, when I leave, will you give me a written recommendation?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly. You have done well since you came here. But you had better think twice before going to Philadelphia.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve thought it over more than twice. I don't expect the earth, but I feel that I can get something to do before my money runs out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much money have you saved up?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got fifty-six dollars, and I+'m going to sell my boat for four dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sixty dollars is+n't such a bad capital. I have known men to start out with a good deal less. When I left home I had but twenty dollars and an extra suit of clothes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you come from a country place?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I came from New York. Times were hard and I could+n't get a single thing to do. I went to Paterson, New Jersey, and got work in a silk mill. From there I went to Camden, and then to Philadelphia. From Philadelphia I came here and have been here ever since.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have been prosperous.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fairly so, although I don't make as much money as some of the hotel men in the big cities. But then they take larger risks. A few years ago a hotel friend of mine opened a big hotel in Atlantic City. He hoped to make a small fortune, but he was not located in the right part of the town and at the end of the season he found himself just fifteen thousand dollars out of pocket. Now he has sold out and is running a country hotel fifty miles west of here. He does+n't hope to make so much, but his business is much safer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m afraid it will be a long time before I get money enough to run a hotel,'' laughed our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you like to run one?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. I+'d like to educate myself first.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you study some now? I have seen you with some arithmetics and histories.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, I study a little every day. You see, I never had much schooling, and I don't want to grow up ignorant, if I can help it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is the proper spirit, lad,'' answered Andrew Mallison, warmly. "Learn all you possibly can. It will always be the means of doing you good.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conversation took place on Thursday and two days later the season at the summer hotel came to an end and the last of the boarders took their departure. Monday was spent in putting things in order, and by Tuesday afternoon work around the place came to an end, and all the help was paid off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the meantime Joe had sold his boat. With all of his money in his pocket he called at the Talmadge house to see if Ned had returned from the trip to the west.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just got back yesterday,'' said Ned, who came to greet him. "Had a glorious trip. I wish you had been along. I like traveling better than staying at home all the time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to do a bit of traveling myself, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To Philadelphia—to try my luck in that city.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to leave Mr. Mallison?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,—the season is at an end.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I see. So you are going to the Quaker City, as pa calls it. I wish you luck. You+'ll have to write to me, Joe, and let me know how you are getting along.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will,—and you must write to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the following day Joe rowed along the lake to where his old home dock had been located and made a trip to what was left of the cabin. He spent another hour in hunting for the blue box, but without success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I+'ll never find that box,'' he sighed. "I may as well give up thinking about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Andrew Mallison our hero had obtained his letter of recommendation and also a good pocket map of Philadelphia. The hotel man had also made him a present of a neat suit case, in which he packed his few belongings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned Talmadge came to see him off at the depot. The day was cool and clear, and Joe felt in excellent spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the train came along and our hero got aboard, along with a dozen or fifteen others. He waved a hand to Ned and his friend shouted out a good-bye. Then the train moved on, and the town was soon left in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car that Joe had entered was not more than quarter filled and he easily found a seat for himself by a window. He placed his suit case at his feet and then gave himself up to looking at the scenery as it rushed past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had never spent much of his time on the railroad, so the long ride had much of novelty in it. The scenery was grand, as they wound in and out among the hills and mountains, or crossed brooks and rivers and well-kept farms. Numerous stops were made, and long before Philadelphia was gained the train became crowded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nice day for riding,'' said a man who sat down beside our hero. He looked to be what he was, a prosperous farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Goin' to Philadelphy, I reckon,'' went on the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s where I+'m going, too. Got a little business to attend to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going there to try my luck,'' said Joe, he felt he could talk to the old man with confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Goin' to look fer a job, eh?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wot kin ye do, if I might ask?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I+'m willing to do most anything. I+'ve been taking care of rowboats and working around a summer hotel, at Lake Tandy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ye won't git many boats to look at down to Philadelphy!'' and the old farmer chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose not. Maybe I+'ll strike a job at one of the hotels.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps. They tell me some hotels down there is monsterous—ten an' twelve stories high. Ye don't catch me goin' to no sech place. In case o' fire, it+'s all up with ye, if you+'re on the twelfth story.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to Philadelphia to stay, Mr. —''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bean is my name—Josiah Bean. I+'m from Haydown Center, I am. Got a farm there o' a hundred acres.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, is that so!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wot+'s your handle, young man?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Joe Bodley. I came from Riverside.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Proud to know you.'' And Josiah Bean shook hands. "No, I ain't going to stay in Philadelphy. I+'m a going on business fer my wife. A relative left her some property an' I+'m a-goin' to collect on it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s a pleasant trip to be on,'' was our hero's comment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll feel better when I have the six hundred dollars in my fist. I+'m afraid it ain't goin' to be no easy matter to git it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the trouble!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't known in Philadelphy an' they tell me a feller has got to be identified or somethin' like thet—somebody has got to speak for ye wot knows ye.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see. Perhaps you+'ll meet some friend.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thet+'s wot I+'m hopin' fer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The train rolled on and presently Joe got out his map and began to study it, so that he might know something of the great city when he arrived there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Guess I+'ll git a drink o' water,'' said Josiah Bean, and walked to the end of the car to do so. Immediately a slick looking man who had been seated behind the farmer arose and followed him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV. A SCENE ON THE TRAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE slick-looking individual had listened attentively to all that passed between our hero and the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waited until the latter had procured his drink of water and then rushed up with a smile on his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I declare!'' he exclaimed. "How do you do?'' And he extended his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do?'' repeated the farmer, shaking hands slowly. He felt much perplexed, for he could not remember having met the other man before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are matters up on the farm,'' went on the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, very good.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—er—I don't think you remember me, Mr. Bean,'' went on the slick-looking individual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, somehow I think I know your face,'' answered the old farmer, lamely. He did not wish to appear wanting in politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to remember me. I spent some time in Haydown Center year before last, selling machines.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you had them patent reapers, is that it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ve struck it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I remember you now. You+'re a nephew of Judge Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O' course! O' course! But I can't remember your name nohow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s Davis, too—Henry Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. I+'m glad to meet you, Mr. Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw you in the seat with that boy,'' went on the man we shall call Henry Davis. "I thought I knew you from the start, but I was+n't dead sure. Going to Philadelphia with us?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good enough. Mr. Bean, won't you smoke with me? I was just going into the smoker.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks, but I—er—I don't smoke much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just one mild cigar. That won't hurt you, I+'m sure. I love to meet old friends,'' continued Henry Davis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the end the old farmer was pursuaded to walk into the smoking car and here the slick-looking individual found a corner seat where they would be undisturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I expect to spend a week or more in Philadelphia, Mr. Bean,'' said the stranger; "if I can be of service to you during that time, command me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, perhaps ye can be of service to me. Do ye know many folks in the city?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, a great many. Some are business friends and some are folks in high society.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care for no high society. But I+'ve got to collect six hundred dollars an' I want somebody to identify me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I can do that easily, Mr. Bean.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Kin ye?'' The farmer grew interested at once. "If ye kin I+'ll be much obliged to ye.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where must you be identified?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down to the office of Barwell &amp; Cameron, on Broad street. Do ye know 'em?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know of them, and I can find somebody who does know them, so there will not be the least trouble.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s a load off my mind,'' said Josiah Bean, with a sigh. "Ye see, the money is comin' to my wife. She writ to 'em that I was comin' to collect an' they writ back it would be all right, only I would have to be identified. Jest as if everybody in Haydown Center don't know I+'m Josiah Bean an' a piller in the Union Church down there, an' a cousin to Jedge Bean o' Lassindale.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, they have to be mighty particular when they pay out any money in the city. There are so many sharpers around.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't no sharper.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure you are not, and neither am I. But I once had trouble getting money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is thet so?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. But after I proved who I was the folks were pretty well ashamed of themselves,'' went on Henry Davis, smoothly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So the talk ran on and at the end of half an hour the old farmer and the slick-looking individual were on exceedingly friendly terms. Henry Davis asked much about the old man and gathered in a good stock of information.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Philadelphia was gained it was dark, and coming out of the big railroad station Joe at first knew not which way to turn. The noise and the crowd of people confused him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have a cab? Carriage?'' bawled the hackmen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Paper!'' yelled a newsboy. "All the evenin' papers!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Smash yer baggage!'' called out a luggage boy, not near as tall as our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking ahead, Joe saw Josiah Bean and the slick-looking individual moving down the street and without realizing it, our hero began to follow the pair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He must be some friend,'' said our hero to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He wondered where they were going and his curiosity getting the better of him he continued to follow them for half a dozen blocks. At last they came to a halt in front of a building displaying the sign: JOHNSON'S QUAKER HOTEL MODERATE TERMS FOR ALL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This hotel is all right and the prices are right, too,'' Joe heard the slick-looking man tell the old farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then thet suits me,'' answered Josiah Bean. "I+'ll go in an' git a room fer the night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I might as well do the same,'' said Henry Davis. "I don't care to go away over to my boarding house at Fairmount Park.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pair walked into the hotel, and Joe saw them register and pass down the corridor in the company of a bell boy. Then our hero entered the place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I get a room here for the night?'' he asked of the clerk behind the desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the charge?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seventy-five cents.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That suits me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The register was shoved forward and Joe wrote down his name. Then he was shown to a small room on the third floor. The building was but four stories high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was tired and soon went to bed. In the next room he heard a murmur of voices and made out that the old farmer and his friend were talking earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They must be very friendly,'' was his comment, and thinking the matter over he fell asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bright and early in the morning our hero arose, dressed himself, and went below. He had breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel and was just finishing up when the old farmer and the slick-looking individual came in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo!'' cried Josiah Bean. "What are you doin' here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got a room overnight,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'re stopping here, too. This is my friend, Mr. Henry Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good morning,'' said the slick-looking man. He did not seem to fancy meeting Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They sat down close at hand and, while eating, the farmer asked Joe half a dozen questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He spoke about his own business until Henry Davis nudged him in the side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would+n't tell that boy too much,'' he said in a low tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, he+'s all right,'' answered the old farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe heard the slick-looking individual's words and they made his face burn. He looked at the man narrowly and made up his mind he was not a fellow to be desired for an acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having finished, our hero paid his bill and left the restaurant. He scarcely knew which way to turn, but resolved to look over the newspapers first and see if any positions were offered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While in the reading room he saw Josiah Bean and his acquaintance leave the hotel and walk in the direction of Broad street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later Joe took from the paper he was reading the addresses of several people who wanted help, and then he, too, left the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first place he called at was a florist's establishment, but the pay was so small he declined the position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I could not live on three dollars per week,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is all we care to pay,'' answered the proprietor, coldly. "It is more than other establishments pay.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I pity those who work at the other places,'' returned Joe, and walked out.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV. WHAT HAPPENED TO JOSIAH BEAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN the meantime Josiah Bean and the slick-looking individual turned into Broad street and made their way to a certain establishment known as the Eagle's Club.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Henry Davis called another man aside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, Foxy, do you know anybody down to Barwell &amp; Cameron's?'' he asked, in a low tone, so that the old farmer could not hear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—a clerk named Chase.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then come down and introduce me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the game?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind—there+'s a tenner in it for you if it works.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'m on, Bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush—my name is Henry Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Hank,'' returned Foxy, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He came forward and was introduced to the old farmer in the following fashion:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Richard Barlow—of Barlow &amp; Small, manufacturers.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All three made their way to the establishment of Barwell &amp; Cameron, and then Henry Davis was introduced under that name to a clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as Foxy had departed the slick-looking individual turned to the clerk and called the old farmer forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is my esteemed friend, Mr. Josiah Bean, of Haydown Center. He has business with Mr. Cameron, I believe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m here to collect six hundred dollars,'' said Josiah Bean. "Mr. Cameron writ me some letters about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, sir. Sit down, gentlemen, and I+'ll tell Mr. Cameron.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two were kept waiting for a few minutes and were then ushered into a private office. Through Chase, the clerk, Henry Davis was introduced and then Josiah Bean. All the papers proved to be correct, and after the old farmer had signed his name he was given a check.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, I want the cash,'' he demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well,'' said Mr. Cameron. "Indorse the check and I+'ll have the money drawn for you across the street.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The farmer wrote down his name once more, and a few minutes later received his six hundred dollars in twelve brand-new fifty-dollar bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gosh! Them will be nice fer Mirandy to look at,'' was his comment, as he surveyed the bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be careful that you don't lose them, Mr. Bean,'' cautioned Henry Davis, as the two left the establishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Reckon the best thing I can do is to git back to hum this afternoon,'' remarked Josiah Bean, when he was on the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, now you are in town you+'ll have to look around a bit,'' said the slick-looking individual. "You can take a train back to-morrow just as well. Let me show you a few of the sights.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This tickled the old farmer and he agreed to remain over until the next noon. Then Henry Davis dragged the old man around to various points of interest and grew more familiar than ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While they were at the top of one of the big office buildings Henry Davis pretended to drop his pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How careless of me!'' he cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got much in it?'' queried Josiah Bean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three thousand dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do tell! It+'s a powerful sight o' money to carry so careless like.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is. Maybe you had better carry it for me, Mr. Bean.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not me! I ain't goin' to be responsible fer nobody's money but my own—an' Mirandy's.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better see if your own money is safe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Josiah Bean got out his wallet and counted the bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Safe enough.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure? I thought there was only five hundred and fifty.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, six hundred.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll bet you ten dollars on it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! can't I count straight,'' gasped the old farmer, much disturbed. "Six hundred I tell you,'' he added, after he had gone over the amount once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If there is I+'ll give you the ten dollars,'' answered the slick one. "Let me count the bills.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, there ye be, Mr. Davis.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry Davis took the wallet and pretended to count the bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo, what+'s that?'' he cried, whirling around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s wot?'' demanded Josiah Bean, also looking around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought I heard somebody cry fire.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't say thet! Say, let+'s git out o' here—I don't want to look at the sights.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right—here+'s your money. I guess it+'s six hundred after all,'' answered the slick-looking individual, passing over the wallet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They hurried to the elevator and got into quite a crowd of people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait for me here,'' said Henry Davis, as they walked past the side corridor. "I want to step in yonder office and send a message to a friend.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ran off, leaving the old farmer by himself. Josiah Bean looked around him nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess that was+n't no cry o' fire after all,'' he mused. "Well, if there+'s a fire I kin git out from here quick enough.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The office building was a large one, running from one street to the next. On the street in the rear was a bookstore, the proprietor of which had advertised for a clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had applied for the position and was waiting for the proprietor to address him when, on chancing to look up, he saw Henry Davis rush past as if in a tremendous hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo, that+'s the fellow who was with the old farmer,'' he told himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can I do for you, young man?'' asked the proprietor of the bookshop, approaching at that instant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe you wish a clerk,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you had experience in this line?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you won't do. I must have someone who is experienced.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am willing to learn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It won't do. I want an experienced clerk or none at all,'' was the sharp answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving the bookstore, Joe stood out on the sidewalk for a moment and then walked around the corner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A moment later he caught sight of Josiah Bean, gazing up and down the thoroughfare and acting like one demented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the matter?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Matter?'' bawled the old farmer. I+'ve been took in! Robbed! Swindled! Oh, wot will Mirandy say!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who robbed you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thet Mr. Davis I reckon! He counted the money last, an' now it+'s gone!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw Mr. Davis a minute ago.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Around the corner, walking as fast as he could.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'s got my money! Oh, I must catch him!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll help you,'' answered Joe, with vigor. "I thought he looked like a slick one,'' he added.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led the way and Josiah Bean came behind. The old farmer looked as if he was ready to drop with fright. The thought of losing his wife's money was truly horrifying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mirandy won't never forgive me!'' he groaned. "Oh, say, boy, we've got to catch that rascal!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If we can,'' added our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had noted the direction taken by the swindler, and now ran across the street and into a side thoroughfare leading to where a new building was being put up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, from a workman, he learned that the sharper had boarded a street car going south. He hailed the next car and both he and the old farmer got aboard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This ain't much use,'' said Josiah Bean, with quivering lips. "We dunno how far he took himself to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let us trust to luck to meet him,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They rode for a distance of a dozen blocks and then the car came to a halt, for there was a blockade ahead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We may as well get off,'' said our hero. "He may be in one of the forward cars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They alighted and walked on, past half a dozen cars. Then our hero gave a cry of triumph .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There he is!'' he said, and pointed to the swindler, who stood on a car platform, gazing anxiously ahead.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI. A MATTER OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"SAY, YOU, give me my money!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such were Josiah Bean's words, as he rushed up to Henry Davis and grabbed the swindler by the shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The slick-looking individual was thoroughly startled, for he had not dreamed that the countryman would get on his track so soon. He turned and looked at the man and also at Joe, and his face fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wha—what are you talking about?'' he stammered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know well enough what I am talking about,'' answered Josiah Bean, wrathfully. "I want my money, every cent o' it,—an' you are a-goin' to jail!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir, you are making a sad mistake,'' said the swindler, slowly. "I know nothing of you or your money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make him get off the car,'' put in Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boy, what have you to do with this?'' asked the swindler, turning bitterly to our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much perhaps,'' answered Joe. "But I+'d like to see justice done.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want that money,'' went on the countryman, doggedly. "Come off the car.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He caught the swindler tighter than ever and made him walk to the sidewalk. By this time a crowd of people began to collect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the trouble here?'' asked one gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'s robbed me, that+'s what+'s the matter,'' answered the countryman. "He has got six hundred dollars o' mine!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Six hundred dollars!'' cried several and began to take a deeper interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentleman this man must be crazy. I never saw him before,'' came loudly from the swindler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is not true!'' cried Joe. "He was with the man who lost the money. I saw them together yesterday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am a respectable merchant from Pittsburg.'' went on the swindler. "It is outrageous to be accused in this fashion.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Somebody had better call a policeman,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll do dat,'' answered a newsboy, and ran off to execute the errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the crowd began to collect the swindler saw that he was going to have difficulty in clearing himself or getting away. He looked around, and seeing an opening made a dash for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He might have gotten away had it not been for Joe. But our hero was watching him with the eyes of a hawk, and quick as a flash he caught the rascal by the coat sleeve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, you don't!'' he exclaimed. "Come back here!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let go!'' cried the man and hit Joe in the ear. But the blow did not stop Joe from detaining him and in a second more Josiah Bean caught hold also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't goin' to git away nohow!'' exclaimed the countryman, and took hold of the swindler's throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Le—let go!'' came back in a gasp. "Don't—don't strangle me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When a policeman arrived the swindler was thoroughly cowed and he turned reproachfully to Josiah Bean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is+n't fair,'' he said. It was all a joke. I have+n't got your money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you have.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is right, Mr. Bean,'' put in Joe. "The money, I think, is in your side pocket.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The countryman searched the pocket quickly and brought out a flat pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo! this ain't mine!'' he ejaculated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the pocketbook and inside were the twelve fifty-dollar bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My money sure enough! How in the world did it git there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This man just slipped the pocketbook into your pocket,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did not!'' put in the swindler, hotly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dat+'s right!'' piped up the newsboy who had brought the policeman. "I see him do de trick jest a minit ago!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is a plot against me!'' fumed the swindler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dat feller is a bad egg!'' went on the news-boy. "His name is Bill Butts. He+'s a slick one, he is. Hits de country jays strong, he does!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the mention of the name, Bill Butts, the policeman became more interested than ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ll come to the station house with me,'' he said, sternly. "We can straighten out the matter there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right,'' answered Bill Butts, for such was his real name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few minutes more the party, including Joe, was off in the direction of the police station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better keep a good eye on your money, Mr. Bean,'' said our hero, as they walked along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got it tucked away safe in an inside pocket,'' answered the old countryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The station house was several squares away, and while walking beside the policeman the eyes of Bill Butts were wide open, looking for some means of escape. He had "done time'' twice and he did not wish to be sent up again if it could possibly be avoided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His opportunity came in an unexpected manner. In a show window on a corner a man was exhibiting some new athletic appliances and a crowd had collected to witness the exhibition. The policeman had to force his way through.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi, quit shovin' me!'' growled a burly fellow in the crowd, not knowing he was addressing a guardian of the law.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make way here!'' ordered the policeman, sternly, and then the fellow fell back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It gave Bill Butts the chance he wanted and as quick as a flash he dove into the crowd and out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is running away!'' cried Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Catch him!'' put in Josiah Bean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both went after the swindler and so did the policeman. But the crowd was too dense for them, and inside of five minutes Bill Butts had made good his escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did ye want to let him slip ye fer?'' growled the old countryman, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't talk to me,'' growled the policeman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He ought to be reported for this,'' put in our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say another word and I+'ll run you both in,'' said the bluecoat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come away,'' whispered Josiah Bean. "Anyway, it ain't so bad. I+'ve got my money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m willing to go,'' answered Joe. "But, just the same, that policeman is a pudding head,'' he added, loudly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll pudding head you!'' cried the bluecoat, but made no attempt to molest Joe, whose general style he did not fancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Side by side Josiah Bean and our hero walked away, until the crowd was left behind and they were practically alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m goin' to count thet money again,'' said the old countryman, and did so, to make certain that it was all there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We were lucky to spot the rascal, Mr. Bean.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did+n't spot him—it was you. I+'m much obliged to ye.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that+'s all right.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seems to me you are entitled to a reward, Joe,'' went on the old farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want any reward.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you+'re a-goin' to take it. How would five dollars strike you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all, sir. I don't want a cent.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, maybe, ye won't even come an' take dinner with me,'' continued the old man, in disappointed tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I+'ll do that, for this chase has made me tremendously hungry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If ye ever come down my way, Joe, ye must stop an' call on me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, Mr. Bean.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nuthin' on my farm will be too good for ye, Joe. I+'m goin' to tell my wife Mirandy o' this happenin' an' she+'ll thank you jest as I+'ve done.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A good restaurant was found not far away and there the two procured a fine meal and took their time eating it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have ye found work yet?'' asked the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not yet. I was looking for a job when I met you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I hope ye strike wot ye want, lad. But it+'s hard to git a place in the city, some times.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall try my level best.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wish I could git a job fer ye. But I don't know nubuddy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to try the hotels next. I have a strong letter of recommendation from a hotel man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If ye don't git no work in Philadelphy come out on my farm. I+'ll board ye all winter fer nuthin','' went on Josiah Bean, generously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mr. Bean; you are very kind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean it. We don't live very high-falutin', but we have plenty o' plain, good victuals.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll remember what you say,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An hour later he saw the countryman on a train bound for home, and then he started once more to look for a situation.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII. JOE'S NEW POSITION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALL of that afternoon Joe looked for a position among the various hotels of the Quaker City. But at each place he visited he received the same answer, that there was no help needed just then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is discouraging,'' he told himself, as he retired that night. "Perhaps I+'ll have to go to the country or back to Riverside after all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet he was up bright and early the next day and just as eager as ever to obtain a situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had heard of a new hotel called the Grandon House and visited it directly after breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he entered the corridor he heard his name called and turning around saw Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Mr. Mallison,'' said our hero, shaking hands. "I did+n't expect to meet you here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got a little special business in Philadelphia,'' said the hotel man. "I came in last night and I am going back this afternoon. How are you making out?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s all out so far,'' and Joe smiled faintly at his own joke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No situation, eh?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you strike the people here. It+'s a new place and the proprietor may need help.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I came for.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll put in a good word for you, Joe. Come on.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andrew Mallison led the way to the office and called up a stout, pleasant looking man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Drew, this is a young friend of mine, Joe Bodley. He worked for me this summer, —around the boats and also in the hotel. Now that the season is at an end he is trying to find something to do in the city. If you have an opening I can recommend him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Arthur Drew surveyed Joe critically. The new hotel was to be run in first-class style and he wanted his help to be of the best. He rather liked Joe's appearance and he took note of the fact that our hero's hands were scrupulously clean and that his shoes were blacked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got almost all the help I need, but I might take him on,'' he said, slowly. "One of my present boys does not suit me at all. He is too impudent.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Joe is never impudent and he is very reliable,'' answered Andrew Mallison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll give you a trial.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The wages will depend upon whether you board here or outside.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much will you give me if I stay at the hotel?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Four dollars a week.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what if I board outside?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nine dollars a week.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you give the boy a pretty fair room?'' asked Andrew Mallison. "I know you+'ll like him after he has been here a while.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He can have a room with another boy. That lad yonder,'' and the proprietor of the Grandon House pointed with his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe looked and saw that the other lad was gentlemanly looking and rather pleasant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will suit me to stay here, I think,'' he said. "Anyway, I am willing to try it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When can you come to work?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right away—or at least, as soon as I can get my suit case from where I have been stopping.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then come in after dinner and I+'ll tell you what to do and turn you over to my head man. Randolph, come here!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the call a bell boy came up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is another boy who is to work here,'' said Arthur Drew. He will room with you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mr. Drew, I+'ll be glad to get rid of Jack Sagger,'' said Frank Randolph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s your name?'' he went on to our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe Bodley.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mine is Frank Randolph. I guess we+'ll get along all right.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so, Frank,'' said Joe, and shook hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a little more talk and then Joe left, to get his dress suit case and a few other things which belonged to him. By one o'clock he was back to the Grandon House, and just in time to see Andrew Mallison going away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am much obliged, Mr. Mallison, for what you have done,'' said our hero, warmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re welcome, Joe,'' answered the hotel man. "I take an interest in you and I trust you do well here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall do my best.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After Andrew Mallison had gone Joe was shown around the hotel and instructed in his various duties. Occasionally he was to do bell-boy duty, but usually he was to be an all-around helper for the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think you+'ll like it here,'' said Frank Randolph. It+'s the best hotel I+'ve ever worked in. Mr. Drew is a perfect gentleman.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to hear it, Frank,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room assigned to the two boys was a small one on the top floor of the hotel. But it was clean, contained two nice cots, and Joe felt it would suit him very well. Frank had hung up a few pictures and had a shelf full of books and this made the apartment look quite home-like.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m going to buy some books myself, this winter,'' said Joe. "And when I get time I am going to do some studying.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m studying myself, Joe. I never had much schooling,'' returned Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you alone in the world?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, my father is living. But he is rather sickly and lives with an uncle of mine, over in Camden. He can't work very much, and that is why I have to support myself. Are you alone?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I think my father is living but I can't locate him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day and for several days following Joe pitched into work in earnest. Many things were strange to him, but he determined to master them as speedily as possible, and this pleased Arthur Drew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That boy is all right,'' he said to his cashier. "I am glad that Andrew Mallison brought him to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jack Sagger was awfully angry at being discharged,'' said the cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was his own fault. I cannot afford to have a boy around who is impudent.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What the cashier said about the discharged lad was true. Jack Sagger was "mad clear through,'' and he attributed his discharge solely to Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll fix dat pill,'' he said to one of his chums. "He ain't going to do me out of my job an' not suffer fer it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you going to do, Jack?'' asked the companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll mash him, dat+'s wot I+'ll do,'' answered Jack Sagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was a big, rawboned lad, several inches taller than Joe. His face was freckled, and his lips discolored by cigarette smoking. He was a thoroughly tough boy and it was a wonder that he had ever been allowed to work in the hotel at all. He had a fairly good home, but only went there to sleep and to get his meals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe, I hear that Jack Sagger is going to make it warm for you,'' said Frank, one Monday afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose he is angry because I got his position, is that it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is he going to do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know exactly, but he+'ll hurt you if he can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he attacks me I+'ll do what I can to take care of myself,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That afternoon he was sent out by Mr. Drew on an errand that took him to a neighborhood occupied largely by wholesale provision houses. As Joe left the hotel Jack Sagger saw him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dere+'s dat country jay now,'' said Sagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now's your time to git square on him, Jack,'' said Nick Sammel, his crony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right you are, Nick. Come on.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to follow him?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, till I git him where I want him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to mash him?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. When I git through wid him his own mother won't know him,'' went on Jack Sagger, boastfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe he+'ll git the cops after you, Jack.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll watch out fer dat, Nick, an' you must watch out too,'' answered Jack Sagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure you kin best him? He looks putty strong.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Huh! Can't I fight? Did+n't I best Sam Nolan, and Jerry Dibble?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s right, Jack.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just let me git one chanct at him an' he+'ll run away, you see if he don't. But he shan't git away until I give him a black eye an' knock out a couple of his front teeth fer him,'' concluded the boaster.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII. JOE SHOWS HIS MUSCLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALL unconscious that he was being followed, our hero went on his errand to a wholesale provision house that supplied the Grandon Hotel with meats and poultry. He felt in good spirits and so whistled lightly as he walked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arriving at the place of business he transacted his errand as speedily as possible and then started to return to the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was just passing the entrance to a factory yard when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and wheeling around found himself confronted by Jack Sagger, Nick Sammel, and half a dozen others, who had gathered to see their leader "polish off'' the country boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want?'' demanded Joe, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know well enough wot I want, country!'' exclaimed Jack Sagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You took my job away from me, an' I+'m goin' to pay you fer doing it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Drew had a perfect right to discharge you, Jack Sagger. He said you were impudent and he did+n't want you around any more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't preach to me, country! Do you know wot I+'m goin' ter do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m going to make you promise to leave dat job. Will yer promise?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Den you have got to fight,'' and Jack Sagger began to pull up his rather dirty coat sleeves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Supposing I don't want to fight?'' went on our hero, as calmly as he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yer got ter do it, country—or else make dat promise.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll make no promise to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Den take dat!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Jack Sagger uttered the last words he launched a blow at Joe's nose. But our hero ducked and the blow went wide of its mark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give it to him, Jack!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Show him what you can do!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep off,'' came from Joe. "If you don't, you+'ll get hurt!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hear dat now! Jack, pitch in, quick, before anybody comes!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus urged Jack Sagger struck out once more, landing on Joe's chest. Then our hero drew back and sent in a blow with all his force. It took the other boy squarely on the chin and sent him staggering against a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If ever there was a surprised boy that boy was Jack Sagger. He had expected that to "polish off'' Joe would be easy and he had not anticipated such a defense as had been made. He righted himself and gazed stupidly at our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wot did yer hit me fer?'' he gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You keep off or I+'ll hit you again,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a pause and Sagger sprang forward, trying to catch Joe around the arms. But our hero was too quick for him and ducked once more. Then he hit the bully in the ear and gave him another blow in the left eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ouch!'' roared Jack Sagger. "Don't! Oh, my eye!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you had enough?'' demanded Joe, who was commencing to warm up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pitch in, fellers!'' came from Jack Sagger. "Throw him down!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't you going to do it alone?'' queried Nick Sammel, in wonder, not unmingled with a suspicion that Joe would not be as easy to handle as anticipated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I+'ve got a—a heartburn,'' came lamely from Sagger. "It come on me all at onct. If it was+n't fer that I+'d do him up all alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re a fraud, and you have+n't any heart-burn!'' cried Joe. "You+'re afraid, that+'s all. If you want to fight, stand up, and we+'ll have it out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you call me afraid,'' said Sagger, but his voice had lost much of its bullying tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re a big coward, Jack Sagger. After this I want you to leave me alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't you fellers going to pitch in?'' demanded Sagger, turning to his cohorts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The first boy to hit me will get paid back with interest,'' said Joe, sharply. "I don't like to fight but I can do it if I have to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One or two had edged forward but when they saw his determined air they slunk back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go on and fight him, Jack,'' said one. "This is your mix-up, not ours.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You said you was going to do him up brown,'' put in another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't I got the heartburn?'' blustered the bully. "I can't do nuthin' when I git that. Wait till I+'m well; then I+'ll show him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you ever touch me again, Jack Sagger, I+'ll give you the worst thrashing you ever had,'' said Joe, loudly. "Remember, I am not the least bit afraid of you. The best thing you can do is to keep your distance.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want to quarrel with anybody, but I am always ready to stick up for my rights, just you remember that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So speaking Joe backed out of the crowd, that opened to let him pass. Several of the boys wanted to detain him, but not one had the courage to do so. As soon as he was clear of his tormentors, he hurried back to the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you make out?'' asked Mr. Drew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s all right, sir, and they+'ll send the things to-night, sure,'' answered Joe. He hesitated for a moment. "I had a little excitement on the way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How was that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jack Sagger and some other boys followed me up and wanted to polish me off.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't look as if they had done much polishing.'' And the hotel man smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Jack Sagger got the worst of it. I guess he+'ll leave me alone in the future.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must+n't fight around the hotel, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This was on the way to Jackson &amp; Bell's, sir. I was bound to defend myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be sure. Sagger came to me yesterday and wanted to be taken back, but I told him no—that I would+n't have such an impudent fellow around.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the winter season came on the hotel began to fill up and Joe was kept busy from early in the morning until late at night, and so was Frank Randolph. The two boys were firm friends, and on Sunday went to Sunday School together and also to church, when their hotel duties permitted of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the corridor of the hotel Joe, one day, met the timid Felix Gussing, the young man who had once had so much trouble in driving a horse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Mr. Gussing,'' said our hero politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why if it is+n't Joe!'' cried the young man, and smiled. "What are you doing here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I work at this hotel now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it possible! Did+n't you like it at Riverside?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but the place is shut up for the winter.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, I see.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you stopping here, sir?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I came in an hour ago. I have business in Philadelphia.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you+'re buying horses,'' said Joe, slyly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No! no! No more horses for me,'' ejaculated the dude. "I—er—this is of more importance.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No more was said just then, but later our hero met Felix Gussing again, and on the day following had an errand that took him to the young man's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe, you are quite a wise boy, perhaps I can confide in you,'' said Felix Gussing, after some talk on other subjects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll be glad to be of service to you, Mr. Gussing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a delicate problem to solve. Sometimes a young man can give better advice than an older person,'' went on the dude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't flatter me, Mr. Gussing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am in love,'' went on the young man, flatly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am quite sure the young lady loves me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I suppose you are going to get married.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is an obstacle in the way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I had better tell you the whole story—if you+'ll listen to me,'' went on the dude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly I+'ll listen,'' said Joe. "I+'ve got a little time off.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then Felix Gussing told his tale of woe, as will be found in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX. ONE KIND OF A DUEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"HER name is Clara, and she is the daughter of Major Thomas Botts Sampson, of the regular army,'' began Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then her father is a military man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly, and that is the trouble,'' and the dude gave a groan. "It is this way: When I went to see Major Sampson he greeted me very cordially, until I disclosed the object of my visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Sir,' said he `This is a matter which requires consideration. Have you gained my daughter's consent?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I have,' I answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `So far so good,' said he. `But there is one thing more. Have you served in the army?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `No,' said I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Or fought a duel?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `No.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then he told me to remember that he had served in the army and that his daughter was the daughter of an army man, one who had gone through many battles. After that he said he was resolved that his daughter should marry only somebody who had proved himself a man of courage.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do then?'' asked Joe, becoming interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What could I do? I am—er—no army man—no fighter. Evidently the major wants a fighter for a son-in-law,'' and Felix Gussing groaned once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ll have to become a fighter,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No! no! I am a er—a man of peace!'' cried the dude, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Gussing, I think I can arrange matters for you,'' said Joe, struck by a certain idea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can you mean, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean that I can prove to Major Sampson that you are a brave man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do that, Joe, and I shall be your friend for life!'' gasped the dude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you wait until to-morrow, Mr. Gussing?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, but do not keep me in suspense too long.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This may cost you a little money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care if it costs a hundred dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I am sure I can fix it up for you,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was stopping at the hotel a man named Montgomery. He had at different times been an auctioneer, a book-agent, a schoolmaster, and a traveling salesman. He was just now selling curiosities and Joe felt that he would be only too glad to do Felix Gussing a good turn if he were paid for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero had a talk with this man, and the upshot of the matter was that Montgomery and the dude were introduced on the following morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I can help you, Mr. Gussing,'' said the curiosity man, who, it may be mentioned here, was a tall and important-looking personage. "I was once in the army.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can you do?'' questioned the dude, hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will it be worth fifty dollars to you if I aid you in winning the consent of Major Sampson to wed his daughter?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Decidedly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is also Joe's plan, so you will have to pay him, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want any money,'' put in our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe shall have ten dollars—if your plan wins out. But how is all this to be accomplished?'' continued Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We will take the earliest possible opportunity to visit Major Sampson,'' said Ulmer Montgomery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When we are all together, we+'ll get into some sort of an argument. You shall call me a fool and I+'ll slap you in the face. Then you shall challenge me to a duel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A duel! Why, sir, I—er—I never could shoot you, and I don't want to be shot myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear Mr. Gussing, you don't understand me. Don't you comprehend, the pistols shall be loaded with powder only.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, that+'s the idea!'' exclaimed the dude, much relieved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. You see it will only be a sham duel so far as we are concerned, but will, in the most harmless fashion possible, prove you to be a man of honor and courage. Major Sampson's scruples will vanish, and you will have the pleasure of gaining his daughter's hand in marriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agree, Mr. Montgomery—the plan is a famous one. Is it yours or is it Joe's?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe's—but it will fall to me to help carry it out,'' said the Jack-of-all-trades, who did not lose sight of the fifty dollars that had been promised to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the following day Felix Gussing and Mr. Montgomery took themselves to Major Sampson's residence, where the stranger was introduced as a curiosity hunter from Chicago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wishes to look at your collection of swords,'' said the dude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall be delighted to show them,'' said the major, who was a person of great self-importance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, this is a fine sword from the Holy Land,'' said Mr. Montgomery, handling one of the blades.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know where it came from,'' said the major. "It was presented to me by a friend from Boston.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is a Russian sword,'' said the dude. "I know it by its handle.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That sword is from the Holy Land,'' insisted Mr. Montgomery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anybody is a fool to talk that way,'' cried Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha! do you call me a fool, sir!'' stormed Montgomery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentlemen!'' put in the major. "I think—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not a fool, sir, and I want you to know it!'' bellowed Ulmer Montgomery. "It+'s an outrage to call me such. Take that, sir!'' and he slapped Felix Gussing lightly on the cheek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentlemen, this must cease!'' cried the major, coming between them. "In my house, too! Disgraceful!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has got to apologize to me!'' roared the dude, acting his part to perfection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never!'' shouted Montgomery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you will not, I demand satisfaction. I —I will fight you in a duel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A duel!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, a duel. Pistols, at ten paces,'' went on Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well! well!'' came from the major in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I do less?'' demanded the would-be son-in-law. "My honor is at stake.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then stand by your honor by all means,'' cried the military man, who, at times, was as hot-blooded as anybody.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the talk the major's daughter had come upon the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Felix, what does this mean?'' she demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to fight this—this fellow a duel, pistols at ten paces,'' answered Felix, firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Felix!'' she gasped. You will not, you cannot fight. For my sake, do not.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Clara,'' answered the dude, smiling affectionately upon her. "For your sake I would forego any personal gratification, but I must not suffer a stain upon the honor.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well said!'' exclaimed the major. "Felix is behaving well. I could+n't have done better myself. I admire his courage and I give him free permission to wed you after the—the—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But father, if he should be killed?'' faltered the fair Clara.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never fear, Clara; "all will go well,'' interposed Felix.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More words followed, but the dude pretended to be stubborn and so did Ulmer Montgomery. Both went off to arrange about the duel, and the major insisted upon it that he must be on hand to see the affair come off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Matters were hurried along with all speed, and it was arranged that the duel should take place on the following morning at ten o'clock, in a country spot just outside of the city. Joe was invited to go along, and carried the pistols, and two others were let into the secret, including a doctor, who went fully prepared to attend to any wounds that might be inflicted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did not take long to load the pistols, with powder only. Great care was taken so that Major Sampson should not suspect the truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Major,'' said Felix, in a trembling voice. "If I—if anything serious happens to me tell Clara that—that I died like a man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Noble boy! I will! I will!'' answered the military man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I give the word, gentlemen, you will both fire!'' said one of the seconds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well,'' answered both of the duelists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ready? One—two—three—fire!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both pistols were simultaneously discharged. When the smoke cleared away it was ascertained that both parties were unharmed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentlemen, are you satisfied?'' asked the seconds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am,'' answered Ulmer Montgomery, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I shall be,'' put in Felix Gussing. "And now that this affair is at an end, Mr. Montgomery will you shake hands?'' he added.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With pleasure, Mr. Gussing!'' was the reply. "I must say in all frankness I am sorry we quarrelled in the first place. Perhaps I was wrong about the sword.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And perhaps I was wrong.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Both of you were wrong,'' put in the major. "I hunted up the letter that came with the blade. It is an old Spanish weapon. Let us all call the affair off, and Mr. Montgomery shall come to Clara's wedding to Mr. Gussing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With all my heart,'' cried Montgomery, and there the little plot came to a finish.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX. ATTACKED IN THE DARK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"JOE, the plot worked to perfection!'' said Felix Gussing, on the day following. "I have to thank you, and here are twenty dollars for your trouble.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want a cent, Mr. Gussing,'' answered our hero. "I did it only out of friendliness to you. I hope you have no further trouble in your courtship.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that was all settled last night. Clara and I are to be married next week. We are going to send out the cards to-day. You see,'' went on the young man in a lower tone. "I don't want to give the major a chance to change his mind, or to suspect that that duel was not just what it ought to have been.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does he suspect anything as yet?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a thing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you are wise to have the wedding as quickly as possible.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When we are married I am going to let Clara into the secret. I know she+'ll enjoy it as much as anybody.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you had better warn her to keep mum before her father. He looks as if he could get pretty angry if he wanted to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As you won't take any money for this, Joe, would+n't you like to come to the wedding?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m afraid it will be too high-toned for me, Mr. Gussing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it is to be a plain, homelike affair— Clara wants it that way. The major has some country cousins who will be there, and they are very plain folks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'ll come—if Miss Sampson wishes it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it was arranged that Joe should attend the wedding, and as he was in need of a new Sunday suit he purchased it at once, so that he could use it at the wedding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re in luck, Joe,'' remarked Frank, when he heard the news. "And that suit looks very well on you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In some manner it leaked out among the boys that Joe was going to the wedding, and two days before the affair came off Jack Sagger learned of it. He immediately consulted with some of his cronies, and it was unanimously resolved to watch for Joe after the wedding was over and chastise him severely for the manner in which he had treated "the gang.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'ll fix him,'' said Sagger, suggestively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the proper time Joe took a car to the Sampson home and was there introduced to a dozen or more people. The wedding proved an enjoyable affair and the elegant supper that was served was one long to be remembered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was nearly eleven o'clock when Joe started for the hotel again. He had thought to take a car, but afterwards concluded to walk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A walk will do me good—after such a hearty supper,'' he told himself. If I ride home I won't be able to sleep.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the corner the Sagger crowd was waiting for him. One gave a low whistle, and all slunk out of sight until Joe had passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several blocks had been covered when our hero came to a spot where several new buildings were in the course of construction. It was rather dark and the street lights cast long and uncertain shadows along the walk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had just started to cross a wooden bridge over an excavation when he heard a rush behind him. Before he could turn he was given a violent shove.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Push him into de cellar hole!'' came, in Jack Sagger's voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop!'' cried Joe, and it must be admitted that he was greatly alarmed. But no attention was paid to his words, and over the side of the bridge he went, to fall a distance of a dozen feet and land in a pile of dirt, with one lower limb in a puddle of dirty water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down he goes!'' he heard, in the voice of Nick Sammel. "Wonder how he likes it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'re a mean, low crowd!'' cried Joe, as he stood up. He was covered with dirt and the cold water felt anything but agreeable on such a frosty night as it chanced to be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare to crawl out of dat!'' said Sagger. "If yer do we+'ll pitch yer in ag'in, won't we, fellers?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure we will!'' was the cry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"De next time we+'ll dump him in on his head!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Growing somewhat accustomed to the semi-darkness, Joe counted seven of his tormentors, all standing on the edge of the cellar hole into which he had so unceremoniously been thrown. Several of the youths had heavy sticks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I+'ll have to retreat,'' he reasoned "I can't fight seven of them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned to the rear of the cellar hole and felt his way along into the deepest shadows. Presently he reached a partly finished building and crawled up some planks leading to one of the floors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is running away!'' he heard Jack Sagger cry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on after him!'' said another of the crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let+'s take his new coat and vest away from him!'' added a third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The entire party dropped down into the hole and ran to the rear, in a hunt after our hero. In the meantime Joe was feeling his way along a scaffolding where some masons had been at work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As it happened the entire party under Jack Sagger walked toward the unfinished building and came to a halt directly under the scaffolding. Joe saw them and crouched back out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is de country jay?'' he heard one of the crowd ask.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'s back here somewhere,'' answered Jack Sagger. "We must find him an' thump him good.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ll not thump me if I can help it,'' said our hero to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe put out his hand and felt a cask near by. It was half filled with dirty water, being used for the purposes of making mortar. A tub of water was beside the cask.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tit for tat!'' he thought, and as quickly as it could be done he overturned the cask and the tub followed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe's aim was perfect, and down came the shower of dirty water, directly on the heads of the boys below. Every one was saturated and each set up a yell of dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, say, I+'m soaked!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He trun water all over me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ugh! but dat+'s a regular ice bath, dat is!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s what you get for throwing me into the hole!'' cried Joe. "After this you had better leave me alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got some mortar in me eye!'' screamed Jack Sagger, dancing around in pain. "Oh, me eye is burned out!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m wet to de skin!'' said Nick Sammel, with a shiver. "Oh, say, but it+'s dead cold, ain't it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Waiting to hear no more, Joe ran along the scaffolding and then leaped through a window of the unfinished building. A street light now guided him and he came out through the back of the structure and into an alleyway. From this he made his way to the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll have to hurry,'' he reasoned. "If they catch me now they will want to half kill me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't let him git away!'' he heard Sagger roar. "Catch him! Catch him!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on there, you young rascals!'' came a voice out of the darkness. "What are you doing around these buildings?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A watchman had come on the scene, with a lantern in one hand and a heavy club in the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We ain't doin' nuthin,'' said one of the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you+'re the gang that stole that lumber a couple of nights ago,'' went on the watchman, coming closer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't touched yer lumber,'' growled Jack Sagger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'re after anudder feller wot hid in here,'' said Sammel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s a likely story. I believe you are nothing but a crowd of young thieves,'' grumbled the watchman. "Every night somebody is trying to steal lumber or bricks, or something. I+'ve a good mind to make an example of you and have you all locked up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We ain't touched a thing!'' cried a small boy, and began to back away in alarm. At once several followed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here+'s a barrel of water knocked over and everything in a mess. You+'ve been skylarking, too. I+'m going to have you locked up!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The watchman made a dash after the boys and the crowd scattered in all directions. Sagger received a crack on the shoulder that lamed him for a week, and Sammel tripped and went down, taking the skin off of the end of his nose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, me nose!'' he moaned. "It+'s busted entirely!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Run!'' cried Sagger. "If you don't you+'ll be nabbed sure!'' And then the crowd ran with all their speed, scrambling out of the hole as best they could. They did not stop until they were half a dozen blocks away and on their way home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We made a fizzle of it dat trip,'' said Sagger, dolefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s all your fault,'' growled one of the boys. "I ain't goin' out wid you again. You promise big things but you never do 'em.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jack 's a gas-bag, dat+'s wot he is,'' was the comment of another, and he walked off by himself. Presently one after another of the boys followed suit, leaving Jack Sagger to sneak home, a sadder if not a wiser lad.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI. DAYS AT THE HOTEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"PERHAPS those fellows have learned a lesson they won't forget in a hurry,'' remarked Frank to Joe, after he learned the particulars of the attack in the dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope they don't molest me further,'' answered our hero. "If they+'ll only let me alone I+'ll let them alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That Sagger is certainly on the downward path,'' said Frank. If he does+n't look out he+'ll land in jail.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What Frank said was true, and less than a week later they heard through another hotel boy that Jack Sagger had been arrested for stealing some lead pipe out of a vacant residence. The pipe had been sold to a junkman for thirty cents and the boy had spent the proceeds on a ticket for a cheap theater and some cigarettes. He was sent to the House of Correction, and that was the last Joe heard of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the coming of winter the hotel filled up and Joe was kept busy from morning to night, so that he had little time for studying. He performed his duties faithfully and the hotel proprietor was much pleased in consequence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe is all right,'' he said to his cashier, "I can trust him with anything.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s so, and he is very gentlemanly, too,'' replied the cashier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ulmer Montgomery was still at the hotel. He was now selling antiquaries, and our hero often watched the fellow with interest. He suspected that Montgomery was a good deal of a humbug, but could not prove it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length Montgomery told Joe that he wa{s} going to the far West to try his fortunes. The man seemed to like our hero, and the night before he left the hotel he called Joe into his room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to make you a present of some books I own,'' said Ulmer Montgomery. "Perhaps you+'ll like to read them. They are historical works.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mr. Montgomery, you are very kind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I used to be a book agent, but I gave that up as it did+n't pay me as well as some other things.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you had these books left over?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. The firm I worked for would+n't take them back so I had to keep them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And now you are selling curiosities.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this Ulmer Montgomery smiled blandly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly, Joe—I only sell curiosities, or antiquities, when I am hard up. On other occasions I do like other folks, work for a living.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't quite understand.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dropped into selling curiosities when I was in the South and hard up for cash. I wanted money the worst way, and I—well, I set to work to raise it. Maybe you+'d like to hear my story.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind you, I don't pose as a model of goodness and I should+n't advise you to follow in my footsteps. But I wanted money and wanted in badly. So I put on my thinking cap, and I soon learned of a very zealous antiquary living about five miles from where I was stopping. He was wealthy and a bachelor, and spent no inconsiderable portion of his income on curiosities.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you went to him?'' said Joe, becoming interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I at once determined to take advantage of this gentleman's antiquarian zeal. I will own that I had some qualms of conscience—about imposing upon the old gentleman, but I did+n't know of any other way to procure the money I absolutely needed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Having made all of my preparations, I set off for Mr. Leland's house. To disguise myself I put on a pair of big goggles and an old-fashioned collar and tie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I understand, Mr. Leland, that you are in the habit of collecting curiosities,' I said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Quite right, sir,' said he. `I have got together some few,' and he gazed with an air of pride at the nondescript medley which surrounded him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I have in my possession,' I proceeded, `two or three of great value, which I had hoped to retain, but, well, I need money, and so I must part with them, much as I wish to call them mine. But I wish to see that they get into the proper hands, and I have been told that you are a great antiquarian, understanding the true value of such things, and so—'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Pray, show them to me at once!' cried the old man, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I have traveled a good deal, and been a pilgrim in many climes,' I went on. `I have wandered along the banks of the Euphrates and dipped my feet in the currents of the Nile. I have gazed upon ruined cities—'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Yes! yes! show me what you have!' he cried, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Here is a curiosity of the highest order', I said, opening a paper and showing a bit of salt about the size of a walnut. `This is a portion of the statue of salt into which Lot+'s wife was turned.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Is it possible?' cried the antiquary, taking the salt and gazing at it in deep veneration. `Are you quite certain of this?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `I am,' I answered. `It is a portion of the wrist. I broke it off myself. The hand was already gone.' ''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `And did he buy it?'' questioned Joe, in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He did, and gave me fifty dollars in cash for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But that was+n't fair, Mr. Montgomery.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seller of bogus curiosities shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps not. But I was hard up and had to do something.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you sell him anything else?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did—a walking stick, which I had procured in Connecticut. It was covered with strange carvings and he mistook them for hieroglyphics, and gave me ten dollars for the thing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how you could have the nerve to do such things, Mr. Montgomery.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, a man can do lots of things when he is driven to do them. I admit the deals were rather barefaced, but, as I said before, I had to do something. Some day, when I am rich, I+'ll return the money to the old fellow,'' added the impostor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He left the hotel that morning, and it may be said here that Joe did not meet him again for several years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Christmas came and went at the hotel, and our hero received several presents from his friends, including a pair of gloves from Ned Talmadge and a five-dollar gold piece from Felix Gussing. Some of the regular boarders at the hotel also remembered him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And how do you like married life?'' asked Joe, of Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are getting along very nicely,'' said the dude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you told your wife about the duel yet?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No,—and I don't think I shall,'' added Felix Gussing. "You see she—er—she thinks me a very brave man and—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you don't want her to change her opinion,'' finished Joe, with a smile!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why should I, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I don't know as there is any reason, excepting that they usually say men and their wives should have no secrets from each other.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Montgomery is gone, I see,'' said the dude, changing the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you are the only one who knows of this secret. You won't tell, will you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are having troubles enough as it is,'' went on the dude. "Both my wife and I find housekeeping rather troublesome. It is hard to obtain proper servants, and she does not care to do the work herself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you go to boarding?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps we will, later on.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the new year came a heavy fall of snow and soon sleighs big and little were in demand. Then came a slight fall of rain which made the sidewalks a glare of ice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got to be careful,'' announced Frank to Joe. "If you don't you+'ll go down on your back.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I intend to be careful,'' answered our hero. "I have no wish to break any bones.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That afternoon Joe was sent on an errand to a place of business half a mile away. On returning he chanced to stop at a street corner, to watch a number of children who had made a long slide for themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he stood watching, a man came along bundled up in a great coat and wearing a slouch hat and blue glasses. The man was walking rapidly, as if in a hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That fellow looks familiar to me,'' thought Joe. "Wonder who he can be?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He watched the stranger cross the street. Then the fellow happened to step on the icy slide and in a twinkling he went down on his back, his hat flying in one direction and a bundle he carried in another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah! Down goes the gent!'' sang out a newsboy standing near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come here an' I+'ll pick yer up!'' said another street urchin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You rascals, you fixed this on purpose so I should fall!'' cried the man, starting to get up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I help you?'' questioned Joe, coming up, and then he gave a start, as he recognized the fellow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Pat Malone, alias David Ball, from Montana!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII. ABOUT SOME MINING SHARES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Mr. Ball?'' said our hero, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh, what+'s that?'' questioned Malone, in amazement. Then he recognized Joe, and his face fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have often wondered what became of you,'' went on our hero. "Let me help you up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—that is—who are you, boy?'' demanded Malone, getting to his feet and picking up his hat and his bundle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to remember me. I am Joe Bodley. I used to work for Mr. Mallison, at Riverside.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't know the man or the place,'' said Pat Malone, coolly. "You have made a mistake.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then perhaps I had better call you Malone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all. My name is Fry—John Fry.'' "How often do you change your name, Mr. Fry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't get impudent!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not impudent,—I am only asking a plain question.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never change my name.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment Joe saw a policeman on the opposite side of the street and beckoned for the officer to come over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi! what+'s the meaning of this!'' ejaculated Pat Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Officer, I want this man locked up,'' said Joe, and caught the rascal by the arm, that he might not run away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the charge?'' asked the bluecoat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is wanted for swindling.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boy, are you really crazy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I am not.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are you?'' asked the policeman, eyeing Joe sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Joe Bodley. I work at the Grandon House. I will make a charge against this man, and I+'ll bring the man who was swindled, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s fair talk,'' said the policeman. "I guess you+'ll both have to go to the station with me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m willing,'' said Joe, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I cannot go—I have a sick wife—I must get a doctor,'' stammered Pat Malone. "Let me go. The boy is mistaken.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ll have to go with me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But my sick wife?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can send for your friends and they can take care of her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no friends—we are strangers in Philadelphia. I don't want to go.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pat Malone tried to move on, but the policeman and Joe detained him, and in the end he was marched off to the police station. Here Joe told what he knew and Malone's record was looked up in the Rogues' Gallery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You+'ve got the right man, that+'s sure,'' said the desk sergeant to our hero. "Now where can you find this Mr. Maurice Vane?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have his address at the hotel,'' answered our hero. "If I can go I+'ll get it and send Mr. Vane a telegram.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bring the address here and we+'ll communicate with Mr. Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero agreed, and inside of half an hour a message was sent to Maurice Vane, notifying him of the fact that Pat Malone had been caught. Mr. Vane had gone to New York on business, but came back to Philadelphia the next day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he saw that he was caught Pat Malone broke down utterly and made a full confession, telling in detail how the plot against Maurice Vane had been carried out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was not my plan,'' said he. "Gaff Caven got the mining shares and he arranged the whole thing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you get the shares—steal them?'' demanded Maurice Vane, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, we did+n't steal them. We bought them from an old miner for fifty dollars. The miner is dead now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you prove this?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then do so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care to answer that question. But if you can prove to me that you and Caven came by those shares honestly I won't prosecute you, Malone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will prove it!'' was the quick answer, and that very afternoon Pat Malone proved beyond a doubt that the shares had belonged to himself and Gaff Caven when they sold them to Maurice Vane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is all I want of you,'' said Maurice Vane. "I shan't appear against you, Malone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then those shares must be valuable after all?'' queried the swindler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps they are. I am having them looked up. I am glad of this opportunity of proving that they are now my absolute property.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Caven and I sold you good stocks we ought to be kicked full of holes,'' grumbled Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was your lookout, not mine,'' returned Maurice Vane. "Mind, I don't say the shares are valuable. But they may be, and if so I shall be satisfied with my bargain.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! where do I come in?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't come in at all—and you don't deserve to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I did+n't swindle you, you can't have me held for swindling.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't intend to have you held. You can go for all I care.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Vane explained the situation to the police authorities and that evening Pat Malone was allowed to go. He threatened to have somebody sued for false imprisonment but the police laughed at him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better not try it on, Malone,'' said one officer. "Remember, your picture is in our Rogues' Gallery,'' and then the rascal was glad enough to sneak away. The next day he took a train to Baltimore, where, after an hour's hunt, he found Gaff Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We made a fine mess of things,'' he said, bitterly. "A fine mess!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you talking about, Pat?'' asked Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you remember the mining stocks we sold to Maurice Vane?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly I do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he has got 'em yet.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, he can keep them. We have his money too,'' and Gaff Caven chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d rather have the shares.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I said I+'d rather have the shares, Gaff. We put our foot into it when we sold 'em.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to say the shares are valuable?'' demanded Gaff Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s the size of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who told you this?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody told me, but I can put two and two together as quick as anybody.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, explain.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was in Philadelphia when I ran into that hotel boy, Joe Bodley.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What of that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had me arrested. Then they sent for Mr. Maurice Vane, and Vane made me prove that the shares were really ours when we sold them to him. I thought I+'d go clear if I could prove that, so I went and did it. Then Vane said he would+n't prosecute me, for the shares might be valuable after all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But the mine is abandoned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe it is and maybe it is+n't. I guess Mr. Maurice Vane knows what he is doing, and we were fools to sell out to him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If that mine is valuable I+'m going to have it!'' cried Gaff Caven. "He can have his money back!'' and the rascal who had overreached himself began to pace the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe he won't take his money back.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'ll claim the mine anyway, Pat—and you must help me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can you do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go out to Montana, just as soon as the weather is fit, and relocate the mine. If it+'s any good we can find some fellows to help us hold it somehow. "I+'m not going to let this slip into Maurice Vane's hands without a struggle.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Talk is cheap, but it takes money to pay for railroad tickets,'' went on Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got the dust, Pat.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Enough to fight Vane off if he should come West?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think so. I met a rich fellow last week and I got a loan of four thousand dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Without security?'' and Malone winked suggestively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly. Oh, he was a rich find,'' answered Gaff Caven, and gave a short laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m willing to go anywhere. I+'m tired of things here. It+'s getting too warm for comfort.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then let us start West next week—after I can finish up a little business here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am willing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so the two rascals arranged to do Maurice Vane out of what had become his lawful property.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII. THE FIRE AT THE HOTEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON the day following the scene at the police station Maurice Vane stopped at the Grandon House to interview our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must thank you for the interest you have taken in this matter, Joe,'' said he. "It is not every lad who would put himself out to such an extent.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wanted to see justice done, Mr. Vane,'' answered our hero, modestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Things have taken a sudden change since I saw you last summer,'' went on Maurice Vane. "Perhaps it will be as well if I tell my whole story.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like first rate to hear it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"After I got those shares of stock I felt that I had been swindled, and I was very anxious to get hold of the rascals. But as time went on and I could not locate them I resolved to look into the deal a little more minutely and see if there was any chance of getting my money, or a portion of it, back.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should have done the same.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wrote to a friend out West and he put me in communication with a mining expert who set to work to find out all about the mine. The expert sent me word, late in the fall, that the mine was, in his opinion, located on a vein of gold well worth working.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do then?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wanted to go West at once and look into the matter personally, but an aunt died and I had to settle up her estate and see to the care of her two children, and that held me back. Then winter came on, and I knew I+'d have to let matters rest until spring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going out there in the spring?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,—as early as possible, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you find the mine a valuable one, Mr. Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I place great reliance on what the mining expert said, for he is known as a man who makes no mistakes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, if the mine proves of value, you+'ll have gotten a cheap piece of property after all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, indeed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't those swindlers be mad when they hear of this!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Most likely, my lad; but they have nobody to blame but themselves. I bought their shares in good faith, while they sold them in bad faith.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is your title perfectly clear now?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Absolutely so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I hope the mine proves to be worth millions.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, my boy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like to own a mine like that myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you? Well, perhaps you will some day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s not likely. A hotel boy does+n't earn enough to buy a mine,'' and our hero laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I find the mine worth working and open up for business, how would you like to go out there and work for me?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'d like it very much, Mr. Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, I+'ll bear that in mind,'' answered the possessor of the mining shares.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you buy up the rest of the mining shares first?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to do so—if I can locate them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the owners will sell cheap.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall explain the situation and make a fair offer. I do not believe in any underhand work,'' was the ready answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you are not like some men I have met,'' said Joe, and told about Ulmer Montgomery and his so-called antiquities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That man will never amount to anything, Joe—mark my words. "He will always be a hanger-on as we call them, in the business world.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe you, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honesty pays in the long run. A rogue may make something at the start but sooner or later he will find himself exposed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Vane remained at the hotel for a week and then left to go to Chicago on business. From that point he was going to Montana as soon as the weather permitted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After that several weeks slipped by without anything unusual happening. During those days Joe fell in again with Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are going to move to Riverside,'' said the dude, if such he may still be called, although he was a good business man. "I have rented a house there—the old Martin place—and if you ever come to the town you must visit us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, I will,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My wife thinks a great deal of you and you must stop at the house during your stay at Riverside,'' went on Felix Gussing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A change came for Joe much quicker than was anticipated. One night, late in the winter, he was just preparing to retire, when he smelt smoke. He ran out of his room and to an air shaft and saw the smoke coming up thickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The hotel must be on fire!'' he thought. "If it is, I+'ll have to notify the management!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He jumped rather than ran down the several stairways to the hotel office. Here he told the proprietor and the cashier. An examination was made and the fire was located in the laundry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go and awaken all the guests,'' said Mr. Drew, and Joe ran off to do as bidden. Other boys did the same, and before long the guests were hurrying through the hallways and down the elevators and stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the smoke was coming thickly, and presently a sheet of flame burst through at the rear of the hotel. The fire alarm had been given and several engines and a hook-and-ladder company dashed on the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are your guests all out?'' demanded a police officer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe so,'' answered Mr. Drew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m going to take a look around,'' said Joe, and darted upstairs once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He visited room after room, only to find them empty. From the rear of the hotel came the crackling of flames and down in the street the fire engines were pounding away, sending their streams of water into the structure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the third floor of the building our hero came across an old lady who was rather queer in her mind. The lady was also lame and walked with great difficulty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Joseph! what is the trouble?'' she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The hotel is on fire, Mrs. Dalley. Come, let me help you out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On fire! Oh, I must save my canary!'' And the old lady started back for her room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have+n't got time, Mrs. Dalley. Come with me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot let my dear Dick perish!'' answered the old lady, firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe looked along the hall and saw that the flames were moving swiftly toward the room the old lady had occupied. To enter the apartment would be highly dangerous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You simply can't go after the bird, madam,'' he said. "Come with me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My bird! my bird!'' screamed Mrs. Dalley, and tried to run, or rather hobble, towards her room, despite the smoke that was now rolling over her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must come with me!'' exclaimed Joe, and drew her back. She tried to struggle and then, without warning, fainted in his arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The burden was a heavy one, but our hero did not shirk the task before him. He half dragged and half carried the unconscious lady to the nearest staircase and almost fell to the bottom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The smoke on the second floor was so thick he could scarcely see. But he kept on and went down another flight and reached the office. He could hardly breathe and the tears were running down both cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo there, boy!'' came the call of a fireman, as he appeared through the smoke. "Better get out of here!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Help me with this lady,'' answered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A lady! Oh, all right!'' And in a moment more the fireman had Mrs. Dalley over his shoulder and was carrying her out. Joe came close behind. The lady was taken to a nearby drug store where she speedily revived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the prompt efforts of the fire department only a small portion of the hotel was burnt. But the whole building was water-soaked, and all of the boarders had to move out, and then the place was closed up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Out of a place once again,'' thought our hero, rather dismally. "What+'s to do next?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was not an easy question to answer. He looked around for another opening but, finding none, resolved to pay a visit to Riverside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can call on the Gussings, and on Ned,'' he thought. "I know all of them will be glad to see me. And maybe Mr. Mallison will be wanting to make some arrangements for next summer. I suppose he+'ll run the boats as usual.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to leave Philadelphia, eh?'' said Frank. "Do you intend to come back, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know yet, Frank.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I wish you luck.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you the same.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you go to work for Mallison this summer, maybe you can get me a job too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll remember that,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His preparations were soon made, and then he boarded a train for Riverside. He did not dream of the surprises in store for him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV. THE BLUE BOX AT LAST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AFTER calling on the Gussings and being invited to remain there for several days, Joe took himself to Ned Talmadge's residence. Ned was very glad to see him and had to give all the particulars of another trip he had made to the West. "I had a splendid time,'' said Ned. "I wish you had been along.'' "Then you like the West, Ned?'' "Indeed I do,—better than the East.'' "Perhaps I+'ll go West some day,'' went on our hero, and told his friend of what Maurice Vane had said. "I saw some mines while I was out there,'' continued Ned. "I went to the very bottom of one mine. I can tell you I felt a bit shivery, being so far underground.'' "I suppose the miners get used to it.'' "It would be a joke on those swindlers if that mine should prove of value,'' went on Ned, after a pause. "I hope, for Mr. Vane's sake, it does prove valuable.'' "Now your hotel is burnt out, what are you going to do?'' "I have+n't made up my mind, Ned. Perhaps I+'ll come back here, to work for Mr. Mallison.'' "Then we+'ll be together again next summer. That will suit me.'' The boys had a good time together and then Joe said he would like to pay a visit to his old home on the mountain side. Ned readily consented to go along. "But I don't imagine you+'ll find much of the old cabin left,'' he added. There was still a little ice in the lake, but they rowed to the spot without great difficulty and made their way to the tumble-down cabin. It was not an inviting sight and it made Joe feel sober to view the locality . "Joe, you never heard anything of that blue box, did you?'' asked Ned, after several minutes of silence. "No.'' "It ought to be somewhere in this vicinity.'' "It+'s gone, and that is all there is to it,'' said our hero, and gave a long sigh. The boys tramped around the vicinity for a good half hour, and then sat down on a hollow log to eat a lunch they had brought along. "Let us build a fire beside the old log,'' said Ned. "It will help to keep us warm.'' Joe was willing and the two boys soon had some leaves and twigs gathered, and placed some good-sized branches on top to make the blaze last. Then they began to eat and to warm themselves at the same time. "This log would make a good hiding-place for some wild animal,'' remarked Ned. "Can anything be inside?'' "It+'s not likely, Ned. The smoke would drive out any living creature.'' "I+'m going to get a stick and poke into the log.'' Both boys procured sticks and began to poke at the log. Presently they felt something move and a half-dazed snake came into view. "There+'s your animal, Ned!'' exclaimed Joe. "Oh, a snake! Keep him away!'' roared Ned, badly frightened. "He can't hurt you—he is too stiff from the cold,'' answered our hero, and quickly dispatched the snake with a stone. "Do you suppose there are any more in the tree?'' asked the rich boy, still keeping at a distance. "More than likely. I+'ll poke around with my stick and see.'' "Be careful!'' "I am not afraid.'' Joe's stick had something of a crotch on the end of it and with this he began to rake among the dead leaves that had blown into the hollow log. He brought out a great quantity but no more snakes showed themselves. "I reckon he was the only one after all, Ned.'' "The log is burning!'' said Ned, an instant later. "See, the smoke is coming out of the hollow.'' "My stick is caught,'' said Joe, pulling hard on something. "I guess—well, I declare!'' He gave a jerk, and from the hollow came a square object, covered with smoking dirt and leaves. IT'S THE BLUE BOX, SURE ENOUGH, SAID JOE.— Page 209. Illusration by Nuttall. Joe and Ned standing in a forest by a lake. Joe holds the blue box, covered with smoking dirt and leaves. "What is it?'' "Unless I am mistaken, it is a tin box.'' "Oh, Joe, the blue box?'' Joe did not answer for he was brushing the smoking leaves and dirt from the object. As he cleaned it off he caught sight of some blue paint. On one end the box was badly charred from the fire. "It+'s the blue box, sure enough,'' said Joe. "And we came close to burning it up!'' groaned Ned. "Oh, Joe, I am so sorry!'' "It+'s not your fault, Ned, I was as much to blame as anybody. But who would look for the box out here?'' "Perhaps some wild animal carried it off.'' "That may be.'' Joe had the box cleaned off by this time. It was still hot at one end and smoking. He tried to pull it open, but found it locked. "The contents will burn up before I can open it!'' cried Joe. He did not know what to do, and in desperation began to pry at the box with his stick and his jackknife. Then the box broke open, scattering some half-burnt papers in all directions. The boys picked the papers up and also a small bag of buckskin. When Joe opened the bag he found it contained exactly a hundred dollars in gold. "That+'s a nice find,'' said Ned. "Anyway, you are a hundred dollars richer than you were.'' Joe began to peruse the half-burnt documents but could make little or nothing out of them. He saw his own name and also that of a certain William A. Bodley, and an estate in Iowa was mentioned. "What do you find, Joe?'' "I can't tell you, Ned. The papers are too badly burnt.'' "Let me look at them.'' Our hero was willing, and the two boys spent an hour in trying to decipher the documents. "It is certainly a puzzle,'' said the rich boy. "Why not let my father look over them?'' Joe was willing, and after wrapping up the documents with care, and pocketing the hundred dollars in gold, Joe led the way back to the boat. The wreck of the blue box was left behind, for it was rusty and worthless. "That evening Mr. Talmadge, Ned and Joe spent two hours in going over the documents and trying to supply the parts which had been rotted or burnt away. They were only successful in part. "I do not wish to say much about this, Joe,'' said Ned's father. "But it would seem from these papers that you are the son of one William A. Bodley, who at one time owned a farm in Iowa, in the township of Millville. Did you ever hear Hiram Bodley speak of this?'' "Never.'' "We might write to the authorities at Millville and see what they have to say.'' "I wish you+'d do it. They may pay more attention to you than to a boy.'' "I+'ll write at once.'' "Father, had+n't Joe better stay here until we get a reply?'' put in Ned. "He may do so and welcome,'' answered Mr. Talmadge. The letter was dispatched the next day and our hero waited anxiously for the reply. It came five days later and was as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your letter of inquiry received. There was a William A. Bodley in this township twelve years ago. He sold his farm to a man named Augustus Greggs and then disappeared. Before he sold out he lost his wife and several children by sickness. Nobody here seems to know what became of him. "Joseph Korn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is short and to the point,'' said Mr. Talmadge, "but it is not satisfying. It does not state if this William A. Bodley had any relatives so far as known.'' "I guess the authorities did not want to bother about the matter,'' said Joe. "Why don't you visit Millville, Joe?'' questioned Ned. "I was thinking I could do that. It would+n't cost a fortune, and I+'ve got that hundred dollars in gold to fall back on, besides my regular savings.'' "You might learn something to your advantage,'' came from Mr. Talmadge. "I think it would be money well spent.'' "Father, can't I go with Joe?'' asked Ned. "No, Ned, you must attend to your school duties.'' "Then, Joe, you must send me full particulars by mail,'' said the rich boy. "Of course I+'ll do that, Ned,'' replied our hero. It was arranged that Joe should leave Riverside on Monday and Ned went to the depot to see him off. "I wish you the best of luck, Joe!'' called out Ned, as the train left the station. "I don't know of a fellow who deserves better luck than you do!''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV. JOE VISITS CHICAGO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOE found Millville a sleepy town of three or four hundred inhabitants. There was one main street containing two blocks of stores, a blacksmith shop, a creamery and two churches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he stepped off the train our hero was eyed sharply by the loungers about the platform.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anything I can' do for you?'' asked one of the men, the driver of the local stage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you tell me where Mr. Joseph Korn lives?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe lives up in the brown house yonder. But he ain't home now. He+'s doing a job of carpentering.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you tell me where?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up to the Widow Fallow's place. Take you there for ten cents.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well,'' and our hero jumped into the rickety turnout which went by the name of the Millville stage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The drive was not a long one and soon they came to a halt in front of a residence where a man wearing a carpenter's apron was mending a broken-down porch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There+'s Joe,'' said the stage driver, laconically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man looked up in wonder when Joe approached him. He dropped his hammer and stood with his arms on his hips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is Mr. Joseph Korn, I believe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s me, young man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am Joe Bodley. You wrote to Mr. Talmadge, of Riverside, a few days ago. I came on to find out what I could about a Mr. William A. Bodley who used to live here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes! Well, young man, I can't tell you much more 'n I did in that letter. Bodley sold out, house, goods and everything, and left for parts unknown.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he have any relatives around here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not when he left. He had a wife and three children—a girl and two boys—but they died.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever hear of any relatives coming to see him—a man named Hiram Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not me—but Augustus Greggs—who bought his farm—might know about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll take you to the Greggs' farm for ten cents,'' put in the stage driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again a bargain was struck, and a drive of ten minutes brought them to the farm, located on the outskirts of Millville. They found the farm owner at work by his wood pile, sawing wood. He was a pleasant appearing individual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come into the house,'' he said putting down his saw. "I+'m glad to see you,'' and when our hero had entered the little farmhouse he was introduced to Mrs. Greggs and two grown-up sons, all of whom made him feel thoroughly at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To tell the truth,'' said Mr. Greggs, "I did not know William Bodley very well. I came here looking for a farm and heard this was for sale, and struck a bargain with him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was he alone at that time?'' questioned Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was, and his trouble seemed to have made him a bit queer—not but what he knew what he was doing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you learn anything about his family?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had lost his wife and two children by disease. What had happened to the other child was something of a mystery. I rather supposed it had died while away from home, but I was not sure.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any idea at all what became of William Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly. Once I met a man in Pittsburg who had met a man of that name in Idaho, among the mines. Both of us wondered if that William A. Bodley was the same that I had bought my farm from.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he say what part of Idaho?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He did, but I have forgotten now. Do you think he was a relative of yours?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what to think. It may be that he was my father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your father?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' and Joe told his story and mentioned the documents found in the blue tin box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It does look as if he might be your father,'' said Augustus Greggs. "Maybe you+'re the child that was away from home at the time his other children and his wife died.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think anybody else in this village would know anything more about this William Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't. But it won't do any harm to ask around. That stage driver knows all the old inhabitants. Perhaps some of them can tell you something worth while.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon urgent invitation, Joe took dinner at the Greggs' farm and then set out to visit a number of folks who had lived in Millville and vicinity for many years. All remembered William A. Bodley and his family, but not one could tell what had become of the man after he had sold out and gone away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you had better advertise for him,'' suggested one man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will cost a good deal to advertise all over the United States,'' replied Joe; "and for all I know he may be dead or out of the country.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe remained in Millville two days and then took the train back to the East. Ned was the first to greet him on his return to Riverside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What luck?'' he asked, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None whatever,'' was the sober answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Joe, that+'s too bad!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid I am stumped, Ned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They walked to the Talmadge mansion, and that evening talked the matter over with Ned's father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will arrange to have an advertisement inserted in a leading paper of each of our big cities,'' said Mr. Talmadge. "That will cost something, but not a fortune.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must let me pay for it,'' said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Joe, you can put this down to Ned's credit—you two are such good chums,'' and Mr. Talmadge smiled quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The advertisements were sent out the following day, through an advertising agent, and all waited for over two weeks for some reply, but none came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s no use,'' said Joe, and it must be admitted that he was much downcast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the meantime he had seen Andrew Mallison and the hotel man said he would willingly hire him for the summer as soon as the season opened, and also give Frank Randolph a situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better be my guest until that time,'' said Ned to our hero, when he heard of this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Ned, but I don't wish to remain idle so long.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The very next mail after this talk brought news for our hero. A letter came from Maurice Vane, asking him if he wished to go to Montana.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am now certain that that mine is valuable,'' wrote the gentleman. "I am going to start West next Monday. If you wish to go with me I will pay your fare and allow you a salary of ten dollars per week to start on. I think later on, I will have a good opening for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That settles it, I am going West!'' cried Joe, as he showed the letter to his chum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I don't blame you,'' was the reply. "I know just how nice it is out there. You+'ll be sure to get along.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before going to bed Joe wired his acceptance of the offer, and in the morning received a telegram from Maurice Vane, asking him to go to Chicago, to the Palmer House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That settles it, I+'m off,'' said our hero, and bought a ticket for the great city by the lakes without delay. Then he said good-bye to the Talmadges and the Gussings, and boarded the train at sundown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was now getting used to traveling and no longer felt green and out of place. He had engaged a berth, and took his ease until it was time to go to bed. Arriving at Chicago he made his way without delay to the Palmer House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found the hotel crowded and had some difficulty in getting a room. Mr. Maurice Vane had not yet arrived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I+'ll leave a note for him,'' thought our hero, and sauntered into the reading-room to pen the communication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Joe was writing, two men came into the room and sat down behind a pillar that was close at hand. They were in earnest conversation and he could not help but catch what was said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You say he is coming West?'' said one of the pair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,—he started yesterday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he has found out that the mine is really valuable?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think so. Anyway he is quite excited about it. He sent a telegram to that boy, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The hotel boy you mean?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So the talk ran on and Joe at length got up to take a look at the two men. They were Gaff Caven and Pat Malone. At once our hero drew out of sight again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can you get the best of Vane, Gaff?'' asked Malone, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is but one way, Malone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that is?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I trust you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have+n't you trusted me before?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must—'' Caven paused. "We won't talk about it in this public place. Come to my room and I+'ll lay my plan before you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the two arose and left the reading-room as rapidly as they had entered it.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI. HOW A SATCHEL DISAPPEARED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"THEY certainly mean mischief,'' Joe told himself, after the two men had vanished. He saw them enter an elevator, but did not know at what floor they alighted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking over the hotel register he was unable to find the names of either Caven or Malone, or even Ball. Evidently the rascals were traveling under other names now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They+'ll bear watching,'' he concluded. "I must put Mr. Vane on guard as soon as he comes in.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gave up the idea of leaving a note and took his station in the corridor of the hotel. After waiting about two hours he saw a well-known form approaching, dress-suit case in hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Vane!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Joe, so you+'re here already! I+'m glad I won't have to wait for you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m afraid you won't be able to get a room, Mr. Vane. But you can have mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I telegraphed ahead for a room, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know that your enemies are here?'' went on our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My enemies?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gaff Caven and Pat Malone. But they are traveling under other names.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have they seen you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think not, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Vane soon had his room assigned to him and he and our hero passed up in the elevator. As soon as they were in the apartment by themselves, Joe related what he had seen and heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are certainly on my trail,'' mused Maurice Vane. "And they must have kept pretty close or they would+n't know that I had asked you to accompany me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They have some plot, Mr. Vane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any idea what it is?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, excepting that they are going to try to do you out of your interest in that mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Vane and Joe talked the matter over for an hour, but without satisfaction. Then they went to the dining room for something to eat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We start for Montana in the morning,'' said the gentleman. "I think the quicker I get on the ground the better it will be for me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Maurice Vane and Joe did not know it, both were shadowed by Caven and Malone. The two rascals had disguised themselves by donning false beards and putting on spectacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They leave in the morning,'' said Caven. "Malone, we must get tickets for the same train, and, if possible, the same sleeping car.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s dangerous work,'' grumbled Pat Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you want to back out, say so, and I+'ll go it alone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want to back out. But we must be careful.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll be careful, don't fear,'' answered the leader of the evil pair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the ticket office of the hotel, Maurice Vane procured the necessary tickets and sleeper accommodations to the town of Golden Pass, Idaho. He did not notice that he was watched. A moment later Gaff Caven stepped up to the desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want a couple of tickets to Golden Pass, too,'' he said, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me see, what sleeper did that other gentleman take?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Number 2, sir—berths 7 and 8.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then give me 9 and 10 or 5 and 6,'' went on Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"9 and 10—here you are, sir,'' said the clerk, and made out the berth checks. Without delay Caven hurried away, followed by Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'ll be in the sleeping compartment right next to that used by Vane and the boy,'' chuckled Gaff Caven. "Pat, it ought to be dead easy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you the chloroform?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, twice as much as we+'ll need.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When can we leave the train?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At three o'clock, at a town called Snapwood. We can get another train two hours later,—on the northern route.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All unconscious of being watched so closely, Maurice Vane and Joe rode to the depot and boarded the train when it came along. Joe had been looking for Caven and Malone, but without success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot see those men anywhere,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are probably in hiding,'' said his employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The train was only half full and for the time being Caven and Malone kept themselves either in the smoking compartment or in the dining car. It was dark when they took their seats, and soon the porter came through to make up the berths for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must confess I am rather sleepy,'' said Maurice Vane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I,'' returned our hero. "I am sure I can sleep like a top, no matter how much the car shakes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then both of us may as well go to bed at once.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it was arranged, and they had the porter put up their berths a few minutes later. Maurice Vane took the lower resting place while our hero climbed to the top.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although very tired it was some time before Joe could get to sleep. He heard Maurice Vane breathing heavily and knew that his employer must be fast in the land of dreams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Joe awoke it was with a peculiar, dizzy feeling in his head. His eyes pained him not a little and for several minutes he could not remember where he was. Then came a faint recollection of having tried to arise during the night but of being held down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must have been dreaming,'' he thought. "But it was exactly as if somebody was keeping me down and holding something over my mouth and nose.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stretched himself and then pushed aside the berth curtain and gazed out into the aisle of the car. The porter was already at work, turning some of the berths into seats once more. Joe saw that it was daylight and consulted the nickel watch he carried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eight o'clock!'' he exclaimed. "I+'ve overslept myself sure! Mr. Vane must be up long ago.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He slipped into his clothing and then knocked on the lower berth. He heard a deep sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Vane!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh? Oh, Joe, is that you? What time is it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eight o'clock.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What!'' Maurice Vane started up. "I+'ve certainly slept fast enough this trip. Are you getting hungry waiting for me?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just woke up myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!'' Maurice Vane stretched himself. "My, how dizzy I am.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am dizzy too, sir. It must be from the motion of the car.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably, although I rarely feel so, and I ride a great deal. I feel rather sick at my stomach, too,'' went on the gentleman, as he began to dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe had just started to go to the lavatory to wash up when he heard his employer utter an exclamation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you see anything of my satchel?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You took it into the berth with you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It must be somewhere around. I saw it when you went to bed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I put it under my pillow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both made a hasty search, but the satchel could not be found. The dress-suit case stood under the seat and Joe's was beside it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is strange. Can I have been robbed?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was there much in that satchel, Mr. Vane?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, those mining shares and some other articles of value.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we must find the satchel by all means.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll question the porter about this.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The colored man was called and questioned, but he denied having seen the bag. By this time quite a few passengers became interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has anybody left this car?'' asked Maurice Vane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The gen'men that occupied Numbers 9 and 10, sah,'' said the porter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When did they get off?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" 'Bout three o'clock, sah—when de train stopped at Snapwood.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have+n't any tickets for Snapwood,'' said the conductor, who had appeared on the scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then they must have had tickets for some other point,'' said Joe. "That looks black for them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The porter was asked to describe the two men and did so, to the best of his ability. Then another search was made, and in a corner, under a seat, a bottle was found, half filled with chloroform.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s as plain as day to me,'' said Maurice Vane. "Joe, I was chloroformed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I was, too. That+'s what gave us the dizzy feeling.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And those two men—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Must have been Caven and Malone in disguise,'' finished our hero.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII. JOE MAKES A DISCOVERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WHO are Caven and Malone?'' asked the conductor of the train, while a number of passengers gathered around, to hear what Maurice Vane and our hero might have to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are two rascals who are trying to do me out of my share of a mine,'' explained Maurice Vane. "I had my mining shares in that satchel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you wish I+'ll telegraph back to Snapwood for you,'' went on the train official.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many miles is that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little over two hundred.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the next stop of this train?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leadington.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When will we get there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In ten minutes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A telegram was prepared and sent back to Snapwood as soon as Leadington was reached. The train was held for five minutes and it was learned that nobody had been seen at the station there at three in the morning, as the night operator and station master were away, there being no passengers to get on the train bound West.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Vane was much disturbed and did not know what to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To go back and look for them at Snapwood may be a mere waste of time,'' said he. "On the other hand, I don't feel much like going on while the shares are out of my possession.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you wish it, Mr. Vane, I+'ll go back,'' said Joe. "You can go ahead, and if anything turns up I will telegraph to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This pleased the gentleman, and he said Joe could go back on the very next train. The conductor was again consulted, and our hero left the train bound West a quarter of an hour later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is some money,'' said Maurice Vane on parting. "You+'ll need it.'' And he handed over two hundred dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mr. Vane! will I need as much as this?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps. If you see those rascals you may have a long chase to capture them. Do not hesitate to spend the money if it appears necessary to do so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Long before noon our hero was on the way Easts on a train scheduled to stop at Snapwood. He went without his dress-suit case and carried his money in four different pockets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The train was almost empty and the riding proved decidedly lonely. In a seat he found an Omaha paper, but he was in no humor for reading. When noon came he took his time eating his dinner, so that the afternoon's ride might not appear so lasting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About half-past two o'clock the train came to an unexpected halt. Looking out of the window Joe saw that they were in something of a cut, close to the edge of a woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The delay continued, and presently one passenger after another alighted, to learn the meaning of the hold-up. Joe did likewise, and walked through the cut toward the locomotive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mystery was easily explained. On one side of the cut the bank had toppled over the tracks, carrying with it two trees of good size. A number of train hands were already at work, sawing the trees into pieces, so that they might be shifted clear of the tracks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe watched the men laboring for a few minutes and then walked up the bank, to get a look at the surroundings. Then he heard a whistle and saw a train approaching from the opposite direction. It came to a halt a few hundred feet away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the delay continued our hero walked along the bank of the cut and up to the newly-arrived train. The latter was crowded with passengers, some of whom also got out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did that train stop at Snapwood?'' he asked of one of the passengers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It did,'' was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you see anybody get on?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but somebody might have gotten on. I was+n't looking.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Looking for a friend?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No,'' said Joe, and moved on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without delay our hero ran to the front end of the newly-arrived train and got aboard. As he walked through he gave every grown passenger a close look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the end of the third car he came upon two suspicious-looking individuals, who were gazing at a bit of paper in the hands of one. Joe came closer and saw that the paper was a mining share.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Caven and Malone, as sure as fate!'' he murmured to himself. "What had I best do next?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Joe was trying to make up his mind, Caven chanced to glance up and his eyes fell upon our hero. He gave a cry of dismay and thrust the mining share out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What+'s the matter?'' asked Malone in a low tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look there, Pat! That boy!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it is!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did he get on this train?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. But it+'s unpleasant enough for us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you suppose Vane is around?'' asked Malone, nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He may be.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two men stared around the car. Only some women and children were present, the men having gone out to learn the cause of the delay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps we had better get out,'' went on Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They arose, and, satchel in hand, started to leave the train.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop!'' cried Joe, and caught Caven by the arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let go of me, boy!'' ejaculated the rascal, and tried to pull himself loose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't let go, Gaff Caven.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don't, it will be the worse for you! I am not to be trifled with!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must give up that satchel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bah!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don't, I+'m going to have you arrested.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is going to arrest me here?'' sneered the man who had robbed Maurice Vane. "Don't you know we are miles away from any town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care. Give up the satchel, or I+'ll call the train hands.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll give up nothing, boy! Stand out of my way!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gaff Caven gave Joe a violent shove which sent our hero up against a seat. Then he turned and ran from the car, with Pat Malone ahead of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop them!'' cried Joe, as soon as he could recover. "Stop the thieves!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Others took up the cry, but before anything could be done Caven and Malone were out of the car and on to the tracks. Both stared around in perplexity for a second.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on, we can't afford to waste time here!'' cried Caven, and ran for the bank of the cut, up which he scrambled hastily, with his confederate at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe saw them make the move and was not slow to follow. Near at hand was a tall, western young man, with bronzed features and a general outdoor manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say!'' cried our hero. "Will you help me to catch those two men? They are thieves and I want them arrested. If you+'ll help me catch them I+'ll pay you well for your trouble.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll go you, stranger!'' answered the western young man, readily. "You are certain of your game?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. That satchel has their plunder in it. They robbed a friend of mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This suits me then, friend. We+'ll round 'em up in short order.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time Caven and Malone had gained the woods. Looking back they saw Joe coming behind, accompanied by the westerner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He+'s after us, and he has got somebody to help him,'' ejaculated Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I reckon we can run as fast as they can,'' answered Gaff Caven. "Come ahead!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led the way along a trail that ran through the woods and came out on a winding country road. Beyond was another patch of timber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This way, Pat,'' said he. "We+'ll have to take to the woods again. They are too close for comfort.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't we climb a tree, or hide in a hollow?'' questioned the confederate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'ll see,'' said Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They pushed on harder than ever, and passed in among some tall trees. Then they came to a tree that was bent over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up you go,'' cried Caven, and gave his confederate a boost into the tree. Then he hauled himself up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now climb to the top,'' he went on, and Malone did as requested. Caven followed suit, and both hid themselves among the thick branches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They won't find us here,'' said Malone, after ten minutes had passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't make a noise,'' whispered Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After that they remained silent. From a great distance came a shouting, and the whistling of locomotives. The trees were being hauled from the car tracks. A little later they heard more whistling and then the two trains passed on their way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The trains have gone,'' whispered Malone. "Do you think the boy got aboard one of them?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't,'' answered his companion. "He is too determined a lad to give up so easily. He must be still looking for us.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII. FROM OUT OF A TREE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CAVEN was right, Joe and his newly-made friend were still in the woods, doing their best to locate the two rascals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had found the trail but lost it in the patch of tall timber, and were gazing around when they heard the trains leaving the cut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There goes our outfit, friend,'' said the westerner. "And there won't be another train along for several hours.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s too bad, but it can't be helped,'' answered our hero. "But I+'ll pay you for all time lost, Mr.—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Plain Bill Badger is my handle, stranger.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Joe Bodley.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What about these two varmin you are after?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They were trying to rob a friend of mine of some mining shares,'' answered Joe, and gave a few details.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I vow!'' cried Bill Badger "That mine is close to one my dad owns. They say it ain't of much account though.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Vane thinks it is valuable. He has had a mining expert go into the matter with great care.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then that+'s a different thing. Were you bound for the mine?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and so was Mr. Vane. We were on the train together when he was robbed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see. I was going out to my dad's mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then perhaps we can journey together— after we get through here,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m willing. I like your looks. Shake.'' And the pair shook hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although a westerner, Bill Badger knew no more about following a trail than did our hero, consequently they proceeded on their hunt with difficulty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Reckon we've missed 'em,'' said Bill Badger, a while latter. "Don't see hide nor hair of 'em anywhere.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s too bad if they got away,'' answered Joe. "Perhaps—What was that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cracking of a tree limb had reached their ears, followed by a cry of alarm. A limb upon which Pat Malone was standing had broken, causing the fellow to slip to another branch below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush! don't make so much noise!'' said Caven, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gosh! I thought I was going to tumble, out of the tree to the ground,'' gasped Malone, when he could catch his breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are coming—I can see them,'' whispered Gaff Caven. "Be as quiet as a mouse.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a moment more Joe and Bill Badger stood directly under the tree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think the noise came from near here,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agree,'' answered the westerner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment our hero looked up and saw a man's arm circling a tree limb far over his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are up there!'' he shouted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I just saw one of them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we've got 'em treed,'' came with a broad grin from Bill Badger. "What+'s the next turn of the game?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We have got to make them both prisoners.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Have you got a shooting iron?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I can get a club.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then do it, and I+'ll use this, if it+'s necessary,'' and the young westerner pulled a pistol from his hip pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish we had some ropes, with which to tie them,'' continued Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here+'s a good big handkerchief.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s an idea. My handkerchief is also good and strong.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You do the pow-wowing and I+'ll do the shooting, if it+'s necessary,'' said Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe looked up into the tree again but could see nobody.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Caven!'' he called out. "I know you are up there and I want you to come down.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this remark and request there was no reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don't come down we may begin to fire at you,'' went on our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, say, do you think he+'ll shoot?'' whispered Malone, in sudden alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; shut up!'' returned Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you coming down or not?'' went on Joe,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still there was no reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll give 'em a shot to warn 'em'' said Bill Badger, and fired into the air at random.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't shoot me!'' roared Pat Malone. "Please don't! I+'ll come down!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you come down first. Caven, you stay up there for the present.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After this there was a pause, and presently Pat Malone came down out of the tree looking sheepish enough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Up with your hands!'' cried Bill Badger, and confronted by the firearms the hands of the rascal went up in a hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Joe took his handkerchief and stepped up behind Malone. The hands were lowered and crossed and our hero tied them firmly together at the wrists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now back up to that tree yonder,'' said our hero. "And don't you dare to move.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll do just as you say,'' whined Malone. "Only don't shoot me.'' He was a coward at heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Caven, you come down!'' shouted Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think I care to,'' answered that rascal, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you don+'t come down I+'ll come up after you with my pistol,'' broke in Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I can do a little shooting myself,'' went on Gaff Caven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll risk that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More words followed, but in the end Caven thought it best to descend and did so. Yet his face still wore a look of defiance. He was compelled to turn around, and his hands were also tied behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I want those mining shares, Caven,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven+'t got them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is the satchel?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I threw it away when you started after me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down at the railroad tracks?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you believe that,'' broke in Bill Badger. "At least, not unless he emptied the satchel first.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Show me the way you came,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make him point out the satchel, or make him suffer,'' went on Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got an idea!'' cried our hero, suddenly. "Perhaps he left the satchel in the tree.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That+'s so. Well, if you want to climb up and look around, I+'ll watch the pair of 'em.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't let them get away.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If they try it, they+'ll go to the hospital or the graveyard,'' replied the western young man, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The satchel ain't in the tree,'' growled Caven, but his tone lacked positiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll soon know for certain,'' said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He climbed the tree with ease, having been used to such doings when living with the old hermit. As he went from branch to branch he kept his eyes open, and presently saw a bit of leather sticking out of a crotch. He worked his way over and soon had the satchel in his possession.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you making out?'' called up Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ve got it!'' shouted our hero, joyfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got the papers?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,—everything,'' said Joe, after a hasty examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hang the luck!'' muttered Gaff Caven, much chagrined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero was soon on the ground once more. Here he examined the contents of the satchel with care. Everything was there, and, locking the bag, he slung the strap over his shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, what+'s the next move?'' queried Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We ought to have these men locked up. How far is it to the nearest town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten or twelve miles, I reckon. I don't know much about the roads.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why can+'t you let us go?'' asked Malone. "You+'ve got what you want.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I let you go you+'ll be trying to make more trouble for Mr. Vane and myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't talk to them,'' growled Caven. "If you want to lock us up, do so!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was in an ugly humor and ready for a fight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We+'ll march 'em along,'' said Bill Badger, and so it was agreed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIX. THE FATE OF TWO EVILDOERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"ARE YOU going to let them arrest us?'' whispered Pat Malone, as the whole party moved through the woods towards a wagon road which ran nearly parallel to the railroad tracks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not if I can help it,'' Caven whispered back. "We must watch our chances.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Half a mile was covered and they came out on the road. It was growing dark and there were signs of a storm in the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s going to rain,'' said Joe, and he was right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, I don't want to get wet to the skin,'' growled Caven. "I+'ll catch my death of cold.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is a barn just ahead,'' said Bill Badger. "Let us get inside.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was willing, and soon all were in the barn. It was now raining at a heavy rate and they were glad to be under shelter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With a barn there ought to be a house,'' remarked our hero. "But I don't see any.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It grew still darker, and the rain came down in perfect sheets. The roof of the barn leaked, and they had to move from one spot to another, to keep out of the drippings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While this was going on Gaff Caven was working at the handkerchief that bound his wrists and soon had it loose. Pat Malone also liberated himself. Caven winked suggestively at his confederate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Watch me,'' he whispered. "When I give the signal we'+ll knock 'em both down and run for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But the pistol—'' began Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll take care of that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In moving around the old barn Caven spotted a club and moved close to it. Suddenly he snatched the weapon up and hit Bill Badger on the arm with it. The pistol flew into a corner and went off, sending a bullet into a board.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Run!'' yelled Caven, and leaped for the open doorway. Malone came beside him, and both ran off through the rain as fast as their legs could carry them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe was startled and made after the pair. But at a groan from Bill Badger he paused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you badly hurt?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He gave me a stiff crack on the arm,'' growled the young westerner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe ran for the corner and caught up the pistol. Then he leaped for the open doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop, both of you!'' he called out. "Stop, or I+'ll fire!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare!'' shrieked Pat Malone, and ran faster than ever, behind the nearest of the trees. Joe aimed the weapon, but before he could pull the trigger both of the bad men were out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go after them, if you want to,'' said Bill Badger. "I+'ll go too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not badly hurt?'' queried our hero, sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but if I catch that fellow I+'ll give it to him good,'' grumbled the young westerner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both now left the barn and made after Caven and Malone. Once they caught sight of the rascals, moving in the direction of the railroad tracks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are going to catch a train if they can!'' cried our hero. "I hear one coming.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s a freight most likely,'' was Bill Badger's answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was right, and soon the long line of freight cars hove into sight around a bend and on an upgrade. Far in the distance they beheld Caven and Malone scooting for the train with all speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are going to make it,'' sighed Joe. "Too bad!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They continued to run, but before they could get anywhere near the tracks they saw Caven leap for the train and get between two of the cars. Then Malone got aboard also, and the freight train passed out of sight through the cut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That ends the chase,'' said Joe, halting. "They were slick to get away.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If we only knew where they would get off we could send word ahead,'' suggested his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we don't know, and after this they will probably keep their eyes wide open and keep out of sight as much as possible. Any- way, I don't think they+'ll bother Mr. Vane any more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It+'s not likely. I+'m a witness to what they were up to,'' answered the young westerner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both Joe and Bill Badger were soaked from the rain and resolved to strike out for the nearest farmhouse or village. They kept along the railroad tracks, and presently came to a shanty where there was a track-walker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far to the nearest village?'' asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Half a mile.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How is it you are out here in the rain?'' went on the track-walker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We got off our train and it went off without us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I see. Too bad.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again our hero and his companion hurried on, and soon came in sight of a small village. They inquired their way to a tavern, and there dried their clothing and procured a good, hot meal, which made both feel much better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to send a telegram to Mr. Vane,'' said Joe, and did so without further delay. He was careful of the satchel and did not leave it out of his sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They found they could get a train for the West that evening at seven o'clock and at the proper time hurried to the depot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m glad I met you,'' said Joe, to his newly-made friend. "Now, what do you think I owe you for what you did?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As we did+n't land the fellows in jail you don't owe me anything,'' said Bill Badger, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well then, you can pay the extra expense, and let that fill the bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'ll certainly do that,'' said Joe, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they rode along Bill Badger told something of himself and of the mine his father owned, and then Joe told something of his own story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you say your name is Joe Bodley?'' asked the young westerner, with deep interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you are looking for a man by the name of William A. Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me I know a man by that name, although the miners all call him Bill Bodley.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is this Bill Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Out in Montana somewhere. He worked for my father once, about three years ago. He was rather a strange man, about fifty years old. He had white hair and a white beard, and acted as if he had great trouble on his mind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You do not know where he is now?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but perhaps my father knows.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I+'m going to see your father as soon as I can,'' said Joe, decidedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind you, I don't say that this Bill Bodley is the man you are after, Joe. I don't want to raise any false hopes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever hear where the man came from?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think he told somebody that he once owned a farm in Kansas or Iowa.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This William A. Bodley once owned a farm at Millville, Iowa.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that so! Then he may be the same man after all. To tell the truth, he looked a little bit like you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was he a good man?'' asked Joe, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, indeed. But some of the men poked fun at him because he was so silent and strange at times. I liked him and so did father. He left us to go prospecting in the mountains.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus the talk ran on for half an hour, when the train came to a sudden halt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are we at a station?'' asked Bill Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both looked out of the window but could see nothing except hills and forests.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are in the foothills,'' said the young westerner.'' "Something must be wrong on the tracks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"More fallen trees perhaps.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Or a landslide. They have them sometimes, when it rains as hard as it did to-day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They left the car with some others and soon learned that there had been a freight collision ahead and that half a dozen freight cars had been smashed to splinters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think it can be the freight that Caven and Malone boarded?'' came from our hero, on hearing this news.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It might be,'' answered Bill Badger. "Let us take a look. Our train won't move for hours now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They walked to the scene of the wreck. One of the cars had been burnt up but the conflagration was now under control and a wrecking crew was already at work clearing the tracks so that they might be used.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anybody hurt?'' asked Joe of a train hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, two men killed. They were riding between the cars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tramps?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They did+n't look like tramps. But they had+n't any right to ride on the freight.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are they?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over in the shanty yonder.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a queer sensation in his heart Joe walked to the little building, accompanied by Bill Badger. A curious crowd was around and they had to force their way to the front.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One look was enough. Gaff Caven and Pat Malone lay there, cold in death. They had paid the penalty of their crimes on earth and gone to the final judgment.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXX. CONCLUSION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"LET US go away!'' whispered Joe, and moved out of the gathering without delay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was sure rough on 'em,'' was Bill Badger's comment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it was awful!'' cried our hero. I—I did+n't expect this, did you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody did. It must have come sudden like on to 'em.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It makes me sick at heart to think of it. I—I hope it was+n't our fault.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all. If they had+n't broke away they'd be alive this minute. They+'ll never bother you or your friend again, Joe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero felt weak at the knees and was glad enough to go back to the train, where he sank into his seat. He scarcely said another word until the wreck was cleared away and they were once more on their journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon you are glad you got the satchel before this happened,'' remarked Bill Badger, when they were preparing to retire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. But I—I wish they had gotten away. It+'s awful to think they are dead—and with such bad doings to heir credit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe did not sleep very well and he was up early in the morning and out on the rear platform, drinking in the fresh air. He felt as if he had passed through some fearful nightmare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you like this climate?'' asked Bill Badger, as he came out. "Ain't it just glorious?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It certainly is,'' said Joe, and he remembered what Ned had told him. "I don't wonder some folks like it better than the East.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, the East can't compare to it,'' answered Bill Badger. "Why I was once down to New York and Boston, and the crowd and confusion and smoke and smells made me sick for a week! Give me the pure mountain air every time!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The day proved a pleasant one and when he did not remember the tragedy that had occurred our hero enjoyed the ride and the wild scenery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last Golden Pass was reached, late at night, and they got off in a crowd of people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Joe!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Vane!'' was the answering cry, and soon the two were shaking hands. "Let me introduce a new friend, Mr. Bill Badger.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad to know you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Badger helped me get back your satchel,'' went on our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I am deeply indebted to him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In that case, just drop the mister from my name,'' drawled the young westerner. "Joe tells me you have a mine up here. My father has one, too—the Mary Jennie, next to the Royal Flush.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I know the mine, and I have met your father,'' said Maurice Vane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They walked to a hotel, and there Joe and his young western friend told their stories, to which Maurice Vane listened with keen interest. The gentleman was shocked to learn of the sudden death of Caven and Malone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was certainly a sad ending for them,'' said he. "But, as Badger says, they had nobody but themselves to blame for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Vane was extremely glad to get back his mining shares and thanked Bill Badger warmly for what he had done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don+'t you mention it,'' said the young westerner. "I+'m going to hunt up dad now. When you get time, call and see us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I+'m coming up soon, to find out about that Bill Bodley,'' said Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As late as it was Joe listened to what Maurice Vane had to tell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now that Caven and Malone are gone I do not anticipate further trouble at the mine,'' said the gentleman. "I am in practical possession of all the shares, and shall have a clear title to the whole property inside of a few weeks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Joe told him what Bill Badger had had to say about a certain man called Bill Bodley he was much interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you must find out about this man at once,'' said he. "I will help you, as soon as certain matters are settled.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning proved a busy one and Joe got no time to call upon Bill Badger's father. He visited the mine and looked over it with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the middle of the afternoon he went back to town on an errand for Mr. Vane. He was passing a cabin on the outskirts when he heard loud words and a struggle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me go, you ruffian!'' cried a weak voice. Leave that money alone!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You shut up, old man!'' was the answer. "The money is all right.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are trying to rob me!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then there was another struggle, and suddenly a door burst open and a man leaped into the roadway. At sight of him Joe came to a halt. The fellow was Bill Butts, the man who had tried to swindle Josiah Bean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop him!'' came from the cabin. "He has my gold!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop!'' cried Joe, and ran up to Butts. The next moment man and boy tripped and fell, but, luckily, our hero was on top.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me go!'' growled the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So we meet again, Butts!'' cried Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man stared in amazement and then began to struggle. Seeing this, Joe doubled up his fists and gave him a blow in the nose and in the right eye, which caused him to roar with pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That+'s right!'' came from the doorway of the cabin. "Give it to him! Make him give me my gold!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give up the gold,'' ordered Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There it is!'' growled Bill Butts, and threw a buckskin bag towards the cabin. The man from within caught it up and stowed it away in his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I call a policeman?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know,'' said the man from the cabin. He wore a troubled face and had white hair and a white beard. "It may be—Wha— where did you come from?'' he gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did I come from?'' asked Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes! yes! Answer me quickly! You are —you must be a ghost! I saw you in my dreams last week!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand you,'' said Joe, and arose slowly to his feet, at which Bill Butts did likewise and began to retreat. "I never met you before.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No? It+'s queer.'' The man brushed his hand over his forehead. Yes, I must be dreaming. But I am glad I got my gold back.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I, but the rascal has run away.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind, let him go.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think you+'ve seen me before?'' questioned Joe, and his breath came thick and fast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—er—I don't know. You must+n't mind me—I have queer spells at times. You see, I had a whole lot of trouble once, and when I get to thinking about it—'' The man did not finish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I ask your name?'' asked Joe, and his voice trembled in spite of his efforts at self-control.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure you can. It+'s Bill Bodley.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"William A. Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. But how do you happen to know my full name?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you once own a farm in Millville, Iowa?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had a farm in Iowa, yes. It was Millville Center in those days.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe drew closer and looked at the man with care and emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever have a brother named Hiram Bodley?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did—but he has been dead for years.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Hiram Bodley died only a short time ago,'' answered Joe. "I used to live with him. My name is Joe Bodley. He told me I was his nephew.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You his nephew! Hiram Bodley's nephew! We did+n't have any brothers or sisters, and he was a bachelor!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know he was a bachelor. But I don't know—'' Joe paused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He told me Joe died, at least I got a letter from somebody to that effect. But I was near crazy just then, and I can't remember exactly how it was. I lost my wife and two children and then I guess I about lost my mind for a spell. I sold out, and the next thing I knew I was roving around the mountains and in rags. Then I took to mining, and now I+'ve got a mine of my own, up yonder in the mountains. Come in and talk this over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Joe entered the cabin and sat down, and William Bodley plied him with questions, all of which he answered to the best of his ability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There was a blue tin box I had,'' said he, presently, "that contained some documents that were mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A blue tin box!'' ejaculated Joe. "Hiram Bodley had it and it got lost. I found it a long time afterwards and some parts of the documents were destroyed. I have the rest in my suit case at the hotel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I see those papers?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you are my son, Joe?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps I am, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went to the hotel, and the documents were produced. Then William Bodley brought out some letters he possessed. Man and boy went over everything with care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must be my son!'' cried William Bodley. "Thank heaven you are found!'' And they shook hands warmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He told Joe to move over to the cabin, and our hero did so. It was a neat and clean place and soon Joe felt at home. Then he heard his father's tale in detail—an odd and wonderful story—of great trials and hardship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There will always be something of a mystery about this,'' said William Bodley. "But, no matter, so long as I have you with me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Hiram was a queer stick,'' answered Joe. "I suppose if he was alive he could explain many things.'' And in this Joe was correct.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let us add a few words more and then draw our tale to a close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Joe told Maurice Vane how he had found a father the gentlemen was much astonished. So were the Badgers, but all were glad matters had ended so well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was found that William Bodley's mine was a valuable one. The ore in it was about equal to the ore in the mine owned by Maurice Vane, and this was likewise equal to that in the mine run by Mr. Badger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After some conversation on the subject it was agreed by all the interested parties to form a new company, embracing all the mines. Of the shares of this new concern, one-third went to Maurice Vane, one-third to the Badgers, and one-third to William Bodley and Joe. The necessary machinery was duly installed, and to-day the new company is making money fast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the day after his trouble with Mr. Bodley, Bill Butts disappeared from town. But a week later he was arrested in Denver and sent to jail for two years for swindling a ranchman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the following summer Joe received a visit from his old friend Ned, and the two boys had a delightful time together. In the meantime Joe spent half of his time at the mine and half over his books, for he was determined to get a good education.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a long time William Bodley had been in feeble health, but with the coming of Joe on the scene he began to mend rapidly, and was soon as hale and hearty as anybody. He was an expert miner, and was made general superintendent for the new company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-day Joe has a good education and is rich, but come what may, it is not likely that he will forget those days when he was known as "Joe the Hotel Boy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE END.</field>
