      <field name="fulltext">Lucie, a little girl, asks Tabby Kitten if she has seen her pocket-handkins</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town. She was a good little girl—only she was always losing her pocket- handkerchiefs!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying— oh, she did cry so! “I've lost my pocket-handkin! Three handkins and a pinny! Have you seen them, Tabby Kitten?” Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sally Henny-penny, has you found three pocket-handkins?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!” On the farm, Lucie asks roosters and chickens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little girl, Lucie, in a pastoral scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little-town-a hill that goes up—up—into the clouds as though it had no top!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass. Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LUCIE scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way—up and up—until Little—town was right away down below—she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney! Lucie, the little girl, in a mountain setting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A lush grotto with a stream, flowers, and a tin-can.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRESENTLY she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water—but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! And where the sand upon the path was wet—there were foot-marks of a very small person.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lucie ran on, and on. Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE path ended under a big rock. The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins—but no pocket-handkerchiefs!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there was something else—a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing— “Lily-white and clean, oh! With little frills between, oh! Smooth and hot-red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!” Lucie, the little girl, sees a door in the mountain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lucie opens the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LUCIE, knocked—once— twice, and interrupted the song. A little frightened voice called out “Who's that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?—a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams—just like any other farm kitchen. Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there. Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap—where Lucie had yellow curls—that little person had PRICKLES! Lucie sees Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, dressed in a bonnet and ironing lots of clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, grins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHO are you?” said Lucie. “Have you seen my pocket-handkins?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little person made a bob-curtsey—“Oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!” And she took something out of a clothes- basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket. Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHAT'S that thing?” said Lucie—“that's not my pocket-handkin?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side. Lucie, the little girl, and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, chat while Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, irons clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, drapes ironed clothes on a clothes-hanger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN she took something else off a clothes-horse— “That isn't my pinny?” said Lucie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! It's very bad to wash!” said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle. Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. TIGGY-WINKLE'S nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, fetches another hot iron from the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, irons Lucie's pocket-handkins and shows them to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE'S one of my pocket-handkins!” cried Lucie—“and there's my pinny!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh that is lovely!” said Lucie. Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“AND what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny- penny—look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! She'll very soon go barefoot!” said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, shows Lucie some long and ugly socks that belong to Sally Henny-penny, the chicken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, and Lucie, the little girl, look at clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHY, there's another handkersniff—but it isn't mine; it's red?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out the smell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's another one of mine,” said Lucie. Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHAT are those funny little white things?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's my last pocket- handkin!” said Lucie. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, pulls clothes out of a basket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, an iron, and a basin of starch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“AND what are you dipping into the basin of starch?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They're little dicky shirt- fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse —most terrible particular!” said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. “Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes.” Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHAT are these dear soft fluffy things?” said Lucie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh those are wooly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will their jackets take off?” asked Lucy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Littletown. They're always marked at washing!” said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, pulls sheep-wool coats off of her drying line to show Lucie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, hangs wet clothes on a drying line.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes— small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole- skin waist-coat; and a red tail- coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing —and at last the basket was empty! Illustration of text-page.Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea—a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie. They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, and Lucie, the little girl, have tea on a bench.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, and Lucie, the little girl outside with bundles of clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill. Illustration of text-page.Illustration of text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny! Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, and Lucie, the little girl giving clothes to bunnies on a garden path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, hands clothes to mice, and birds with a nice mountain and lake view behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SO that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle. Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, and Lucie, the little girl, conversing as they walk arm-in-arm through the woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of text-page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LUCIE scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say “Good-night,” and to thank the washer-woman— But what a very odd thing! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was running running running up the hill—and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown—and her petticoat? Lucie, the little girl, looking dumbfounded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, the hedgehog, runs off naked through the underbrush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Illustration of final page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND how small she had grown—and how brown —and covered with PRICKLES!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* * * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile—but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And besides— I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells— and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)</field>
