      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTORY FAVOUR'D by Heav'n are those, ordain'd to taste The bliss supreme that kindles fancy's fire; Whose magic fingers sweep the muses' lyre, In varying cadence, eloquently chaste! Well may the mind, with tuneful numbers grac'd, To Fame's immortal attributes aspire, Above the treach'rous spells of low desire, That wound the sense, by vulgar joys debas'd. For thou, blest POESY! with godlike pow'rs To calm the miseries of man wert giv'n; When passion rends, and hopeless love devours, By mem'ry goaded, and by frenzy driv'n, 'Tis thine to guide him 'midst Elysian bow'rs, And shew his fainting soul,—a glimpse of Heav'n.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II. HIGH on a rock, coaeval with the skies, A Temple stands, rear'd by immortal pow'rs To Chastity divine! ambrosial flow'rs Twining round icicles, in columns rise, Mingling with pendent gems of orient dyes! Piercing the air, a golden crescent tow'rs, Veil'd by transparent clouds; while smiling hours Shake from their varying wings—celestial joys! The steps of spotless marble, scatter'd o'er With deathless roses arm'd with many a thorn, Lead to the altar. On the frozen floor, Studded with tear-drops petrified by scorn, Pale vestals kneel the Goddess to adore, While Love, his arrows broke, retires forlorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III TURN to yon vale beneath, whose tangled shade Excludes the blazing torch of noon-day light, Where sportive Fawns, and dimpled Loves invite, The bow'r of Pleasure opens to the glade: Lull'd by soft flutes, on leaves of violets laid, There witching beauty greets the ravish'd sight, More gentle than the arbitress of night In all her silv'ry panoply array'd! The birds breathe bliss! light zephyrs kiss the ground, Stealing the hyacinth's divine perfume; While from the pellucid fountains glitt'ring round, Small tinkling rills bid rival flow'rets bloom! HERE, laughing Cupids bathe the bosom's wound; THERE, tyrant passion finds a glorious tomb!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV WHY, when I gaze on Phaon's beauteous eyes, Why does each thought in wild disorder stray? Why does each fainting faculty decay, And my chill'd breast in throbbing tumults rise? Mute, on the ground my Lyre neglected lies, The Muse forgot, and lost the melting lay; My down-cast looks, my faultering lips betray, That stung by hopeless passion,—Sappho dies! Now, on a bank of Cypress let me rest; Come, tuneful maids, ye pupils of my care, Come, with your dulcet numbers soothe my breast; And, as the soft vibrations float on air, Let pity waft my spirit to the blest, To mock the barb'rous triumphs of despair!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V O! How can LOVE exulting Reason queil! How fades each nobler passion from his gaze! E'en Fame, that cherishes the Poet's lays, That fame, ill-fated Sappho lov'd so well. Lost is the wretch, who in his fatal spell Wastes the short Summer of delicious days, And from the tranquil path of wisdom strays, In passion's thorny wild, forlorn to dwell. O ye! who in that sacred Temple smile Where holy Innocence resides enshrin'd; Who fear not sorrow, and who know not guile, Each thought compos'd, and ev'ry wish resign'd; Tempt not the path where pleasure's flow'ry wile In sweet, but pois'nous fetters, holds the mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI IS it to love, to fix the tender gaze, To hide the timid blush, and steal away; To shun the busy world, and waste the day In some rude mountain's solitary maze? Is it to chant one name in ceaseless lays, To hear no words that other tongues can say, To watch the pale moon's melancholy ray, To chide in fondness, and in folly praise? Is it to pour th' involuntary sigh, To dream of bliss, and wake new pangs to prove; To talk, in fancy, with the speaking eye, Then start with jealousy, and wildly rove; Is it to loathe the light, and wish to die? For these I feel,—and feel that they are Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII COME, Reason, come! each nerve rebellious bind, Lull the fierce tempest of my fev'rish soul; Come, with the magic of thy meek controul, And check the wayward wand'rings of my mind: Estrang'd from thee, no solace can I find, O'er my rapt brain, where pensive visions stole, Now passion reigns and stormy tumults roll— So the smooth Sea obeys the furious wind! In vain Philosophy unfolds his store, O'erwhelm'd is ev'ry source of pure delight; Dim is the golden page of wisdom's lore; All nature fades before my sick'ning sight: For what bright scene can fancy's eye explore, 'Midst dreary labyrinths of mental night?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII WHY, through each aching vein, with lazy pace Thus steals the languid fountain of my heart, While, from its source, each wild convulsive start Tears the scorch'd roses from my burning face? In vain, O Lesbian Vales! your charms I trace; Vain is the poet's theme, the sculptor's art; No more the Lyre its magic can impart, Though wak'd to sound, with more than mortal grace! Go, tuneful maids, go bid my Phaon prove That passion mocks the empty boast of fame; Tell him no joys are sweet, but joys of love, Melting the soul, and thrilling all the frame! Oh! may th'ecstatic thought in bosom move, And sighs of rapture, fan the blush of shame!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX YE, who in alleys green and leafy bow'rs, Sport, the rude children of fantastic birth; Where frolic nymphs, and shaggy tribes of mirth, In clam'rous revels waste the midnight hours; Who, link'd in flaunting bands of mountain flow'rs, Weave your wild mazes o'er the dewy earth, Ere the fierce Lord of Lustre rushes forth, And o'er the world his beamy radiance pours! Oft has your clanking cymbal's madd'ning strain, Loud ringing through the torch-illumin'd grove, Lur'd my lov'd Phaon from the youthful train, Through rugged dells, o'er craggy rocks to rove; Then how can she his vagrant heart detain, Whose Lyre throbs only to the touch of Love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X DANG'ROUS to hear, is that melodious tongue, And fatal to the sense those murd'rous eyes, Where in a sapphire sheath, Love's arrow lies, Himself conceal'd the crystal haunts among! Oft o'er that form, enamour'd have I hung, On that smooth cheek to mark the deep'ning dyes, While from that lip the fragrant breath would rise, That lip, like Cupid's bow with rubies strung! Still let me gaze upon that polish'd brow, O'er which the golden hair luxuriant plays; So, on the modest lily's leaves of snow The proud Sun revels in resplendent rays! Warm as his beams this sensate heart shall glow, Till life's last hour, with Phaon's self decays!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI O! Reason! vaunted Sovreign of the mind! Thou pompous vision with a sounding name! Can'st thou, the soul's rebellious passions tame! Can'st thou in spells the vagrant fancy bind? Ah, no! capricious as the wav'ring wind, Are sighs of Love that dim thy boasted flame, While Folly's torch consumes the wreath of fame, And Pleasure's hands the sheaves of truth unbind. Press'd by the storms of Fate, hope shrinks and dies; Frenzy darts forth in mightiest ills array'd; Around thy throne destructive tumults rise, And hell-fraught jealousies, thy rights invade! Then, what art thou? O! Idol of the wise! A visionary theme!—a gorgeous shade!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII NOW, o'er the tessellated pavement strew Fresh saffron, steep'd in essence of the rose, While down yon agate column gently flows A glitt'ring streamlet of ambrosial dew! My Phaon smiles! the rich carnation's hue, On his flush'd cheek in conscious lustre glows, While o'er his breast enamour'd Venus throws Her starry mantle of celestial blue! Breathe soft, ye dulcet flutes, among the trees Where clust'ring boughs with golden citron twine; While slow vibrations, dying on the breeze, Shall soothe his soul with harmony divine! Then let my form his yielding fancy seize, And all his fondest wishes, blend with mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIII BRING, bring to deck my brow, ye Sylvan girls, A roseate wreath; nor for my waving hair The costly band of studded gems prepare, Of sparkling crysolite or orient pearls: Love, o'er my head his canopy unfurls, His purple pinions fan the whisp'ring air; Mocking the golden sandal, rich and rare, Beneath my feet the fragrant woodbine curls. Bring the thin robe, to fold about my breast, White as the downy swan; while round my waist Let leaves of glossy myrtle bind the vest, Not idly gay, but elegantly chaste! Love scorns the nymph in wanton trappings drest; And charms the most concealed, are doubly grac'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIV COME, soft Aeolian harp, while zephyr plays Along the meek vibration of thy strings, As twilight's hand her modest mantle brings, Blending with sober grey, the western blaze! O! prompt my Phaon's dreams with tend'rest lays, Ere night o'er shade thee with its humid wings, While the lorn Philomel his sorrow sings In leafy cradle, red with parting rays! Slow let thy dulcet tones on ether glide, So steals the murmur of the am'rous dove; The mazy legions swarm on ev'ry side, To lulling sounds the sunny people move! Let not the wise their little world deride, The smallest sting can wound the breast of Love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XV NOW, round my favor'd grot let roses rise, To strew the bank where Phaon wakes from rest; O! happy buds! to kiss his burning breast, And die, beneath the lustre of his eyes! Now, let the timbrels echo to the skies, Now damsels sprinkel cassia on his vest, With od'rous wreaths of constant myrtle drest, And flow'rs, deep tinted with the rainbow's dyes! From cups of porphyry let nectar flow, Rich as the perfume of Phoenicia's vine! Now let his dimpling cheek with rapture glow, While round his heart love's mystic fetters twine; And let the Grecian Lyre its aid bestow, In songs of triumph, to proclaim him mine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVI DELUSIVE Hope! more transient than the ray That leads pale twilight to her dusky bed, O'er woodland glen, or breezy mountain's head, Ling'ring to catch the parting sigh of day. Hence with thy visionary charms, away! Nor o'er my path the flow'rs of fancy spread; Thy airy dreams on peaceful pillows shed, And weave for thoughtless brows, a garland gay. Farewell low vallies; dizzy cliffs, farewell! Small vagrant rills that murmur as ye flow: Dark bosom'd labyrinth and thorny dell; The task be mine all pleasures to forego; To hide, where meditation loves to dwell, And feed my soul, with luxury of woe!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVII Love steals unheeded o'er the tranquil mind, As Summer breezes fan the sleeping main, Slow through each fibre creeps the subtle pain, 'Till closely round the yielding bosom twin'd. Vain is the hope the magic to unbind, The potent mischief riots in the brain, Grasps ev'ry thought, and burns in ev'ry vein, 'Till in the heart the Tyrant lives enshrin'd. Oh! Victor strong! bending the vanquish'd frame; Sweet is the thraldom that thou bid'st us prove! And sacred is the tear thy victims claim, For blest are those whom sighs of sorrow move! Then nymphs beware how ye profane my name, Nor blame my weakness, till like me ye love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XVIII WHY art thou chang'd? O Phaon! tell me why? Love flies reproach, when passion feels decay; Or, I would paint the raptures of that day, When, in sweet converse, mingling sigh with sigh, I mark'd the graceful languor of thine eye As on a shady bank entranc'd we lay: O! Eyes! whose beamy radiance stole away As stars fade trembling from the burning sky! Why art thou chang'd? dear source of all my woes! Though dark my bosom's tint, through ev'ry vein A ruby tide of purest lustre flows, Warm'd by thy love, or chill'd by thy disdain; And yet no bliss this sensate Being knows; Ah! why is rapture so allied to pain?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XIX FAREWELL, ye coral caves, ye pearly sands, Ye waving woods that crown yon lofty steep; Farewell, ye Nereides of the glitt'ring deep, Ye mountain tribes, ye fawns, ye sylvan bands: On the bleak rock your frantic minstrel stands, Each task forgot, save that, to sigh and weep; In vain the strings her burning fingers sweep, No more her touch, the Grecian Lyre commands! In Circe's cave my faithless Phaon's laid, Her daemons dress his brow with opiate flow'rs; Or, loit'ring in the brown pomgranate shade, Beguile with am'rous strains the fateful hours; While Sappho's lips, to paly ashes fade, And sorrow's cank'ring worm her heart devours!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XX OH! I could toil for thee o'er burning plains; Could smile at poverty's disastrous blow; With thee, could wander 'midst a world of snow, Where one long night o'er frozen Scythia reigns. Sever'd from thee, my sick'ning soul disdains The thrilling thought, the blissful dream to know, And can'st thou give my days to endless woe, Requiting sweetest bliss with cureless pains? Away, false fear! nor think capricious fate Would lodge a daemon in a form divine! Sooner the dove shall seek a tyger mate, Or the soft snow-drop round the thistle twine; Yet, yet, I dread to hope, nor dare to hate, Too proud to sue! too tender to resign!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXI WHY do I live to loath the cheerful day, To shun the smiles of Fame, and mark the hours On tardy pinions move, while ceaseless show'rs Down my wan cheek in lucid currents stray? My tresses all abound, nor gems display, Nor scents Arabian! on my path no flow'rs Imbibe the morn's resuscitating pow'rs, For one blank sorrow, saddens all my way! As slow the radiant Sun of reason rose, Through tears my dying parents saw it shine; A brother's frailties, swell'd the tide of woes,- And, keener far, maternal griefs were mine! Phaon! if soon these weary eyes shall close, Oh! must that task, that mournful task, be thine?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXII WILD is the foaming Sea! The surges roar! And nimbly dart the livid lightnings round! On the rent rock the angry waves rebound; Ah me! the less'ning bark is seen no more! Along the margin of the trembling shore, Loud as the blast my frantic cries shall sound, My storm-drench'd limbs the flinty fragments wound, And o'er my bleeding breast the billows pour! Phaon! return! ye winds, O! waft the strain To his swift bark; ye barb'rous waves forbear! Taunt not the anguish of a lover's brain, Nor feebly emulate the soul's despair! For howling winds, and foaming seas, in vain Assail the breast, when passion rages there!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIII TO AEtna's scorching sands my Phaon flies! False Youth! can other charms attractive prove? Say, can Sicilian loves thy passions move, Play round thy heart, and fix thy fickle eyes, While in despair the Lesbian Sappho dies? Has Spring for thee a crown of poppies wove, Or dost thou languish in th' Idalian grove, Whose altar kindles, fann'd by Lover's sighs? Ah! think, that while on AEtna's shores you stray, A fire, more fierce than AEtna's, fills my breast; Nor deck Sicilian nymphs with garlands gay, While Sappho's brows with cypress wreaths are drest; Let one kind word my weary woes repay, Or, in eternal slumbers bid them rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIV O THOU! meek Orb! that stealing o'er the dale Cheer'st with thy modest beams the noon of night! On the smooth lake diffusing silv'ry light, Sublimely still, and beautifully pale! What can thy cool and placid eye avail, Where fierce despair absorbs the mental sight, While inbred glooms the vagrant thoughts invite, To tempt the gulph where howling fiends assail? O, Night! all nature owns thy temper'd pow'r; Thy solemn pause, thy dews, thy pensive beam; Thy sweet breath whisp'ring in the moonlight bow'r, While fainting flow'rets kiss the wand'ring stream! Yet, vain is ev'ry charm! and vain the hour, That brings to madd'ning love, no soothing dream!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXV CAN'ST thou forget, O! Idol of my Soul! Thy Sappho's voice, her form, her dulcet Lyre! That melting ev'ry thought to fond desire, Bade sweet delerium o'er thy senses roll? Can'st thou, so soon, renounce the blest control That calm'd with pity's tears love's raging fire, While Hope, slow breathing on the trembling wire, In every note with soft persuasion stole? Oh! Sov'reign of my heart! return! return! For me no spring appears, no summers bloom, No Sun-beams glitter, and no altars burn! The mind's dark winter of eternal gloom, Shews 'midst the waste a solitary urn, A blighted laurel, and a mould'ring tomb!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVI WHERE antique woods o'er-hang the mountains's crest, And mid-day glooms in solemn silence lour; Philosophy, go seek a lonely bow'r, And waste life's fervid noon in fancied rest. Go, where the bird of sorrow weaves her nest, Cooing, in sadness sweet, through night's dim hour; Go, cull the dew-drops from each potent flow'r That med'cines to the cold and reas'ning breast! Go, where the brook in liquid lapse steals by, Scarce heard amid'st the mingling echoes round, What time, the noon fades slowly down the sky, And slumb'ring zephyrs moan, in caverns bound: Be these thy pleasures, dull Philosophy! Nor vaunt the balm, to heal a lover's wound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVII OH! ye bright Stars! that on the Ebon fields Of Heav'n's empire, trembling seems to stand; 'Till rosy morn unlocks her portal bland, Where the proud Sun his fiery banner wields! To flames, less fierce than mine, your lustre yields, And pow'rs more strong my countless tears command; Love strikes the feeling heart with ruthless hand, And only spares the breast which dullness shields! Since, then, capricious nature but bestows The fine affections of the soul, to prove A keener sense of desolating woes, Far, far from me the empty boast remove; If bliss from coldness, pain from passion flows, Ah! who would wish to feel, or learn to love?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXVIII WEAK is the sophistry, and vain the art That whispers patience to the mind's despair! That bids reflection bathe the wounds of care, While Hope, with pleasing phantoms, soothes their smart. For mem'ry still, reluctant to depart From the dear spot, once rich in prospects fair, Bids the fond soul enamour'd there, And its least charm is grateful to the heart! He never lov'd, who could not muse and sigh, Spangling the sacred turf with frequent tears, Where the small rivulet, that ripples by, Recalls the scenes of past and happier years, When, on its banks he watch'd the speaking eye, And one sweet smile o'erpaid an age of fears!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXIX FAREWELL, ye tow'ring Cedars, in whose shade, Lull'd by the Nightingale, I sunk to rest, While spicy breezes hover'd o'er my breast To fan my cheek, in deep'ning tints array'd; While am'rous insects, humming round me, play'd, Each flow'r forsook, of prouder sweets in quest; Of glowing lips, in humid fragrance drest, That mock'd the Sunny Hybla's vaunted aid! Farewell, ye limpid rivers! Oh! farewell! No more shall Sappho to your grots repair; No more your white waves to her bosom swell, Or your dank weeds, entwine her floating hair; As erst, when Venus in her sparry cell Wept, to behold a brighter goddess there!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXX O'ER the tall cliff that bounds the billowy main Shad'wing the surge that sweeps the lonely strand, While the thin vapours break along the sand, Day's harbinger unfolds the liquid plain. The rude Sea murmurs, mournful as the strain That love-lorn minstrels strike with trembling hand, While from their green beds rise the Syren band With tongues aerial to repeat my pain! The vessel rocks beside the pebbly shore, The foamy curls its gaudy trappings lave; Oh! Bark propitious! bear me gently o'er, Breathe soft, ye winds; rise slow, O! swelling wave! Lesbos; these eyes shall meet thy sands no more: I fly, to seek my Lover, or my Grave!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXI FAR o'er the waves my lofty Bark shall glide, Love's frequent sighs the flutt'ring sails shall swell, While to my native home I bid farewell, Hope's snowy hand the burnis'd helm shall guide! Triton's shall sport admidst the yielding tide, Myriads of Cupids round the prow shall dwell, And Venus, thron'd within her opal shell, Shall proudly o'er the glitt'ring billows ride! Young Dolphins, dashing in the golden spray, Shall with their scaly forms illume the deep Ting'd with the purple flush of sinking day, Whose flaming wreath shall crown the distant steep; While on the breezy deck soft minstrels play, And songs of love, the lover soothe to sleep!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXII BLEST as the Gods! Sicilian Maid is he, The youth whose soul thy yielding graces charm; Who bound, O! thraldom sweet! by beauty's arm, In idle dalliance fondly sports with thee! Blest as the Gods! that iv'ry throne to see, Throbbing with transports, tender, timid, warm! While round thy fragrant lips zephyrs swarm! As op'ning buds attract the wand'ring Bee! Yet, short is youthful passion's fervid hour; Soon, shall another clasp the beauteous boy; Soon, shall a rival prove, in that gay bow'r, The pleasing torture of excessive joy! The Bee flies sicken'd from the sweetest flow'r; The lightning's shaft, but dazzles to destroy!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIII I WAKE! delusive phantoms hence, away! Tempt not the weakness of a lover's breast; The softest breeze can shake the halcyon's nest, And lightest clouds o'ercast the dawning ray! 'Twas but a vision! Now, the star of day Peers, like a gem on Aetna's burning crest! Wellcome, ye Hills, with golden vintage drest; Sicilian forests brown, and vallies gay! A mournful stranger, from the Lesbian Isle, Not strange, in loftiest eulogy of Song! She, who could teach the Stoic's cheek to smile, Thaw the cold heart, and chain the wond'ring throng, Can find no balm, love's arrows to beguile; Ah! Sorrows known too soon! and felt too long!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIV VENUS! to thee, the Lesbian Muse shall sing, The song, which Myttellenian youths admir'd, when Echo, am'rous of the strain inspir'd, Bade the wild rocks with madd'ning plaudits ring! Attend my pray'r! O! Queen of rapture! bring To these fond arms, he, whom my soul has fir'd; From these fond arms remov'd; yet, still desir'd, Though love, exulting, spreads his varying wing! Oh! source of ev'ry joy! of ev'ry care Blest Venus! Goddess of the zone divine! To Phaon's bosom, Phaon's victim bear; So shall her warmest, tend'rest vows be thine! For Venus, Sappho shall a wreath prepare, And Love be crown'd, immortal as the Nine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXV WHAT means the mist opake that veils these eyes; Why does yon threat'ning tempest shroud the day? Why does thy altar, Venus, fade away, And on my breast the dews of horror rise? Phaon is false! be dim ye orient Skies; And let black Erebus succeed your ray; Let clashing thunders roll, and lightning play; Phaon is false! and hopeless Sappho dies! "Farewell! my Lesbian love, you might have said," Such sweet remembrance had some pity prov'd, "Or coldly this, farewell, Oh! Lesbian maid!" No task severe, for one so fondly lov'd! The gentle thought had sooth'd my wand'ring shade, From life's dark valley, and its thorns remov'd!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVI LEAD me, Sicilian Maids, to haunted bow'rs, While yon pale moon displays her faintest beams O'er blasted woodlands, and enchanted streams, Whose banks infect the breeze with pois'nous flow'rs. Ah! lead me, where the barren mountain tow'rs, Where no sounds echo, but the night-owl's screams, Where some lone spirit of the desart gleams, And lurid horrors wing the fateful hours! Now goaded frenzy grasps my shrinking brain, Her touch absorbs the crystal fount of woe! My blood rolls burning through each gasping vein; Away, lost Lyre! unless thou can'st bestow A charm, to lull that agonizing pain, Which those who never lov'd, can never know!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVII WHEN, in the gloomy mansion of the dead, This with'ring heart, this faded form shall sleep; When these fond eyes, at length shall cease to weep, And earth's cold lap receive this fev'rish head; Envy shall turn away, a tear to shed, And Time's obliterating pinions sweep The spot, where poets shall their vigils keep, To mourn and wander near my freezing bed! Then, my pale ghost, upon th' Elysian shore, Shall smile, releas'd from ev'ry mortal care; Whil, doom'd love's victim to repine no more, My breast shall bathe in endless rapture there! Ah! no!my restless shade would still deplore, Nor taste that bliss, which Phaon did not share.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXVIII OH Sigh! thou steal'st, the herald of the breast, The lover's fears, the lover's pangs to tell; Thou bid'st with timid grace the bosom swell, Cheating the day of joy, the night of rest! Oh! lucid Tears! with eloquence confest, Why on my fading cheek unheeded dwell, Meek, as the dew-drops on the flowret's bell By ruthless tempests to the green-sod prest. Fond sigh be hush'd! congeal, O! slighted tear! Thy feeble pow'rs the busy Fates control! Or if thy crystal streams again appear, Let them, like Lethe's, oblivion roll: For Love the tyrant plays, when hope is near, And she who flies the lover, chains the soul!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XXXIX PREPARE your wreaths, Aonian maids divine, To strew the tranquil bed where I shall sleep; In tears, the myrtle and the laurel steep, And let Erato's hand the trophies twine. No parian marble, there, with labour'd line, Shall bid the wand'ring lover stay to weep; There holy silence shall her vigils keep. Save, when the nightingale such woes as mine Shall sadly sing; as twilight's curtains spread, There shall the branching lotos widely wave, Sprinkling soft show'rs upon the lily's head, Sweet drooping emblem for a lover's grave! And there shall Phaon pearls of pity shed, To gem the vanquish'd heart he scorn'd to save!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XL ON the low margin of a murm'ring stream, As rapt in meditation's arms I lay; Each aching sense in slumbers stole away, While potent fancy form'd a soothing dream; O'er the Leucadian deep, a dazzling beam Shed the bland light of empyrean day! But soon transparent shadows veil'd each ray, While mystic visions sprang athwart the gleam! Now to the heaving gulf they seem'd to bend, And now across the sphery regions glide; Now in mid-air, their dulcet voices blend, "Awake! awake!" the restless phalanx cried, "See ocean yawns the lover's woes to end, "Plunge the green wave, and bid thy griefs subside."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLI YES, I will go, where circling whirlwinds rise, Where threat'ning clouds in sable grandeur lour; Where the blast yells, the liquid columns pour, And madd'ning billows combat with the skies! There, while the Daemon of the tempest flies On growing pinions through the troublous hour, The wild waves gasp impatient to devour, And on the rock the waken'd Vulture cries! Oh! dreadful solace to the stormy mind! To me, more pleasing than the valley's rest, The woodland songsters, or the sportive kind, That nip the turf, or prune the painted crest; For in despair alone, the wretched find That unction sweet, which lulls the bleeding breast!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLII OH! can'st thou bear to see this faded frame, Deform'd and mangled by the rocky deep? Wilt thou remember, and forbear to weep, My fatal fondness, and my peerless fame? Soon o'er this heart, now warm with passion's flame, The howling winds and foamy waves shall sweep; Those eyes be ever clos'd in death's cold sleep, And all of Sappho perish, but her name! Yet, if the Fates suspend their barb'rous ire, If days less mournful, Heav'n designs for me! If rocks grow kind, and winds and waves conspire, To bear me softly on the swelling sea; To Phoebus only will I tune my Lyre, "What suits with Sappho, Phoebus suits with thee!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIII WHILE from the dizzy precipice I gaze, The world receding from my pensive eyes, High o'er my head the tyrant eagle flies, Cloth'd in the sinking sun's transcendent blaze! The meek-ey'd moon, 'midst clouds of amber plays As o'er the purpling plains of light she hies, Till the last stream of living lustre dies, And the cool concave owns her temper'd rays! So shall this glowing, palpitating soul, Welcome returning Reason's placid beam, While o'er my breast the waves Lethean roll, To calm rebellious Fancy's fev'rish dream; Then shall my Lyre disdain love's dread control, And loftier passions, prompt the loftier theme!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XLIV. CONCLUSIVE HERE droops the muse! while from her glowing mind, Celestial Sympathy, with humid eye, Bids the light Sylph capricious Fancy fly, Time's restless wings with transient flowr's to bind! For now, with folded arms and head inclin'd, Reflection pours the deep and frequent sigh, O'er the dark scroll of human destiny, Where gaudy buds and wounding thorns are twin'd. O! Sky-born VIRTUE! sacred is thy name! And though mysterious Fate, with frown severe, Oft decorates thy brows with wreaths of Fame, Bespangled o'er with sorrow's chilling tear! Yet shalt thou more than mortal raptures claim, The brightest planet of th' ETERNAL SPHERE!</field>
