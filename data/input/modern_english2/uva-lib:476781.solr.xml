      <field name="heading_text">Beyond the Bayou</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE bayou curved like a crescent around the point of land on which La Folle's cabin stood. Between the stream and the hut lay a big abandoned field, where cattle were pastured when the bayou supplied them with water enough. Through the woods that spread back into unknown regions the woman had drawn an imaginary line, and past this circle she never stepped. This was the form of her only mania.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five. Her real name was Jacqueline, but every one on the plantation called her La Folle, because in childhood she had been frightened literally "out of her senses," and had never wholly regained them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was when there had been skirmishing and sharpshooting all day in the woods. Evening was near when P'tit Maître, black with powder and crimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline's mother, his pursuers close at his heels. The sight had stunned her childish reason.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She dwelt alone in her solitary cabin, for the rest of the quarters had long since been removed beyond her sight and knowledge. She had more physical strength than most men, and made her patch of cotton and corn and tobacco like the best of them. But of the world beyond the bayou she had long known nothing, save what her morbid fancy conceived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">People at Bellissime had grown used to her and her way, and they thought nothing of it. Even when "Old Mis'" died, they did not wonder that La Folle had not crossed the bayou, but had stood upon her side of it, wailing and lamenting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">P'tit Maître was now the owner of Bellissime. He was a middle-aged man, with a family of beautiful daughters about him, and a little son whom La Folle loved as if he had been her own. She called him Chéri, and so did every one else because she did.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">None of the girls had ever been to her what Chéri was. They had each and all loved to be with her, and to listen to her wondrous stories of things that always happened "yonda, beyon' de bayou."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Chéri did, nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep in her arms as he used to do. For Chéri hardly did such things now, since he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black curls cut off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That summer—the summer Chéri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a knot of red ribbon—the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river. La Folle was sorry when they were gone, for she loved these dumb companions well, and liked to feel that they were there, and to hear them browsing by night up to her own enclosure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Saturday afternoon, when the fields were deserted. The men had flocked to a neighboring village to do their week's trading, and the women were occupied with household affairs,—La Folle as well as the others. It was then she mended and washed her handful of clothes, scoured her house, and did her baking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this last employment she never forgot Chéri. To-day she had fashioned croquignoles of the most fantastic and alluring shapes for him. So when she saw the boy come trudging across the old field with his gleaming little new rifle on his shoulder, she called out gayly to him, "Chéri! Chéri!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Chéri did not need the summons, for he was coming straight to her. His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given that day up at his father's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was a sunny-faced youngster of ten. When he had emptied his pockets, La Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her apron, and smoothed his hair. Then she watched him as, with his cakes in his hand, he crossed her strip of cotton back of the cabin, and disappeared into the wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had boasted of the things he was going to do with his gun out there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think they got plenty deer in the wood, La Folle?" he had inquired, with the calculating air of an experienced hunter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Non, non!" the woman laughed. "Don't you look fo' no deer, Chéri. Dat 's too big. But you bring La Folle one good fat squirrel fo' her dinner to-morrow, an' she goin' be satisfi'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One squirrel ain't a bite. I'll bring you mo' 'an one, La Folle," he had boasted pompously as he went away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the woman, an hour later, heard the report of the boy's rifle close to the wood's edge, she would have thought nothing of it if a sharp cry of distress had not followed the sound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She withdrew her arms from the tub of suds in which they had been plunged, dried them upon her apron, and as quickly as her trembling limbs would bear her, hurried to the spot whence the ominous report had come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was as she feared. There she found Chéri stretched upon the ground, with his rifle beside him. He moaned piteously:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm dead, La Folle! I'm dead! I'm gone!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Non, non!" she exclaimed resolutely, as she knelt beside him. "Put you' arm 'roun' La Folle's nake, Chéri. Dat 's nuttin'; dat goin' be nuttin'." She lifted him in her powerful arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chéri had carried his gun muzzle-downward. He had stumbled,— he did not know how. He only knew that he had a ball lodged somewhere in his leg, and he thought that his end was at hand. Now, with his head upon the woman's shoulder, he moaned and wept with pain and fright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, La Folle! La Folle! it hurt so bad! I can' stan' it, La Folle!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't cry, mon bebe, mon bebe, mon Chéri!" the woman spoke soothingly as she covered the ground with long strides. "La Folle goin' mine you; Doctor Bonfils goin' come make mon Chéri well agin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had reached the abandoned field. As she crossed it with her precious burden, she looked constantly and restlessly from side to side. A terrible fear was upon her, —the fear of the world beyond the bayou, the morbid and insane dread she had been under since childhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she was at the bayou's edge she stood there, and shouted for help as if a life depended upon it:—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, P'tit Maître! P'tit Maître! Venez donc! Au secours! Au secours!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No voice responded. Chéri's hot tears were scalding her neck. She called for each and every one upon the place, and still no answer came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shouted, she wailed; but whether her voice remained unheard or unheeded, no reply came to her frenzied cries. And all the while Chéri moaned and wept and entreated to be taken home to his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">La Folle gave a last despairing look around her. Extreme terror was upon her. She clasped the child close against her breast, where he could feel her heart beat like a muffled hammer. Then shutting her eyes, she ran suddenly down the shallow bank of the bayou, and never stopped till she had climbed the opposite shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood there quivering an instant as she opened her eyes. Then she plunged into the footpath through the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She spoke no more to Chéri, but muttered constantly, "Bon Dieu, ayez pitie La Folle! Bon Dieu, ayez pitie moi!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instinct seemed to guide her. When the pathway spread clear and smooth enough before her, she again closed her eyes tightly against the sight of that unknown and terrifying world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A child, playing in some weeds, caught sight of her as she neared the quarters. The little one uttered a cry of dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"La Folle!" she screamed, in her piercing treble. "La Folle done cross de bayer!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quickly the cry passed down the line of cabins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yonda, La Folle done cross de bayou!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Children, old men, old women, young ones with infants in their arms, flocked to doors and windows to see this awe-inspiring spectacle. Most of them shuddered with superstitious dread of what it might portend. "She totin' Chéri!" some of them shouted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some of the more daring gathered about her, and followed at her heels, only to fall back with new terror when she turned her distorted face upon them. Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a white foam on her black lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some one had run ahead of her to where P'tit Maître sat with his family and guests upon the gallery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P'tit Maître! La Folle done cross de bayou! Look her! Look her yonda totin' Chéri!" This startling intimation was the first which they had of the woman's approach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was now near at hand. She walked with long strides. Her eyes were fixed desperately before her, and she breathed heavily, as a tired ox.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the foot of the stairway, which she could not have mounted, she laid the boy in his father's arms. Then the world that had looked red to La Folle suddenly turned black,—like that day she had seen powder and blood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She reeled for an instant. Before a sustaining arm could reach her, she fell heavily to the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When La Folle regained consciousness, she was at home again, in her own cabin and upon her own bed. The moon rays, streaming in through the open door and windows, gave what light was needed to the old black mammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs. It was very late.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Others who had come, and found that the stupor clung to her, had gone again. P'tit Maître had been there, and with him Doctor Bonfils, who said that La Folle might die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But death had passed her by. The voice was very clear and steady with which she spoke to Tante Lizette, brewing her tisane there in a corner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ef you will give me one good drink tisane, Tante Lizette, I b'lieve I'm goin' sleep, me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And she did sleep; so soundly, so healthfully, that old Lizette without compunction stole softly away, to creep back through the moonlit fields to her own cabin in the new quarters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle. She arose, calmly, as if no tempest had shaken and threatened her existence but yesterday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she remembered that this was Sunday. When she had made for herself a cup of strong black coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted the cabin and walked across the old familiar field to the bayou's edge again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She did not stop there as she had always done before, but crossed with a long, steady stride as if she had done this all her life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she had made her way through the brush and scrub cottonwood-trees that lined the opposite bank, she found herself upon the border of a field where the white, bursting cotton, with the dew upon it, gleamed for acres and acres like frosted silver in the early dawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">La Folle drew a long, deep breath as she gazed across the country. She walked slowly and uncertainly, like one who hardly knows how, looking about her as she went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cabins, that yesterday had sent a clamor of voices to pursue her, were quiet now. No one was yet astir at Bellissime. Only the birds that darted here and there from hedges were awake, and singing their matins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When La Folle came to the broad stretch of velvety lawn that surrounded the house, she moved slowly and with delight over the springy turf, that was delicious beneath her tread.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped to find whence came those perfumes that were assailing her senses with memories from a time far gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that peeped out from green, luxuriant beds. There they were, showering down from the big waxen bells of the magnolias far above her head, and from the jessamine clumps around her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were roses, too, without number. To right and left palms spread in broad and graceful curves. It all looked like enchantment beneath the sparkling sheen of dew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When La Folle had slowly and cautiously mounted the many steps that led up to the veranda, she turned to look back at the perilous ascent she had made. Then she caught sight of the river, bending like a silver bow at the foot of Bellissime. Exultation possessed her soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">La Folle rapped softly upon a door near at hand. Chéri's mother soon cautiously opened it. Quickly and cleverly she dissembled the astonishment she felt at seeing La Folle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, La Folle! Is it you, so early?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oui , madame. I come ax how my po' li'le Chéri do, 's mo'nin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is feeling easier, thank you, La Folle. Dr. Bonfils says it will be nothing serious. He's sleeping now. Will you come back when he awakes?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Non , madame. I'm goin' wait yair tell Chéri wake up." La Folle seated herself upon the topmost step of the veranda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A look of wonder and deep content crept into her face as she watched for the first time the sun rise upon the new, the beautiful world beyond the bayou.</field>
