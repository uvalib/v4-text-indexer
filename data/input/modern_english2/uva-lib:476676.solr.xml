      <field name="fulltext">"I shall never write another book dealing with the West—that is, with the primitive life of the West," said Mary Austin the other day when discussing her new work with a friend. "I feel that the West was generous to me in material, and I do not mean to say that the primitive life of the desert has ceased to interest me, but merely that I have written as much about it as I care to. Others will find material in the far West no doubt, for although the rough life of the mining camps and the cattle ranches is already tinged with civilisation in almost every locality there still remains enough that is picturesque to furnish a library full of books." Mrs. Austin went on to explain that she feels that she has found her field in the more complicated life of the cities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Following her book of essays, Christ in Italy , is A Woman of Genius —described as a novel of temperament rather than one of locality, which is to be issued this month. In the words of the author, A Woman of Genius is "the story of the struggle between a genius for tragic acting and the daughter of a County Clerk, with the social ideal of Taylorville, Ohianna, for the villain."</field>
