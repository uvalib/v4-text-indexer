      <field name="fulltext">I call the old time back : I bring my lay In tender memory of the summer day When, where our native river lapsed away,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We dreamed it over, while the thrushes made Songs of their own, and the great pine-trees laid On warm noonlights the masses of their shade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And she was with us, living o'er again Her life in ours, despite of years and pain, - The Autumn's brightness after latter rain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beautiful in her holy peace as one Who stands, at evening, when the work is done, Glorified in the setting of the sun !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her memory makes our common landscape seem Fairer than any of which painters dream ; Lights the brown hills and sings in every stream ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For she whose speech was always truth's pure gold Heard, not unpleased, its simple legends told, And loved with us the beautiful and old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hay stack decoration. Part I title page. Moon rises over a river. Decorative scythes Image of the countryside.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">I. THE RIVER VALLEY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Across the level tableland, A grassy, rarely trodden way, With thinnest skirt of birchen spray</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And stunted growth of cedar, leads To where you see the dull plain fall Sheer off, steep-slanted, ploughed by all</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seasons' rainfalls. On its brink The over-leaning harebells swing, With roots half bare the pine-trees cling ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunrises over a tree clinging to a cliffside. Text is incorporated in the picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, through the shadow looking west, You see the wavering river flow Along a vale, that far below</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holds to the sun, the sheltering hills And glimmering water-line between, Broad fields of corn and meadows green,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And fruit-bent orchards grouped around The low brown roofs and painted eaves, And chimney-tops half hid in leaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Countryside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No warmer valley hides behind Yon wind-scourged sand-dunes, cold and bleak ; No fairer river comes to seek</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wave-sung welcome of the sea, Or mark the northmost border line Of sun-loved growths of nut and vine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, ground-fast in their native fields, Untempted by the city's gain, The quiet farmer folk remain</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who bear the pleasant name of Friends, And keep their fathers' gentle ways And simple speech of Bible days ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In whose neat homesteads woman holds With modest ease her equal place, And wears upon her tranquil face</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The look of one who, merging not Her self-hood in another's will, Is love's and duty's handmaid still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pass with me down the path that winds Through birches to the open land, Where, close upon the river strand</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Man standing on wooded hillside overlooking ruined cottage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You mark a cellar, vine o'errun, Above whose wall of loosened stones The sumach lifts its reddening cones,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Close up of the ruined cottage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the black nightshade's berries shine, And broad, unsightly burdocks fold The houshold ruin, century-old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, in the dim colonial time Of sterner lives and gloomier faith, A woman lived, tradition saith,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who wrought her neighbors foul annoy, And witched and plagued the county side, Till at the hangman's hand she died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sit with me while the westering day Falls slantwise down the quiet vale, And, haply ere yon loitering sail,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That rounds the upper headland, falls Below Deer Island's pines, or sees Behind it Hawkswood's belt of trees</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rise black against the sinking sun, My idyl of its days of old, The valley's legend, shall be told.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An Island in the middle of a lake. A sailboat sits to the left.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">II. THE HUSKING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part II title page. A barn stands open at night. Small image of crows picking at the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the pleasant harvest-time, When cellar-bins are closely stowed, And garrets bend beneath their load,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A farm in the morning. Farmers ready a cart of hay pulled by bulls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the old swallow-haunted barns, - Brown-gabled, long, and full of seams Through which the moted sunlight streams,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And winds blow freshly in, to shake The red plumes of the roosted cocks, And the loose hay-mow's scented locks, -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Are filled with summer's ripened stores, Its odorous grass and barley sheaves, From their low scaffolds to their eaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The loft of the barn filled with corn or grain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Esek Harden's oaken floor, With many an autumn threshing worn, Lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And thither came young men and maids, Beneath a moon that, large and low, Lit that sweet eve of long ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men and women gather on a fenced path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They took their places ; some by chance, And others by a merry voice Or sweet smile guided to their choice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How pleasantly the rising moon Between the shadow of the mows, Looked on them through the great elm-boughs !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunset through trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On sturdy boyhood, sun-embrowned, On girlhood with its solid curves Of healthful strength and painless nerves!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And jests went round, and laughs that made The house-dog answer with his howl, And kept astir the barn-yard fowl;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men and women sit in a tavern. A musician plays a harp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And quaint old songs their fathers sung In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors, Ere Norman William trod their shores ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And tales, whose merry license shook The fat sides of the Saxon thane, Forgetful of the hovering Dane, -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rude plays to Celt and Cimbri known, The charms and riddles that beguiled On Oxus' banks the young world's child, -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That primal picture-speech wherein Have youth and maid the story told, So new in each, so dateless old,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Recalling pastoral Ruth in her Who waited, blushing and demure, The red-ear's kiss of forfeiture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A decorative corn motif. Part III title page. A dark plain.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">III. THE WITCH'S DAUGHTER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Grave stones. Mabel Martin sits on the ground husking corn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But still the sweetest voice was mute That river-valley ever heard From lips of maid or throat of bird ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For Mabel Martin sat at, And let the hay-mow's shadow fall Upon the loveliest face of all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat at, as one forbid, Who knew that none would condescend To own the Witch-wife's child a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old woman (witch) led to the top of the gallows by a frowning crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seasons scarce had gone their round, Since curious thousands thronged to see Her mother at the gallows-tree ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And mocked the prison-palsied limbs That faltered on the fatal stairs, And wan lip trembling with its prayers !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few questioned of the sorrowing child, Or, when they saw the mother die, Dreamed of the daughter's agony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went up to their homes that day, As men and Christians justified : God willed it, and the wretch had died !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear God and Father of us all, Forgive our faith in cruel lies, - Forgive the blindness that denies !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Forgive thy creature when he takes, For the all-perfect love Thou art, Some grim creation of his heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cast down our idols, overturn Our bloody altars ; let us see Thyself in Thy humanity !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Young Mabel from her mother's grave Crept to her desolate hearth-stone, And wrestled with her fate alone ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With love, and anger, and despair, The phantoms of disordered sense, The awful doubts of Providence !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mabel weeps slumped over an empty rocking chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, dreary broke the winter days, And dreary fell the winter nights When, one by one, the neighboring lights</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A small dark cottage with a light in the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Went out, and human sounds grew still, And all the phantom-peopled dark Closed round her hearth-fire's dying sk</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And summer days were sad and long, And sad the uncompanioned eves, And sadder sunset-tinted leaves,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A tree hanging over a still pond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Indian Summer's airs of balm ; She scarcely felt the soft caress, The beauty died of loneliness !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The school-boys jeered her as they passed, And, when she sought the house of prayer, Her mother's curse pursued her there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And still o'er many a neighboring door She saw the horseshoe's curved charm, To guard against her mother's harm :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A family sits outside of their cottage. A cat plays with a broom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That mother, poor and sick and lame, Who daily, by the old arm-chair, Folded her withered hands in prayer ;-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who turned, in Salem's dreary jail, Her worn old Bible o'er and o'er, When her dim eyes could read no more !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An old woman sits in a dark cell reading a book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sore tried and pained, the poor girl kept Her faith, and trusted that her way, So dark, would somewhere meet the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And still her weary wheel went round Day after day, with no relief : Small leisure have the poor for grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A woman carries sticks in a field.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">IV. THE CHAMPION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part IV title page. A three story house in the woods. A butter churn. Mabel sits sadly on the ground in the shadow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So in the shadow Mabel sits ; Untouched by mirth she sees and hears, Her smile is sadder than her tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But cruel eyes have found her out, And cruel lips repeat her name, And taunt her with her mother's shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She answered not with railing words, But drew her apron o'er her face, And, sobbing, glided from the place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And only pausing at the door, Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze Of one who, in her better days,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A man introduces himself to a young woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Had been her warm and steady friend, Ere yet her mother's doom had made Even Esek Harden half afraid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He felt that mute appeal of tears, And, starting, with an angry frown, Hushed all the wicked murmurs down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good neighbors mine," he sternly said, "This passes harmless mirth or jest ; I brook no insult to my guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is indeed her mother's child, But God's sweet pity ministers Unto no whiter soul than hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let Goody Martin rest in peace ; I never knew her harm a fly, And witch or not, God knows -not I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bearded man addresses a crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know who swore her life away ; And as God lives, I'd not condemn An Indian dog on word of them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The broadest lands in all the town, The skill to guide, the power to awe, Were Harden's ; and his word was law.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">None dared withstand him to his face, But one sly maiden spake aside: "The little witch is evil-eyed !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Her mother only killed a cow, Or witched a churn or dairy-pan ; But she, forsooth, must charm a man !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little cherubs play in the arch of a horseshoe.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">V. IN THE SHADOW</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part V title page. A tree casts its shadow on a dark house. Moonlight over a wooded pond. Mabel walks through the forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Mabel, homeward turning, passed The namelass terrors of the wood, And saw, as if a ghost pursued,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her shadow gliding in the moon ; The soft breath of the west-wind gave A chill as from her mother's grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How dreary seemed the silent house ! Wide in the moonbeams' ghastly glare Its windows had a dead man's stare !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, like a gaunt and spectral hand, The tremulous shadow of a birch Reached out and touched the door's low porch,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As is to lift its latch ; hard by, A sudden warning call she heard, The night-cry of a boding bird.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She leaned against the door ; her face, So fair, so young, so full of pain, White in the moonlight's silver rain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mabel leans against a door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The river, on its pebbled rim, Made music such as childhood knew ; The door-yard tree was whispered through</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By voices such as childhood's ear Had heard in moonlights long ago ; And through the willow-boughs below</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Moonlight on a wooded stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She saw the rippled waters shine ; Beyond, in waves of shade and light, The hills rolled off into the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She saw and heard, but over all A sense of some transforming spell, The shadow of her sick heart fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A house with lighted windows on a hilltop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And still across the wooded space The harvest lights of Harden shone, And song and jest and laugh went on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he, so gentle, true, and strong, Of men the bravest and the best, Had he, too, scorned her with the rest ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She strove to drown her sense of wrong, And, in her old and simple way, To teach her bitter heart to pray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mabel slumps in a chair beneath a window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor child ! the prayer, begun in faith, Grew to a low, despairing cry Of utter misery : "Let me die !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh ! take me from the scornful eyes, And hide me where the cruel speech And mocking finger may not reach !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dare not breathe my mother's name : A daughter's right I dare not crave To weep above her unblest grave !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me not live until my heart, With few to pity, and with none To love me, hardens into stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O God ! have mercy on Thy child, Whose faith in Thee grows weak and small, And take me ere I lose it all !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A shadow on the moonlight fell, And murmuring wind and wave became A voice whose burden was her name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A man carries a lamb throught the rain</field>
      <field name="heading_text">VI. THE BETROTHAL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part VI title page. A man and woman walk slowly along a path. Flowering branches. Seated Mabel looks up at a man, whose head is bowed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Had then God heard her ? Had He sent His angel down ? In flesh and blood, Before her Esek Harden stood !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laid his hand upon her arm : "Dear Mabel, this no more shall be : Who scoffs at you must scoff at me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know rough Esek Harden well ; And if he seems no suitor gay, And if his hair is touched with gray,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A woman and small girl play with yarn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The maiden grown shall never find His heart less warm than when she smiled, Upon his knees a little child !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her tears of grief were tears of joy, As, folded in his strong embrace, She looked in Esek Harden's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A seated man holds a knealing woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O truest friend of all !" she said, "God bless you for your kindly thought, And make me worthy of my lot !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A man and woman walk in the woods arm and arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led her forth, and, blent in one, Beside their happy pathway ran The shadows of the maid and man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led her through his dewy fields, To where the swinging lanterns glowed, And through the doors the huskers showed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Man and woman stand together arm and arm among a crowd of huskers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good friends and neighbors !" Esek said "I'm weary of this lonely life ; In Mabel see my chosen wife !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She greets you kindly, one and all ; The past is past, and all offence Falls harmless from her innocence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Henceforth she stands no more alone ; You know what Esek Harden is ;- He brooks no wrong to him or his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now let the merriest tales be told, And let the sweetest songs be sung That ever made the old heart young !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For now the lost has found a home ; And a lone hearth shall brighter burn, As all the household joys return !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Moon rise framed by two tall trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, pleasantly the harvest-moon, Between the shadow of the mows, Looked on them through the great elmboughs !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mabel's curls of golden hair, On Esek's shaggy strength it fell ; And the wind whispered, "It is well !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A lighted cottage window and foliage.</field>
