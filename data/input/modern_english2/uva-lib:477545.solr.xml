      <field name="heading_text">SIX POEMS BY WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PORTRAIT OF A LADY Your thighs are appletrees whose blossoms touch the sky. Which sky? The sky where Watteau hung a lady's slipper. Your knees are a southern breeze—or a gust of snow. Agh! what sort of man was Fragonard? —As if that answered anything.—Ah, yes. Below the knees, since the tune drops that way, it is one of those white summer days, the tall grass of your ankles flickers upon the shore— Which shore?— the sand clings to my lips— Which shore? Agh, petals maybe. How should I know? Which shore? Which shore? —the petals from some hidden appletree—Which shore? I said petals from an appletree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO WAKEN AN OLD LADY Old age is a flight of small cheeping birds skimming bare trees above a snow glaze. Gaining and failing they are buffeted by a dark wind— But what? On harsh weedstalks the flock has rested— the snow is covered with broken seed husks and the wind tempered with a shrill piping of plenty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DESOLATE FIELD Vast and grey, the sky is a simulacrum to all but him whose days are vast and grey and— In the tall, dried grasses a goat stirs with nozzle searching the ground. My head is in the air but who am I . . . ? —and my heart stops amazed at the thought of love vast and grey yearning silently over me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLOW POEM It is a willow when summer is over, a willow by the river from which no leaf has fallen nor bitten by the sun turned orange or crimson. The leaves cling and grow paler, swing and grow paler over the swirling waters of the river as if loth to let go, they are so cool, so drunk with the swirl of the wind and of the river— oblivious to winter, the last to let go and fall into the water and on the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BLIZZARD Snow falls: years of anger following hours that float idly down— the blizzard drifts its weight deeper and deeper for three days or sixty years, eh? Then the sun! a clutter of yellow and blue flakes— Hairy looking trees stand out in long alleys over a wild solitude. The man turns and there— his solitary track stretched out upon the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPRING STORM The sky has given over its bitterness. Out of the dark change all day long rain falls and falls as if it would never end. Still the snow keeps its hold on the ground. But water, water is seething from a thousand runnels. It collects swiftly, dappled with black cuts a way for itself through green ice in the gutters. Drop after drop it falls from the withered grass stems of the overhanging embankment.</field>
