      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I AN ENCOUNTER ON BICYCLES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi, Ned! What do you say to a little race?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm ready," called Ned Slade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How about you, Jerry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm always ready," answered Jerry Hopkins, tossing aside the core of an apple he had been eating. "But how far is the race to be, Chunky?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To the oak tree," replied Bob Baker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suits me," said Jerry. "All aboard!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three bicyclists rose from the grass where they had been resting in the shade of a big maple tree, after a trip of about five miles on their bicycles around the country outside of the village of Cresville, where they lived. Cresville was a pleasant town, not a great many miles from Boston.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys were chums, and had been ever since they had started to school together, eight years previous. There was Bob, the son of Andrew Baker, who was counted one of the wealthiest men in Cresville. His interests were varied, but were mainly in banks and banking institutions. Besides Bob there was in the family a daughter Susie. Bob was fourteen years old, and Susie two years younger, and Bob was so much inclined to stoutness that he was sometimes called "Chunky" by his chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned was the only child of Aaron Slade, owner of the largest department store in the town, and a well-off merchant. As for Jerry he lived with his widowed mother, and his sister Julia Hopkins, a girl whom it would do your heart good to know, she was so jolly and full of fun. The death of Mr. Hopkins, a few years previous, had left his widow with an ample income, which she devoted to the bringing up of her children. Jerry and Ned were the same age, fifteen years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All three boys were sturdy chaps, full of life and energy. They had studied, played and fought together so long that they had come to be regarded as three inseparables by the townspeople.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now are you fellows ready for the word?" asked Bob, steadying his wheel in a line with the other two.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let her go!" called Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sing out, Chunky!" shouted Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a moment of suspense, and a momentary thrill over even so slight a thing as this little sprint among the three boys. Each one meant to win.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go!" yelled Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In an instant the wheels were started off. Three boys bounded into three saddles. Three pairs of feet began to pump the pedals desperately. A cloud of dust arose and the race was on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a distance of half a mile from the maple tree, where the start was made, to the oak which Bob had designated as the winning post. The road was a good hard level stretch of macadam and the wheels fairly spun along it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first the boys were on even terms. Then Bob gradually drew away from Ned and Jerry. Seeing this Ned put an extra ounce or two into his pushing and he soon caught up to Bob. These two held the lead on almost a line for a few hundred feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly there was a whirr of wheels behind them, an excited joyous shout and, with a yell, Jerry whizzed past, and obtained such a good advantage that he kept it, until he reached the oak, where he leaped off, and cast himself down in the shade to rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think you could do it, Jerry," panted Ned, as he and Bob flashed up two seconds later. "Honest, I didn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor I," came from Bob. "You must have been practicing lately."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I thought I ought to try and improve my wheel-work," said Jerry modestly. "I'm thinking of going in the club races that will be held soon, and I wanted to stand some sort of a show."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd say you stood a pretty good one, if you ride like you did to-day," interposed Ned. "You went past us flying, and Bob and I weren't going so slow, either; were we, Bob?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a few minutes the boys lolled lazily in the grass, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. Then Bob took three apples from his pocket and treated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you fellows know what I wish?" began Jerry, who had finished his light lunch first. "I wish we all had motor-cycles."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It wouldn't be a half-bad idea," agreed Bob, after a little thought. "I'm beginning to get a little tired of this leg-work, myself. How about you, Ned?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I could use a motor-cycle if one came my way," replied Ned. "That is after I learned how to operate one, and wouldn't blow myself and the immediate neighborhood up with gasolene."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're easy to run," affirmed Jerry, "and no more dangerous than a horse. The catalogue I have says so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That reminds me, are you two going in the bicycle races?" asked Jerry. "You know there are going to be some fine prizes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean the Cresville Athletic Club races?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hadn't thought much of it," said Bob. "I heard about 'em, but it takes a lot of time to train, and you have to almost starve yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How about you, Ned?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you and Bob go in for it, Jerry, I s'pose I might as well too. Tell us what you know about the races."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry related what he had heard about the plans of the athletic club to hold an out-door meet on their grounds three weeks hence. As he had said, several valuable prizes were to be awarded, and there were many classes of handicap contests, so that the boys would have plenty of chances to enter, and stand a good show of winning one or more of the trophies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It sounds good," said Ned at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to enter, and begin training at once," decided Chunky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Same here, then," came from Ned. "Have you entered yet, Jerry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I've begun to train some. There's plenty of time to send in your name if you want to enter. The lists are open until five days before the races."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, then it's settled," exclaimed Ned, slowly rising from his comfortable berth in the grass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys mounted their wheels and started slowly homeward. They took their time, keeping close together and talking now of the coming races and again of the prospects of owning motor-cycles. At the top of a long, gentle sloping hill, that led down, almost to the centre of the town, the boys put their feet on the coasters and let their wheels glide down by gravity. Soon they were going at a rapid rate, with Ned slightly in the lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the foot of the hill another road crossed at right angles. By reason of a turn to this second road, and a clump of trees, any one passing along it could not be seen until he was nearly in the middle of the hill road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly there shot from behind the clump of trees lining the cross-road, a figure on a wheel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look out!" yelled Bob and Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned looked up and saw, but was too late. He could not check his speed, and the only thing to do was to turn to one side, and try to avoid the other rider. Unfortunately the other rider, also seeing the danger, took the same turn as had Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's going to be a smash!" called Jerry in excited tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The shock threw Ned and the other cyclist from their wheels into the dusty road. The bicycles went in one direction and the riders in another. Both boys were lying still on the highway when Bob and Jerry came running up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are they killed?" asked Jerry in a trembling voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, only stunned, I guess," answered Bob, feeling of Ned's heart, and finding it beating. "Let's see who the other fellow is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned the boy who had collided with Ned over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Noddy Nixon?" he said. "He'll be sure to say this was Ned's fault, and it may make trouble. I wish Ned had put on his brake."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned sat up and opened his eyes. A few seconds later Noddy Nixon did likewise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What happened?" gasped Ned, rubbing the dust from his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had a little spill, that's all," answered Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little spill? I should say we did," snarled Noddy, who was larger and stronger than any of the three chums, and older, being about eighteen. "A nasty little spill it was, too. And all your fault, Ned Slade! Why didn't you look where you were going?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why didn't you look?" asked Ned, hotly. "I turned out to avoid you, and if you'd been paying attention you wouldn't have steered right into me. It's as much your fault as it is mine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My leg's broke," came from Noddy. "You'll suffer for this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get up and let's see if it's broken," urged Bob, taking hold of Noddy's shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! Ouch!" screamed Noddy, who though he was strong and a bully was also a great coward in pain. "My shoulder's broken, too. I'll sue you for this, Ned Slade, after I get well, and I'll lick you, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, dry up," muttered Ned, who was painfully limping toward his wheel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Noddy came to move he discovered that he was not as badly hurt as he had foolishly imagined. He got on his feet, brushed the dirt from his clothes, and found that he could walk all right. But he scowled darkly when he saw Bob grinning at him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're more scared than hurt," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, you impudent little snob!" burst out Noddy, limping over toward the boy who was still smiling. "Don't give me any of your lip. I won't stand it. I'll knock your head off!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better not try," advised Bob quietly, the smile leaving his face. "Two can play at that game."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and so can we all of us," broke in Jerry, who was something of a boxer. "We're sorry for what happened, Nixon," he went on. "but you needn't rub it in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, shut-up!" cried Noddy, turning away, and picking up his wheel. "I'll get even with you for this, though," he muttered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two of my spokes are broken," he went on, after an examination of his bicycle. "You'll have to pay for them, Ned Slade."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So are two of mine, and my handle bars are bent," retorted Ned. "I guess we'll call it even, Noddy. I won't charge you for straightening the handles," and he laughed in spite of the pain of his bruises.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You—you!" began Noddy, but rage seemed to choke him, and with scowling face he mounted his wheel and rode slowly away. "You just wait!" he shouted back, shaking his head at the three boys.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II A MEAN PLOT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WELL," began Bob, when the three chums were ready to proceed on their way, Ned having been brushed off. "I'd like to have Noddy for a close friend, I don't think! Wonder what makes him so mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Born so, I s'pose," grunted Ned. "Any one else would have laughed over such an accident. He seemed to think I did it on purpose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He talks as though he did," ventured Jerry. "I wonder what he'll do to get square?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh something sneaking, you may depend on it," replied Bob. "That's the way with Noddy and his kind. He's nothing but a big bully. Never fights with any one but some one he's sure he can whip. I don't know's I could lick him, but I'd like to try once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me too," said Ned, "after I get over being stiff."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Jack Pender, who was a toady of Noddy Nixon, called on the latter in a sort of club-house in Nixon's yard that night, he found the bully in no amiable frame of mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" asked Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None of your business," snapped Nixon, lighting a cigarette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You needn't be so cross," whined Jack, who was used to rather shabby treatment from the bully, to whom he toadied in the hope of favors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you'd be cross if you had the tumble I did to-day," growled Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Somebody knock you down?" asked Pender, incautiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Somebody knock me down? I'd like to see 'em try it," boasted Noddy. "No. I was out taking a spin, and that young cub of a Ned Slade tried to upset me. I got even with him, though," added Noddy, to whom telling the truth did not come natural. "I gave his wheel a twist and sent him flying. I guess he won't forget his fall in a hurry. He got worse than I did," which was not so, though Jack did not know it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Serves him good and right," chuckled the toady. "I can't bear Ned. He's too uppish. Thinks because his father has a little money he's better than the rest of us. And I haven't any use for his chums, Bob and Jerry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Same here," Agreed Noddy, lighting another cigarette. "But I'll get even with 'em. My father has as much money as any of their fathers has. They needn't think they can down me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bully for you," cried Jack, hoping to curry favor. "I'd like a chance to get even too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe it will come before you think it will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean?" asked Jack in a whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind," replied Noddy. "I'll tell you when the time comes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For some time the two cronies sat and talked in the structure, which Noddy had fixed up as a resort where he might smoke cigarettes, a practice his father had forbidden him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going in the club races?" asked Jack at length. "I hear there will be some fine prizes, and a little chance to make money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean on the winners?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. I got the tips straight from one of the trainers. There'll be a pretty penny in it for us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's worth looking into," decided Noddy. "But about my racing. I hadn't thought of that. I suppose I could go in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After some further talk both Jack and Noddy decided they would enter their names for several events in the bicycle class. When they parted that night they agreed to meet the next evening to discuss details.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not long after dusk the following night Jack and Noddy were in close consultation in "the coop."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hear Ned, Bob and Jerry are going to enter the races," said Jack, after a short conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you're not afraid of them, are you?" asked Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know I can beat either Ned, Bob or Jerry. The only thing is I'm not in good training and I can't spare the time. I'm faster than either of them for a short sprint," which he was. "But in a long race they might down me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jack did not think it wise to comment on the bully's change of ideas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If the races were hundred-yard dashes I wouldn't worry a bit," said Noddy. "I could win hands down. But the best race is for three miles, and that—that's rather a long distance for me. If we could fix things—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How fix?" inquired Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," proceeded Noddy boldly. "I mean to win that race. There's a first prize, worth three hundred dollars, and I want it. I'm going to get it. That's all. If I can't win by fair means—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see," whispered Jack softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you do," retorted Noddy, lighting a cigarette. "I may need your help. We must beat them, Jack. I hate them!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thereupon the two cronies resumed their whisperings, talking in low tones, for they were fearful of being overheard in their plotting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within the next few days arrangements for the races of the athletic club went rapidly on. Bob, Ned and Jerry entered their names, Ned finding that he had no permanent lameness from his "spill." Noddy and Jack also had their names entered. Then all the boys, including many others who had decided to try for the prizes, began training.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were several events on the race card. There were ten and five mile races, but none of the boys thought of trying for them. There were also short distance trys for girls, and also a three mile race, for boys and young men between fourteen and nineteen years of age. The first prize was a three hundred dollar piano, or any other article of that value, and the second and third prizes were of one hundred and fifty and one hundred dollars value respectively. Of course each of our heroes hoped to win big prizes, and there was a keen but friendly rivalry among them.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III A DAY OF THE RACES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last came the day for the races. It was early in July, and the weather though warm, was not oppressive. Early in the morning a big crowd started out toward the grounds of the Cresville Athletic Club, which were about a mile outside of the town proper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned, Bob and Jerry reached the track about ten o'clock, and found it pretty well occupied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will give us good practice in wheeling in a crowd," observed Jerry as he stripped off his sweater and, in regular racing costume, began to make the circuits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His two friends soon followed his example. A little later Noddy and Jack arrived. The two cronies kept to themselves and spoke no word to our three heroes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About noon-time there was a general stopping and all the contestants who were warming up went to get something to eat. Under Jerry's advice Ned and Bob ate and drank sparingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The races were to begin at two o'clock. Long before that hour most of the best seats were filled, and there was a crowd on the way to the athletic grounds that would tax the capacity of the bleachers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About half-past one o'clock a rather gaunt individual might have been seen making his way toward the athletic grounds. He wore a pair of patched trousers and a green coat, with a red patch on either elbow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi there?" called some boys. "Look at the hobo going to enter the races."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I may be a hobo, but I'm not a dodo, put that in your pipe and smoke it till night. That ain't a good rhyme, but it'll do this time," recited the man in a sing-song tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha! Ha! Isn't he funny!" laughed some small boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hearing the sound of laughter Ned, Bob and Jerry, who were walking together in the fields, a short distance away from the athletic grounds, came over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why it's Old Pete!" cried Bob. "Hello Pete! I say, Old Pete Bumps!" he called, waving his hand to the man with a green coat and a red patch on either elbow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I say, is that you, why how do you do?" said Mr., otherwise Old Pete Bumps, who was a general man of all work about Mr. Baker's place. He did everything from feeding the chickens to taking out the ashes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello Pete!" called Jerry and Ned in chorus. "What did you come for? Are you going to race?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Am I going to race? Well not in this place," replied Pete gravely. "I came to watch over you boys. Be a sort of general overseer as it were. Look after the wheels and see that they get full meals," he added without a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From which it may be inferred that Mr. Bumps was something of a character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed at one time he had been a well educated man. But an injury to his head, caused by a fall, and a number of misfortunes, had displaced him from a life of comparative wealth, and had made him a sort of foolish, though very loving, elderly man. Mr. Baker had taken pity on him and made a place for him, for which poor Old Pete Bumps, as he called himself, was very grateful. He was very fond of children, especially boys, and was always looking after the interests of Bob and his chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now Pete can look after our wheels," said Bob. "I was wondering who we could leave in charge between the heats, and while we were dressing. He'll be the very one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Surely will I, e'en though I die," said Pete gravely, for he had a habit of making extemporaneous rhymes on all occasions, which jingles sometimes fitted and sometimes did not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Pete," said Bob. "Come on over here," and he led the hired man to where the boys had left their three wheels in charge of a lad of their acquaintance, who had agreed to stand guard at the rate of five cents a half hour. Pete gravely squatted down on the grass near the bicycles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Relieved of the responsibility of guarding their mounts, the trio of lads wandered about the grounds of the club. There was much bustle and excitement. New riders were constantly arriving and going out on the track to warm up. Hundreds of spectators were coming afoot, or in carriages or automobiles. Flags waved gaily in the wind, and the whole scene was a spirited one. A bevy of girls coming up the road that led to the entrance of the grounds attracted the attention of our three heroes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Looks like my sister Susie with that red dress on," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that seems to be Julia, in that green hat," observed Jerry. "Yes, that's her," he went on. "I can tell by her laugh," he added, as a merry, peal floated over the green field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are the girls with them?" asked Ned, who had no sisters, but who was as fond of girls as they were of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's Mollie Horton, who lives near me," said Ned. "She's jolly enough. And Alice Vines. I don't know who the other one is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's Helen Gale," put in Bob. "I know her. She made that silk flag with our foot-ball colors on last year for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good for her!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girls soon came up, and there was merry talk for a little while. The boys wanted to take the girls over and buy some ice-cream sodas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We haven't time," objected Julia. "We want to get our seats before the races begin. We don't want to miss a one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't miss anything," assured Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh but we might," interposed Alice. "And it is not every day we can come to such a big event as this. If you boys want to get the sodas afterward—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course we will," broke in Jerry. And so they agreed to treat the girls after the races.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not long after Pete had been left in charge of the cycles a man, wearing a slouch hat, who had been but a few minutes before in close consultation with Jack Pender, shuffled up to where Pete was Lying in the grass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Arternoon, mate," said the roughly dressed man in a growling voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, I'm glad to see you," replied Pete, in his sweetest tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What yer givin' us?" demanded the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me? I gave you nothing, sir," replied Pete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come off your high perch then, an' talk United States," went on the stranger gruffly. "My name's Bill Berry, what's yours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name's Pete Bumps, I'm full of humps," recited Pete gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look it," commented Bill Berry. "But I say, mate," he went on. "how would you like to go off and get a good smoke? Come, I'll pay for it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like it first rate, but I must stay here quite late," said Pete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why so? Oh, I don't know," mocked Bill, falling into the eccentric mood of his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To guard the wheels against the steals," replied Pete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't let that worry you," went on Bill, eagerly. "I'll stay here. You go get yourself something to smoke, and take your time. I'll stand guard while you're away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If there was one thing more than another that Old Pete liked, it was to smoke. Usually he had to forego this pleasure because of lack of funds. Now here was a chance to indulge. So, after receiving twenty-five cents from Bill Berry, Pete started over to the grand stand, near which was a booth where cigars and refreshments were sold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bill looked narrowly about as soon as Pete was out of sight. There were plenty of people around him, but no one seemed to be noticing what he was doing. Quickly Bill pulled a wrench from his pocket and used it on each of the three bicycles. Then he brought out a stick of something black.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This graphite is well doctored," he muttered. "I guess it won't be healthy for the chains."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rubbed a liberal supply on the chain of each wheel, and also on the sprockets. Then he rapidly opened the tool bags on each machine, took out the graphite he found there, and substituted some of his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess that will do the trick," he said softly. "And I guess I've earned my two dollars, Jack Pender."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hurried off, mingled with the crowd, and a little later was in conversation with Jack Pender.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later Pete came hurrying back. He was smoking a cheap cigar, and his pockets bulged with others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here you go, Bill, now smoke with a will," began Pete, when he drew near where he had left his new friend in charge of the boys' bicycles. "Why, he's gone," he went on, seeing the deserted mounts. "Wonder where he went?" However, he did not give much thought to it, and went on smoking happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wheels all right?" asked Ned a few minutes after, as he, Jerry and Bob came up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right as a fiddle, come high-diddle," recited Pete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hark! What's that?" asked Chunky suddenly? "Sounds like an announcement."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys ran nearer the grand stand where the official announcer stood. The man was using a small megaphone and went on to say that there had been a slight change in the program, and that the race for those who had never been in a contest before would be the first number instead of the third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great Scott, Chunky! That'll mean you'll have to hustle for all you're worth!" cried Jerry? "Here, get your wheel out, strip off your sweater and get around to the track entrance and have your number pinned on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry grabbed up his chum's wheel, while Ned assisted the lad in pulling his sweater over his head. Then, cautioning Pete to keep a strict look-out, the three boys ran with Bob to the track entrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were only just in time, and found a lot of other contestants ahead of them. Bob received his number, and then, for the first time, thought of his wheel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just spin it for me, to see if it don't need a drop more of oil," Bob asked Jerry. "My hands shake so I can't undo the tool bag."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Obligingly Jerry spun the wheels. The rubber-tired circle went around swiftly for several turns, and then came a sudden slowing down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's funny," remarked Bob? "I had that all adjusted this noon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry bent down and looked at the bearings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The cones have been tightened," he announced? "Why I can feel the friction," and he moved the front wheel slowly with his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Try the back wheel!" urged Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holding that clear of the ground Jerry spun it by placing his foot on the pedal. There was a woeful squeak, and, after a few revolutions that wheel, too, slowed down. Jerry rubbed his finger over the sprocket chain. It came away black from the graphite, but mingled with the blackness were many shining specks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then there came the crack of a revolver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That means three minutes to the start," cried Bob. "What will I do? I can't fix the wheel in that time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some one's put iron filings in the graphite," announced Jerry, rubbing the stuff between his fingers?. "There's trickery here!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'll lose the race!" cried Bob. "I know I have a good chance of winning!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me get my wheel!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It wouldn't do any good," interposed Jerry. "We haven't time to run after them. Besides, the chances are our wheels are doctored too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All ready, boys!" warned the starter. "Minute and a half more before the final gun!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might as well quit," cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you do it!" said some one suddenly at his side. "Here, you take my wheel. It's a racer, and I've just oiled it." As he spoke a boy, of about thirteen years, who had a slight acquaintance with our three heroes, shoved a handsome new wheel over toward Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, thank you, Sam Morton," said Bo. "But don't you want it yourself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit," said Sam. "I'm not going to race. Take the wheel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, I will," assented Bob. "And I'll square things with you afterward, Sam. Some one has doctored mine. I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Bob did not have time to say any more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Half a minute!" warned the starter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get on the track!" cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Line up! Do your best and win!" counseled Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will!" shouted back Bob, and the next instant he was lined up with the others, waiting for the pistol shot that would start them off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Crack!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little puff of smoke, a sliver of flame, and a slight report. Then the whirr of rubber tires on the track sounded like the wind rushing through the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The race, while it was of much interest to the contestants and their friends, was not very important to the general public. It was only a mile sprint and there were ten starters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob's heart beat wildly at first and his wheel wobbled from side to side. Then the fever of fear left him. He saw that he was not being left behind and he picked up courage. He shut his teeth tightly, took a long breath, and let out a burst of speed that carried him to within three of the leader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a cheer at this, which gave him new courage, and he struggled harder and harder. Gradually he passed two of those ahead of him. There now remained but one lad between himself and the lead. He gave one quick glance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's Jack Pender," he thought. "I know he's been in races before. But I'm going to beat him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more Bob clenched his teeth and let out another burst of speed. But he had a good rider to contend against. Jack, looking behind and seeing the boy he hated, redoubled his efforts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The race was half done. Already several who had no chance had dropped out. The struggle was between Bob and Jack. Bob could hear the band playing, as if it was a mile away. He drew one long breath, threw into his leg muscles another ounce of strength and then, with an effort that surprised even himself he found that he was on even terms with Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Confound you! What are you trying to do, beat me?" snapped Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you're not going to!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jack gave his wheel a sudden turn. His intention was to upset Bob. But the latter was too quick for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Foul! Foul!" cried several who had seen the attempt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two passed the post set an eighth of a mile from the finish, neck and neck. Bob could see that Jack was almost winded. As for Bob, though in distress he still had some reserve strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, with a last final burst of speed, with a frenzied effort that sent the blood singing to his head, Bob passed his rival, and came under the tape a winner by two good lengths.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" cried thousands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" cried Ned and Jerry, though Bob could not hear them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Bob, almost tumbling from his wheel, felt happier than he ever had in his life before. He had won the race.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He could see Jack Pender scowling at him, but he did not mind that.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know you were an amateur, Jack," Bob heard one of the toady's friends address him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not any more," laughed Jack. "That was my last amateur race. I'm going in with the professionals on the next race, and I'm going to win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are if we let you," was the response.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV THE THREE MILE RACE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as Ned and Jerry had congratulated Bob, which they did with glad hearts, they hurried from where they had watched him winning the race, to the place where Old Pete had been left in charge of the wheels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The chances are we'll find them doctored," said Jerry. "Only we'll have an opportunity to fix them before our race, if they aren't too badly tampered with."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob returned the wheel he had won on to its owner, Sam Morton, and offered to share the prize with him, but Sam would not hear of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was only too glad to help you out," he said. You ought to make a complaint to the officers of the club about your wheel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait until I find out who monkeyed with it," said Bob, "and I'll take care of him without any complaint," and he doubled up his fist suggestively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three chums, Bob carrying his own disabled wheel, hurried to where Pete was. They found that worthy consuming his third cheap cigar, evidently in great enjoyment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry and Ned made a hasty examination of their bicycles, and quickly discovered something wrong with each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same scoundrel that tampered with Bob's was at ours," said Ned. "Bearings tightened and steel filings in the graphite. Who was it, I wonder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, Pete," began Bob, "did any one touch our wheels while we were away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a one, my dear son," recited Pete with a wise air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here Pete, you drop that poetry and attend to business," said Bob, somewhat sternly. "Were you here every minute since we left?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I went over to get some cigars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And who stayed with the wheels while you were away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Friend of mine. Bill Berry, fat as a cherry," replied Pete, unable to resist the temptation to make a rhyme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here—" started in Bob, fiercely. "I'll have to—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That explains it," broke in Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Explains what?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Explains who had a hand in this," went on Jerry. "You know Bill, who isn't any too good a character about town, and Jack Pender have been quite thick of late. Two or three times I've caught them whispering together down to the post office."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This much. You know what a sneak Jack is, always toadying around that bully Nixon. Well, Nixon threatened to get even with all of us on account of that little spill he and Ned had. This is how he's done it. He's got Jack to do his dirty work, and Jack has hired Bill to doctor our wheels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"While we were away Bill comes over here, bribes poor old Pete with the offer of something to smoke to leave him in charge for a little while, and does the trick. Didn't Bill give you something to smoke?" demanded Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He give me the money, now ain't that funny," sang Pete, without a thought of the consequences of his act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just it," agreed Ned and Bob, and they complimented Jerry on his shrewdness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that was easy enough to figure out," said the lad. "The question is, can we get our wheels in shape for the race? We've got about half an hour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys lost no more time in idle regrets. Tool bags were opened, and with wrenches and screw drivers the three set to work adjusting the bearings properly. Though this was a somewhat delicate task they succeeded in about ten minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now to clean the chains," said Bob. "That graphite must all come off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Kerosene oil is the best," suggested Jerry. "Hurrah!" he shouted. "This will do!" and he set off on the run.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few seconds he reached a lantern that was fastened on a pole, and used, at night, to illuminate the driveway to the club-house. "This is just what we needed," he said. "We'll borrow a little kerosene from the lamp."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tin reservoir held more than was needed, and in another minute each boy was busy cleaning his chain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now to put some fresh graphite on, and we'll be in good shape," cried Ned, in high glee over the successful outcome of the plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry was the first to take his stick of lubricant from his tool bag. As he did so he gave a start. Then he rubbed some of the black material between his thumb and finger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought so!" he exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Doctored?" inquired Ned and Jerry nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Iron or steel filings," he said. "Lucky there is plenty of graphite to be had, or we'd be stuck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did not take long to borrow from other cyclists some of the stuff, and the chains were soon lubricated. The boys still had five minutes before their race would be called. They spent the time in resting from their hustling labors. They had fixed things just in time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the meantime Noddy had been rather busy about the track. He prided himself on being a sport and was seeking some one who would lay wagers with him. He made several on various events, profiting by what Jack Pender said were sure tips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if we can't bet something on this race we're in?" asked Noddy of his toady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see why not," assented Jack. "I think you have a good chance of winning, with those three young cubs out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Noddy busied himself, putting up what was a large sum even for a youth whose father kept him liberally supplied with pocket money. As a matter of fact Noddy went so deep into the betting that he had to lay considerable of the money on "wind." That is he did not have in his pocket the money he would have to pay if he lost. But then he did not think of losing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His last wager, laid just before the time of the three mile race, was with Paul Banner. "Polly," the boys called him, for young Banner aspired to be what, a few years ago, was called a dude. He was fond of dressing in the height of fashion, and liked to be thought a sport. He had a small income, did not work, and spent most of his time at the athletic club.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll give you odds of two to one against the favorite in this race," said Noddy to Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And who's the favorite?" asked Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jerry Hopkins," replied Noddy. "Come, what do you say? Two to one he doesn't win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're on. For how much?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll lay you one hundred dollars to fifty dollars," said Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Done," assented Paul, and he made a memorandum of the wager.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last, after several events had been run off, during which our heroes had been busy undoing the mischief worked to their wheels, the time came for the race that meant so much to them. The announcer gave the word. Ned, Bob and Jerry hastened around to the track entrance. Noddy and Jack, with their wheels, were a few seconds behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, they're on hand, I see," whispered Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, they'll start, and that will be about all," replied Jack, with a meaning smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a few minutes there was considerable work getting the dozen riders correctly placed. Finally they were all lined up on the white mark, and the starter raised his revolver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bang!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Off in the air lazily floated a little puff of smoke. Then the cyclists were off like the wind. My! how they did go!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy Nixon, who, to give him the credit he deserved, was not a bad sprinter, was in the lead. He was pedaling at top speed, for he knew only by acquiring a big lead could he hope to win.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was an excited shout from the spectators as they saw the start of the race, and realized that the favorite was left in the lurch. But if Jerry was disconcerted, or if either Ned or Bob was, not one of them showed it. After a few seconds Noddy glanced back. He was surprised to see Jerry rather closer to him than he hoped to find him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you said the wheels would lag behind," said Noddy to Jack, who was riding furiously beside him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They must have discovered the trick and fixed things up," panted Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there was no time to talk. It was to be a race to the finish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll fix them, though," muttered Jack, letting up on his speed, which had kept him beside Noddy, and dropping back a little to the rear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aside from the three chums, and Noddy and Jack, there was no interest in the race, for the other seven contestants were hopelessly in the rear. Bob and Ned were on even terms, with Jerry somewhat ahead of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go on, Jerry!" called Ned. "Beat the big bully!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't either of you fellows drop out!" pleaded Jerry. "Try to win. You've as good a chance as I."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then Jerry gave his attention to the task before him. It was no light one. However, he, as did the other two boys, felt the bicycles to be in good order in spite of the attempts at foul play. They were all riding well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy's advantage in age, his better muscular development, gave him a big lead, however, and for the first mile the gap between him and Jerry was scarcely shortened. Jack still hung on to his comrade's rear, ready to play another dastardly trick when opportunity offered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the second mile it was plain to all that Noddy was petering out. His head bent lower over the handle bars, and foam, like white cotton, could be seen on his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm almost all in!" he gasped to Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep up a little longer!" entreated Jack. "You'll win! Why, you've got to win!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, to save himself in more ways than one, Noddy felt he must succeed. But how to do it was the question. His heart was beating like a trip-hammer, and his head felt as if it would burst.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He tried to develop another burst of sped, but, as he had said, he was "all in." Slowly he felt, rather than saw, Jerry creeping up on him. He knew that Jack was between him and his rival, however, and he hoped something might happen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The crowd on the bleachers and on the grand stand nearly went wild as they looked at the most exciting race so far that day. The favorite was slowly but surely creeping up on the leader, and crowding him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go on Jerry!" cried hundreds who wanted to see the plucky lad win. "Go on! Go on!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Peg away, Noddy!" shouted one or two of the bully's friends, who had, thanks to his tips or those of Jack, put their money up on him. "Keep going!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it was no use. The gap between Jerry and Noddy lessened. Ned and Bob were close behind Jerry, and stood excellent chances of being at least third and fourth. But there was Jack to be reckoned with as well as Noddy, and Jerry knew this. He felt he must keep clear of Jack, for he had seen the attempted foul when Bob was racing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, with a wildly beating heart, Jerry decided that the time had come to make his final sprint. He had just started on the last half mile. He grasped the handle bars with a firmer grip, shut his teeth hard and took a long breath. The burst of speed he then let out amazed and delighted the audience. There were wild cheers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy looked back in despair. He saw that Jerry and Jack were on even terms. Then something happened. The something that Jack had promised to have up his sleeve. With a quick motion he sent his wheel, ever so little over toward Jerry. The act was hardly noticeable on the stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep off!" cried Jerry, seeing what Jack had in mind. "Do you want to have an upset?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You never mind me!" snarled Jack. "I'll do as I please!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again he gave his wheel a twist. He was now riding dangerously close to Jerry. Noddy was barely a length ahead. There was a quarter of a mile to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep back, do you hear!" yelled Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep back yourself!" retorted Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Jack deliberately fouled Jerry. He sent his front wheel against that of his rival, intending to cause an upset. But he reckoned without his host. Bob, who had, by a sudden sprint, approached nearer to Jerry than Ned, saw what was up. Without an instant's hesitation Bob sent his wheel crashing full into Jack's from the rear, and, amid a roar of surprise and terror from the spectators, the two boys went down in a heap on the track.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's killed. They're killed!" cried scores.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry, with grim determination in his eyes, rode on, never looking back. Noddy cast a frightened glance over his shoulder, and, when he saw what had happened his heart grew faint. He nearly lost control of his wheel. The little swerve he gave it was fatal to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like a flash Jerry dashed in, took the pole, and with a burst of speed, that set the excited spectators into cheer after cheer, Jerry passed Noddy, and won by a good five lengths.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jerry wins! The favorite wins!" shrieked the assemblage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Bob was out of the race, by his own act of self-sacrifice in saving Jerry, Ned had managed, by clever riding to escape the spill. He saw his chance when Noddy looked back, and, with a fierce effort passed the bully and came in a good second.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even the privilege of being third was denied Noddy. He lost control of his wheel before he could cross the finish line, and one of the stragglers in the race, who had been merely hanging on the tail end, sprinted up and came in third, so that, for all their plans, Noddy and his toady came to grief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were congratulations after congratulations for Ned and Jerry. The boys blushed almost like girls as they received the praises that sounded in their ears. There was some talk of the spill, but when it was seen that neither Jack nor Bob was hurt there was no further alarm. At first Jack sputtered and threatened to complain that he was deliberately run down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go ahead," said Bob coolly. "I saw what you tried to do to Jerry, and I know something about Bill Berry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that Jack and his bully friend sneaked off without a word. They felt that it needed but a few words on the part of the three chums to get them into trouble, and they were glad enough to escape as easily as they did.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I appreciate what you did, Chunky," said Jerry. "You practically won the race for me, and you had a good chance yourself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hadn't a chance in the world with you in it," replied Bob. "Besides I won my race, so what did I want with another? I just had to run him down to save you. I'm glad I did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't forget it," exclaimed Jerry, warmly, as he grasped his chum's hand heartily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then the three boys, each one of whom had won a valuable prize that day, gathered up their wheels and belongings and prepared to start for home.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V A DEMAND FOR MONEY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Probably there was no more disgusted person at the races that day than Noddy Nixon. He was mad at himself, at Jack, and more than angry at Bob, Ned and Jerry. He felt very bitter in his heart toward them, though it was all his own fault. Another matter that troubled him was the money he had lost on bets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm in a deep hole," he muttered as he left the athletic grounds, "and how to get out I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For few of the tips that Jack had given proved good ones, and Noddy had lost in all about two hundred dollars. This was more money than he had possessed in some time, though an indulgent father kept him well supplied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's my father?" asked Noddy in surly tones as the maid answered his ring at the handsome house on the hill where the Nixon family lived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In his study, Mr. Noddy," answered the girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now to beard the lion in his den," whispered the young man to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In answer to Noddy's knock—rather a timid, hesitating sort of a knock, and not in keeping with the bully's usual bluster—Mr. Nixon bade his son enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Noddy?" asked Mr. Nixon, who was fond of the young man, in spite of his bad manners at times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty fair," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you go to the races? Of course you must have, to judge by your costume."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I went," replied Noddy. "I rode in one, just as a sort of practice. I didn't try to win. I only wanted to get in form. But say, father," he went on rapidly. "I need some money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Money!" exclaimed Mr. Nixon, laying aside the book he had been reading, and looking over the tops of his spectacles. "Money? Why do you know how much you have had in the last month?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not so much," replied Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For answer Mr. Nixon rapidly turned over the pages of a memorandum book. When he came to a certain page he stopped and begin adding up some figures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The total, since the middle of last month, when I began keeping the account, to the present time, which is just about four weeks of time, is three hundred and seventy-five dollars," said Mr. Nixon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had no idea it was so much," muttered Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And now you want more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must have about two hundred dollars, father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two hundred dollars! Great Scott, young man I do you think money grows on trees? What do you want with two hundred dollars? Are you going to start in business?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I need it to pay a few debts with," murmured Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry," said Mr. Nixon, closing the book, "but I can't let you have any more money now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But father, I simply must have it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll not get it from me, young man. I'm tired of handing you over money to waste on foolishness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm going to have that money," retorted Noddy, speaking in an excited tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, young man," answered his father, "don't let me hear you speak to me again like that. Remember you are not of age, and until you are you are under my control. Remember also that you are not too big to be whipped. I am inclined to think that would be a good thing for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to see any one try it," retorted Noddy impudently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leave the room! Leave the room, sir!" exclaimed Mr. Nixon, rising to his feet, his face white with anger. "I do not want to lose my temper, and act hastily. Leave the room at once, "and he pointed to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy, with a sullen and hateful glance at his parent, passed through the portal. He slammed the door behind him, giving vent to the anger that raged within him. After the young man was gone Mr. Nixon sank down in a chair. He was trembling, and tears stood in his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To think that my oldest son should be so thoughtless of the respect due me," he sighed. "I wish he was better. Perhaps if he had had to work as hard as I did to make my fortune he would not be so wasteful. But I simply can not let him spend any more money at present. It is for his own good, but he can't seem to see it. Ah me! I wish he was a better son."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy went to his room, put on another suit after doffing his bicycle clothes, and then ordered one of the maids to get him something to eat. After a hasty meal he left the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if I couldn't borrow some money, from Tom Judson," mused Noddy, as he reached the centre of the town, and proceeded along the streets filled with people coming home from work. "He must be at the mill office yet. I'll try, any how."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom, the son of Amos Judson, who owned a large iron mill in Cresville, was a young man whose acquaintance Noddy had made some time before. Ordinarily Tom was well supplied with money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy found Tom in the mill office. It was about closing time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, Tom!" greeted Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, yourself!" responded Tom, genially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom," went on Noddy rapidly, seeing there was no one within hearing, "can you lend me three hundred dollars? I need it to pay a bill with in a hurry, and I haven't time to go home. The governor would let me have it for the asking. I'll pay you back in a couple of days."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For answer Tom slowly turned one pocket after another inside out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dead broke!" he laughed. "Just paid my board bill and I can't get any cash until Saturday night. Sorry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I," joined in Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you want to crack the safe there," went on Tom, pointing to an old-fashioned one that stood in a corner, "you could get three hundred dollars, and more. I saw dad put one thousand dollars in bills in there a while ago. Some people paid their debts late this afternoon, and he didn't want to go to the bank so near closing time. But I guess you don't want to crack a safe, do you, Noddy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," replied Noddy, with an uneasy laugh, as he left the mill office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night," called Tom, as he proceeded to put his books away. Then, seeing that the safe was closed, and locking the office door, he went home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Everything fails me," muttered Noddy. "But I simply must raise the cash—somehow. I wonder—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But he hardly dared whisper even to himself the thought that came into his mind.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI AT THE CLUB HOUSE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Following the last of the races at the athletic grounds it was announced that the Cresville Club would tender, that night, a reception to all participants and their friends. There was to be a little entertainment and refreshments would be served. The prizes would also be awarded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob and his sister Susie were going, Ned would be there and Jerry Hopkins had promised to take Julia. Besides it was expected that a number of boys and girls, friends of the three chums, would be present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Bob, Ned and Jerry, with the two girls, reached the club house that evening, they found a big crowd already there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, there's Alice Vines and Helen Gale!" exclaimed Susie, leaving her brother and running over to where the girls stood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and there's Mollie Horton!" exclaimed Julia. "I'm real glad she came," and Julia ran from her brother and joined Mollie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it looks as if we'd have to paddle our own canoes," remarked Jerry, with a laugh. "Deserted the first thing, after the glorious victories we won, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's pretend we don't want to talk to them," suggested Ned. "That's the surest way to bring the girls around," which holds true of old as well as young girls, it may be said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come down stairs and I'll treat you all to ice-cream," invited Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys were hurrying away, not looking in the direction of the girls, when there was a flurry of skirts and a miniature cyclone descended about the lads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that I heard about ice-cream?" asked Julia, with a laugh, as she ran up and grasped her brother by the arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you hear anything?" asked Jerry, in an innocent tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and I happen to have some sort of a vague recollection about a promise of ice-cream sodas made by some one this afternoon," went on the girl, laughing. "Do you boys recall anything about that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess the joke is on us, boys," said Bob. "Come along, girls, you shall have the ice-cream."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a jolly little party that gathered about the ice-cream tables. They had almost finished one plate each, when a boy with light hair, that never seemed to be combed, and blue eyes that twinkled like two stars and a mouth that always seemed to be open, either while he was talking or laughing, came up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello girls! Hello fellows!" he exclaimed rapidly, and talking by jerks. "Fine night—big crowd—lots of people—have some more cream?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Easy, easy," pleaded Jerry. "You talk like a house afire, Andy Rush."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rush by name—Rush by nature," spluttered Andy. "Come, what is it? Ice-cream—candy cake—lemonade—pick the winner!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I guess the girls wouldn't object to some more cream," spoke Bob. "As for me, ice-cream sort of palls after one big plate. I'll have some lemonade."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andy joined the little party, and added to the fun. He never seemed to stop talking, and he didn't seem to care whether any one listened. "Prizes going to be given out," cried Andy, presently, hurrying up stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was a signal for a general breaking up of the little party. As each of the three chums came in for a prize they had to be near the platform, where Mr. Wakefield, the athletic instructor of the club, gave out the trophies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was quite a jam of people in the main room of the club, where seats had been placed to accommodate the assemblage. The boys found it rather difficult to get near the platform, but finally succeeded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob's name was the first called. He blushed as he went forward to receive a fine diamond scarf pin that was the first prize in the amateur race class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After several other trophies had been given out came the turn of Jerry to go forward and get the first prize for the three mile race. It was announced that the winner of this could have his choice of any article to the value of three hundred dollars. The money could not be given, as that would put the winner in the professional class, Mr. Wakefield said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We thought of giving a three hundred dollar piano as the first trophy," said Mr. Wakefield, "but there is no obligation to take that, as it is not purchased. Now, Jerry, what would you like?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it can be bought for that amount of money I'll have a motor-cycle," replied Jerry after a moment's thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the stuff!" called Bob in such a loud whisper that it was heard all over the room, and caused considerable laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And a motor-cycle you shall have," said Mr. Wakefield. "The finest that can be bought. I am glad you took that. It gives me a chance to say that in the future the club intends having some motor-cycle races. Perhaps you will compete, Jerry, and if you do I hope you will do your best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three cheers for Jerry Hopkins!" called some one, and they were given with a will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your prize is not quite as optional as was Jerry's," said Mr. Wakefield, when Ned came forward in answer to his name. "Still we hope you will like it. I have picked out this for you," and he gave the boy a magazine rifle of the most expensive make, a regular beauty, at the sight of which Ned's eyes sparkled with joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three cheers for Ned Slade!" shouted a voice at the back of the room, and Ned was cheered until his face grew red with blushes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not long before all the prizes had been given out. Then followed an entertainment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's go back and sit with the girls," suggested Ned. The three chums moved down the centre aisle, and found that the young ladies had anticipated their coming and had saved seats for them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a jolly little party that gathered about the ice-cream tables.— Page 49 Image of the formally attired Motor Boys sitting at a table with two formally dressed women.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wakefield sought out Jerry and whispered that his motor-cycle would be ordered at once, and would probably arrive in the course of a couple of weeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't it queer," said Ned. "Do you remember that day how we were talking about getting motor-cycles?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I remember," replied Jerry. "But I didn't think I would have one so soon. I wish you and Bob were going to get them now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to see if I can't," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Same here," came from the heavy-weight youth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The party, increased by late comers, was more jolly than before, and laughter and jokes made the hours pass so pleasantly that when twelve o'clock boomed out on the chiming time-piece of the club, there was a chorus of cries from the girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh I How late it is!" almost screamed Mollie Horton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And mother told me to be sure and be home by eleven," came from Alice. "We must start, girls."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The majority of boys and girls lived in the same neighborhood. They paired off, as young folks will, when they approach the age of sentiment, and by two marched down the now quiet streets of Cresville, singing snatches of songs. It was a bright moon-light night, and the young people enjoyed every moment of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned, who had no sister to worry about, had asked permission to take Alice Vines home. She lived some distance from the others, though her route was the same as theirs for a little way. When it came time for Alice and Ned to take another path, they bade their companions good-night, and started off down the street together. Alice lived about half a mile from the parting of the ways, and Ned thought the distance all too short.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've had a very pleasant time," said Alice, when she reached her gate. "Thank you very much for bringing me home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The pleasure was all mine, I assure you," said Ned with a gallant bow, whereat Alice laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Ned started home alone. His way lay past the Judson iron mill, a rather lonesome part of the town, but Ned did not care. Once he wished he had brought his new rifle along, instead of leaving it at the club house. Then he laughed to himself at his fears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After he had passed his father's store, which was in darkness, he came to a part of the town where there were no street lamps. However the moon gave considerable light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were mysterious shadows, too, and once Ned thought one took on the shape of a man sneaking around a corner. He came to a halt, his heart beating wildly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pshaw! It must have been a cloud," he declared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later he came nearer the iron mill. It was located on the bank of a river, and the rushing of the water sounded rather uncanny in the lonesome night. Once more Ned started as he beheld a shadow glinting along the street ahead of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's no moon-shadow," argued the boy. "That's the outline of a man, if ever there was one. And it looked for all the world like Bill Berry. Well, I don't know's I'm afraid of him, and he certainly isn't of me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked on boldly, whistling to keep up his courage, though he would have disputed that point had any one accused him. Then he came in full view of the mill. Through the glass door of the office he caught sight of a light. He gave a sudden start and hurried forward.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII NODDY AND THE SQUARE BOX</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A light in the mill!" exclaimed Ned softly. There must be something wrong. I never saw one there before. Mr. Judson has no night watchman either, unless he has gotten one in the last few days, which I doubt. I wonder what's up?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the rather disagreeableness of the task Ned resolved to keep watch for a little while and see what developed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found a stone where he could sit down in the shadow and observe events. For some time nothing happened. The little light glowed steadily. Then it began to flicker and to move about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly, off to the left, Ned heard a sound. It was just as if some one was walking along and trying to avoid making a noise. Only the breaking of a little piece of wood now and then, or the rattle of a pebble, showed that some one was moving.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned crouched down behind the stone on which he had been sitting. He peered forward, straining his eyes in the uncertain light to catch the least glimpse of who ever was approaching. He started as he saw a man, bending low so as to conceal as much of himself as possible, steal from the yard of the mill and take up his position on the other side of the street, about fifty feet from where Ned was concealed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm almost certain that was Bill Berry," whispered Ned. "I'm positive now that something wrong is afoot. Bill isn't out on a night like this for any good. I wonder if I ought to run for help?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For some time Ned kept watchful eyes in the direction Bill, or the man he supposed was him, had gone. He could see him, crouched all in a heap, beside a stone, just as Ned himself was. And the man seemed to be keeping a watch on the mill, exactly as Ned was doing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe there are robbers in the mill now," argued Ned, "and Bill is keeping guard. I've a good notion to go and see if I can't find a policeman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more Ned heard a movement in the direction of the mysterious watcher. He looked and saw the man straighten up and look cautiously about him. Then he saw him steal across the street, go up to the door of the mill office, and peer in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I dared do that," thought Ned. "Then I'd know whether I'm making a fool of myself, staying out like this when I ought to be in bed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For more than a minute Bill Berry, for Ned could see plainly now that the man was the town bad character, stood and gazed into the mill office. Then, apparently satisfied with what he had seen, Bill tip-toed away and passed down the street and out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now it's my turn," whispered Ned, and he moved forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked up. The light was still glowing though faintly. Ned set his foot on the first wooden step. As if it had been a signal agreed upon the light went out suddenly, and the office was in darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Queer!" exclaimed Ned. "I wonder if whoever is in there could have heard me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A moment's reflection, however, showed him this could not have been the case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe they are watching and saw me," he argued. This made him feel a little strange. To think that in the darkness, there might be evil eyes watching his every movement was not a pleasant thought. He knew that he could be seen from within the mill, though he himself could observe nothing inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Might as well look in, though, now I'm here," he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he boldly, but softly, went up the five steps, and, placing his hands on either side of his face, to shut out the little light of the moon that, now and then, straggled through the clouds, Ned peered anxiously into the office. As he had feared he could distinguish nothing. It was as black as the proverbial pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned walked down the steps. As he did so ho thought he heard, from within the mill, a sound, as if a door was slammed. He listened intently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I must have fancied it," he said. "I must be getting nervous. That won't do. All the same I would like to have seen what Bill Berry did when he looked in while the light was there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this thought in mind Ned moved off. The iron mill took up quite a large space of ground, what would be termed a city block, and there were streets on three sides of it, besides a road along the river, between the stream and the mill. A high fence surrounded all but the front of the mill, though there were gates in it at intervals to admit the workmen and teams. To get to his home Ned had to go to the farthest end of the mill fence, and turn up a street there. He was walking toward the corner, and was close to it, when he heard footsteps approaching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hesitated a moment. Then he reflected that he had as much right to be where he was as any one. The footsteps came nearer and nearer. Then, as Ned proceeded he turned the corner, and came face to face with Noddy Nixon!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then the moon, which had been hidden by a cloud, came out brightly. By its gleam Ned could distinguish the bully's features clearly. They bore a look of mingled rage and fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, Noddy," said Ned, resolving in spite of all that had taken place, to speak friendly. "Fine night, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here!" burst out Noddy. "Are you spying on me? Can't I go to the river to get some fish bait without having every young cub in Cresville at my heels?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wasn't spying on you, as you call it," said Ned quietly, "and if you think so the less I have to say to you the better off I'll be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've a mind to knock your head off," spluttered Noddy. "Just mind your own business or you'll get into trouble, and it will be a kind you won't like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned did not deem the remarks worthy of an answer. He turned and was hurrying past. As he did so he noticed that Noddy held tightly under one arm a small square box. It seemed to be made of wood. Catching Ned's glance at what he carried, Noddy rapidly shifted the box until it was hidden under his coat. Then, with angry mutterings, he hurried on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather a queer sort of box to use for his fish bait," thought Ned. "I wonder what he was up to, any how? And I wonder what that light in the mill meant? I've had quite a few adventures to-night. Guess I'd better get home before I meet with any more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he walked rapidly on, and reached his house without further incident. He soon fell asleep, to dream of being shut up in a small square wooden box with a big fish, while Noddy Nixon, on a motor-cycle, was riding off rapidly with the box under his arm.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII THE MILL MYSTERY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you heard the news—great excitement—big robbery—everybody talking about it—hurry up!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was thus Andy Rush greeted Ned the next morning as he stopped at the latter's house on the way down town. Andy's hair was more disarranged than ever, and his blue eyes fairly shone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's up?" asked Ned, who had come to the door in answer to Andy's whistle, having been met with the flow of words that startled him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Last night—midnight, I guess—Judson's mill—thousand dollars—great excitement—safe blown open—money taken—detectives notified—I'm off to see the fun—hurry up!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on!" called Ned. "I saw—I know—" and then he stopped. The memory of what he had seen in the night; the light in the mill, the actions of Bill Berry, and his meeting with Noddy Nixon, who carried a square box; all this came to Ned in an instant. He was about to tell Andy, but on second thought decided that he had better keep his own counsel, at least, for a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Coming along?—no time to lose!" cried Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be down after I have breakfast," replied Ned, waving a farewell to Andy, and returning to the house sorely puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ate his breakfast rapidly. He hardly knew what to do in reference to what he had witnessed during his watch at the mill. After some thought he decided to wait a little while, learn more particulars of the robbery, and then relate everything to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a little while Mr. Slade left the house and Ned soon followed. When the lad reached the centre of the town he needed no one to tell him that there was considerable excitement. In a small place like Cresville news spreads quickly even without a daily paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned soon found his chums, Bob and Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you heard about it?" demanded Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Andy Rush told me," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he told me, too," put in Bob. "That fellow is as swift as his name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you hear any particulars?" demanded Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was an old-fashioned safe, according to what the policeman told me," said Jerry, "and the burglars had little trouble in getting it open."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did they blow it apart?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, simply took a chisel and hammer and cut the lock out. The door was only soft iron."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the three boys were near the mill. There was quite a crowd about, and several policemen were on guard, preventing any one, but those having business, from entering the establishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One side, please," called a man suddenly, coming up behind the three chums. "I'm in a hurry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys turned aside, to give passage to short, stout fussy man, who seemed in a tremendous state of excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's Sheriff Blackwell," said Jerry. "I suppose he thinks the robbers are here waiting for him to arrest them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was really little news of the robbery to be had. Mr. Judson related what particulars he knew to the police.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had a little more than one thousand dollars on hand late yesterday afternoon," he said to the officers. "Several people paid me some bills, and as it was late, I didn't go to the bank, but locked the money up in the safe. I seldom do this, as the iron box is no match for burglars. As far as I know the only persons who knew the money was in the safe were my son and myself. I am sure neither he nor I told any one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must get right to work looking up clues," said the sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there were apparently no clues. As has been said, the door of the safe was of soft iron. The robber, or robbers, had used a cold chisel and a hammer, and cut out a section of the door around the big clumsy lock. Then it was a comparatively easy matter to get at the cash. The thieves had left nothing behind them that would throw any light on the mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having learned all they could, and seeing that there were likely to be no developments at the mill, the three chums wandered up the street. All the while Ned was busy thinking. Finally he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys, I've something to tell you. I want to ask your advice. It's about the robbery. Come where we can find a quiet place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the three chums were sitting comfortably beneath a big oak tree, that cast a pleasant shade from the sun, which was already hot, though it was early in the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, let's hear the yarn," said Chunky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thereupon Ned told what he had seen while watching the mill the previous night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I should say you did know something about the robbery," commented Jerry. "Why didn't you tell this to the police?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did think of it," said Ned. "But I wanted to get some advice first. You see the light may or may not have had a connection with the crime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but it looks suspicious, seeing Bill Berry around," came from Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure it was him?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As sure as I am that I'm talking to you now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And are you just as positive that it was Noddy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Even more so. Wasn't I talking to him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he said he had fish bait in the square box?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He didn't exactly say so, but he intimated as much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it was fish bait, why should he try to hide it, as you say he did?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what puzzles me," replied Ned. "I only wish I had seen what Bill saw in the mill office when the light was burning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe Bill is the robber," suggested Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hardly think so," was Ned's opinion. "He may have had some connection with it, and may even have known about it. But, in my opinion the person who took the thousand dollars was the person who had the light in the office, and that wasn't Bill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you—do you think Noddy—er—Noddy took the money?" asked Bob in a hesitating tone. He felt rather delicate about accusing an acquaintance, even one so undesirable as Noddy, of a serious crime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I hate to think so, but it does look suspicious," said Ned. "He certainly acted afraid because he met me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could any one get out of the office any way except going through the front door?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," replied Ned. "There is a back door that goes out into the mill yard. From the yard a person could pass onto the road along the river, and then come up along the north side of the mill fence, on Peterson street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And it was at the corner of Peterson street and Maple alley that you met Noddy, wasn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just where it was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was silence for a few minutes among the boys. Each one was busy with disagreeable thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did any of you hear how the mill of lice door was opened?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The lock wasn't forced on either the back or front door," answered Jerry. "So I was told. The police think the robber used a skeleton key."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it comes right down to a question. Is Noddy Nixon guilty?" asked Bob solemnly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's hard to decide," replied Ned. "I'd hate to accuse any one, even when things look as suspicious as they do now. Do you think I ought to tell the police? Perhaps they will arrest both Bill and Noddy on suspicion."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd have to be a witness against them, and that would not be very pleasant," suggested Jerry. "Besides their word would be as good as yours in court, and you have no proof. I think the best thing to do is to wait a while. If suspicion points more strongly to Noddy or Bill, then you can come forward and tell what you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I'll wait a while," said Ned. "In the meantime we can, all three, have an eye on Noddy and Bill. They may do something or say something that would give us a clue."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's another thing I don't believe any of us have thought of," came from Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you know, Mr. Nixon, Noddy's father, owns several shares in Judson's mill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure of that?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Positive. I heard mother saying something about it the other day. It seems the concern was made a stock company not long ago, and Mr. Judson wanted mother to invest some of her money in it. He remarked at the time that Mr. Nixon had taken ten shares of the stock, and thought it a good investment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That might or might not throw additional suspicion on Noddy," remarked Ned. "If he knew his father was interested, financially, in the iron mill, he hardly would take money that he knew might cause his father a loss."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, all this talking don't bring matters any nearer a solution," said Jerry, finally. "I think all we can do is to wait and watch."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And meet every day to compare notes," suggested Ned.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX THE QUEER BANK BILL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the afternoon of the day the robbery of the mill was discovered. Ned, after his conference with his two chums, had gone down to his father's store. He wanted to talk to Mr. Slade about the prospects of getting a motor-cycle. For, now that Jerry was about to get one, the desire on Ned's part was all the stronger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While standing in the front of the big department establishment his father owned Ned was surprised to see, passing on the other side of the street, Noddy Nixon and Paul Banner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's queer," commented Ned. "I didn't know Noddy and Paul were as chummy as that. They didn't used to have much use for each other."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the idea suddenly came to him, that here was the very opportunity he desired. He could follow Noddy and Paul, and see if he might learn anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bully and the dude, as Ned could observe from time to time, did not seem to be exactly in accord. At times they would almost come to a halt, and dispute over something. Noddy seemed to be objecting to some course of action proposed by Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They must be going to the old wind mill," commented Ned, as he saw Noddy and Paul turn down a street that led to an old-fashioned, and deserted flour mill, that, in by-gone days, had been operated by wind power. The mill was a good distance from the edge of the town, in the centre of a big field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sure enough that was the destination of the two young men. Ned was as close after them as he dared to go. There was little risk of his being noticed while he was on the streets, but, after leaving them there was greater danger of detection for the trailer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"However," argued Ned. "as long as I know where they are going, I don't need to keep so close after them. I can wait until they get to the mill, and then I can go there too. By coming up from the back, where there are no windows, which I can do by going through Hedges's Lane, they can't see me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He approached the mill rapidly from the rear. As he came within hearing distance he could distinguish voices. And they seemed to be disputing. The ancient establishment was full of cracks and broken places, and the noise from inside passed out freely. Nearer and nearer hurried Ned. At last he reached the broad platform that ran all around the base of the mill. He proceeded cautiously, taking care not to step in the big holes that yawned here and there. He crept around to a place near the front entrance to the old structure. Fortunately here he found where a board had come lose, so that it afforded a good listening place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see what in the world you wanted to bring me all the way out to this lonely place for, my dear chap," Paul was saying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's this way," Noddy was explaining. "I told you I was short of cash, and had to ask you to wait until to-day to pay the bet I made with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, my dear fellow," "Polly" expostulated, "why couldn't you pay me up there in town, just as well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To tell you the truth," said Noddy, in a tone that would indicate to any one who knew him that he was going to do just the opposite. "I didn't want any one to see me paying you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not, pray, my dear chap?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I owe quite a few bets," replied Noddy. "I am going to square them all up in a day or so, but if those I owe saw me paying you they would all come down on me at once and I would be financially embarrassed. I suppose you're ready to take the money now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ready, nay, anxious, my dear chap."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I had a little trouble in getting it," went on Noddy, not going into particulars, however. "And here it is. Just one hundred dollars, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Correct, my dear boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten fives are fifty," said Noddy, counting out some bills, "and twenty is seventy. Twenty more is ninety, and that ten makes just the hundred."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on here!" exclaimed Paul, when Noddy had come to the end of his counting. "This bill doesn't look just right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which bill?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This last ten dollar one. I never saw one like it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense, that's all right," responded Noddy. "Let's see it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul passed it back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, certainly it's good," Noddy said. "It's a state bank bill, instead of a national one, that's all. Issued by the Merchants' Bank of Boston."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But what's mat queer red mark on it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy examined it more closely. Then he laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some one has gone to the trouble of marking his initials on it in red ink," he said. "Probably for identification, or to serve as a mark. Maybe it was once used as a marked bill," and Noddy gave a short laugh. "See, there are the letters H. R. C."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you're right," agreed Paul. "Well, hand it over. I must be going. Sorry you lost the bet, but losers must pay, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm not squealing," retorted Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Guess I'll be going," went on Paul. "Beastly long walk back to town."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned was glad to hear the sound of departing footsteps. He kept in hiding for five minutes, however, fearing Noddy might return. At the end of that time he ventured out. He saw Noddy and Paul almost across the field and knew he was safe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned hurried back to town, going the same roundabout path he had taken in coming. He hastened to Jerry's house and told him what had taken place, and the two hunted up Bob and related the events to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Things are getting warm," commented Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are that," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if one of us couldn't get a talk with 'Polly' Banner." suggested Jerry. "We might manage to get talking about queer bills, and 'Polly' would show us the one he had."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you try that," Bob said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm willing," Jerry responded. "I'll take a walk down town now, and maybe I'll meet him. You wait until I come back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry resolved to first visit the club house of the athletic organization, as he knew Paul spent a good deal of his time there. Sure enough, he found Paul sitting at ease in a comfortable chair, smoking a perfumed cigarette and reading a book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, Paul," said Jerry. "you're not interested in old coins are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Old coins? No, my dear chap; why should I be interested in old coins?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I don't know. I was just wondering. Some people collect old coins, and some stamps. I favor stamps, myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now that you speak of it," said Paul. "I remember I have an old bill about me. It's rather odd. Maybe you'd be interested in it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's see," replied Jerry, thanking his stars that he was about to accomplish his purpose so easily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paul drew out the odd ten dollar note Noddy had given him. Just as Ned had reported, it was an old style state bank note. And, in one of the blank spaces on the reverse side some one had made a very elaborate monogram of the initials H. R. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite a curiosity," observed Jerry, passing the bill back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think so," said Paul, puffing out thick clouds of smoke from his Egyptian cigarette. "But I suppose there is no premium on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There might be," replied Jerry in as careless a tone as he could assume. "If I were you I'd save it and see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will," said Paul. "I'll place it in the very back part of my wallet, and I won't spend it until I see a coin catalog. That's an easy way to make money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you get the bill. "asked Jerry. "Perhaps you can get more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Noddy Nixon gave it to me," responded Paul. "I wasn't going to take it at first, but he told me it was good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I reckon it's good enough," answered Jerry. "Well, I guess I'll be traveling. Good-bye, Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good afternoon, my dear chap," answered Paul, lighting another cigarette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll not forget how that bill looks," said Jerry to himself, as he sought his two chums and told them what had taken place between Paul and himself.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X THE MOTOR-CYCLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about a week after the foregoing events when Jerry received a letter, bearing in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope the mark of the C. H. &amp; D. Railroad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He read the missive, which was short and to the point. Briefly it informed Jerry that there awaited him at the freight office of the road one motor-cycle, which he could have by calling and presenting the enclosed way-bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" shouted the boy. "Three cheers for the Cresville Athletic Club and Mr. Wakefield! Hurrah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry lost no time in calling for his two chums, and the three boys hurried together to the freight depot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can I do for you boys?" asked Mr. Hitter, the agent in charge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I come to get what that calls for," replied Jerry, handing over the way-bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, one of them new-fangled bicycles that take a steam engine to run 'em. Well, you'll find it down at the end of the platform," said Mr. Hitter. "Now, be careful, and don't blow your self up. Boys is dreadful careless like," he muttered, as he went on with his work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boxed in a big crate, at the end of the freight platform, the boys found the motor-cycle. It was addressed in big letters to "Jerry Hopkins, Esq.," and marked "With Care."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I unpack it here or get it taken up to the house, crate and all?" asked Jerry of his chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, unpack it here. Then you can ride it home," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know about as much how to ride one as I would how to run a locomotive," objected Jerry. "I've studied the catalogs, of course, but I think I'd better start it up at home first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, go ahead, ride it home," put in Ned. "We can manage to find out how it works, and we can get some gasolene over to the drug store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So, rather against his own calmer judgment, Jerry decided to do as his friends wished. He borrowed a hammer from Mr. Hitter and soon the crate was broken apart and the motor-cycle, in all its mechanical beauty, was revealed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It certainly was a fine machine and had all the latest improvements. There were two cylinders instead of one, insuring great speed; the tires were large, and there was a large reservoir for gasolene. It was of the latest make and not generally on the market as yet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's a book that tells all about how to run it," said Bob, catching sight of a pamphlet of directions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys read the directions over carefully. It seemed simple enough. All there was to do was to put some gasolene in the tank, see that the batteries gave a proper current, start the machine off, turn on the gasolene, switch on the spark and ride off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll get the gasolene," volunteered Ned. He ran over to the drug store and came back with a can full.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now try and see if there's a good spark," Jerry suggested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Satisfied that the batteries were in working order, Jerry prepared to take his first ride. The street leading from the railroad depot was a long straight wide one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a good thing," commented Jerry, referring to the highway. "There's plenty of chance to be run away with, and not damage anything. I can ride clear to New York if I go far enough"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't this time, though," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry smiled. It was a rather dubious sort of a grin, to be sure. Much as he wanted a motor-cycle, he knew there was a little risk in riding one when he was not thoroughly familiar with it. However, he wasn't going to back out. He got on the ponderous machine, which Bob and Ned steadied for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give me a little shove."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob and Ned did so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Work the pedals and get a good start," advised Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry did so. Soon he was moving off at a fair speed, though, of course, just as if he was on an ordinary bicycle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Turn on the gasolene!" shouted Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And throw in the spark!" called Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here she goes," Jerry yelled back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a series of sharp explosions, like a machine gun being fired at top speed, and the motor-cycle, with Jerry aboard, started off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" shouted Ned and Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bang! Bang! Bang! the machine went, and soon Jerry was a quarter of a mile down the road. "He ought to shut off the exhaust," commented Bob. "He can do that on this machine. On some you can't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys, thinking of nothing but motor-cycles and their chances of getting them, passed down the road. Jerry was out of sight. In a little while they espied a cloud of dust down the highway. It seemed to be moving toward them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here comes Jerry, I guess," Bob said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he's moving like the wind!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few minutes the dust cloud was nearer, and then the boys saw that it was Jerry approaching at a rapid rate. His machine did not make so much noise now. But, as he came nearer, Bob and Ned, who caught a glimpse of his face, thought he looked a little worried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on! Can't you stop?" cried Bob, for Jerry was about to pass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the trouble!" Jerry yelled as he whizzed past. "I can't seem to shut off the power!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he was lost in a cloud of dust, going down the road in the opposite direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Something's wrong!" Bob ejaculated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's forgotten which lever to pull!" exclaimed Ned. "If he don't look out there'll be trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he spoke Jerry came flying back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't one of you do something?" he cried. "I'm afraid to take my hands off the bars long enough to pull the levers again, and the last time I yanked them I seemed to turn on more power. I'll ride down the road a way and turn back. Think up something in the meanwhile!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's in a pickle!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have it!" cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The next time he comes past yell at him to ride around in a circle until we can look in the book of directions on how to run a motor-cycle." And so, the next time Jerry whizzed by, with a comical worried look on his face, Bob yelled:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ride around us in a circle, Jerry. Make believe you're on the track. Ned and I will look in the book and see how to stop you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry obeyed. Around and around he went, the machine kicking up a cloud of dust. In the centre of the ring stood Bob and Ned, pouring over the pages of the book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There it is. "cried Ned, pointing to something on one page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does it say?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To stop the machine pull lever A and throw off B toward you three notches," read Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pull lever A and throw off B toward you three notches!" Bob yelled to Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which is lever A and which is lever B?" asked Jerry. "They're not marked on the machine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so, I forgot that," admitted Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What am I going to do?" begged Jerry. "Have I got to ride around like this all night?"'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's in the name of Tunket is the trouble?" asked Mr. Hitter, the station agent, who was on his way down the road, and who had come to where Jerry was riding around in a circle with Bob and Ned in the centre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He can't stop!" cried Ned and Bob at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knowed there'd some trouble come of that machine," said Mr. Hitter, shaking his head. "I told you not to monkey with 'em. It all comes of man trying to improve on nature. Walking's good enough for me. What particular form of trouble does the critter seem to be suffering from? I mean the motor-cycle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's two levers," explained Bob. "One is A and the other is B, according to the book. The trouble is they are not marked on the machine, and Jerry don't know which one to pull."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, not knowing much about the case, I would advise him to pull 'em both," said Mr. Hitter. "He can't be any worse off than he is now, and maybe it'll stop him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good!" exclaimed Bob. "That's it. Why didn't we think of that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why didn't we?" was all Ned could say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then they both shouted to Jerry, who was still pursuing his weary round:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Move both levers, Jerry!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry did so. In an instant the motor-cycle ceased the explosions, and, in a little while it slowed down so that Jerry could dismount.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that certainly was an experience," commented Jerry, as he wiped the dust from his face. "But it was fun all the same," he added, whereat Mr. Hitter laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys will be boys," the station agent muttered as he went off down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Funny the machine got such a fit on," said Ned, examining the motor-cycle closely. "I didn't think they would act like that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's the difficulty," cried Bob, who was also looking over the apparatus. "This piece of wire ought to have been taken off. It was put on temporarily when the machine was packed. See, it held the gasolene lever and the spark one also, so they couldn't come back separately. You had to pull them both at once to shut off the flow of fluid and the current of electricity. It's a thing that wouldn't happen if we hadn't been in such a hurry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it all came out right," said Jerry. "I'm going to ride the machine home." And he did without further mishap, stopping and starting the motor without trouble, now that the wire was off.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI MACHINES FOR BOB AND NED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That night two very earnest lads implored two fathers to purchase motor-cycles for them. As Bob and Ned were both sons of well-to-do parents the matter was not much one of cost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To tell you the truth," said Mr. Baker to Bob, "I'm a little afraid of those machines. They are dangerous."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be careful," pleaded Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know, but that's what every one says at first," objected Mr. Baker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time the same sort of a conversation was going on in the Slade household.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You say there's no danger," Mr. Slade was remarking in answer to Ned's statement to that effect. "But I heard about Jerry Hopkins and his experience this afternoon. It seems to me there was danger there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was three days before the two fathers arrived at a decision. They had consulted in the meanwhile, and Jerry's machine had been closely examined. Bob and Ned had both taken turns on it, and showed that, after a little practice, they could run it perfectly. Jerry, also, had become quite expert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the meantime the boys were so engrossed with the idea of motor-cycles that they had almost forgotten about the mill robbery. They met, according to appointment, under the tree in the woods, but there was nothing new to tell. With the discovery of the queer bank bill, and the knowledge that Paul Banner was saving it, the boys resolved to let the matter rest for a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The police and detectives, and even the fussy sheriff, had discovered nothing, save that the money was gone, which every one knew. As for Noddy, he did not act like a guilty person. Bill Perry had disappeared for the time being.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy seemed to have plenty of money. He was careful not to apply to his father again, however, and the source of his supply was a mystery except to himself. In about a week Mr. Nixon, of his own accord, gave Noddy two hundred dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will spend it wisely, my son," he said. "It is wicked to waste money, when so much good can be done with it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, father," began Bob to Mr. Baker one evening, a little more than a week after the time Jerry had received his prize motor-cycle, "have you thought any more about that machine for me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have made up my mind," went on Mr. Baker, with exasperating slowness. "that you can not—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, father!" burst out Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That you can not get along without one," finished the banker with a laugh. "and so I have ordered one for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks dad!" was all Bob could say, but the two words meant a good deal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time, according to arrangement between Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade, the latter was announcing to his son Ned, that he could have the much-wanted machine. If there were two happier boys than Ned and Bob in Cresville that night, no one knew where to find them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll have lots of sport," said Bob. "I know of a dozen trips we can take, that would be too long for a bicycle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days later the two motor-cycles came, and the chums could hardly wait to unpack them. Bob's and Ned's machines were just like Jerry's except in a few minor points.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry was delighted that his chums' machines had arrived. He got his own out and soon all three were speeding down the road. In point of fastness there was not much to choose from among the three motors. None of the boys had risked running the cycles at top speed yet, and at the half-way mark each one developed about the same swiftness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys rode for several miles. It was a pleasant dry, with a bright sun overhead, while an early morning shower had laid the dust. After an hour's travel Bob said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm hungry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few minutes they stopped their motor-cycles in front of a big white farm house, and walked up the path to the side door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the porch they found a motherly looking woman churning. She smiled at the sight of the three boys, and took off her apron, which was splashed with butter-milk, as she came forward to greet them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-afternoon," she said pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We stopped to see if we could get something to eat," began Jerry. "We're willing to pay for it, of course," he added, fearing the woman might think they were tramps. "Anything will do. Some cookies, a little milk or a piece of pie."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I can fix you something," said the woman. "Hi! You Jason!" she called in a loud voice. "Come and run this churn while I set out a lunch for some visitors."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In answer to her hail an old man shuffled around the corner of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm comin'," he said in a quavering voice. "I'm a leetle mite slow, 'cause the rheumatiz catches me to-day, Alvirah. But I'm comin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's my grand uncle," the woman explained to the boys. "He's almost ninety years old, but he can churn as good as I can. Can't you, Jason."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon so, Alvirah."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the farmer's wife bustled around to set out a simple meal for the boys, the latter sat out on the porch watching old Jason churn. He moved the dasher up and down, a queer chugging sound following each stroke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you come, anyhow? Walk?" asked the old man presently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On motor-cycles," replied Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know they had them flyin' machines in working order yit," exclaimed the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on, boys," interrupted the farmer' wife. "I have a little something here for you.?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "little something" proved to be quite a meal. There was nice fresh bread, with the best butter the boys had ever eaten. There was also honey right from the bee hives, some rich milk, a plate of doughnuts and cheese, and two big pies, one apple and the other peach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is very kind of you," said Jerry. "We didn't want you to go to all this trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sure it's no trouble," replied the woman. "I'm glad you came along. It's rather lonesome out this way. We don't often have company."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys ate with a will. When they had finished there was not much left on the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do we owe you?" asked Jerry, as he and his chums rose in preparation to continue their journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I reckon ten cents will be about right," was the answer. But Jerry insisted on paying twenty-five cents for each, and, after some argument, the woman accepted it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the boys were well on the road toward Cresville. They talked of many things, and planned several trips in the near future. As they turned into the main road leading to their homes they heard a chugging sound behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All three came to a halt, dismounted, and sat down under a tree. Nearer and nearer came the sound of the approaching motor-cycle. Then, in a cloud of dust, a solitary rider whizzed past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you see who that was?" asked Ned. "Noddy Nixon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Positive. I heard the other day that he was going to get a machine. That was him, sure enough."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think he goes so very fast," observed Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He does, all the same," was Bob's opinion. "You can make up your mind Noddy will have as fast a machine as there is built."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose he bought it with some of the proceeds of the mill robbery," cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush!" cried Ned. "Don't say such things. Some one might hear you and it would make trouble. Besides, we have not proved Noddy guilty yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," said Bob with a shrug of his shoulders. "I hope we don't meet him very often when we are out on the road. He's not the most pleasant fellow in the world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's not much danger of his seeking our company," came from Jerry. "He is not over-fond of any of us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys rested for a while beneath the tree and, then as the sun sank, they mounted their cycles, put on good speed, and arrived home in time for supper, bearing excellent appetites, in spite of the good meal they had had at the farm house.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII A WILD NIGHT RIDE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, Jerry," began Bob, dismounting from his motor-cycle one afternoon in front of his chum's house. "what do you say to a night ride?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean on our machines?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. Let's get acetylene gas lamps, that give a good light, and ride over to Fallsburg and back. "We can start in the evening and easily make the round trip in five or six hours."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fallsburg was a town about the size of Cresville and forty miles distant therefrom. The road between was a fairly good one most of the way, and, by making a circuit involving about five miles more of travel an excellent highway for the whole distance was available.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was decided to start right after supper, and the chums calculated they could make Fallsburg in about three hours. They did not intend to ride fast, and were out for pleasure rather than for speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without special incident the trip to Fallsburg was concluded. It was nine o'clock when the boys reached the town, which was quite a lively place. Considerable of a stir was caused when our three heroes rode in on their machines, which were somewhat of a novelty there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah! I see an ice-cream sign!" exclaimed Ned, pointing down the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little time was lost in getting to the store and after each had put away a large plate of the frozen stuff the boys felt better. The tables in the ice cream parlor were separated one from the other by large screens. In the improvised apartment just back of where the three boys were sitting, voices in low conversation could be heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sure Noddy will be there?" was the cautious inquiry that came to the ears of our heroes. At the sound of that name all three started.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll be there if his machine doesn't break, which it has an unpleasant habit of doing lately," a second voice said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And do you think he'll bring the money?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'd better if he knows what's good for him," was the answer. "He's put me off long enough."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The old house by the cross-roads is the place, ain't it?" asked the party who had first spoken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's it, and if Noddy don't show up he'll hear from me in a way he won't like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on," Whispered Jerry to his chums. "Let's get out of this before those men see us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quietly the three boys left the ice cream parlor. They did not speak until they were in the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you suppose they were talking about?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what the subject was," replied Jerry. "but I venture to say the person they meant was our acquaintance, Noddy Nixon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he's evidently expected to pay over some money to-night," added Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the old house at the cross-roads," put in Ned. "l'll bet I know where they mean."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you remember that old tumbled-down place we passed about three miles outside of this town? Near the blacksmith shop?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean right after we crossed the river?" inquired Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The same thought was in the minds of all three. Bob was the first to mention it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's go out there and see what we can learn," he said. "It is on our way home, and we have plenty of time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There may be some danger," objected Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense. We have as much right there as any one. All we have to do is to stop off from our motor cycles as we pass. No one can object to that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After some further conversation it was agreed to do this. The boys wandered about the streets a while longer and, as it was nearing eleven o'clock they thought they had better start. They found their machines in proper order, and soon were moving slowly out of town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's no use being in too much of a hurry," advised Bob. "Probably Noddy won't meet the men there much before midnight, and it lacks half an hour of that now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later the three boys cam in sight of the deserted house. Lonesome and uncanny enough it looked, the moonlight making mysterious shadows here and there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go easy," spoke Ned. "No need to tell them we are coming if by any chance they are there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Silently the boys dismounted from their cycles, leaned the machines up against the fence a short way from in front of the house, and crept up through the long grass that filled the yard of the old vacant structure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on!" cried Bob suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All three came to a halt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" whispered Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For answer Bob pointed toward a shed at the side of the house. In it could be seen a light gleaming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are they in there?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but some one's motor-cycle is," replied Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Foot by foot the three boys made toward the dark and deserted house. They had circled half way around it, and, coming to the rear, were suddenly brought to a halt by a sliver of light shooting out from some crack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on!" exclaimed Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They stopped and looked toward the light. It came from the kitchen window, which was closed by broken shutters through a splintered slat of which the gleam came. On tip-toes the three boys crept under the window. They peered into the room, and the sight that met their eyes made them start in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seated around a rough table, on which stood a lighted candle stuck in a bottle, were three figures. One was Bill Berry, the other was a stranger and the third was Noddy Nixon. The stranger was holding a pistol to Noddy's head, and seemed to be threatening him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bill Berry was looking on, and taking no part in the proceedings, evidently. Then, as the boys watched, they saw Noddy, plainly in fear of the man with the weapon, pull from his pocket a roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gave it to the stranger, fairly throwing it at him in a rage. Then the man with the pistol, smiling in a satisfied way, put up his weapon. Noddy was saying something, for the boys could see his lips moving, but they could not hear the words, for the window was closed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Queer doings," whispered Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that instant Ned, in an endeavor to see better, leaned a little forward. A piece of board he was standing on broke with a loud crash, and he toppled forward, hitting the window shutter with his elbow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like a flash Noddy, Bill and the strange man leaped to their feet and gazed in the direction of the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quick! Light out of this!" exclaimed Bob. "They will be after us in another minute!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sure enough, after a moment's hesitation, Noddy ran toward the door with the intention of going outside and seeing who had made the racket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurry!" whispered Bob hoarsely. "To the motor-cycles!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys lost no time. Hastening on in the darkness they stumbled and ran to where they had left their machines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they reached them they heard a door opened, and footsteps in hot pursuit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is it?" they heard Noddy's voice inquiring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys rolled their motor-cycles out in the road. They leaped into the saddles, started off, and in another instant had turned on the power and were off down the highway leading to Cresville. As they whizzed past the house, in which several lights now gleamed, they heard Noddy cry:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Confound them! I'll fix them for spying on me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time they heard the explosions that indicated that Noddy had put his motor-cycle in operation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The race is on!" cried Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And a race it was to be. They were about thirty-five miles from home. There was a good road, and, with the moon high up now, it was well lighted. The acetylene lamps on the machines also gave good illumination. In a few minutes the motors of the three boys were humming on half-speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Behind them, borne on the night wind, could be heard the puffing of the motor-cycle in pursuit. But the three chums had a start of several minutes, which counted much.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look behind and see if you can see his lamp," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a gleam," reported Bob, after a hasty glance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several miles were passed in this fashion, the pursuing machine getting no nearer. Then, all at once, Ned cried:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can see his light!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was true. Either Noddy had increased his speed, or he had emerged from behind some bend in the road that hitherto hid the gleam of his lamp from the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time the explosions of his motor sounded louder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's catching up to us!" cried Jerry. "Shall we turn on more power?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a little risky," cautioned Bob. "Especially as we don't know the road very well. However, another notch or two won't do any harm."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy was now within an eighth of a mile. His speed was increasing. Suddenly he called:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whoever you are, stop, or I'll shoot?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He don't know who we are, anyhow," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to fire!" shouted Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is getting exciting!" cried Ned</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is only trying to scare us," exclaimed Bob. Then came a loud report.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That wasn't a revolver!" exclaimed Jerry. "It sounded as if one of his tires burst. That's it!" he added a second later, as he looked back. "Noddy has had an accident. I guess this race is off!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">True enough, the front tire on Noddy's machine had collapsed. He was forced to stop, and, as the boys sped on they could hear him faintly calling after them. The three chums reduced the speed of their motors, but did not stop, and soon they were out of sight and hearing of Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we certainly had an adventure," came from Ned. "I wonder what it was all about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll find out some day," was Jerry's opinion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, once more they took up their journey, and reached Cresville without further happening, arriving just before daylight.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII ADVENTURES ON THE ROAD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WANT to take a ride with me?" asked Bob of Ned, one morning, about a week following the exciting night ride. "Father wants me to go over to Franklin to take a message to the bank there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure I'll go. And we'll ask Jerry. Wait until I get my machine, and I'll be with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys were soon puffing along their motors to Jerry's house. He joined them and all three started off for Franklin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ride was a pleasant one. It was rather warm, but there was a cool breeze, that was added to by the speed at which the boys rode. Franklin was about twenty miles from Cresville, and was a village of good size. The boys had some friends there, and intended calling on them before returning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They reached Franklin without mishaps. Bob transacted the business his father had sent him on, and then the boys voted that a meal would not be out of place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I guess we'll have to be starting back," said Bob at length. "Father will want to know how I made out with his matter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned and Jerry were agreeable, and they mounted their machines and were soon on the homeward journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had gone perhaps ten miles when, on making a sudden turn in the road, they came face to face with a countryman who was driving a rather spirited horse. At the sight and sound of the machines the animal reared up in the air. The boys stopped their motors, but the horse would not be quieted. Even the sight of the cycles seemed to madden the brute. In spite of the efforts of the countryman the horse continued to rear and prance. Then the steed made a sudden turn, and, with a cracking sound, one of the carriage shafts broke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now ye've gone and done it!" yelled the driver, seeming to fly in a rage. "Ye'll have to pay for this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're very sorry," began Jerry. "we didn't intend to cause any trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's always the way with peesky boys," went on the countryman. "I'll have the law on ye for this! You wait until I get out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horse, having done what damage he could, seemed to be satisfied, and quieted down. The driver dismounted and tied the animal to a fence, and then proceeded to examine the broken shaft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Busted clean oft," he announced in an ugly tone. "It'll cost five dollars to get it fixed. You'll have to settle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's right, make 'em pay!" exclaimed a voice from the bushes that lined the road side, and, to the surprise of the three boys, Noddy Nixon stepped out into view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I intend to," said the countryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They've no business on the road in their machines, frightening horses," went on Noddy with a grin. "The roads are for carriages."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I like your nerve, Noddy Nixon!" exclaimed Jerry hotly. "We have just as much right on the road as this driver has. And you've got a motor-cycle yourself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's none of your business," remarked Noddy in a surly tone. "You cubs frightened this man's horse, and he has a right to demand payment. Don't let 'em get away until they pay," Noddy added to the driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't intend they shall," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here!" exclaimed Bob. "We never said we didn't intend to pay, but it's none of your business, Noddy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't give me any of your lip," the bully roared. "I've been wanting to thrash you for some time, and now I have a good chance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go ahead, if you think it's healthy," said Bob boldly. "I'm not afraid of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you fight him, you'll have to fight me," said Jerry, coming forward and standing beside Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and me also," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I'll have to take a hand then," said the countryman. "I want pay for my broken shaft. If I can't get it in money I'll take it out of your hides."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you touch us I'll make a complaint and cause your arrest," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who's talking about arrests?" asked a gruff voice, and, from the bushes whence Noddy had made his appearance Bill Berry stepped out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the sight of him Noddy grinned, and moved closer to Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's big talk for a small boy," Bill went on with a laugh. "What's the row, Noddy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, these young cubs frightened this gentleman's horse, the animal broke a shaft, and they won't pay for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That isn't true," cried Bob. "We never refused to pay for the damage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Make 'em pay!" cried Bill, slapping his hand on his thigh with a sound like a pistol shot. "Make 'em pay!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a fit of passion Noddy aimed a blow at Bob. The boy dodged it cleverly, and shot out his fist toward Noddy's face. He only landed lightly on the bully's nose, but that, with the overbalancing caused when he missed his mark, sent Noddy down in a heap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll make you pay for this!" he fairly screamed as he scrambled up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rushed at Bob. Ned and Jerry ran up and were about to aid their chum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me attend to him alone!" pleaded Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll fix you!" screamed the bully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more he aimed a fearful blow at Bob, but the latter merely stepped to one side, and once more Noddy went down, without having been hit. He arose with his mouth full of dust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that instant the countryman's horse, probably frightened by the noise and shouts, reared on its hind legs, broke the strap that fastened him to the fence, and galloped off down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Consarn ye! There goes my best horse!" cried the countryman, losing all interest in the fight. "Five dollars to whoever catches him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to have a try for that!" exclaimed Bill, setting off down the road on a swift run. "Five dollars don't come my way every afternoon!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll sue ye for this!" yelled the countryman, shaking his fist at the boys before speeding down the highway after Bill in pursuit of the horse. "I'll have the law on ye!" His coat tails streamed in the wind as he raced away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy had stopped mid-way in his rush at Bob as the horse broke loose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, are you going to fight?" asked Bob coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Noddy's desire for battle seemed to have left him suddenly. He realized that he was no match for the three, or even for two, of the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll get square with you for this," he muttered as he slunk away in the bushes. "I've several scores to settle with you three cubs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better settle 'em here and now," advised Jerry. "It's a good chance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You just wait," was all Noddy would say. Soon he disappeared in the shrubbery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I thought for a while there was going to be trouble," said Bob, with a laugh. "Noddy certainly seemed mad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I don't see any need of staying here any longer," said Ned at length. "It doesn't seem as if the countryman or Bill would come back. If that man with the horse wants any pay let him call and collect. He didn't treat us very nicely. As for Noddy, I guess he's far enough off by now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder what he was doing out this way?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and lately Bill Berry is always with him," commented Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're up to no good, you can be sure of that," was Jerry's opinion, in which the others shared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, mounting their motor-cycles, the three boys made good speed home, meeting with no more fractious horses and puncturing no more tires.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV A FIRE AND A DISCOVERY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fire! Fire! Fire!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Loud shouts of this dreadful alarm, mingled ,with the ringing of bells, the tooting of whistles and the hurrying of many feet awoke Jerry late one night, three days after the encounter in the road with the countryman and his skittish horse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fire! Fire! Fire!" yelled men and boys hastening down the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's the blaze?" asked Jerry, throwing open his window and calling down to those running past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Judson's mill!" was the cry. "Looks like a big fire!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry looked in the direction of the mill, and saw a glare in the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going!" he exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh Jerry, you might get hurt," objected Mrs. Hopkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be careful, mother," replied the boy, rapidly dressing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his way to the blaze he met Ned, who had also been awakened from his sleep by the alarm. The two boys hurried toward the mill, to which point it seemed as if every one in Cresville was hastening. The glare in the sky grew brighter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here comes one of the engines!" cried Ned as the apparatus dashed past. It was one of two new steamers recently purchased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurry up, and let's see it work!" called Jerry, and the boys increased their run.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How'd the mill catch fire?" panted Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—didn't—hear," answered Jerry, breathing hard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a little while they were at the scene of the blaze. One of the smaller buildings of the mill was burning furiously. Smoke, flames and sparks were spouting from the roof, which was almost consumed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up dashed the engines. Connections were quickly made to hydrants, and soon two good sized streams were playing on the flames. The puffing of the steamers, the snapping and crackle of the flames, the shouts of those looking on, the yells of the firemen and the crash as pieces of the burning building fell in, made a din that was chaotic. "Stand back boys!" exclaimed one of the firemen. "We want to run a hose in that gate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys made room and were now joined by Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can we go in?" asked Jerry. "We'll keep well back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gate in front of which they stood gave access to the mill yard, at a point quite a distance from the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess it won't do any harm," answered the fireman who was a good natured man. "But keep well back in case the walls fall. We don't want any one to get hurt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll be careful," promised Jerry, and the boys followed the fire-fighter within the gate, helping him drag the hose, which was twisting and turning like a snake trying to get loose, so strong was the water pressure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last the fury of the fire seemed to have spent itself. The flames died down and all that remained to do was to wet down the ruins thoroughly to prevent any sparks from flying to other departments of the mill. The blaze had been confined to the building where it started, and, in spite of the excitement over it, the damage had been small.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad it didn't get into my office," remarked Mr. Judson, the mill owner, who had arrived on the scene soon after the fire started. "All my valuable books and papers would have been destroyed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you got off pretty lucky," said the chief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks to the hard work you and your men did," Mr. Judson replied. "I won't forget it, I assure you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We only did our duty," responded the chief modestly. "It's our business to put out fires."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was not much more of interest to see, and the three boys, as did a number of others, began to think of going home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned, Jerry and Bob started from the mill yard. As they passed a pile of lumber near the gate Ned gave one of the boards a careless kick. There was a rattling sound and a small round object rolled out at his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look's like a tin can," observed Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned picked it up to examine it better, for it was now quite dark, the fire giving only a faint glow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look at this!" Ned cried, holding out the object.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a burglar's dark lantern!" exclaimed Bob. "I saw one just like it that the police took from a thief. It is over to police headquarters."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wonder who put it there?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's hard to—" began Ned, and then he stopped. Dropping to his knees he reached his hand into the hole from whence the dark lantern had rolled. He groped around a few seconds and then drew out his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've found 'em," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The things I was looking for," and Ned held up to view in the faint gleam from the burned building a cold chisel and a hammer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are they for?" asked Bob, not seeing the connection of the dark lantern and the tools just found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"These are the things the mill safe was robbed with," replied Ned. "The lantern made the light that puzzled me that night I came past, and with this cold chisel and hammer the lock was cut out. The thief must have hidden the things under the boards as he ran away with the money. It was on his route as he passed out of the gate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This mill robbery seems to follow us," observed Jerry. "Every once in a while something about it crops out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," commented Ned. "I saw the robbery being committed, or rather I was there while it was being done, we learned about the queer bank bill and Noddy's connection with it, and now we have discovered the tools that were used."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All we need to do next is to recover the money," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And find the thief," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I fancy that won't be difficult to do," added Bob. "If Noddy—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush!" exclaimed Ned. "some one is coming ! Let's get out of here!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hurriedly Ned hid under his coat the lantern, the hammer and chisel, and the three boys passed out of the mill yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you chaps doin' here?" demanded a rough voice, and Bill Berry shuffled up, looking sharply at first one and then another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We were watching the fire," replied Ned politely. "Any objections, Mr. Berry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You boys better keep away from here," growled Bill. "I reckon Mr. Judson don't want another robbery."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean?" demanded Jerry. "Do you mean that we robbed the mill?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well you might and then agin you mightn't," mumbled Bill. "I ain't sayin' as how you did, and I ain't sayin' as how you didn't. You'd better move on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We've as much right here as you have, Bill Perry," said Bob. "We're ready to go and we're going; all you may say wouldn't move us, as long as Mr. Judson didn't object to our being here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That'll do for you," muttered Bill, as he shuffled away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you catch the horse and win the five dollars?" inquired Jerry, referring to the country man's fractious steed that ran away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bill's only answer was a growl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on, let's get home and go to bed," suggested Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take good care of those tools," warned Jerry. Ned promised to do so; and there the talk came to an end.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV NED UNDER SUSPICION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was quite early in the morning some days later when Bob called at Jerry's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, Chunky!" greeted Jerry as he came to the door, having finished a bountiful breakfast. "What's up now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thought maybe you might like to take a ride off in the country," replied the stout youth, panting a bit from having to push his motor up the little incline leading to his chum's front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing would suit me better," said the male representative of the Hopkins family. "Where is it to this time?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you say to a trip over to Limestone Creek? We can go fishing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm with you. Ned will go, of course?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he is waiting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Slade, on Ned's request, had the cook put up a basket of bread and butter, some cake and cheese, which Bob fastened to his machine. Then, the fishing tackle having been stowed away on Jerry's motor the three chums started off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Limestone Creek was a stream about ten miles from Cresville. It was a noted fishing place, and many a fat chub or speckled trout had been pulled from the sparkling waters. It was a hot August day, but the boys did not mind the burning rays of the sun. Part of the way they rode along under big trees that gave a refreshing shade, and occasionally there was a little breeze to cool them off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here we are," cried Jerry at length as he turned his machine from the main road, into a narrow path that led through a green field to the brook. "This way to the fishing banks!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and if you yell that way all the fish will be scared away," expostulated Ned. "Make a little less noise if you want any luck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good idea," chimed in Bob. He soon had the lines in shape, and then, taking out his knife, cut a slim willow pole that would serve excellently for fishing. The others followed his example, and soon all three were sitting on the grassy bank, while the cork floats bobbed lightly in the swirl of the eddy which formed the "old fishing hole."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luck was good with the young disciples of Isaak Walton, and they soon had a dozen choice fish among them. Then, as the sun was high in the sky, and it was hot sitting on the bank, the boys adjourned to the shade of the tree where they had left their cycles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now for dinner!" cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's draw lots to see who makes the fire, who cleans the fish and who cooks them," suggested Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ten minutes later an appetizing aroma filled the summer air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah! Maybe that ain't good!" cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beats restaurants all to pieces!" was Ned's opinion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then with the bread and butter they had brought along, with the seasoning for the fish, fresh crullers and cheese, the whole washed down with water from a clear cool spring near by, the boys made a meal that even a king might have envied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dinner over they lolled lazily beneath the trees until the sun was low in the west. Bob proposed a walk along the creek as he wanted to see if there were any evidences of musk-rats nests in a certain place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will it be safe to leave the machines here?" asked Jerry. "Some one might come along and ride off with them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would take more than one person to get away with all three," Bob said. "But we can take out the spark plugs, and unless the thieves have duplicates along they won't get very far."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Removing the plugs, the boys walked along the stream for half a mile. They found no musk-rats nests, and Bob, remarking that they could come back another day and make a better search, proposed a return trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did not take long to reach the places where they had left their machines. The spark plugs were put back, and, after finishing what few crullers remained, the three boys trundled their motors out into the path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here goes for home!" cried Ned, as he vaulted into his saddle. He got his cycle started by foot power and then attempted to throw the power on. Nothing but a faint sound of air being exhausted from the cylinders responded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Something's wrong!" cried the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time the other two discovered that their machines would not work. Again and again they tried but with no result.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some one has cut the wires!" exclaimed Bob. "You can see where they split the insulation, shoved it to one side, broke the copper, and then put the insulation back to cover up the mean trick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're right!" exclaimed Ned. "I'd like to catch the fellow who did it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly Jerry darted over toward the tree beneath which the cycles had been standing. He stooped down and picked up something which he looked at closely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I fancy this will give us a clue," he said, showing a knife with an opened blade, to which there clung some of the insulation from the copper wires.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whose is it?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It has the initials N. N. on it," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And there's only one person around here who has a name with those letters," put in Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There might be more," said Jerry, inclined to be cautious. "but I happen to remember that Noddy Nixon had a knife like this. I saw him use it once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is his first move in getting square, as he would call it," ventured Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still it is only circumstantial evidence against him," reasoned Bob. "And we had better have more before we accuse him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course," agreed Ned. "I think—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which of you boys happens to be Ned Slade?" interrupted a voice, and the boys turned to see a short, stout fussy man gravely regarding them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, I thought so," he remarked as Ned gave an involuntary start. "Then you are the one I want to see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?" asked the owner of the name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well—er—I don't like to speak of it in public."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't anything to conceal," spoke Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then if you haven't I haven't," said the little man. "I'm Sheriff Blackwell of Peterstown, and I want to talk to you about a robbery."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! Not the robbery of Mr. Judson's mill?" asked Ned, greatly excited. "Why I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I may as well warn you right now, that whatever you say will be used against you," said the sheriff. "Now that I've done my duty in giving the warning, go ahead if you want to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you—you—why you surely don't think I robbed the mill?" asked Ned, blushing with shame at the thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good, but you can't get anything out of me, young man," said the sheriff with a wise nod. "I cut my eye teeth years ago. You'll have to come with me, at least for a while. I reckon you can get bail."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bail! Come with you! What do you mean?" asked Ned, while his two chums stood looking on, not knowing what to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here," began the fussy little sheriff. "You were at the mill on the night of the robbery, weren't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—er—that is I was—er—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course," said the sheriff. "I knew you were. And you never said anything about it when we were hunting for clues, did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told my two chums, Jerry and Bob, here," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's right," chimed in Jerry, and Bob nodded his head in assent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm acting on information and belief," went on the sheriff. "Certain knowledge has come to me from a man who saw you at the mill on the night of the robbery. It looks as if you might know something about it, that is, who did it, and who has the money. I might add that suspicion points strongly to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Can you give us any clue that would indicate that some one else might be involved?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned hesitated an instant. He looked quickly at Jerry, who shook his head slightly, to indicate to Ned to have nothing to say about having seen Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't give you any information," said Ned slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you'll have to come with me," went on the sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I ask," inquired Ned. "who told you that I might be the guilty person?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A gentleman of Cresville, named William Berry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bill Berry!" exclaimed Ned. "I—" and then he stopped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't lose any time," the representative of the law continued. "I drove over from Peterstown this morning. By judicious inquiries I learned you and two other boys had come over here. I followed. The law knows no delays. Are you ready to come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have my motor cycle with me," said Ned. "Can I go on that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I let you ride your machine will you promise to go slow, and not try to escape? I'll drive along in my carriage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll promise," said Ned, the deep flush not having left his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we'll consider that arranged. Come on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly, and in depressed spirits, greatly in contrast to the gaiety with which they had arrived, the three boys trundled their machines, the wires of which had been quickly repaired, to the road. The sheriff untied his horse, got in the carriage, and cautioning Ned to run his machine at reduced speed, followed the boys who felt very little inclined for talk. They were so worried that they left their fish behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eventually Cresville was reached. Ned, much as he was humiliated by his technical arrest, knew he could easily prove his innocence. But he felt that the mystery of the mill robbery was deepening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go right to your house with you," said the sheriff to Ned. "We will have a talk with your father, and I have no doubt we can come to some understanding."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Slade was surprised, incensed and puzzled by turns when the fussy little sheriff in charge of Ned called on him. The arm and majesty of the law soon explained what had taken place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This Mr. Berry is sure he saw your son at the mill," repeated the sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't depend too much on Berry's word," said the merchant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was at the mill that night," exclaimed Ned. Then he related what he had seen, all about the queer light, the presence of Bill Berry, and the finding of the tools and dark lantern. He only refrained from mentioning Noddy's name, since he did not feel justified in bringing him in, no matter what his suspicions were concerning the bully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great Snakes and little fishes!" exclaimed the sheriff, when Ned had finished. "I wish I had known this at the time. I guess we'll have to hold you, as a witness, at least, my boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Ned's father had sufficient standing in the town to render unnecessary any formal proceedings in holding Ned, and the sheriff departed without his one-time prisoner, on Ned's promise to give evidence when wanted.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI PLANS FOR A MOTOR-CYCLE RACE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Ned," said Mr. Slade when the sheriff had gone, "you came close to getting into trouble. Why didn't you mention to me something about seeing the light in me mill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought of it," replied the boy, "but after I talked it over with Bob and Jerry we decided it was better not to say anything about it. Besides I haven't told all yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What? Is there more to tell?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I saw some one besides Bill Berry at the mill that night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Noddy Nixon," and then Ned told of meeting Noddy with the box of bait, as the bully had called it. He also related what the three boys had planned to do in keeping watch of Noddy, and of the odd bank bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it would have been wise to tell some older person of all this," commented Mr. Slade. "Still I appreciate that you did not want to cast suspicion on any one. And, as you say, it is only a vague suspicion as yet. Noddy may be as innocent as you. I would like to know more of this Bill Berry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He knows who robbed the mill," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think so?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because he was looking right in the office door when the light was visible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he knew why should he cast suspicion on you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, unless it is to draw attention from some one else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean Noddy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned nodded his head affirmatively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Think no more about it; at least for the present," advised Mr. Slade. "I will see to the legal end of it, and take care you are not again annoyed by the sheriff unless it is necessary to give evidence. I would urge you and your two chums to keep quiet about this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy promised, and both Bob and Jerry agreed to say nothing of the latest development in the mill robbery mystery when Ned had told them of the outcome of the sheriff's act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For several days after this it was so hot that the boys stayed quietly at home instead of taking trips on their machines. Toward the end of the week, however, there came several heavy thunder showers that cooled the air, laid the dust, and made traveling pleasant. It was on Saturday afternoon that the three chums went for another short spin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Coming back they stopped at the Athletic club house. Leaving their wheels in charge of the caretaker they went to the refreshment room to have some soda and ice cream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, what's this?" exclaimed Ned, catching sight of a large notice fastened on the wall. "Come here Chunky and Jerry. This looks as if it was meant for us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rapidly the three boys read an announcement that the Cresville club had decided to hold a grand motor cycle meet, open to competitors of all classes and all makes of machines, not over two cylinders in size. There were to be three prizes. The first was to be optional with the winner and of the value of two thousand dollars, the second one thousand dollars and the third five hundred dollars. Articles worth these amounts would be given, it was stated, and entries would be received until within a week of the race, which was to be on September 20.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think of that, Chunky?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to hit us in the right spot," replied the heavy-weight youth. "I'm going to enter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I," came from Ned and Jerry in a chorus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't it be great if one of us could win the first prize?" inquired Jerry. "Think of getting something worth two thousand dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder what I'd take if I won?" asked Bob of no one in particular.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think we have as good a chance of winning as any one," proceeded Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't doubt it," agreed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then let's agree," and Jerry's face was serious. "that if any of us captures that first prize we'll select an automobile touring car."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An automobile? exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A touring car? cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly. Why not? Isn't that better than a horse, or a motor boat? Think what it would mean. We could travel all over,—make a tour of the United States perhaps. Yes, sir, that's the ticket! If we win let's get a touring car. What do you say, boys?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a few seconds the very audacity of the idea seemed to stagger Ned and Bob. They gradually recovered, and their eyes shone as they realized the possibilities of the plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll do it!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what we will!" asserted Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then all we have to do is to go in and win that first prize," concluded Jerry. "We must begin practice at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And there isn't the least doubt but what you'll win," exclaimed a mocking voice suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys turned, to behold Noddy Nixon grinning at them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not the least in the world," went on the bully in tantalizing tones. "In fact I don't see why they hold any contest at all. The club might as well give you boys all three prizes. It would save a lot of work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here—," began Bob, but Ned placed a quieting hand on his shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't reply to him," said Ned. "It may make trouble."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think because you won a little race a while ago that you can go in a big one," went on Noddy. "But you'll find that this is a different matter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you're going to enter?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it any of your business if I do?" inquired Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None at all," replied Jerry. "Only if you do decide to start in the races you might find this handy, in case you had to cut any wires, you know," and he handed Noddy the knife with the initials N. N. that the boys had found the day their cycles were disabled in the field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" asked Noddy, not seeing at first what it was that Jerry held toward him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a knife that I think belongs to you," said Jerry. "It has been used to cut wires with," he went on. "and it may come in handy for that purpose again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what you mean," Noddy responded, but a deep blush dyed his face and he looked very uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you don't care to claim this?" asked Jerry as he saw Noddy turn aside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't mine; why should I?" Noddy asked in turn, though the boys knew he was telling an untruth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well," Jerry said, replacing the knife in his pocket as Noddy hurried from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a cool one," commented Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what he is," assented Bob. "If he only knew all we know he would act differently."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it's not time to say anything yet," counseled Jerry. "We must go slow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys resumed their talk about the coming motor cycle races. They discussed the questions from all sides, and decided that, accidents excepted, they had at any rate as good a chance of winning, at least one of the prizes, as any one else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll form a community of interests," said Bob. "We'll race separately, but whoever wins pledges himself to get a touring automobile, if one can be had for the amount of the prize, and share it with the others. Is that a go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Every time, as far as I am concerned," was Ned's answer.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII CAUGHT IN THE STORM</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We ought to begin our training for the motor-cycle race soon," said Jerry one morning, when he stopped at Ned's house, coming back from the post-office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you're right," Ned assented. "I think a few good long trips on the road as a starter would be a fine thing. What we need most is an endurance run, for that's what will count in the twenty-five mile race that we are going to compete in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was thinking of that myself," Jerry remarked. "What would you say to a pretty long trip, say one hundred miles? We could run to Huntsville, which is about sixty miles from here as I figure it, stay there all night, and come back the next day. That would give us good practice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sounds as if it might do," was Ned's opinion. "Let's go over and talk to Bob about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eight o'clock the next morning saw them assembled in Bob's yard, for it had been agreed to start from his house. The last touches were given the machines and, at a signal from Jerry, the trip was begun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are we going to stop for dinner?" asked Bob, when they had been riding about an hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There he goes," said Jerry in a pretended complaining voice. "I never did see such a fellow! You'd think he was all stomach."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why," began Ned soberly. "Jerry and I had about made up our minds that we'd go without dinner. It will be good training and you need it you know, Chunky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!" groaned the stout youth. "Oh dear! If I had known that I wouldn't have come along. I can't go without my dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was silence for a little while, broken now and again by a deep sigh from Bob. Jerry and Ned had all they could do to keep from laughing, but they managed to keep their faces serious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's speed up a bit," suggested the stout boy, after a time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinner time will come and pass quicker then," explained the hungry one. "Maybe we won't notice it at all. But I surely will be glad when supper time comes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, we agreed to run slowly," Jerry remarked. "and we must stick to our plan."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob sighed but said nothing. On and on they rode, along pleasant highways, under big shady trees, up hill and down dale. At last, when the sun was almost at the zenith, they came to the top of a hill that led down into a pretty valley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the centre of the vale, which was surrounded on all sides by green wooded hills, nestled a village.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the town of Montville," said Jerry. "We are half way to Huntsville now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are we going to stop here?" asked Bob, a note of hope coming into his voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?" inquired Ned, winking at Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—er—thought—er—we—" began Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Own up! It was dinner you were thinking of, now wasn't it Chunky?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it was," admitted Bob in desperation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry and Ned laughed outright</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see anything so very funny," exclaimed Bob, who was not in the best of humor. "If you had the appetite I have you wouldn't want to laugh!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time the boys had reached the village and were riding through the streets. People turned to stare at them, but the chums were used to that by this time. They steered past a hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah! Um! Doesn't that smell good!" cried Ned, tilting his nose high in the air and sniffing vigorously. "I'll bet they have ham and eggs!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just what I was wishing for," groaned Bob. "I'm going to have my dinner, training or no training, race or no race," and, with a determined look he got off his machine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ha! Ha! Ha!" laughed Bob's two chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wondered how much longer we could keep up the joke," Jerry said, when he had ceased chuckling. "You were easy, Chunky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we are going to have dinner?"asked Bob, all his ill humor gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what we are, Chunky, my boy!" exclaimed Jerry. "We were only fooling you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They all sat down to a bountifully spread table a little later, and Ned and Jerry were almost sorry for the anguish they had caused their chum, when they saw, by the quantity of ham and eggs he consumed, how really hungry he had been.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dinner over, the three boys sat about on the hotel piazza for an hour. They were plied with questions as to the working of their machines by about a score of boys and youths who had gathered to see the motors operated, Jerry kindly went into details and entertained the little audience for some time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I think we'd better be going," said Jerry to his chums at length. "It's two o'clock and we can just about reach Huntsville by night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're goin' t' git ketched in a storm," said the hotel keeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Think so?" inquired Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it." The man pointed to where a bank of dark clouds were accumulating in the west. "Thunder storm coming as sure as guns is guns."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we'll ride on, and if we have to take to shelter I guess we can find it," Jerry said. "We don't mind a little rain. We're out for practice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, good luck to ye," called the hotel man after the three boys, as they rode down the village street. "Stop in agin when ye're in this direction."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a time it seemed as if the prediction of the storm was not going to be verified. The bank of clouds grew no larger, and the sun still shone. The boys speeded up a bit as they struck a stretch of good road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hark! What was that?"asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sounded like thunder," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no doubt of it a minute later, for the distant rumble of the sky artillery could easily be distinguished. The wind, which had died away, began to blow stronger, and the clouds spread over the heavens and were blacker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It won't break for half an hour," was Ned's opinion. "We can ride on through a little rain, but if it gets too bad we can turn into some barn."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In less than fifteen minutes the first drops splashed down. The rumble of thunder grew louder, and there were vivid spurts and tongues of lighting leaping across the black vapor masses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Crack! sounded a report so loud that it seemed as if lightning had struck near by. For a moment there was no apparent increase in the fury of the storm. Then came a flash so bright that it seemed as if the whole heavens had been lighted up. It was followed by a terrifying crash that fairly shook the earth, and then came a deluge of water that almost hid the three boys one from another as it poured down from the clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'd better get out of this!" cried Jerry. "It seems to be getting worse. Put on full speed! I saw a house a little way ahead. We'll stop there until this is over!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned and Bob could just hear Jerry through the noise the storm made, though the boy was shouting at the top of his voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The storm was at its height now. The lightning seemed incessant, and the thunder claps followed one after the other so closely that it was a continual roar. The wind was a regular gale, driving the rain with stinging force into the faces of the riders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here we are!" yelled Jerry presently. "Turn in!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dimly through the rain Ned and Bob could see their chum steering through a drive-way alongside of a white house on the left of the highway. They followed him, and soon found themselves in front of a barn, to which the drive-way led.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurry up inside!" Jerry called. "And bring the machines in with you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The motors were stopped and three drenched boys trundled them into the shelter of the barn, the doors of which Jerry had found unlocked, and had managed to open.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whew! This is a storm!" exclaimed Ned, wiping the water from his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Storm! I should say so—terrible—fearful! Worst one in twenty-one years! Hundreds of people struck! Houses burned! Barns blown over! Awful! Awful! Hello! Bob, Ned and Jerry! Where'd you come from? Glad to see you—come in—shut the door—get up in the hay and dry off—this is the worst ever!" and then the voice, that had uttered all this in one breath stopped, and the three chums who had started in surprise as the torrent of words began, turned to behold their friend Andy Rush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, how in the world did you get here?" asked Jerry, taking off his cap and wringing the water from it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On a visit—my Aunt Jane lives here—nice lady—she'll be glad to see you—lots to eat—I'm having a fine time—came out here to feed the horse—storm came up—I didn't want to get wet—say how'd you get here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same old Andy," murmured Ned to Bob. "He'll beat the storm for wind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We were going to Huntsville on our motors," Jerry explained. "and we got caught in the deluge. Do you suppose your aunt will mind if we stay here a while?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit—glad to have you—Whoop! That was a cracker—bet it struck the house!" cried Andy, as a louder clap of thunder than usual fairly shook the barn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andy ran to the door and peered through a crack in the direction of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nope, it's all right," he called, in a sort of disappointed tone. "No damage done—but say—I'm glad you happened to strike this place—how's things in Cresville? I've been here a week—fishing—riding horses—milking cows—lots of fun—can't you stay a few days—I know a dandy place to fish—catch big suckers—chub—Aunt Jane will give you lots to eat—whoop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andy could not seem to keep still. He hurried around in the barn, and, to give vent to his feelings he crawled up on a high beam, and jumped down in a big pile of hay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three chums were laughing so they could hardly speak. When they ceased Jerry thanked Andy for the invitation, but said they had made other plans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you can stay all night," suggested Andy, calming down a bit. "The roads will be bad after this storm. You can go to Huntsville in the morning. It's only ten miles from here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The idea appealed to the boys. The storm showed no signs of stopping, and they knew it would be impossible to go on while it lasted. As Andy had said, they could proceed in the morning, and there was no special need of reaching Huntsville anyhow, except that they wanted to carry out the arrangements they had made, and make a trip of over a hundred miles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evening was pleasantly spent in talking, singing and playing games. Andy's uncle wanted the three chums to remain over a day or two, but, though they thanked him for the invitation they decided to push on the next morning, complete their schedule trip, and then return home.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII A LEAP FOR LIFE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" cried Andy the next morning, bursting into the room where the three chums had slept. "Hurrah! It's a fine day! Rain all stopped—sun shines—sorry to see you fellows go—come again!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take it easy," advised Jerry. "We're very much obliged to you, Andy, for providing this fine shelter for us. Wish you were going along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I—can't though—got to stay here another week—help run the farm—maybe I'll be a farmer some day—whoop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the storm, which had been an unusually severe one, the roads were in fairly good shape. Now and then a stretch would be reached where speed had to be slackened but, by picking their way, the machines were pushed along at a good rate. Huntsville was reached in about two hours, and the boys left their machines in charge of a store keeper while they walked about the town viewing the sights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was not much to be seen, and they had come more for the sake of saying they had ridden the distance than from any other reason. Purchasing a few souvenirs for the folks at home, and buying some sandwiches in case they might not find a convenient eating place, the boys prepared for the return trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll take a little different way on our back trip," said Jerry. "I know a road that goes past a fine waterfall that's worth seeing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hills were about fifty feet high, and, with the jagged rocks over which the water flowed, and the trees on either side, made a picture well worth beholding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys stopped for half an hour, watching the leaping, falling water, which possessed a peculiar fascination. Then, as they still had most of their trip before them, Jerry suggested they had better start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had not yet turned into the road leading to Cresville, from which they had diverged in order to visit the falls, when riding along a rather lonely stretch of the highway, the boys came in sight of a white house, with no other residences near it. As they came opposite a man suddenly ran from the front door. He seemed greatly excited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop!" he called to the boys. "Stop, for Heaven's sake."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was so much anguish in his tone that the boys knew something must have happened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" asked Jerry, riding up to the front gate and dismounting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's my wife! She has just been taken very sick and I'm all alone here. I need a doctor, but I dare not leave her to get one, and I have no one to send. I saw you coming down the road and I thought maybe you would help me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course we will," replied Jerry heartily. "Where does the doctor live? I'll ride after him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His house is about two miles from here," said the man. "It's the first one after you cross the white bridge. Oh! Hurry, and tell him to be quick! I'm afraid my wife is dying! Tell him to come to Mr. Johnson's! Oh! What shall I do!" and the unfortunate man showed so much distress that the hearts of the boys were touched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't worry," Jerry advised. "I'll make good time. Ned and Bob will stay with you. Maybe they will be of some help."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Springing into the saddle, Jerry started his machine and soon had it going at a good rate. Because of the condition of the roads, which were not in the best of shape, he dared not push the motor to the limit. Ned and Bob followed the man into the house, willing to do what they could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Jerry rode on. A turn of the road soon hid the lonely farm house from sight. The grade was up hill for a way, and the machine did not make such good time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must hurry," reasoned the boy. "I hope I find the doctor at home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few minutes Jerry had come to the top of the hill. At the foot of the slope, which was about half a mile in extent, the boy saw a white bridge, that spanned a narrow but swift running stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here goes!" cried Jerry. He was about to coast at half speed down the hill when a voice suddenly called:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't!" shouted back Jerry. "I'm hurrying for the doctor!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy turned to see who had warned him, and saw a farmer hurrying across the field toward him. Something in his manner caused Jerry to dismount.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't get across the bridge!" cried the man. "It's broken. If you ride down that hill you'll be killed! I stopped you just in time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry felt his heart sink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The rains made the creek rise," explained the man. "The farther span of the bridge was carried away last night. There's a sign just this side of it warning people, but if you rode down on that lickity-split thing I knew you'd never see the sign until it was too late."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm much obliged to you," said Jerry. "But I must cross that stream. A lady back there," pointing in the direction he had come. "is dying. I'm after the doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's bad," said the man. "But I don't see how you're going to do it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is the missing span of the bridge too wide for me to jump across?" asked Jerry, a sudden idea coming into his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's fifteen feet," replied the man. "That's too much for you I reckon. And if you didn't make it you'd be killed, for the current is very swift, and the creek is full of rocks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't we get planks and bridge the gap?" asked the boy in desperation. "Something must be done."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm on my way to get men to mend the break now," the man said. "But it will take some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't there another bridge near here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not one within five miles either way," was the answer. "I'm very sorry, my boy. Is the sick woman any relation of yours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, her husband stopped me as I was riding past the house with my two chums, and begged us to hurry after a doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll go after some planks," said the man. "but it may take two hours to get 'em here. I'll have to hunt for 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly Jerry rode his motor down to the white structure that spanned the now swollen and swiftly running stream. As the man had said the last span of the bridge, on the side farthest from Jerry, had been carried away. It was the part which had extended from the shore to the stone abutment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy carefully examined the ruined bridge. There were planks on the floor, but they were firmly spiked down, and none of them seemed long enough. To leap the gap was a feat beyond Jerry's ability, though a professional jumper might have done it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If the stream wasn't so swift I could swim it," the boy murmured. "But it's too risky. Besides, even if I get over, I wonder how the doctor is to come back? Though I guess I can manage that. He can bring some planks with him, and walk over on them. That part will be all right if I can only get across."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Jerry had to admit that the problem was a difficult one to solve. He looked at the bridge with sorrow in his heart as he thought of the man waiting anxiously for the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I simply must get across. "exclaimed the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he walked to the edge of the structure, looking in vain for a plank that would serve, Jerry noticed a strange trick that the water had played. In tearing away the far span the timbers that remained resting on the stone abutment had been loosened. This caused the middle of what was left of the bridge to sag, or dip down to considerable degree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All at once a daring thought came to Jerry. He looked at the sagging bridge, at the gap where the span was missing, and at the angry waters that swirled between him and the other shore. Then he turned and looked back at the hill which came to an end right at the bridge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have it!" cried the boy, his eyes shining with excitement. "If I only dare do it! I will do it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hurried back to where he had left his motor cycle. He started it in motion and rode slowly back up the hill which he had just descended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Any one seeing him, and not knowing his plan might have thought he had given up in despair. But Jerry was not that kind of a boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he looked at the broken and sagging bridge he had suddenly thought of a trick he had seen performed in a circus that had exhibited in Cresville. This was where a man on a bicycle had started down a steep incline of boards to accomplish what was billed as "A Leap For Life!" The incline was broken about three-quarters of the way down, making a gap. Just before the gap was reached there was a dip, or curve in the incline. Across the gap the incline was continued at a slight angle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The principle on which the feat was performed was, that the man on the bicycle, rushing down the incline, would get momentum enough to shoot across the gap. To prevent the wheel and rider from falling from the attraction of gravitation while it was flying across the space, the end of the incline was curved upward. This served to shoot the machine and man into the air, and overcame, for the time necessary to speed across the gap, the pull of the earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And, in a crude way, Jerry saw before him all the elements that went to make up the trick as it is performed in many circuses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hill made the incline. The sag in the middle of the bridge, and the little rise at the further abutment, gave the necessary upward curve that would throw Jerry and his motor far enough into the air to prevent him tumbling into the stream. The missing span was the gap corresponding to the one in the inclined plane of boards, and the road on the farther shore would make a good landing place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I can do it as well as that man in the circus!" exclaimed Jerry. "It's a risk, I know, but I can't stay here and wait two hours for that man to bring the planks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was soon at the top of the hill. He looked around to see if any one was in sight to aid him in case he failed. But the roads were deserted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must put on full speed," thought the boy. "I'll need all the momentum I can get."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned his machine to face down the slope. For a moment he hesitated as he looked at what was before him. But, steeling his heart, and uttering a short prayer, he leaped into the saddle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here I go!" thought Jerry. He turned the motor to full speed, and soon was racing down the hill at a fearful pace. "There's no stopping now!" he murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How the wind sang in his ears! The motor fairly hummed beneath him, and the big tires threw up a shower of mud. On and on rushed the boy! Nearer and nearer he came to the broken bridge. He heard a shout behind him but he dared not turn to see who it was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was twenty feet from the spot where the road ended and the bridge began. He wanted to shut his eyes, but he knew he must guide the motor with a firm and steady hand. He gripped the steering bars with all his might. There was a whizz as the rubber tires struck the wooden planking of the bridge. Jerry felt himself going down as he reached the sagging middle of the broken structure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, like a stone fired from some ancient catapult, he felt his machine rise under him, shoot up into the air, and sail across the gap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For one instant Jerry looked down at the black swirling waters below him. Then with a terrific thud he felt himself land on the road across the missing span.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had made the leap for life and succeeded!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So swiftly was the machine going that even the shock of the landing in the road beyond the broken bridge did not check it. On and on it rushed until Jerry, whose breath had been almost shaken from him by the concussion, turned off the power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I must not stop!" cried the boy. "I'm safely across, and I've got to get the doctor!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So turning on the power again he sent the motor flying down the road. Three-quarters of a mile further he came to the first house. There was a sign on it:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DR. JOHN RAND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is the doctor in?"gasped Jerry, barely able to stand as he leaped from his machine and ring the bell which was answered by a woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, right in his office," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell him he's wanted at once! Mrs. Johnson is dying!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I can't get across the bridge; it is broken," said Dr. Rand, who had come from his office in time to hear Jerry's message.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got across," exclaimed the boy. "Quick, doctor! You must hurry! Take a long plank along and you can get over the gap!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if I did get across, how am I to get my horse over? He can't walk a plank," objected the medicine man. "It will take a long time for me to walk to Mrs. Johnson's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more it looked as if Jerry had failed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX JERRY AND THE DOCTOR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how I can get there in time to be of any service," Dr. Rand went on. "I'll start and walk of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a better plan!" cried Jerry suddenly. Hitch up your horse, and bring two planks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, my boy, you can't get a horse and carriage across on two narrow planks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not going to try," responded Jerry. "Please do as I say, doctor. We must lose no time. Get the planks and hitch up, please. I'll get you over the bridge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the rig was ready. The boards stuck out ahead and behind the carriage, in which the doctor seated himself with his driver. While the boy rode his machine to the bridge the doctor urged the horse to a gallop, and soon the structure was reached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now what is your plan, Jerry!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He felt his machine rise under him.— Page 154 Image of Jerry jumping his bike over a broken section of a bridge, with rushing water beneath him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll show you, sir. Quick, get out the planks and lay them over the gap."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The driver soon had the two boards in position. They formed a narrow and not very steady temporary bridge over where the black water showed below the missing span.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you walk across, doctor?" inquired Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess so, my head is pretty steady," was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then cross, and I'll follow with my machine," said the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It took the doctor but a few seconds to cross the planks, carrying his medicine case. Then Jerry, pushing his machine on one plank, and walking on the other, joined the physician.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell your driver to come back for you in about two hours," suggested Jerry. "If the lady is going to get better I guess you can safely leave by that time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you seem to have the matter all planned," said the doctor smiling, as he called the order to his driver. "But still I don't see how I am to get to Mrs. Johnson's unless I walk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're going on my motor cycle," said Jerry. "You can stand on the back step, and hold on to me. This machine will carry two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," agreed the physician. "I must take the risk, I guess."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you won't be taking any more of a risk than that youngster did, doc," interrupted a voice, and the man who had warned Jerry came up. He had several planks with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I watched him shoot across that gap," he went on, "and it made me shiver. I thought sure he'd be killed. I hollered at him to wait, as I had some planks, but I guess he didn't hear me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I heard somebody, but I couldn't stop," Jerry said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And do you mean to say you leaped across that missing span?" asked the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what he done, doc," said the man. "It was as nervy a thing as I ever seen, and I never seen it outside of a circus."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It wasn't anything," said Jerry modestly. "I had to get across, and that was the only way. But we are wasting time. Come on, doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So, with a nervous dread in his heart, the physician got on the rear step, and clasped Jerry about the shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give us a start," Jerry asked of the countryman, for the boy found it hard to pedal the machine up grade with the added weight of his passenger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The shove gave the motor start enough so that Jerry could turn on the power, and then he rode on, bearing the much-needed physician. In a comparatively short time they reached the Johnson house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad you came, doctor!" exclaimed the woman's husband. "I'm afraid you're too late though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll see," said the physician cheerfully, as he dismounted from the rather uncomfortable step and hurried into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the doctor found that Mrs. Johnson was in much pain and suffering, he soon discovered that he was not in danger of immediate death, though her symptoms were alarming enough to cause herself and her husband much fear. The physician was able to afford some relief, and in about an hour the woman was much better, and, so the physician said, on the road to recovery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I only got here just in time," the physician remarked. "If she had suffered from such great pain much longer it would have weakened her heart so that the results might have been serious. You owe a great deal to this brave boy, Mr. Johnson. Only for him, and for his ingenuity in getting me here, the case might have had a different ending."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I realize that," said the man. "and I can't thank him enough. The other two boys aided me also. I don't know what I would have done without them. They helped me heat water and in other ways. I am sure I'll never forget it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After seeing that his patient was as comfortable as possible the physician said he would return home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll send you as far as the bridge in a carriage," proposed Mr. Johnson. "That is if one of these boys can drive you and bring the rig back. I don't feel like leaving Mrs. Johnson yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll drive," volunteered Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he hitched up a horse and soon the doctor was ready to go, saying he would call again the next day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You boys had better stay here all night," invited Mr. Johnson. "I'll be glad to have you, and it's so late now you can't get to Cresville."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What will our folks say?" asked Bob. "You know they might worry if we didn't come home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is a telegraph station not far from my house," put in Dr. Rand. "A message can be sent to Cresville from there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it was arranged. Ned drove the doctor back, and found that in the meantime the bridge had been repaired so that the passage was safer, though a horse could not be driven over it. The physician promised to send the message to the boys' parents, and, leaving Ned, Dr. Rand walked across the planks, got in his own carriage and drove home, while Ned made his way back to Mr. Johnson's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sick woman continued to improve and soon was much better. Mr. Johnson secured the services of some women neighbors who were brought to his house by Ned in the carriage, and arrangements were made for the boys to spend the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning Mrs. Johnson was so much better that she insisted on sitting up and having a talk with the three boys, whose coming was so fortunate for her. She had high praise for them, especially for Jerry, who blushed like a girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hear you all come from Cresville," said Mrs. Johnson. "Isn't that where a mill was robbed not long ago?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some one took one thousand dollars from Mr. Judson's place," answered Ned, wondering what was coming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think the thieves must have got some of my money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your money? What do you mean?" asked Ned. "I thought it was all Mr. Judson's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was. I mean that I paid a bill at the mill the afternoon of the night the robbery took place. Mr. Judson took my money, together with some other that he had in a box, and locked it all in the safe. It was quite late, and he said that he would not have time to go to the bank."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!" cried Ned. "Then some of the money you paid was taken, for it was the very money that Mr. Judson didn't take to the bank that was stolen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then there ought to be a clue to the thief," went on Mrs. Johnson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because with the money I paid was a queer looking bill," said the woman. "It was from some Massachusetts state bank, instead of a national note, and it had a funny mark on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you remember what that mark was?" asked Ned, while the other boys waited in breathless silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I remember it very well," said Mrs. Johnson. "There was a monogram of three letters. I recall them very distinctly because they were the initials of my brother's name. He is dead, so of course he could not have put them on the bill, but some one with the same initials did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what were the letters?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They were H. R. C," was the answer. The boys, who recalled the initials on the queer bill that Paul Banner had received from Noddy Nixon, were too startled to reply. They did not know what to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That certainly ought to furnish a clue," said Jerry at length, making a sign to Ned and Bob to say nothing. "But the police do not know that; or, if they do, they have made nothing of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I'll write and tell them," said Mrs. Johnson. "It seems a shame for Mr. Judson to lose all that money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps that would be a good plan," Jerry said quietly. "What was the value of the queer bill?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was a ten dollar note," replied Mrs. Johnson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After some further conversation the boys, finding there was nothing more they could do, decided they had better start for home. They were prevailed on, however, to remain for dinner and, shortly after that meal, the doctor having come in the meanwhile and pronouncing Mrs. Johnson out of danger, the three chums motored to Cresville, where they arrived at dusk.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX CLOSING THE NET</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, things seem to be narrowing down," said Ned the next day, when he called on Jerry. "Rather odd, that information about the queer bank bill coming out, wasn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It certainly was," agreed Jerry. "I want to get another look at the note Paul has. Suppose I hunt him up this afternoon?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good idea," commented Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly Jerry looked up the dapper Polly, and, after a general conversation, managed to turn the talk to odd coins and bank bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you remember that queer bill you showed me one day, not long ago?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do," replied Paul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you got it yet?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, my dear boy, I have not," answered Paul, lighting one of his perfumed Egyptian cigarettes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What—what did you do with it?" asked Jerry, fearing lest the clue he hoped for had gotten away from him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—humph! That's queer, I forget now what I did do with it. Oh, yes! I remember now. Some young chap, a friend of yours I guess, asked me to sell it to him. He said he thought there was a premium on it. He gave me eleven dollars for it. I made one dollar, so I was satisfied. You know you said you were going to see if the bill had any value, but I guess you forgot it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did, for a fact," said Jerry, sorry now he had not remembered to do as he had promised. "But who has the bill now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I forget the boy's name I sold it to," Paul said in reply. "but he talks very fast, is always in a hurry, and doesn't seem to have time to breathe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Andy Rush, I'll bet a cooky," cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the name. I thought first it was Andy Hurry, but I remember now, it was Rush. It's the same thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty nearly," agreed Jerry. "Well, I'll be going I guess."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due time Andy Rush returned from his visit to his aunt. Jerry heard of his home-coming and soon hunted up the rapid chap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you get home all right?" burst out Andy as soon as he caught sight of Jerry. "My but that was a storm—wish you could have stayed with me—I had jolly fun—the horse ran away with me—I got chased by a bull—fell in the ditch—sprained my wrist, and got kicked by a cow—whoop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say Andy," broke in Jerry, anxious to get on the subject that interested him. "have you a queer bank bill that you got from Paul Banner?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have!" exclaimed Andy. "I gave him a dollar extra for it. I thought it might be valuable—no go—bill is just like any other—no premium—I'm out a dollar—too bad!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd buy it from you for just what you gave for it," said Jerry eagerly. "I want it for a particular purpose. Will you sell it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I sure will!" cried Andy. "I don't like to lose money—here it is—glad you spoke—I would have spent it in a week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry, who happened to have the necessary amount with him, passed eleven dollars over to Andy, and received the odd ten dollar note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bidding the boy who was always in a hurry a good-bye Jerry left. As soon as he was where he could not be observed he examined the bank note closely. It tallied exactly with the description given by Mrs. Johnson, just as Jerry had expected it would from his former view of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Ned told his father of the latest developments Mr. Slade said he would take the matter under advisement. At his direction Jerry handed over the queer bill, Mr. Slade paying what the boy had expended for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will keep it," said the merchant. "until the time comes to use it. Meanwhile you boys had better say nothing about the matter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was three days later when the chums, having gone for a short ride on their motors, stopped one afternoon at a little wayside refreshment booth, where the proprietor had cakes, candy, ice cream and soda water for sale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the boys were eating their refreshments in the shade of a canvas awning the owner of the stand had put up, a horse and carriage, rapidly driven, passed along the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The driver pulled his beast up quickly as he came opposite the booth, and jumped out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hi, Bill," he called to his companion, who was in the carriage. "Come here and we'll wet our whistle. I'm as dry as a chip."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's Noddy Nixon, and Bill Berry is with him!" exclaimed Jerry. "I hope they don't bother us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're not afraid, are you?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit, but I don't want a row here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy did not appear to notice the three boys. He ordered some lemon soda in a blustering tone, and when he paid for it pulled out quite a roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where'd you get all the money?" the boys heard Bill ask Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I had a little and Jack Pender loaned me the rest," said Noddy with a laugh. "Jack's a soft mark. He'd give me all he had."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could find some one as accommodating," said Bill with a chuckle, as he drained his glass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on!" cried Noddy. Then he cast a look over to where the chums were sitting. He started to walk toward them and seemed about to say something.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep quiet!" the boys heard Bill advise Noddy, at the same time grasping him by the arm. "Don't raise a row with those cubs again. They know too much now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" growled Noddy. "I'd like to punch their heads, though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he and Bill got in their carriage and drove away at a rapid pace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Punch our heads!" muttered Bob. "I'd like to see him try it. He's always talking of it. why doesn't he do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess he knows it wouldn't be healthy," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI PRACTICE FOR THE RACE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must begin track work," said Jerry one afternoon, when the three chums, having been out on a spin, stopped beneath the shade of a road-side tree. In a week from to-day the races take place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think we are all in pretty good trim, and so are the machines," ventured Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That part's all right, Chunky," came from Ned. "but what we want is track work, as Jerry says. Nothing like getting right on the ground. Besides, we have been speeding on a wide road, where we have all the room we want. It will be different when there are twenty riders on a narrow track, each one wanting to get inside."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned and Bob agreed that it would be the very thing needed. Accordingly the next morning, early, saw the three boys at the track of the Cresville Athletic Club. Though it was little more than eight o'clock the chums found about a dozen riders with their motors "warming-up" on the banked oval. The explosions of the numerous gasolene engines sounded like a miniature battle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If any one challenges you to a little sprint, accept it," said Jerry to Ned and Bob, "but don't attempt to win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?" asked Ned, always ready to take sides.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell you later," was all Jerry had time to say, for just then two young men rode up to our heroes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you fellows say to a little sprint for a few miles around the track," inquired one young man, who wore a blue sweater.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a practice warm-up," put in the other, who was attired in a pair of pink racing trousers. "It's rather dull going around this way, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We don't mind a little race," said Jerry. "Just for fun, however."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course. What sort of a start do you prefer, flying or from a standstill?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Flying will suit us," Ned put in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Come on, we'll ride around once together, line up at the judge's stand, and make a four-mile circuit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was agreeable to the boys and they prepared for the start with their unknown rivals. They all came up to the line opposite the judges' stand in good formation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go!" shouted the youth in the blue sweater.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each contestant turned more power into his motor and the machines whizzed around the track in good time. It was easy to see that the two strangers were trying to get a "line" on the speeds of the motors of the three chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Both of the youths who had been so anxious for the sprint watched with eager eyes every motion of Bob, Ned and Jerry. But the latter, under the direction of Jerry, did not operate their motors at top speed. This was what the strangers wanted. They desired to see just how fast the machines of the Cresville boys could go, so as to know what sort of competitors they would have when the big event came on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All the efforts of the two schemers to get either of our three heroes to "make pace" for them failed. Bob, Ned and Jerry just went around easily, sometimes taking the lead, and again dropping behind. The impromptu race was finally ended with the motors running about three-quarters speed, and Jerry and Ned just a little in the lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You two win!" cried the youth in the blue sweater. "Pretty good machines you have there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They'll do," agreed Jerry, determined that the strangers should not find out that they had been suspected. "And we went at a pretty good clip, while it lasted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No doubt," commented the lad in the blue sweater. Plainly the two plotters were disappointed. They had not succeeded in taking the speed-measure of the three chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The track was now well filled with those practicing for the coming race. More than a score were scooting around on their machines. Few motors were as fine and complete as those of the three chums and not many had the double cylinder improvement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall we go around again?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think we'd better," counseled Jerry. "That sprint was nothing. What we most need is to ride in a big crowd and not lose our nerve when we think there is going to be a collision."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope there will be no smashups," came from Bob. "If I thought that I wouldn't go in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There will not be any if you are careful," advised Jerry. "Just keep your wits about you and mind your steering. Poor steering is responsible for more accidents than anything else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you suppose those two chaps wanted to see how fast we could go for?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They wanted to know just what sort of opposition they might count on," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think those fellows gained much," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me either," commented Jerry. "Another thing we must look out for is a pocket."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" asked Bob, who was not very, well up on racing terms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll see in a minute," said Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He speeded up his motor. At the sound of the quicker explosions there were hasty glances at the youth on the part of many strangers. Jerry was off down the track in a trice. The next instant a dozen riders had taken after him, anxious to see what his machine could do. But Jerry was too wise to be caught.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pretended to be trying to get more revolutions from his motor, but, in reality he was throttling down the gasolene and advancing the spark, which made the reports quicker but which did not increase his speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bunch of a dozen riders soon surrounded Jerry. He continued to speed away, but in a few moments he found himself in the apex of a "V" shaped gathering of contestants. They were ahead and on either side of him; a veritable pocket, from which there was no way out so close were the riders bunched. As soon as Jerry would try to pass any one the others would crowd in front and prevent it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finally Jerry shut off the power of his machine, and with a laugh at the efforts of those who thought they were fooling him, he came to a halt, and dismounted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Smart kid, that," commented one of the older riders. "Up to snuff!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thinks he is," growled the youth in the blue sweater. "He and those other two with him fooled me a while ago. I couldn't get a rise out of him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now you see what a pocket is," said Jerry as he joined his chums. "If you get into one do your best to ride out, or you'll lose the race, providing the others stick together and have made up their mind to let one of their number win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The practice continued for some time. A little before noon there was a stir at the track entrance and a motor cycle, painted a bright red on every available space shot on the track. The loudness of the explosions told that it was a machine of high power, and it attracted considerable attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a faster machine than ours," called Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and do you see who's riding it?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. Who?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jack Pender."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that Noddy's machine painted over?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it looks like a new one," said Ned. "Yes, it is a new one," he added as he got a closer view of the motor which swept by at that instant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he goes in the race we'll have to look sharp if we want our touring car," Jerry remarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jack Pender did not seem to care to have anything to say to the three chums, and neither did they seek to speak to the bully's toady. Bob, Ned and Jerry rode together around the track for several minutes, while Jack occasionally passed them, making swift speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Guess I'll go off and get some dinner," Jerry announced finally. He was opposite the gate by which riders left the track and steered for it. He looked and saw Jack coming toward him, but noted that the latter would, in the natural course of events, pass behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look out there! What's the matter with you?" cried Jack in sudden anger. Jerry glanced around in time to see the rider of the red machine steering directly for him, having left his course to do so. A collision was imminent, and only by a skillful handling of his machine did Jerry so manage that Jack only struck the rear wheel with his front one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you trying to do?" cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you up to?" retorted Jack. "You got right in my way!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I say you deliberately left your path to try and run me down!" cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's false!" exclaimed Jack, getting off his motor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is not, and I'll leave it to any one who saw it," spoke Jerry sharply. He was very angry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's right; you had plenty of room to pass him," said a quiet dark man, who had been making several rounds of the track. "I don't know either of you, but the man on the red machine is to blame."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mind your own business!" snapped Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, my young friend," said the dark man, as he got off his machine and came close to Jack. "I would advise you to be a little more careful of your language and your conduct. You were either foolishly or deliberately careless in this matter. This track is for gentlemen, remember."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What affair of yours is it. "asked jack with a growl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am one of the directors of the club, and I will most certainly make it my affair, if necessary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jack had nothing more to say, and turned off the track with his loud-puffing machine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he damage your motor any?" asked the man of Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess not," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you want to make a complaint to the club I will be a witness for you," went on the director of the organization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I had rather drop it now," replied Jerry. "I thank you, just the same."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He and Noddy make a nice team, don't they. "inquired Ned, he and Bob having followed Jerry from the track.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I suppose it comes natural for them to be mean," replied Jerry. "The only thing to do is to avoid trouble, but not to give in too much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if he is going in the race with that red machine? If so we'll have to hustle," commented Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what races are for," said Jerry, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII JACK PENDER'S TRICK</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was on Saturday, when they had once more gone to the track for practice, that the boys had another encounter with Noddy Nixon and Jack Pender. The three chums had been making several rounds, and, as it was rather warm, had left the oval and gone to lie down in the shade of some trees. Their machines they had left in the rear of the club house, not far away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know what I think we ought to do?" asked Bob as he reclined at length in the grass, chewing a straw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What new plan have you on foot now, Chunky? A scheme to get some one to race for you, or an arrangement to get out of training?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Neither one," was the reply. "but I think we ought to begin to think of what we will do with our touring automobile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait until one of us wins it," advised Ned. "We don't stand any better chance than a dozen others."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From off in the distance there sounded the loud explosions of an approaching motor cycle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's Noddy's machine," said Jerry. "I hope he doesn't come around here bothering us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The noise sounded nearer and, in a few minutes Noddy rode up on his cycle. He got off, ran his machine close to where the three chums had stored theirs, and then came to where Bob, Ned and Jerry were taking their ease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You fellows going in the race?" asked Noddy, in rather more friendly tones than he was in the habit of using to those he did not care for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We expect to," answered Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you think you'll all win, I s'pose?" went on the bully, in a sneering tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One of us hopes to take a prize," said Jerry, preserving a calm voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't any of you one chance in a hundred," said Noddy decidedly. "Some of the best motor cyclists in the country are going in the race."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess we stand as good a chance as any one," put in Ned. "This isn't like bicycle riding. A great deal depends on the machine, and we have good ones."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tell you none of you can win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You wait and see," advised Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you want to back your opinion with any money. "asked Noddy. "If you do, say the word and I'll bet you any amount." He pulled out quite a roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We don't bet," returned Jerry quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! I suppose you're afraid you'll lose," came with a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, it isn't that," went on Jerry, looking the bully square in the eye. "We don't bet on principle, but we do think we'll win, and, if we did bet it would not be with you, Noddy Nixon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to say I'm not good enough to bet with?" demanded Noddy, advancing toward Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't say that, but you can take my remark any way you choose," replied Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'll take it that you want to insult me!" exclaimed the bully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I allow no one to insult me without paying for it," proceeded Noddy, in a blustering tone. "You'll have to fight me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here!" exclaimed Jerry. "You seem to want to pick a quarrel, Noddy Nixon. Let me tell you I'm not afraid of you. I don't want to fight, but, if I have to you'll be the first to cry 'quits.' I'm not anxious to fight, but I'm not going to run away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor I!" cried Ned and Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can fight us all, one after the other," suggested Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mind your own business, I wasn't talking to you," called Noddy, now thoroughly angry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The business of one of us is the business of all of us," replied Jerry with a laugh. "Better be careful Noddy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bully growled out something in reply, and cast a glance over his shoulder. He gave a start as he did so, and then, turning quickly made off on his machine. Jerry looked in the direction Noddy had peered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'd better be getting over to our machines," said Jerry suddenly. "I thought I saw some one moving about near them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only boys watching to see how they work," said Bob, who felt too comfortable to move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going over to see who they are, though. Looks like a pretty big boy, and I don't want my machine put out of gear when the race is only four days off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so, those youngsters might get something out of kilter," agreed Ned, springing up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He and Jerry went over to where the motors had been left. The cycles were surrounded by a crowd of small boys, but, as Jerry had remarked, one of the lads seemed to be well grown. Suddenly the group of youngsters parted and a tall youth came from their midst. He glanced in the direction of Jerry and Ned, and then, with a quick motion, broke into a run. He hurried around the comer of the club house and, the next instant there came the sound of a motor cycle in motion. A second later a red machine was observed moving, off in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was Jack Pender!" cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's who it was!" agreed Ned. "And he was up to some trick, I'll bet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he's damaged my machine he'll pay for it," vowed Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys, who were joined by Bob in a little while, reached their machines. The crowd of small lads who had not gone watched the three chums as they made a careful examination of their wheels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That fellow said he was fixing them," volunteered a little boy in short trousers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What fellow?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The one that just went away from here. He had a wrench and screw driver and he was doing something to the engine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was he?" asked Jerry, wanting to make sure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know! It was Jack Pender!" exclaimed another of the small boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry was the first to finish the examination of his motor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he's fixed mine all right!" he exclaimed, straightening up. "He's taken off part of the carburetor and the motor is no good until I get a new one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's done the same thing to mine!" cried Ned, just discovering the damage which had been done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And to mine," added Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boys, this is very serious," said Jerry when he had drawn his two chums out of hearing of the group of small boys. "The machines can't run without those parts."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But can't we easily get them?"asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We could in New York, or Boston or some large city," said Jerry. "But have we time to send? To-day is Saturday, the race takes place Thursday. We can't get word to any supply store until Monday morning, and it's a question whether we would receive the parts in time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can telegraph," said Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Even that takes time. Jack Pender laid his plans well for this trick. He means to keep us out of the race!" Jerry said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't we get the parts in Cresville?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a store keeps them that I know of," replied Jerry. "I'm afraid we're done for. Most likely Pender broke the parts and threw them away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, we're not done for!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I'll ride into Boston to-night and get the new parts!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But none of our machines can be run," objected Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll borrow Mr. Wakefield's," said Ned. "He'll lend it to me when I tell him how the case stands!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurrah!" exclaimed Bob. "You're the stuff, Ned!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I doubt if you can do it," objected Jerry. "There is no moon to-night, and the roads are hard to find."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to try," insisted Ned. "Jack Pender shall not keep us out of the race if I can prevent it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, hurry and find Mr. Wakefield," urged Jerry. "There's no time to lose. Bob and I will see to your machine and you can start at once."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII THE RIDE TO BOSTON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned found Mr. Wakefield, the athletic instructor, in the gymnasium of the club house. The boy hastily told him of the trouble, not however mentioning Jack's name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And, Mr. Wakefield," said Ned, in great distress. "If we can't get those carburetor parts we can't race."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll do all I can to help you," said Mr. Wakefield. "Take my machine and welcome."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned really had quite a task before him. It was a long ride to Boston, and there would be no moon. Besides the roads were not of the best. It was after four o'clock when he secured Mr. Wakefield's machine, and a half hour was lost in oiling it up, and seeing that it was in shape for the lengthy trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not know whether to let you go or not," said Mr. Slade, when Ned broached the subject to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I really must go, father," and Ned spoke so earnestly that Mr. Slade was more than half persuaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I suppose it is hard to have to think of giving up the race" he said at length. "And it seems to be the only way to do. So you may go, but be very careful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will," promised Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He prepared himself for the trip, and was about to start from his house, where he had taken Mr. Wakefield's machine, when Bob and Jerry came along. They had wheeled their motors to their houses, and brought Ned's with them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you off?"asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just ready to start," was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to be able to get the parts in any automobile store," said Jerry. "The only bad feature of the trip will be coming home. I wish I was going along."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I haven't any time to lose," said Ned. "so here goes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaped into the saddle, started the machine off by means of the pedals and soon was pushing down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The start was made about half past five o'clock, on a pleasant afternoon. The sun shone through a hazy mist, and, though it had been warm, it was cooler now. Because it was of an earlier pattern, Mr. Wakefield's machine was not as speedy as any of the boys', and Ned realized he would have to be longer on the journey than if he had his own fast motor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I'm in luck to be able to get any machine at all," he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the first ten miles Ned had no trouble, as he was familiar with the road. He had been riding over an hour when he came to a small village which, he learned by inquiry, was thirty miles from the big city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rode out of the little town, and then, coming to a place where several roads branched off was puzzled which one to take, as there was no sign posts. No house was near and no one seemed to be traveling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll take the middle road," thought Ned. "It's trusting to chance, but it's all I can do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had ridden perhaps four miles when he met a farmer driving a bony horse attached to a dilapidated wagon. Poor, thin and old as the horse was it seemed frightened at the sight of the machine, and inclined to rear on its hind legs and bolt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this the road to Boston?" asked Ned, knowing he had little time to waste in talk, however pleasant it might be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wa'al ye kin git to it this way, but it'll take ye a long time. Ye're going in a opposite direction. Ye'd oughter taken the left hand road back there at the forks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks," said Ned, briefly, turning his machine in readiness to go back and take the right road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on! Maybe I can make some kind of a trade with ye for that threshing machine ye got!" called the old man, but Ned, with a friendly wave of his hand, started back to regain the right road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He resolved to be more careful next time in taking roads where there was more than one. So, when he again reached places where the highways diverged he waited until some one came along, or he went back to the last house he had passed, and inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rode on for two hours longer. It was getting a little dusky now because of the clouds, and Ned began to fear he was in for a storm. He wished he was at his destination, for, if worst came to worst, he could stay in Boston all night, and start back in the morning. But he soon saw evidences that he was nearing some large city. Houses became more frequent, and every now and then he would pass through some settlement or good sized suburb. Then, off in the distance, he descried the Hub City.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's Boston!" he cried. "Now for an automobile or motor store."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Getting on to good roads he speeded his machine up as fast as it would go, which was not overly rapid, and was soon riding through the streets of the historic city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He kept his eyes open, and presently saw an automobile shop. The man was just closing up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute!" called Ned. "Hold on! I want to get something!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to be quick," said the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned lost no time in telling what he desired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's what you want," said the dealer. "We got some new ones in to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks," said Ned fervently, as he paid for the articles. He stowed the precious parts safely away in his pockets. Then he began to think of supper. It was nearly ten o'clock, but he found a small restaurant open, and made a hasty meal. Then, lighting his own acetylene gas lamp, which he had brought along in place of the oil affair Mr. Wakefield carried, the boy prepared for his homeward trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was a very different thing from riding along in the afternoon and early evening. If he was in doubt of a road he could find plenty of persons to ask. But after dark every one seemed to go to bed, as he noticed when he passed from the immediate Boston suburbs into the country. Several times Ned had to get off his machine and, with his lamp for a torch, hunt around for a sign post to tell him which road to take.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once he came to where three roads divided. He could find no friendly pointing finger to tell him which one to take, and there was not a house in sight. The last residence he had passed was half a mile back. He did not relish going on the wrong highway until he met some one to set him right, nor did he want to retrace his journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If only some one would come along now," he murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By dint of making inquiries at many farm houses Ned managed to cover about twenty miles of his homeward trip. Then, as it grew later, the friendly lights that shone from the lonely roadside residences went out, and Ned began to think his trip was going to be a rather unpleasant one at the close, although it was still fairly clear. He did not like to awaken people up to ask them about the road, and it was evident that nearly every one in the country had gone to rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was very dark. His gas lamp gave a brilliant thread of light directly in front of him, but that was all. It was quiet, also, save for the chug-chug of his motor. Now and then an owl would hoot, and the sound, strange and weird, seemed to chill Ned's blood, though he knew what it was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once again the old trouble of coming to two roads, and not knowing which to follow, confronted him. It was close to midnight, and the country was so deserted that for the last two miles he had not passed a house. Nor did he know how far in advance he might have to go before reaching one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I go to the right or left?" Ned asked himself. "I'll trust to luck, I'll toss a stone up, and take the road it falls nearest to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had dismounted from his wheel, and standing at the fork of the roads, tossed a pebble into the air. It fell on the left path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The left it is!" He got on his machine, rode about a quarter of a mile, and then, with a loud noise his rear tire burst. It came with such suddenness and gave Ned such a shock that he nearly tumbled from the motor. "Here's luck!" he exclaimed. He quickly discovered that the break was a bad enough one to mend in daylight to say nothing of attempting it in the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess I'm booked to stay here all night," the boy said. "If I could find a farm house near by I'd ask to stay there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But he did not feel like pushing the heavy motor along the road in a search.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's warm, and I can stay out all night," Ned thought. "I'd like to get in shelter though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused in the middle of the dark road and looked about him. Off to the left were fields.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Looks like a lot of hay in that meadow," he told himself. "If it is that will be just the thing to crawl into and go to sleep." He walked closer and peered at the dark objects that had attracted his attention. He climbed the fence, and discovered that his surmise was right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pulling and hauling the motor he got it through the bars. Then, selecting a big mound of the fragrant dried grass, Ned made a hole in it, crawled in, curled up and, in spite of his queer bed, was soon sound asleep.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV GETTING BACK HOME</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun was shining in through the chinks of the mound of hay the next morning when Ned awoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! Why! Where in the world am I?" he exclaimed. He had slept so hard, because of the fatigue of his ride, that he could not remember where he was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh I know now," he said, at length, as the recollection of his experience came to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stretched, rolled out of his fragrant bed and, brushing the wisps of hay from his hair, stepped out into the glow of the sun. His first care was to feel in his pocket to see if the carburetor parts, that had cost him all his trouble, were safe. They were all right, and then Ned began to think of breakfast and getting home. He feared his parents would be worried over his absence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Doesn't seem to be a very thickly settled locality around here," observed Ned, taking a survey and seeing nothing but fields and woods in the distance. "I guess I'm in for a long walk for breakfast. And I've got to push that motor. I can't fix the tire with what tools I have along. Well, there's no help for it, and I suppose it will give me a good appetite."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found Mr. Wakefield's motor where it had been left, covered with hay to keep off the dew. Ned rolled it out into the road and then, hearing the musical tinkle of a brook near by, he bethought that a wash and a drink of cool water would not come amiss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found a clear sparkling little meadow stream. It raced and bubbled its way over the white pebbles, and between banks of green grass and moss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That looks good," thought Ned, as he stretched out at full length on his face and took a long drink. Then he found a shallow little basin, scooped out of a stone where the water formed a pool, and there he washed and felt much refreshed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm still in the dark as to whether I'm on the right road or not," thought Ned. "But it's daylight now, and I might as well keep going this way until I meet some one to inquire of."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he started off. He was hungry and wished very much for something to eat. It was no fun pushing the heavy motor cycle along the dusty road, but Ned dared not leave it behind on the highway for fear something might happen to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had gone about a mile, perhaps, when down the road he saw a farm wagon, to which was hitched a team of horses, approaching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here comes some one at last," Ned thought. "and I may get a lift."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello bub!" exclaimed the driver of the horses, a jolly-looking blue-eyed farmer, when the wagon came opposite Ned. "Had a smash up?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, only a tire broken," replied the boy. "But can you tell me whether this is the way to Cresville?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you could get there on this road, but it's about five miles out of your way. Is that where you want to go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's where I live," Ned answered. "I went to Boston yesterday, and on my way back last night I lost my way, my machine broke, and I had to sleep in a hay stack."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see you did," observed the farmer. "Some of the grass is in your hair yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned hastily removed the traces of his recent bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if you're going to Cresville," went on the man. "I can give you a lift. I'm going within three miles of there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd be much obliged if you would," spoke Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, pile your machine in back there, and climb up on the seat," was the invitation, and Ned did so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't happen to know of any restaurants around here, do you?" he asked the driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, nothing open on Sunday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure enough, it is Sunday!" cried Ned. "I'm so upset I'd about forgotten it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sleeping in the hay instead of your bed sort of put you off the track," suggested the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what it did," agreed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a beautiful morning and Ned thoroughly enjoyed it as he rode along. Even the rough jolting of the farm wagon was not unpleasant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't usually travel in this kind of a rig on Sundays," explained the farmer. "But I have to go over to Doddtown for some grain for the horses, and I had to take this cart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you did," said Ned. "If you had been in a carriage I couldn't have brought the motor cycle with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No more you could," spoke the farmer. "Everything happens for the best after all. But here you are. This is as far as I go on your way. If you take that road," pointing to where one branched off from the highway the wagon was on. "you'll come to Cresville. Sorry I can't take you all the way, but it's only three miles."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm much obliged to you for the lift," said Ned, getting the machine out of the wagon and bidding his new acquaintance good-bye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving the motor cycle at a house on the outskirts of town, Ned reached home about noon, and found his parents much alarmed. Jerry and Bob were at his house, and there was talk of organizing a searching party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you bring the carburetor parts?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did!" exclaimed Ned, as he passed them over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're all right," announced Jerry, after an inspection. "From now on we must take care not to leave our machines out of our sight. But what did you do with Mr. Wakefield's motor?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned told where it was. Then he had a bath and got ready for dinner. After the meal, which his chums ate with him, Ned went and told Mr. Walkefield what had happened to the motor. The latter was not alarmed for the safety of his machine, and it was arranged that one of the employees of the club would drive over for it on Monday. The rest of the day the boys spent quietly, anxiously waiting for the morrow when they might again try their motors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bright and early on Monday each boy was fitting the new carburetor parts to his cycle. The apparatus fitted perfectly and soon all three were spinning down the road at a good speed. They rode for several miles and were about to turn back on Jerry's proposal to go to the athletic track when they heard the noise of an approaching motor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next instant a machine turned the corner of the road, and came toward them. All three of the chums started as they saw that the rider was Jack Pender. Hardly knowing what they were doing, Ned, Bob and Jerry spread themselves out across the highway so that Pender could not pass. On his part he was so surprised that he shut off the power of his machine and came to a stop, just as the three chums, who had done like wise, dismounted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," observed Jerry quietly. "I've been wanting to meet you, Jack."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare to touch me!" exclaimed Jack. "If you do, I'll have you arrested."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a nice one to talk about having people arrested," went on Jerry. "I've a good mind to shake you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did I do?"asked Jack, looking uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know well enough what you did. Tried to fix our machines so they wouldn't work by taking off the carburetors. That's what you did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean to," said Jack. "I was just—just turning them and they came off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd ought to be made to pay for the damage you did," put in Ned. "I had to go all the way to Boston for new parts."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't any money," whined Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have enough to lend to Noddy Nixon," put in Bob, remembering that day when they had met Noddy at the soda-water booth, and the bully had boasted that Jack loaned him money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never lent Noddy any money!" exclaimed Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said you did!" exclaimed Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well he tells—what business is it of yours any how!" Jack interrupted a statement he was going to make. "I don't have to tell you anything about my affairs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No one asked you to," Ned put in. All we want is for you to let us and our machines alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think a good thrashing is what he needs," said Jerry, with mock severity, standing his machine against Ned's and advancing toward Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh no! Please don't!" begged the young coward. "I'll never do anything again. Please don't lick me! Noddy Nixon made me do it! Don't touch me, and I'll tell you everything!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Everything about what?" asked Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About—about the—the mill robbery!" exclaimed Jack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you know of it?" asked Ned in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know very much, but you watch Noddy Nixon about six o'clock to-night," replied Jack. "There," he burst out. "I promised I wouldn't tell, but he's always getting me in trouble and never helping me out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, before the boys could stop him, Jack Pender turned his machine in the opposite direction, leaped into the saddle and was soon moving off swiftly down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall we chase him?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, let him go," replied Jerry. "We gave him a good scare, and, besides, we want to be on hand for something else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We want to watch Noddy to-night."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV NODDY'S QUEER ACTIONS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a few moments after Jerry had spoken neither Ned nor Bob knew what to say. Events had happened so rapidly, and they seemed on the verge of such a discovery, that they were startled. Jerry alone kept cool.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think Noddy will do?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might make a dozen guesses and not hit it," Jerry replied. "We can only wait and watch."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall we do it together?" inquired Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hardly that," spoke Jerry. "If he saw three of us on his trail he would probably suspect something. I have a plan."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know there are only three ways Noddy can take after he leaves his house," said Jerry. "He can go up town, down town or he can take the road that leads out to the old wind mill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," came from Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now my idea is that we all three ought to keep watch," went on Jerry. "If he goes up town Ned can follow him. If he goes down town Bob can take up the trail and if he goes out to the old mill I will go after him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," Jerry said. "That settles it. Now for home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little talk was indulged in. Each of the three chums felt that something of importance was to happen and their thoughts were too busy for conversation. In due time the boys separated, had their dinners and suppers, and shortly before six o'clock met by appointment in the post office, which was a block from Noddy's residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now remember," said Jerry. "If he goes up town you are to follow, Ned. Bob, it's your turn if he goes down, and if he takes the road to the old mill I'll follow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had long waits, for it was nearly nine o'clock before Noddy crept quietly from the rear door in the darkness of the night. He did not know that three pairs of sharp eyes watched his every movement. Peering on every side of him the bully quickly made his way to the street. Then, after a moment's hesitation he started rapidly off in the direction of the old mill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here goes!" said Jerry, who was on the lookout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like a shadow he glided from his hiding place and was after Noddy. He kept a sufficient distance in the rear so that he would not betray himself by the sound of his footsteps. It was quite dark, for there was no moon, but the stars were bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder what he wants out here?" thought Jerry. "Is he going to meet some one?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his surprise he saw Noddy, having halted in front of the deserted mill, enter the dark and uninviting place without hesitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ugh! I wouldn't care to go in there alone," thought Jerry. "It looks spooky!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dared go no closer than the dilapidated fence that surrounded the structure. Crouching there in the shadow, he looked toward the mill, to discern what went on. No one seemed to be waiting for Noddy, nor did the bully show by his actions that he expected any one. Shortly after he had entered the place Noddy struck a light, as Jerry could see. It flickered and moved about some, but seemed to be kept in one room. Then, in a few minutes, the light went out, and Jerry heard footsteps approaching down the gravel walk that led to the main entrance of the mill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He either went there to get something or hide something," Jerry reasoned. "If it was to hide something I may discover what it was. If it was to take something I have very little chance of success."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still hiding in the shadow of the fence Jerry waited until Noddy had passed some distance down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't fancy going into that place very much," observed the boy, "but it's got to be done."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Considerably against his inclinations, Jerry took the dark path leading to the old mill. He started at every sound, and when an Owl hooted in a nearby tree the boy jumped as if some one had yelled at him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With beating heart he made his way into the deserted place. It was as dark as a pocket and the boy struck a light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I only had a candle," he wished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardly had he formed the thought when, glancing down, he saw a short wax end on the floor. He picked it up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is the light Noddy had," reflected Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lighted the wick, and the illumination somewhat dispelled the gloom. With eager eyes he scanned the place. Moving about he held the candle up where it would give a good light. But nothing rewarded his search. From side to side he went. Then he held the light close to the floor. He had gone over almost every foot of surface and found nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess it's a wild-goose chase," thought Jerry. "But I'm sure Noddy did not go out of this room. I watched the light. Hello! What's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had suddenly struck his foot against a board that projected somewhat above the others in the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Queer I didn't notice that before," said Jerry. He lowered the candle carefully. "Looks as if it had been moved lately," he went on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thrusting his fingers beneath the edge of the board Jerry gave a strong pull. The plank did not budge. He tried again without success. At the third attempt, however, his strength availed, and he felt the piece of flooring suddenly yield. So quickly did it come from its place in fact that Jerry fell backward, knocking out his candle and leaving himself in utter darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quickly searching in his pocket the boy found his matches, struck a light and ignited the candle end. Then, with swiftly beating heart he peered down into the hole he had disclosed. He was rewarded by seeing a small wooden box, half covered with dirt and rubbish. With trembling fingers Jerry drew it forth and held it close to the light. It was a square wooden receptacle with a hinged cover.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the box that was stolen from the mill with the thousand dollars in it!" exclaimed Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He raised the cover. If he had had any doubts about his find they were dispelled when he saw the contents of the box. It was half tilled with papers, seemingly of no value, but bearing the name of Amos Judson. There were receipts, notes, bills and memoranda. But there was no trace of the money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll take this away," said the boy. "and have a talk with Ned and Bob about it. I think—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There came a sudden sound that startled the lad. It was as if some one had stepped on the platform outside of the mill. Jerry quickly blew out his candle. Then, as he heard an owl hoot, he knew it was the bird that had made the noise, and breathed easier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not stopping to relight the candle, but replacing, as best he could in the darkness the plank, so the hole would not be noticed on a casual inspection, Jerry hurried from the mill and made a quick trip to Ned's house. He felt that matters were now at a crisis.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI NODDY NIXON CORNERED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As late as it was Jerry found his two chums anxiously waiting for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is something," replied Jerry, showing the box which he had concealed under his coat. He told how he had found it and the three chums examined the contents curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What had we better do?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you what I think," spoke Ned. "We ought to tell father. He will know what to do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Slade was plainly surprised at some of the disclosures made, for, though he knew most of the circumstances, he was not acquainted with all of them. The boys had forgotten many details in their previous recitals, and, of course, the finding of the box was the latest occurrence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must say you boys have sifted this thing out pretty well," said Mr. Slade. "You have great deal more information than have the police."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What had we better do about it?" asked Jerry. "You see we are at a sort of stand still now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Slade thought for a few minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here is what I would do," he said at length. "I would contrive to have a talk with Noddy Nixon, all three of you. I understand he is a sort of bully, but if the three of you are together there is nothing to fear from him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once you get him alone somewhere you can tell him just what you know, and show him how everything points to him as the person who robbed the mill. It may be that the information will overwhelm him, and he will own to everything. Again, he may be innocent of everything, and able to explain all of his acts satisfactorily. In that case you will be glad that you made no public complaint."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a little thought the boys voted this was the best thing to do. They arranged to send Noddy a note asking him to meet one of them in a secluded place the next day, and all three chums promised to be on hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early the next day the three boys met again. In accordance with the arrangement of the night before, Jerry had sent a note to Noddy, asking the bully to meet him near the old wind mill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, for the matter is of great interest to you," the note had said, and Jerry had signed no name. Ten o'clock was the hour set, and quite a while before that time the three boys were at the dilapidated structure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think you two had better stay inside," said Jerry to Bob and Ned. "But remain where you can see and hear everything. I'll be out here when Noddy comes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a few minutes after ten when Jerry saw Noddy coming up the path that led to the main mill entrance. No sooner had the bully caught sight of Jerry than he started, and seemed about to turn back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't go!" called Jerry. "Did you get my note?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you write that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I certainly did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's it all about?" growled Noddy. "If you're fooling me you'll wish you hadn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you won't think it's much like fooling," replied Jerry. "In the first place, have you ever seen this before?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He suddenly held out the wooden box he had found hidden in the mill. At the sight of it Noddy started.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where—where did you get it?" Noddy, gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right here, in this mill," was the answer. "I took it out of a hole in the floor last night, right after you had been here. It has some papers in it from the Judson mill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy started again. His face was pale, and he trembled. His hands twitched nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What—what else?" he whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You might as well tell everything," said Jerry. "Ned saw you coming from the mill on the night of the robbery with this box under your arm. You said it had fish bait in it. We know how thick you were with Bill Berry, and how he tried to have the blame cast on Ned. And we know something else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That you paid a bet to Paul Banner shortly after the robbery."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Supposing I did?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just this, we have—or, rather I have—one of the bills you gave to Paul."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what of that?" asked Noddy, trying to maintain a brave air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only this. It was a ten dollar bill, issued by a state instead of a national bank, and it had the initials H. R. C. on it in red ink. We have learned that this bill was paid to Mr. Judson on the afternoon before the robbery, that it was placed in the box—this box—that was stolen from the safe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Supposing some one gave that bill to me be fore I gave it to Paul?" asked Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you can prove that it will be a good thing for you," Jerry went on. "We have no desire, Noddy, to fasten this on you, but Ned must be cleared and the robbery mystery ended. Tell me—who gave you the queer bank bill?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Noddy kept silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On the night of the mill fire," Jerry went on, "we found the hammer and chisel that were used to cut the safe open, and also the dark lantern. If anything more is needed, Bill Berry will—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Bill Berry tells that he saw me in the mill—!" cried Noddy, and then he stopped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We may need Bill's testimony," Jerry said. "You see we have nearly everything, Noddy. What have you to say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy said nothing for a few minutes. He seemed ill at ease. Then he burst out:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I may as well confess! You cubs have spied on me to good advantage. I had to take that money! I needed it to pay my debts. I heard Tom Judson say it was in the safe that afternoon. I knew the old iron box was easy to crack. I had no trouble to get in, and I began work. When I was almost through I looked up, and saw Bill Berry looking in at me. I offered to go shares with him if he would keep quiet, and he did. Then, after a while he said another man, a chum of his, had seen me also, and I had to give him money. He would have shot me if I hadn't. It was one night in a lonely house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry nodded. He well remembered that night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then," went on Noddy. "Bill suggested throwing the blame on Ned, because he was around the mill that night. It didn't work, however. Now, I guess the game is up. What are you going to do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll have to consider," Jerry replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We? Who is we?" asked Noddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bob, Ned, and myself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are they here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They heard it all. We needed several witnesses," was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give me one day more," pleaded the bully. "I may be able to pay the money back then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll see what the others say," replied Jerry. "Come out, Ned and Bob."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys came from their place of concealment. Noddy did not appear to notice them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You heard what he said," spoke Jerry. "What do you say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One day more will do no harm," said Bob, who felt a little compassion for Noddy, unfriendly as the bully had always been.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Jerry, and Ned nodded in assent to the stout boy's proposal. "We will say nothing for another twenty-four hours, Noddy. Meet us here at this time to-morrow and we will decide what is to be done."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will," replied Noddy as he hurried away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm glad that's over," remarked Jerry. "I hated to do it, but I felt it ought to be done. Now to go and tell Mr. Slade that Noddy has confessed, and see what's to be done to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII NODDY NIXON'S MOVE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mr. Slade had been informed of the outcome of the interview with Noddy, he said the boys had acted with caution and wisely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We will see if Noddy intends to settle and pay back the money," said Ned's father. "If he does not it is only right that his father should be informed, also the sheriff and Mr. Judson."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nothing to do but to wait until the next day. The three chums spent some time in wondering what Noddy would do. Then Ned exclaimed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, we're forgetting all about the race. Here it is Tuesday. The day after to-morrow we'll have to make a try for that touring car, and we ought to be practicing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and our wheels need overhauling," suggested Jerry. "I'm going to put in new batteries. Don't want to run any risk of the motor missing explosions when we're on the track, you know." This was voted a wise precaution, and the motor boys separated, to go home after their cycles, agreeing to meet in the afternoon on the track for practice runs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through a good part of the afternoon they went around and around at moderate speed, testing their motors thoroughly and practicing the turns. Others were doing the same, and no especial attention was drawn to our three heroes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Along about five o'clock, most of the other prospective contestants having gone off, Jerry suggested it would be a good time to give the three motors a friendly trial. Accordingly a flying start was made from the judges' stand, and each of the three boys soon had his cycle going at almost top speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first there seemed to be little to choose from among them. They hung well together at the start, and then Ned began to forge ahead a little. He had acquired more momentum than the others, perhaps, or the difference that exists in two motors made exactly the same, gave his wheel one or two more revolutions a minute than Jerry's or Bob's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you on full speed?" asked Jerry at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," replied Ned and Bod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Turn on all the power you can," was the suggestion. "Let's see what we really can do on the track."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The muffled explosions at once became more rapid. The wheels whizzed around the track faster and faster, and Jerry and Bob began to creep up on Ned, who was leading. Then they passed him, and he was half a length behind. Again Jerry forged in front of Bob, and it seemed that the prize motor was going to prove the fastest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But a careful eye could see that Bob was beginning to regain his lost ground. The distance between his wheel and Jerry's lessened until, after two more rounds Jerry and the stout youth were riding exactly on a line. Ned was perhaps a length behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess this will do," called Jerry. "Shut down!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly the motors ceased their rapid explosions, and after another turn of the track the three boys came to a halt and dismounted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're pretty evenly matched," said Ned. "My machine didn't do as well as I expected though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They separated, arranging to be on hand at the old mill at ten o'clock the following morning, to clear up the last of the mill robbery mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jerry, I wish you would take this message over to Mrs. Northrup's for me," said Mrs. Hopkins to her son, after supper that evening. "I want her to come and do some sewing for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, mother," responded the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going on your machine?" asked his sister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sis. I don't want to run any chance of puncturing a tire after dark. It's too near the race for that. I'm going to walk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Off Jerry started. Mrs. Northrup lived in a cottage about a mile from Mrs. Hopkins. She was a widow who went out dressmaking. To get to her house Jerry had to pass the handsome residence of Mr. Nixon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked at it as he went by on his way to deliver the message. There seemed to be no one about, and Jerry wondered if Noddy was at home, and what he was doing. Mrs. Northrup was in, and, as she wanted to write a reply to the note Jerry had brought, he had to wait a few minutes. Then the widow asked him all about himself and his family, and inquired about the coming race, which she had heard Jerry was interested in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So, though the boy had meant to stay but a short time, he was there the better part of an hour, and, when he had the answer to his mother's note and was on his way back, it was nine o'clock and quite dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Jerry came in front of the Nixon residence he was surprised to see no lights in the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's queer," he said to himself. "The place is usually well lighted, for they always have company there. I guess Mr. and Mrs. Nixon must be away from home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was about to pass on when he noticed a faint glimmer of light near the automobile shed, Mr. Nixon having recently purchased a big touring car.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather dangerous to go out there with a lantern," Jerry thought, "especially if they have oil and gasolene stored there. I wonder if Noddy is there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a side street, rather narrow and seldom used, which extended along the Nixon property to the left. It passed close to the automobile shed, and a drive-way had been constructed to enable the machine to be taken out into the side road way if desired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having nothing particular to hurry him, and being of a curious turn of mind, Jerry decided that he would walk down the narrow thoroughfare and look at the new automobile shed, which he had not seen at close range. Accordingly he turned from the main street and soon found himself opposite the shed. He stopped to look at it, and, as he did so, he heard voices in conversation. At the same time the flicker of a light through a crack in the shed door could be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if it's thieves trying to steal the machine," thought Jerry. "Guess I'll watch little while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took a position behind a tree where he could see what went on without being observed. The voices in the shed grew louder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tell you I will take it!" some one exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's Noddy," said Jerry softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know what I'm doing," Noddy went on, seemingly in answer to an objection from some one whose words Jerry could not distinguish. "You can come along if you want to, or stay behind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry shrank closer behind the tree. There was a glare of light as the shed door was opened, and in the beams the boy could distinguish the form of Bill Berry. That he and Noddy were planning some new escapade was evident.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it all right?" asked Noddy, sticking his head out of the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on then," went on the bully. "Put out the light. We've got to escape in the darkness. It's a good thing the folks are away to-night. Well, here is where we leave Cresville behind, and those three cubs that got me into this trouble!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry heard the sound of the motor car being cranked up. Then, as he waited in the darkness, he saw the big touring machine glide out of the shed under Noddy's guidance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jump in, Bill!" called the youth, and Berry did as requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Noddy threw in the gear clutch, and the machine rolled slowly down the inclined drive-way to the street, right opposite Jerry, who still crouched behind the tree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's running away in his father's automobile!" Jerry exclaimed softly. "I wonder if I ought to give an alarm?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The motor car was now turning out into the main thoroughfare. It bore no lights and made scarcely any noise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," thought Jerry. "Let him go. It may be better that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so Noddy, afraid to face the consequences of his confessed crime, fled from his home. Pondering over what would be the outcome on the morrow, Jerry went home and to bed, resolving to get up early and tell his chums what he had seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's running away in his father's automobile!" Jerry exclaimed, softly.— Page 222. Image of Jerry, standing behind a tree and watching Noddy drive away in his father's car.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII THE GREAT RACE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you heard the news—great excitement—big robbery—Mr. Nixon's automobile stolen—Noddy kidnapped—terrible—awful—whoop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andy Rush let out the above avalanche of words as he met Ned the next morning, as the merchant's son was on his way to see Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's all that, Andy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Last night! Somebody kidnapped the auto and rode off in Noddy—fearful—terrible—I mean some one kidnapped Noddy and rode off in the auto! I'm all excited!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can see that without being told," remarked Ned. "But can't you calm down a bit and explain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Andy tried but it was hard work. Ned gathered that something out of the ordinary had happened. As soon as he could leave Andy he hurried to Jerry's house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you heard the news?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About Noddy and the auto?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was there when it happened."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't mean it! Tell me all about it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thereupon Jerry did. He had no sooner finished than Bob appeared and wanted the particulars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you told any one about this?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only you two."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we'd better go and tell father. He expects us to meet Noddy again at ten o'clock to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three chums called on Mr. Slade. He was greatly surprised at what Jerry had to tell, and he agreed that no especial good would have come from Jerry having given an alarm at the time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must see Mr. Nixon and explain the situation to him," said Mr. Slade. "The sheriff had better be told also. You boys might as well come along, to give certain details."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a little while the three boys, with Mr. Slade were in the drawing room of the Nixon home. Mr. Nixon, looking worn and pale, greeted them. Mr. Slade went over the whole story, occasionally calling on one or the other of the boys as to certain facts. He told the circumstances from the time Ned saw the light in the mill until the happenings of the previous night, when Jerry saw Noddy run away in an automobile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am deeply grieved at my son's conduct," said Mr. Nixon, "It is a bitter blow to me. I thank you Mr. Slade, and you boys also, for being so considerate as not to publish the story broadcast. I have shame enough without that.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall pay back the thousand dollars Noddy took. I will ask you, Mr. Slade to be a witness to that transaction. As far as the automobile is concerned, that was my property, and, in order to save my son from being branded as a double thief, I here and now make him a present of the machine. So he is in something that belongs to him. I only hope he comes back, for I love him in spite of his faults.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I agree with you, Mr. Slade, that the sheriff must be informed. It is only due Ned, to clear him of all suspicion, though any one who knew him would be sure he was never guilty. That is all that can be done, I believe. When I pay Mr. Hudson the money he has lost he will have no reason for proceeding against my son. This ends the mill robbery mystery forever I hope. Once again I thank you all for your consideration."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Slade quietly motioned for the boys to withdraw and Mr. Nixon was left alone in his grief and sorrow. That afternoon Mr. Slade accompanied Noddy's father to Mr. Judson and the stolen money was repaid. The mill owner agreed to begin no legal proceedings against the misguided young man. Nor was there any charge against Bill Berry, though Mr. Nixon said he wished Noddy was out of the bad man's influence. When the sheriff was told of the circumstances and informed that the case had been settled he announced that he was satisfied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I always did like the looks of you, Ned," he remarked, "and I was sorry to arrest you, but duty is duty, you know, as the elephant said when he squirted water in the face of the man who stuck a pin in him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys did not quite see the connection, but decided to let it go at that. The sheriff, who had called on Mr. Slade, at the latter's request, went off, and said the case was ended as far as he was concerned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And now to get ready for the race to-morrow!" cried Jerry. "Everything is straightened out, and we only have to think of winning. Hurrah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each one was up bright and early the next morning, though the races did not start until two o'clock in the afternoon. It was a beautiful September day, just cool enough to take the temper from a warm sun, and with only a light breeze blowing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somehow the morning passed. The boys made one trip to the grounds without their machines, and found men busy raising the banks at the turns of the course, so that there would be less danger to the riders. The turns were banked with wood, although the track itself was a hard dirt one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though it seemed hours and hours until the hands of the clock approached The "two" mark, they did eventually. Shortly before one o'clock, however, the boys were at the track. Old Pete Bumps was there ahead of them, having been sent over by Mr. Baker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here we all be, happy and free," said Pete, as he greeted the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, just stay near the machines," said Bob. "And mind, don't go away from them, no matter if some one offers you a pipe, cigars, tobacco and matches."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That I will not, I will stay on the spot," said Pete, gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My, what a crowd!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And indeed there was a big gathering. The grand stand was almost filled, and the bleachers completely, while hundreds stood up all the way around the oval track. There were many ladies and gentlemen, club members and citizens of Cresville, besides any number of boys and girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Cresville Athletic Club was a well known one, and the big prizes offered for the motor-cycle race had attracted riders from all over the state. There were thirty starters, and, as the track was not wide enough for them all to line up at once it had been decided to get them away in three batches of ten each, the second squad to start off after the first finished, and the third after the second.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys made quick work of getting into their racing togs. Then, with fifteen minutes to spare before the five minute warning gun would send all practicers from the course, they went out on the track. They found their machines were working to perfection, and each one, in his secret heart, hoped he would win the coveted first prize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed no more than a few minutes before a gun went off, and a man with a megaphone began shouting to have the track cleared. People scurried for their seats, and there was a tense feeling in the air, that always preceeds a test of strength and endurance. Riders hurried from the course to give a last drop of oil to their machines. Late coming contestants were busy pinning their numbers on their shirts, and, altogether there was a scene of confusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though it was the largest race the three chums had ever been in, they kept cool. They had all their arrangements made, and soon, with all the other riders they were called to the judges' stand. They were briefly told of the rules, and then lots were drawn to determine in what squad the riders were to start off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned, Bob and Jerry each drew different numbers. Ned was to start off with the first batch, Jerry with the second, and Bob with the third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this way it would not be known until the very last squad had finished who had won, and thus interest would be maintained until the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bang!" another shot was fired. It indicated that the races would start in two minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go in and win, Ned," advised Jerry as he and Bob left their chum with the riders of the first batch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same to you!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Line up!" called the starter, and the ten riders mounted their machines, which were held for them by men engaged for the purpose by the club. There was a moment of suspense!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go!" shouted the starter, at the same time firing his revolver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The riders, shoved off by those who held the machines, pedaled furiously, and then, having sufficient momentum, started the motors. It sounded as if a battery of gatling guns had gone into action, for most of the contestants, in an endeavor to lighten their cycles, had taken off the mufflers, and the wild cheer that was given by the spectators as the batch started off was drowned to the contestants by reason of the gas explosions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned handled his machine well, and secured a good place, about third from the front. He quickly had his motor going at full speed, and he was delighted to see that he was increasing his lead over the man behind him. He was slowly creeping up on the man ahead of him, when the latter looked back. Then he turned on a little more power, and slowly drew away from Ned. The boy knew, then, that there was at least one machine faster than his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Around and around the track the riders went. They took the turns at dangerous speed, and one man had a spill that put him out of the contest. Another burst a tire and had to withdraw. Ned managed to pass one of the men in front of him, but by that time some one had come up from the rear, and he still found himself third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly, as he passed the judges' stand, he heard a revolver shot, and saw a red flag waved. It indicated that there were two laps more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the eight riders swept like the wind, and, a quarter of a mile from the finish, one of the riders in front of Ned began to slacken speed. His batteries had failed at the last moment, and Ned rushed past him, a good second in the first squad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fine!" exclaimed Jerry as he and Bob rushed up to congratulate him. "I only hope I do as well!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to see you do better," said Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little time was lost in getting the second detachment off. Again the explosions sounded and the air was rent with cheers. Jerry had secured a good start, but he had not made more than two laps before he was aware that a plan to get him into a pocket was being made. He tried to avoid it but he was pitted against racers of skill, most of them grown men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once inside the fatal "V" shaped formation of riders Jerry gave the race up for lost. His machine was going almost at top speed. He managed to get directly behind the fourth man in the left leg of the "V," and hung there, hoping some chance might offer. He knew he could make a good record if he was allowed to escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, when there was but a mile of the race left there came a chance. The man behind whom he was riding burst a tire. He fell from his machine and there would have been a serious smash-up had not Jerry quickly and skillfully turned aside, shot through the gap made by the missing fourth rider, and, swinging away from the pole a bit, taken his place second from the leader. Jerry threw his motor on to full speed. The man in the lead had his there already.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jerry was hopeful. There was one lap more and his machine was working like a charm. He was but ten feet behind the leader, whose cycle was working to the limit, and Jerry saw that he was slowly but surely forging ahead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then one of those things happened that come so unexpectedly and so inexplainably to gasolene motors. Jerry's suddenly refused to work. The explosions ceased. He worked the pedals frantically, but it was of no use. The batch of riders swept past him, and he saw with regret and chagrin that he was distanced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There goes my chance!" he said sorrowfully as he dismounted and pushed his machine from the track. "All our hope is in Bob now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner was the second squad of riders out of the way than the third batch came hurrying on the track. They were lined up, the pistol cracked, and away they went. Ned and Jerry, who had found a good place to watch, strained their eyes for a sight of Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's close to the front!" cried Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, he's away to the rear," said Jerry, and so it proved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By some mischance Bob was third from the rear as the riders swept around on the first lap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He doesn't look discouraged," said Jerry. "Maybe he is running his motor slow, and trying to keep out of a pocket."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so," grunted Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the exception of two riders well to the fore, and Bob and two others in the rear, the contestants were pretty well bunched. For several laps no one gained an advantage. One man tried to steal up, but he was promptly pocketed and lost whatever chance he had.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why doesn't Bob do something? There are only two miles more!" groaned Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Watch him!" cried Jerry suddenly. "I believe he's been hanging back on purpose, so as not to get in a pocket."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned gazed with straining eyes. Certainly Bob seemed to be increasing his speed. He was sixth from the last. Another lap was reeled off. Bob crept up two more places.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bang!" went the gun. The red flag was waved. There were two more laps and the race would be over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's got to do something quick now!" exclaimed Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'll bet he's going to do it!" exclaimed Ned as Bob swept past, a look of determination on his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, while the big crowd looked on, almost holding its breath, something happened. Bob turned the levers of his machine with a quick motion. He shot forward on his machine as an arrow leaves a bow. Outside and around the bunch of riders he swept! Past the two confident leaders he went! Up ahead to the very front he forged while a mighty shout went up!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he can only keep it!" cried Ned, and his voice had something of agony in it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And keep it Bob did. He held his place the rest of that lap and during the next, though he was close pressed, and swept across the line a winner!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wins this heat! I wonder if he wins the race?" cried Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their doubts were set at rest a minute later. The announcer, with his big megaphone invited silence with uplifted hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Race won by Robert Baker!" he shouted. "Second was Timothy Wilson, and third William Jones. Time of the winner—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the crowd never stopped to hear what the official time was. With wild shouts, with the tossing of hats and canes in the air, they cheered again and again for Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's won the race! He's won the race!" cried Ned jumping about and slapping Jerry on the back. "Now for our touring car!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIX A TRIP OVERLAND PROPOSED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ned and Jerry had a hard time making their way through the throng to where Bob stood. The crowd evinced a desire to catch up the victor and carry him on their shoulders. That a boy of his age should have won a race where many veteran riders contested was no small honor, and the people of Cresville were proud of Bob. Even the girls went wild with delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was just grand!" cried Alice Vines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I felt like jumping up and down when you won," came from Mollie Horton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never saw anything more exciting," put in Helen Gale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And all three of the young ladies looked as if they wanted to hug the winner of the contest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Bob had no desire to be made a hero of, and dodged those who would have done him public honor. He slipped to one side, and managed to join his two chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fine!" cried Jerry. "However did you do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just took it easy until they thought I had no speed in my machine," answered Bob, smiling. "Then, when I saw a chance, I let it out. I'm sorry you and Ned didn't win though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were other races to come, bicycle events, a running contest and a test against time by an automobile, but the boys wanted to get off by them selves and talk matters over, so they went to the dressing rooms, donned their street clothes, and, Jerry's machine having been fixed, all three motors were left in charge of Pete Bumps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys found a quiet corner of the grand stand and sat down to talk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you still think you'll ask for an automobile?" inquired Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. That is if father will let me have one, and I don't see why he will not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you get it we'll have some jolly fun," spoke Jerry. "Think of what we could do with it! Why, we could even make a trip overland!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what we'll do if our folks will let us," agreed Bob. "Think of going across the United States in a touring car!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The athletic contests were soon over. Mr. Wakefield spied Bob in the grand stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to come out of that," he cried with a laugh. "We want you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?" asked the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The winners are to be formally announced in the club house, and their certificates are to be awarded. Come along!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rather against his will, for he did not like to be shown off before a crowd, Bob went. His two chums followed. The main room of the club house was filled with people who had witnessed the races. At the sight of Bob they set up a cheer, and the boy would have escaped had not Mr. Wakefield gently detained him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then came the announcements of the prizes, and the statement that Bob had come in first, and won the grand trophy, which was to be anything he might select at a cost of two thousand dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And here is a certificate to that effect," said Mr. Wakefield, handing him an engraved card. "When you make up your mind what you want, let me know and you shall have it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know about what I want," said Bob, "but I'll have to ask my father first."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bob's father had not had time to go to the races, it being impossible for him to leave the bank, and Bob made up his mind to ride down to the institution and tell the banker the result of the contest. He promised to meet his chums a little later, and let them know how Mr. Baker regarded the automobile project.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, are the races over?" inquired the banker when his son came into the private office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you make out? Come in tenth or last?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't mean to tell me you got first prize! Not the two thousand dollars?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I did, dad," replied Bob, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shake hands!" exclaimed the banker. "I'm proud of you, Bob, my boy! What are you going to take as your prize?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—that is we—er—you see," burst out Bob. "Ned, Jerry and I agreed if either of us won, to ask for a touring automobile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good land, boy! what do you want of that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We thought we'd take a trip across the country."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, well! This does beat all!" exclaimed Mr. Baker. "An automobile! Goodness gracious sakes alive! What a boy you are!" and Mr. Baker sighed and laughed by turns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what did he say?" asked Ned and Jerry, when the stout youth joined them a little later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think he'll let me have it," replied Bob, with all a boy's positiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then hurrah for the trip overland!" cried Ned. "Make way for the Motor Boys in their mad rush across the continent!" How the boys got their coveted auto, and how they went on a long trip, wherein they had many adventures, will be told in the next volume, to be called "The Motor Boys Overland, Or, A Long Trip for Fun and Fortune."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In it Bob, Ned and Jerry will continue their adventures and, also, will be told how they took part in a mad race across the mountains to the gold mines, and how they met their old acquaintance, Noddy Nixon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys got a taste of the pleasures of riding in an automobile that afternoon. After Bob's announcement of what he thought his father's decision would be they strolled about the town. As they were turning a corner they saw a big touring car approaching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it's Mr. Wakefield!" exclaimed Jerry. "I didn't know he had a machine."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish he'd ask us to take a ride," spoke Ned. The car came nearer, vibrating with the power of its motor. Then it slowed down, ran close to the curb and stopped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, boys!" exclaimed Mr. Wakefield. "Want to go for a spin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do we!" exclaimed Ned. "We were just wishing you would ask us. But I didn't know you had an automobile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I only got it to-day," explained the athletic instructor. "I purchased one some time ago, and have been taking lessons in how to run one in Boston. They sent my car out to-day but I didn't get a chance to try it until now because of the club races. Come on! Jump in!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three boys lost no time in complying. Bob got in the front seat with Mr. Wakefield, for he thought if he was to have an auto he had better learn as much about how to run one as he could. Jerry and Ned were in the back. Off they started and made good speed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll go out in the country a way," said Mr. Wakefield. "I know a nice pleasant road."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the car swung into a broad highway shaded by big trees through which the sun, that was beginning to sink into the west, shone faintly. On and on they went for several miles. Then as the evening shadows were beginning to fall, Mr. Wakefield turned his car toward Cresville, which was reached all too soon for the boys, who had enjoyed their ride greatly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks!" they chorused as they alighted. "It was great!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad you liked it," returned Mr. Wakefield. "I will take you again, some time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If we only had a car like that!" sighed Jerry, and Bob and Ned echoed his wish.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXX AN IMPORTANT LETTER.—CONCLUSION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a week after the race before Mr. Baker fully made up his mind to let his son have the automobile. Before announcing his decision he had a talk with Mr. Slade and with Mrs. Hopkins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't so much letting Bob and his chums have the auto," said Mr. Baker, with a smile, "as it is what they will do after they get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so," admitted Mr. Slade. "Still they are ,pretty careful boys, and their experience with the motor cycles has been good training for automobiling for them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Bob was informed of the decision he could scarcely keep from jumping up in the air and giving an Indian war-whoop. He raced off to tell his chums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all right! We get it! Dad just told me! The automobile—touring car—we'll take a lot of trips—start next week—whoop!" Bob shouted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're as bad as Andy Rush!" exclaimed Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I feel like him!" cried Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little time was lost in notifying Mr. Wakefield of the boys' decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you took that," he said. "I know where I can get a fine, strong, serviceable touring car for the amount of the prize."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And will you order it at once?" asked Bob eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the next mail," promised the instructor, with a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three chums strolled down the main street of Cresville, their happiness showing on their faces. They passed the post-office, and Jerry happened to think of a letter his mother had given him to mail. He stepped inside and, after dropping the envelope in the slot, looked in the family box to see if there was any mail. There was one missive, and, when the clerk had handed it out, Jerry saw that it was addressed to himself. It was postmarked New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder who can be writing to me from there," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He tore open the envelope and took out a small folded paper. It bore no date and began abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To Jerry, Ned and Bob: You cubs are responsible for me being an outcast. You drove me away from home, and forced me to come here. I will not forget it, and some day I shall square accounts. Look out for me! It will not be well if we meet. NODDY NIXON."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I like his nerve!" said Jerry, after he had read the letter over a second time. "As if we made him take that money. Look here!" he called to Ned and Bob, showing them the letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were much surprised at the veiled threats contained in the missive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder what he thinks he can do to us?" asked Ned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How does he come to be in New York?" asked Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He probably went there in his father's—I mean in his own—automobile," said Jerry. "That isn't much of a trip for a big car."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I guess we will not let the letter worry us," went on Bob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if when we happen to be touring the west we will meet with Noddy?" said Ned, presently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I wonder if he'd really try to do anything to us," put in Bob.</field>
