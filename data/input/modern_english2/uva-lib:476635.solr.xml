      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I. PHIL HAS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL BRENT was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his step-mother and her son, when a snow-ball, moist and hard, struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis. The pain was considerable, and Phil's anger rose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned suddenly, his eyes flashing fiercely, intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage, for he had no doubt that it was intentional.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked in all directions, but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles, who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him. So he looked farther, but his ears gave him the first clew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He heard a chuckling laugh, which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will see who it is,“ he decided, and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall, in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So it's you, Jonas!“ he shouted wrathfully. ”I thought it was some sneaking fellow like you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas Webb, his step-brother, his freckled face showing a degree of dismay, for he had not calculated on discovery, ran the faster, but while fear winged his steps, anger proved the more effectual spur, and Phil overtook him after a brief run, from the effects of which both boys panted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What made you throw that snow-ball?“ demanded Phil angrily, as he seized Jonas by the collar and shook him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You let me alone!“ said Jonas, struggling ineffectually in his grasp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Answer me! What made you throw that snow-ball?“ demanded Phil, in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Because I chose to,“ answered Jonas, his spite getting the better of his prudence. ”Did it hurt you?“ he continued, his eyes gleaming with malice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should think it might. It was about as hard as a cannon-ball,“ returned Phil grimly. ”Is that all you've got to say about it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I did it in fun,“ said Jonas, beginning to see that he had need to be prudent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well! I don't like your idea of fun. Perhaps you won't like mine,“ said Phil, as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow, and then kneeling by his side, rubbed his face briskly with snow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you doin'? Goin' to murder me?“ shrieked Jonas, in anger and dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to wash your face,“ said Phil, continuing the operation vigorously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I say, you quit that! I'll tell my mother,“ ejaculated Jonas, struggling furiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you do, tell her why I did it,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas shrieked and struggled, but in vain. Phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing, and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There, get up!“ said he at length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas scrambled to his feet, his mean features working convulsively with anger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'll suffer for this!“ he shouted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You won't make me!“ said Phil contemptuously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You're the meanest boy in the village.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'll tell my mother!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Go home and tell her!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas started for home, and Phil did not attempt to stop him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward, he said to himself:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I can't help it. Mrs. Brent always stands up for her precious son, who is as like her as can be. Well, it won't make matters much worse than they have been.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil concluded not to go home at once, but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story. So he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door. He opened the door, brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door, and opening the inner door, stepped into the kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No one was there, as Phil's first glance satisfied him, and he was disposed to hope that Mrs. Brent— he never called her mother—was out, but a thin, acid, measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent, come here!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil entered the sitting-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman, with a sharp visage, cold eyes and firmly compressed lips, to whom no child would voluntarily draw near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On a sofa lay outstretched the hulking form of Jonas, with whom he had had his little difficulty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am here, Mrs. Brent,“ said Philip manfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent,“ said Mrs. Brent acidly, ”are you not ashamed to look me in the face?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know why I should be,“ said Philip, bracing himself up for the attack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You see on the sofa the victim of your brutality,“ continued Mrs. Brent, pointing to the recumbent figure of her son Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas, as if to emphasize these words, uttered a half groan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip could not help smiling, for to him it seemed ridiculous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You laugh,“ said his step-mother sharply. ”I am not surprised at it. You delight in your brutality.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose you mean that I have treated Jonas brutally.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see you confess it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Mrs. Brent, I do not confess it. The brutality you speak of was all on the side of Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt,“ retorted Mrs. Brent, with sarcasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's the case of the wolf and the lamb over again.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think Jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened,“ said Phil. ”Did he tell you that he flung a snow-ball at my head as hard as a lump of ice?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him like a tiger.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There's a little mistake in that,“ said Phil. ”The snow-ball was hard enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher. I wouldn't be hit like that again for ten dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That ain't so! Don't believe him, mother!“ said Jonas from the sofa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And what did you do?“ demanded Mrs. Brent with a frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I laid him down on the snow and washed his face with soft snow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You might have given him his death of cold,“ said Mrs. Brent, with evident hostility. ”I am not sure but the poor boy will have pneumonia now, in consequence of your brutal treatment.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you have nothing to say as to his attack upon me?“ said Phil indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have no doubt you have very much exaggerated it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, he has,“ chimed in Jonas from the sofa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil regarded his step-brother with scorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Can't you tell the truth now and then, Jonas?“ he asked contemptuously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You shall not insult my boy in my presence!“ said Mrs. Brent, with a little spot of color mantling her high cheek-bones. ”Philip Brent, I have too long endured your insolence. You think because I am a woman you can be insolent with impunity, but you will find yourself mistaken. It is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your tone. Learn, then, that you have not a cent of your own. You are wholly dependent upon my bounty.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What! Did my father leave you all his money?“ asked Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He was not your father!“ answered Mrs. Brent coldly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. A STRANGE REVELATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHILIP started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from the lips of his step-mother. It seemed to him as if the earth were crumbling beneath his feet, for he had felt no more certain of the existence of the universe than of his being the son of Gerald Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was not the only person amazed at this declaration. Jonas, forgetting for the moment the part he was playing, sat bolt upright on the sofa, with his large mouth wide open, staring by turns at Philip and his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Gosh!“ he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you repeat that, Mrs. Brent?“ asked Philip, after a brief pause, not certain that he had heard aright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I spoke plain English, I believe,“ said Mrs. Brent coldly, enjoying the effect of her communication.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I said that Mr. Brent, my late husband, was not your father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't believe you!“ burst forth Philip impetuously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't wish to believe me, you mean,“ answered his step-mother, unmoved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I don't wish to believe you,“ said the boy, looking her in the eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are very polite to doubt a lady's word,“ said Mrs. Brent with sarcasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In such a matter as that I believe no one's word,“ said Phil. ”I ask for proof.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, I am prepared to satisfy you. Sit down and I will tell you the story.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother fixedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Whose son am I,“ he demanded, ”if not Mr. Brent's?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are getting on too fast. Jonas,“ continued his mother, suddenly turning to her hulking son, on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity, ”do you understand that what I am going to say is to be a secret, not to be spoken of to any one?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes'm,“ answered Jonas readily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well. Now to proceed. Philip, you have heard probably that when you were very small your father—I mean Mr. Brent—lived in a small town in Ohio, called Fultonville?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I have heard him say so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you remember in what business he was then engaged?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He kept a hotel.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; a small hotel, but as large as the place required. He was not troubled by many guests. The few who stopped at his house were business men from towns near by, or drummers from the great cities, who had occasion to stay over a night. One evening, however, a gentleman arrived with an unusual companion—in other words, a boy of about three years of age. The boy had a bad cold, and seemed to need womanly care. Mr. Brent's wife—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The woman you were taught to call mother,“ corrected the second Mrs. Brent, ”felt compassion for the child, and volunteered to take care of it for the night. The offer was gladly accepted, and you— for, of course, you were the child—were taken into Mrs. Brent's own room, treated with simple remedies, and in the morning seemed much better. Your father—your real father—seemed quite gratified, and preferred a request. It was that your new friend would take care of you for a week while he traveled to Cincinnati on business. After dispatching this, he promised to return and resume the care of you, paying well for the favor done him. Mrs. Brent, my predecessor, being naturally fond of children, readily agreed to this proposal, and the child was left behind, while the father started for Cincinnati.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Mrs. Brent paused, and Philip regarded her with doubt and suspense</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well?“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, you want to know the rest?“ said Mrs. Brent with an ironical smile. ”You are interested in the story?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, madam, whether it is true or not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There isn't much more to tell,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A week passed. You recovered from your cold, and became as lively as ever. In fact, you seemed to feel quite at home among your new surroundings, which was rather unfortunate, for your father never came back! “</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Never came back!“ repeated Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; nor was anything heard from him. Mr. and Mrs. Brent came to the conclusion that the whole thing was prearranged to get rid of you. Luckily for you, they had become attached to you, and, having no children of their own, decided to retain you. Of course, some story had to be told to satisfy the villagers. You were represented to be the son of a friend, and this was readily believed. When, however, my late husband left Ohio, and traveled some hundreds of miles eastward to this place, he dropped this explanation and represented you as his own son. Romantic, wasn't it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip looked searchingly at the face of his step-mother, or the woman whom he had regarded as such, but he could read nothing to contradict the story in her calm, impassive countenance. A great fear fell upon him that she might be telling the truth. His features showed his contending emotions. But he had a profound distrust as well as dislike of his step-mother, and he could not bring himself to put confidence in what she told him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What proof is there of this?“ he asked, after a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your father's word. I mean, of course, Mr. Brent's word. He told me this story before I married him, feeling that I had a right to know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why didn't he tell me?“ asked Philip incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He thought it would make you unhappy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You didn't mind that,“ said Philip, his lips curling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered Mrs. Brent, with a curious smile. ”Why should I? I never pretended to like you, and now I have less cause than ever, after your brutal treatment of my boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas endeavored to look injured, but could not at once change the expression of his countenance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your explanation is quite satisfactory, Mrs. Brent,“ returned Philip. ”I don't think I stood much higher in your estimation yesterday than today, so that I haven't lost much. But you haven't given me any proof yet.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Wait a minute.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent left the room, went up-stairs, and speedily returned, bringing with her a small daguerreotype, representing a boy of three years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you ever see this before?“ she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered Philip, taking it from her hand and eying it curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When Mr. and Mrs. Brent decided that you were to be left on their hands,“ she proceeded, ”they had this picture of you taken in the same dress in which you came to them, with a view to establish your identity if at any time afterward inquiry should be made for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The daguerreotype represented a bright, handsome child, dressed tastefully, and more as would be expected of a city child than of one born in the country. There was enough resemblance to Philip as he looked now to convince him that it was really his picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have something more to show you,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She produced a piece of white paper in which the daguerreotype had been folded. Upon it was some writing, and Philip readily recognized the hand of the man whom he had regarded as his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He read these lines:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is the picture of the boy who was mysteriously left in the charge of Mr. Brent, April, 1863, and never reclaimed. l have reared him as my own son, but think it best to enter this record of the way in which he came into my hands, and to preserve by the help of art his appearance at the time he first came to us. GERALD BRENT.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you recognize this handwriting?“ asked Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Philip in a dazed tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps,“ she said triumphantly, ”you will doubt my word now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”May I have this picture?“ asked Philip, without answering her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; you have as good a claim to it as any one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And the paper?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The paper I prefer to keep myself,“ said Mrs. Brent, nodding her head suspiciously. ”I don't care to have my only proof destroyed.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip did not seem to take her meaning, but with the daguerreotype in his hand, he left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I say, mother,“ chuckled Jonas, his freckled face showing his enjoyment, ”it's a good joke on Phil, isn't it?“ I guess he won't be quite so uppish after this.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III. PHIL'S SUDDEN RESOLUTION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN Phil left the presence of Mrs. Brent, he felt as if he had been suddenly transported to a new world. He was no longer Philip Brent, and the worst of it was that he did not know who he was. In his tumultuous state of feeling, however, one thing seemed clear—his prospects were wholly changed, and his plans for the future also. Mrs. Brent had told him that he was wholly dependent upon her. Well, he did not intend to remain so. His home had not been pleasant at the best. As a dependent upon the bounty of such a woman it would be worse. He resolved to leave home and strike out for himself, not from any such foolish idea of independence as sometimes leads boys to desert a good home for an uncertain skirmish with the world, but simply be cause he felt now that he had no real home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To begin with he would need money, and on opening his pocket-book he ascertained that his available funds consisted of only a dollar and thirty-seven cents. That wasn't quite enough to begin the world with. But he had other resources. He owned a gun, which a friend of his would be ready to take off his hands. He had a boat, also, which he could probably sell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the village street he met Reuben Gordon, a young journeyman carpenter, who was earning good wages, and had money to spare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How are you, Phil,“ said Reuben in a friendly way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are just the one I want to meet,“ said Phil earnestly. ”Didn't you tell me once you would like to buy my gun?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. Want to sell it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I don't; but I want the money it will bring. So I'll sell it if you'll buy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What d'ye want for it?“ asked Reuben cautiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Six dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Too much. I'll give five.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can have it,“ said Phil after a pause. ”How soon can you let me have the money?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Bring the gun round to-night, and I'll pay you for it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right. Do you know of any one who wants to buy a boat?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What? Going to sell that, too?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Seems to me you're closin' up business?“ said Reuben shrewdly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I am. I'm going to leave Planktown.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't say? Well, I declare! Where are you goin'?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To New York, I guess.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Got any prospect there?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was not, perhaps, strictly true—that is, Phil had no definite prospect, but he felt that there must be a chance in a large city like New York for any one who was willing to work, and so felt measurably justified in saying what he did.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hadn't thought of buyin' a boat,“ said Reuben thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil pricked up his ears at the hint of a possible customer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better buy mine,“ he said quickly; ”I'll sell it cheap.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How cheap?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ten dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's too much.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It cost me fifteen.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But it's second-hand now, you know,“ said Reuben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's just as good as new. I'm taking off five dollars, though, you see.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think I want it enough to pay ten dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What will you give?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reuben finally agreed to pay seven dollars and seventy-five cents, after more or less bargaining, and to pay the money that evening upon delivery of the goods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think I've got anything more to sell,“ said Phil thoughtfully. ”There's my skates, but they are not very good. I'll give them to Tommy Kavanagh. He can't afford to buy a pair.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy was the son of a poor widow, and was very much pleased with the gift, which Phil conveyed to him just before supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just after supper he took his gun and the key of his boat over to Reuben Gordon, who thereupon gave him the money agreed upon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shall I tell Mrs. Brent I am going away?“ Phil said to himself, ”or shall I leave a note for her?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He decided to announce his resolve in person. To do otherwise would seem too much like running away, and that he had too much self-respect to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So in the evening, after his return from Reuben Gordon's, he said to Mrs. Brent:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think I ought to tell you that I'm going away to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent looked up from her work, and her cold gray eyes surveyed Phil with curious scrutiny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are going away!“ she replied. ”Where are you going?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think I shall go to New York.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What for?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Seek my fortune, as so many have done before me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They didn't always find it!“ said Mrs. Brent with a cold sneer. ”Is there any other reason?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; it's chiefly on account of what you told me yesterday. You said that I was dependent upon you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So you are.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And that I wasn't even entitled to the name of Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I said it, and it's true.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well,“ said Phil, ”I don't want to be dependent upon you. I prefer to earn my own living.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am not prepared to say but that you are right. But do you know what the neighbors will say?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What will they say?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That I drove you from home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It won't be true. I don't pretend to enjoy my home, but I suppose I can stay on here if I like?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, you can stay.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't object to my going?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, if it is understood that you go of your own accord.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am willing enough to take the blame of it, if there is any blame.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well; get a sheet of note-paper, and write at my direction.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil took a sheet of note-paper from his father's desk, and sat down to comply with Mrs. Brent's request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She dictated as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I leave home at my own wish, but with the consent of Mrs. Brent, to seek my fortune. It is wholly my own idea, and I hold no one else responsible. ”PHILIP BRENT.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may as well keep the name of Brent,“ said his step-mother, as you have no other that you know of.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil winced at those cold words. It was not pleasant to reflect that this was so, and that he was wholly ignorant of his parentage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”One thing more,“ said Mrs. Brent. ”It is only eight o'clock. I should like to have you go out and call upon some of those with whom you are most intimate, and tell them that you are leaving home voluntarily.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps you would prefer to do so to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I am going away to-morrow morning.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Going away to-morrow morning?“ repeated Jonas, who entered the room at that moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's plan was briefly disclosed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then give me your skates,“ said Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't. I've given them to Tommy Kavanagh.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's mean. You might have thought of me first,“ grumbled Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know why. Tommy Kavanagh is my friend and you are not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Anyway, you can let me have your boat and gun.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have sold them.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's too bad.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know why you should expect them. I needed the money they brought me to pay my expenses till I get work.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will pay your expenses to New York if you wish,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you; but I shall have money enough,“ answered Phil, who shrank from receiving any favor at the hands of Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As you please, but you will do me the justice to remember that I offered it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you. I shall not forget it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That evening, just before going to bed, Mrs. Brent opened a trunk and drew from it a folded paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She read as follows—for it was her husband's will:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To the boy generally known as Philip Brent, and supposed, though incorrectly, to be my son, I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars, and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian, to hold in trust for him till he attains the age of twenty-one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He need never know of this,“ said Mrs. Brent to herself in a low tone. ”I will save it for Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She held the paper a moment, as if undecided whether to destroy it, but finally put it carefully back in the secret hiding-place from which she had taken it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is leaving home of his own accord,“ she whispered. ”Henceforth he will probably keep away. That suits me well. but no one can say I drove him to it.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV. MR. LIONEL LAKE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIX MONTHS before it might have cost Philip a pang to leave home. Then his father was living, and from him the boy had never received aught but kindness. Even his step-mother, though she secretly disliked him, did not venture to show it, and secure in the affections of his supposed father, he did not trouble himself as to whether Mrs. Brent liked him or not. As for Jonas, he was cautioned by his mother not to get himself into trouble by treating Phil badly, and the boy, who knew on which side his interests lay, faithfully obeyed. It was only after the death of Mr. Brent that both Jonas and his mother changed their course, and thought it safe to snub Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Planktown was seventy-five miles distant from New York, and the fare was two dollars and a quarter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was rather a large sum to pay, considering Phil's scanty fund, but he wished to get to the great city as soon as possible, and he decided that it would be actually cheaper to ride than to walk, considering that he would have to buy his meals on the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took his seat in the cars, placing a valise full of underclothes on the seat next him. The train was not very full, and the seat beside him did not appear to be required.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mile after mile they sped on the way, and Phil looked from the window with interest at the towns through which they passed. There are very few boys of his age—sixteen—who do not like to travel in the cars. Limited as were his means, and uncertain as were his prospects, Phil felt not only cheerful, but actually buoyant, as every minute took him farther away from Planktown, and so nearer the city where he hoped to make a living at the outset, and perhaps his fortune in the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently—perhaps half way on—a young man, rather stylishly dressed, came into the car. It was not at a station, and therefore it seemed clear that he came from another car.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He halted when he reached the seat which Phil occupied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero, observing that his glance rested on his valise, politely removed it, saying:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you like to sit down here, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, thank you,“ answered the young man, and sank into the seat beside Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Sorry to inconvenience you,“ he said, with a glance at the bag.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, not at all,“ returned Phil. ”I only put the valise on the seat till it was wanted by some passenger.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are more considerate than some passengers,“ observed the young man. ”In the next car is a woman, an elderly party, who is taking up three extra seats to accommodate her bags and boxes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That seems rather selfish,“ remarked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Selfish! I should say so. I paused a minute at her seat as I passed along, and she was terribly afraid I wanted to sit down. She didn't offer to move anything, though, as you have. I stopped long enough to make her feel uncomfortable, and then passed on. I don't think I have fared any the worse for doing so. I would rather sit beside you than her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Am I to consider that a compliment?“ asked Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, yes, if you choose. Not that it is saying much to call you more agreeable company than the old party alluded to. Are you going to New York?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Live there?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I expect to live there.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Brought up in the country, perhaps?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, in Planktown.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Planktown! I've heard it's a nice place, but never visited it. Got any folks?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil hesitated. In the light of the revelation that had been made to him by Mrs. Brent, he did not know how to answer. However, there was no call to answer definitely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not many,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Goin' to school in New York?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To college, perhaps. I've got a cousin in Columbia College.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish I knew enough to go to college,“ said Phil; ”but I only know a little Latin, and no Greek at all.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, I never cared much about Latin or Greek, myself. I presume you are thinking about a business position?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I shall try to get a place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may find a little time necessary to find one. However, you are, no doubt, able to pay your board for awhile.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”For a short time,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, I may be able to help you to a place. I know a good many prominent business men.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should be grateful to you for any help of that kind,“ said Phil, deciding that he was in luck to meet with such a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't mention it. I have had to struggle myself—in earlier days—though at present I am well fixed. What is your name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good! My name is Lionel Lake. Sorry I haven't got any cards. Perhaps I may have one in my pocket-book. Let me see!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Lake opened his porte-monnaie and uttered a exclamation of surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By Jove!“ he said, ”I am in a fix.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil looked at him inquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I took out a roll of bills at the house of my aunt, where I stayed last night,“ explained Mr. Lake, ”and must have neglected to replace them.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you have not lost them,“ said Phil politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, no; my aunt will find them and take care of them for me, so that I shall get them back. The trouble is that I am left temporarily without funds.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But you can get money in the city,“ suggested Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt; only it is necessary for me to stay over a train ten miles short of the city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Lionel Lake seemed very much perplexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If I knew some one in the cars,“ he said reflectively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did occur to Phil to offer to loan him something, but the scantiness of his own resources warned him that it would not be prudent, so he remained silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finally Mr. Lake appeared to have an idea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you got five dollars, Philip?“ he said familiarly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Philip slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I'll make a proposal. Lend it to me and I will give you this ring as security. It is worth twenty-five dollars easily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew from his vest-pocket a neat gold ring, with some sort of a stone in the setting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There!“ said Mr. Lake, ”I'll give you this ring and my address, and you can bring it to my office to-morrow morning. I'll give you back the five dollars and one dollar for the accommodation. That's good interest, isn't it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But I might keep the ring and sell it,“ suggested Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, I am not afraid. You look honest. I will trust you,“ said the young man, in a careless, off-hand manner. ”Say, is it a bargain?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It occurred to him that he could not earn a dollar more easily. Besides, he would be doing a favor to this very polite young man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right, then!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Five dollars of Phil's scanty hoard was handed to Mr. Lake, who, in return, gave Phil the ring, which he put on his finger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He also handed Phil a scrap of paper, on which he penciled:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”LIONEL LAKE, No. 237 Broadway.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'm ever so much obliged,“ he said. ”Good-by. I get out at the next station.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was congratulating himself on his good stroke of business, when the conductor entered the car, followed by a young lady. When they came to where Phil was seated, the young lady said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is my ring on that boy's finger?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Aha! we've found the thief, then!“ said the conductor. ”Boy, give up the ring you stole from this young lady!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he spoke he placed his hand on Phil's shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Stole!“ repeated Phil, gasping. ”I don't understand you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, yes, you do!“ said the conductor roughly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V. AN OVERBEARING CONDUCTOR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NO MATTER how honest a boy may be, a sudden charge of theft is likely to make him look confused and guilty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such was the case with Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I assure you,“ he said earnestly, ”that I did not steal this ring.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where did you get it, then?“ demanded the conductor roughly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was one of those men who, in any position, will make themselves disagreeable. Moreover, he was a man who always thought ill of others, when there was any chance of doing so. In fact, he preferred to credit his fellows with bad qualities rather than with good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was handed me by a young man who just left the car,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a likely story,“ sneered the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young men are not in the habit of giving valuable rings to strangers.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He did not give it to me, I advanced him five dollars on it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What was the young man's name?“ asked the conductor incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There's his name and address,“ answered Phil, drawing from his pocket the paper handed him by Mr. Lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Lionel Lake, 237 Broadway,“ repeated the conductor. ”If there is any such person, which I very much doubt, you are probably a confederate of his.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have no right to say this,“ returned Phil indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I haven't, haven't I?“ snapped the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know what I am going to do with you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you wish me to return the ring to this young lady, I will do so, if she is positive it is hers.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, you must do that, but it won't get you out of trouble. I shall hand you over to a policeman as soon as we reach New York.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was certainly dismayed, for he felt that it might be difficult for him to prove that he came honestly in possession of the ring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The fact is,“ added the conductor, ”your story is too thin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Conductor,“ said a new voice, ”you are doing the boy an injustice.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The speaker was an old man with gray hair, but of form still robust, though he was at least sixty five. He sat in the seat just behind Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir,“ said Phil gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I understand my business,“ said the conductor impertinently, ”and don't need any instructions from you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young man,“ said the old gentleman, in a very dignified tone, ”I have usually found officials of your class polite and gentlemanly, but you are an exception.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who are you?“ asked the conductor rudely. ”What right have you to put in your oar?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As to who I am, I will answer you by and by. In reference to the boy, I have to say that his story is correct. I heard the whole conversation between him and the young man from whom he received the ring, and I can testify that he has told the truth.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At any rate he has received stolen property.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not knowing it to be stolen. The young man was an entire stranger to him, and though I suspected that he was an unscrupulous adventurer, the boy has not had experience enough to judge men.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well. If he's innocent he can prove it when he's brought to trial,“ said the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As for you, sir, it's none of your business.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young man, you asked me a short time since who I am. Do you want to know?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am not very particular.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then, sir, I have to inform you that I am Richard Grant, the president of this road.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conductor's face was a curious and interesting study when he heard this announcement. He knew that the old man whom he had insulted had a right to discharge him from his position, and bully as he had shown himself, he was now inclined to humble himself to save his place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I beg your pardon, sir,“ he said in a composed tone. ”If I had known who you were I wouldn't have spoken as I did.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I had a claim to be treated like a gentleman, even if I had no connection with the road,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you say the boy's all right, I won't interfere with him,“ continued the conductor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My testimony would clear him from any charge that might be brought against him,“ said the president. ”I saw him enter the car, and know he has had no opportunity to take the ring.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If he'll give me back the ring, that's all I want,“ said the young lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That I am willing to do, though I lose five dollars by it,“ said Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do so, my boy,“ said the president. ”I take it for granted that the young lady's claim is a just one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon this Philip drew the ring from his finger and handed it to the young lady, who went back to the car where her friends were sitting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope, sir,“ said the conductor anxiously, ”that you won't be prejudiced against me on account of this affair.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sorry to say that I can't help feeling prejudiced against you,“ returned the president dryly; ”but I won't allow this feeling to injure you if, upon inquiring, I find that you are otherwise an efficient officer.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad that my presence has saved this boy from being the victim of an injustice. Let this be a lesson to you in future.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conductor walked away, looking quite chop-fallen, and Philip turned to his new friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am very much indebted to you, sir,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But for you I should have found myself in serious trouble.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad to have prevented an injustice, my lad. I am sorry I could not save you from loss also. That enterprising rogue has gone off with five dollars belonging to you. I hope the loss will not be a serious one to you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was more than a third part of my capital, sir,“ said Phil, rather ruefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sorry for that. I suppose, however, you are not dependent upon your own resources?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir, I am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you no parents, then?“ asked Mr. Grant, with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir; that is, I have a step-mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And what are your plans, if you are willing to tell me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to New York to try to make a living.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I cannot commend your plan, my young friend, unless there is a good reason for it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think there is a good reason for it, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you have not run away from home?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir; I left home with my step-mother's knowledge and consent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is well. I don't want wholly to discourage you, and so I will tell you that I, too, came to New York at your age with the same object in view, with less money in my pocket than you possess.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And now you are the president of a railroad!“ said Phil hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; but I had a hard struggle before I reached that position.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am not afraid of hard work, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is in your favor. Perhaps you may be as lucky as I have been. You may call at my office in the city, if you feel inclined.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Mr. Grant spoke he put in Phil's hand a card bearing his name and address, in Wall Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir,“ said Phil gratefully. ”I shall be glad to call. I may need advice.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you seek advice and follow it you will be an exception to the general rule,“ said the president, smiling. ”One thing more—you have met with a loss which, to you, is a serious one. Allow me to bear it, and accept this bill.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But, sir, it is not right that you should bear it,“ commenced Phil. Then, looking at the bill, he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Haven't you made a mistake? This is a ten -dollar bill.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know it. Accept the other five as an evidence of my interest in you. By the way, I go to Philadelphia and Washington before my return to New York, and shall not return for three or four days. After that time you will find me at my office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am in luck after all,“ thought Phil cheerfully, ”in spite of the mean trick of Mr. Lionel Lake.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI. SIGNOR ORLANDO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SO PHIL reached New York in very fair spirits. He found himself, thanks to the liberality of Mr. Grant, in a better financial position than when he left home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he left the depot and found himself in the streets of New York, he felt like a stranger upon the threshold of a new life. He knew almost nothing about the great city he had entered, and was at a loss where to seek for lodgings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's a cold day,“ said a sociable voice at his elbow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking around, Phil saw that the speaker was a sallow-complexioned young man, with black hair and mustache, a loose black felt hat, crushed at the crown, giving him rather a rakish look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Phil politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Stranger in the city, I expect?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Never mind the sir. I ain't used to ceremony. I am Signor Orlando.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Signor Orlando!“ repeated Phil, rather puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you an Italian?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, yes,“ returned Signor Orlando, with a wink, ”that's what I am, or what people think me; but I was born in Vermont, and am half Irish and half Yankee.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How did you come by your name, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I took it,“ answered his companion. ”You see, dear boy, I'm a professional.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A what?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A professional—singer and clog-dancer. I believe I am pretty well known to the public,“ continued Signor Orlando complacently. ”Last summer I traveled with Jenks &amp; Brown's circus. Of course you've heard of them . Through the winter I am employed at Bowerman's Varieties, in the Bowery. I appear every night, and at two matinees weekly.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It must be confessed that Phil was considerably impressed by the professional character of Signor Orlando. He had never met an actor, or public performer of any description, and was disposed to have a high respect for a man who filled such a conspicuous position. There was not, to be sure, anything very impressive about Signor Orlando's appearance. His face did not indicate talent, and his dress was shabby. But for all that he was a man familiar with the public—a man of gifts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should like to see you on the stage,“ said Phil respectfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So you shall, my dear boy—so you shall. I'll get you a pass from Mr. Bowerman. Which way are you going?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know,“ answered Phil, puzzled. ”I should like to find a cheap boarding-house, but I don't know the city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I do,“ answered Signor Orlando promptly. ”Why not come to my house?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you a house?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I mean my boarding-house. It's some distance away. Suppose we take a horse-car?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right!“ answered Phil, relieved to find a guide in the labyrinth of the great city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I live on Fifth Street, near the Bowery—a very convenient location,“ said Orlando, if we may take the liberty to call him thus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Fifth Avenue?“ asked Phil, who did not know the difference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, no; that's a peg above my style. I am not a Vanderbilt, nor yet an Astor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is the price moderate?“ asked Phil anxiously. ”I must make my money last as long as I can, for I don't know when I shall get a place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To be sure. You might room with me, only I've got a hall bedroom. Perhaps we might manage it, though.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think I should prefer a room by myself,“ said Phil, who reflected that Signor Orlando was a stranger as yet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, well, I'll speak to the old lady, and I guess she can accommodate you with a hall bedroom like mine on the third floor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What should I have to pay?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A dollar and a quarter a week, and you can get your meals where you please.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think that will suit me,“ said Phil thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After leaving the car, a minute's walk brought them to a shabby three-story house of brick. There was a stable opposite, and a group of dirty children were playing in front of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is where I hang out,“ said Signor Orlando cheerfully. ”As the poet says, there is no place like home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If this had been true it was not much to be regretted, since the home in question was far from attractive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Signor Orlando rang the bell, and a stout woman of German aspect answered the call.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So you haf come back, Herr Orlando,“ said this lady. ”I hope you haf brought them two weeks' rent you owe me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All in good time, Mrs. Schlessinger,“ said Orlando. ”But you see I have brought some one with me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is he your bruder now?“ asked the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, he is not, unfortunately for me. His name is—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Orlando coughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent,“ suggested our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just so—Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad to see Mr. Prent,“ said the landlady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And is he an actor like you, Signor Orlando?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not yet. We don't know what may happen. But he comes on business, Mrs. Schlessinger. He wants a room.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The landlady brightened up. She had two rooms vacant, and a new lodger was a godsend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I vill show Mr. Prent what rooms I haf,“ she said. ”Come up-stairs, Mr. Prent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The good woman toiled up the staircase panting, for she was asthmatic, and Phil followed. The interior of the house was as dingy as the exterior, and it was quite dark on the second landing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She threw open the door of a back room, which, being lower than the hall, was reached by a step.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There!“ said she, pointing to the faded carpet, rumpled bed, and cheap pine bureau, with the little six-by-ten looking-glass surmounting it. ”This is a peautiful room for a single gentleman, or even for a man and his wife.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My friend, Mr. Brent, is not married,“ said Signor Orlando waggishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will have your shoke, Signor Orlando,“ said Mrs. Schlessinger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is the price of this room?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Three dollars a week, Mr. Prent, I ought to have four, but since you are a steady young gentleman—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How does she know that?“ Phil wondered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Since you are a steady young gentleman, and a friend of Signor Orlando, I will not ask you full price.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is more than I can afford to pay,“ said Phil, shaking his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think you had better show Mr. Brent the hall bedroom over mine,“ suggested the signor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Schlessinger toiled up another staircase, the two new acquaintances following her. She threw open the door of one of those depressing cells known in New York as a hall bedroom. It was about five feet wide and eight feet long, and was nearly filled up by a cheap bedstead, covered by a bed about two inches thick, and surmounted at the head by a consumptive-looking pillow. The paper was torn from the walls in places. There was one rickety chair, and a wash-stand which bore marks of extreme antiquity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is a very neat room for a single gentleman,“ remarked Mrs. Schlessinger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's spirits fell as he surveyed what was to be his future home. It was a sad contrast to his neat, comfortable room at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is this room like yours, Signor Orlando?“ he asked faintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As like as two peas,“ answered Orlando.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you recommend me to take it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You couldn't do better.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How could the signor answer otherwise in presence of a landlady to whom he owed two weeks' rent?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then,“ said Phil, with a secret shudder, ”I'll take it if the rent is satisfactory.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A dollar and a quarter a week,“ said Mrs. Schlessinger promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'll take it for a week.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You won't mind paying in advance?“ suggested the landlady. ”I pay my own rent in advance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's answer was to draw a dollar and a quarter from his purse and pass it to his landlady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'll take possession now,“ said our hero. ”Can I have some water to wash my face?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Schlessinger was evidently surprised that any one should want to wash in the middle of the day, but made no objections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Phil had washed his face and hands, he went out with Signor Orlando to dine at a restaurant on the Bowery.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII. BOWERMAN'S VARIETIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RESTAURANT to which he was taken by Signor Orlando was thronged with patrons, for it was one o'clock. On the whole, they did not appear to belong to the highest social rank, though they were doubtless respectable. The table-cloths were generally soiled, and the waiters had a greasy look. Phil said nothing, but he did not feel quite so hungry as before he entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The signor found two places at one of the tables, and they sat down. Phil examined a greasy bill of fare and found that he could obtain a plate of meat for ten cents. This included bread and butter, and a dish of mashed potato. A cup of tea would be five cents additional.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can afford fifteen cents for a meal,“ he thought, and called for a plate of roast beef.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Corn beef and cabbage for me,“ said the signor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's very filling,“ he remarked aside to Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They won't give you but a mouthful of beef.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it proved, but the quality was such that Phil did not care for more. He ordered a piece of apple pie afterward feeling still hungry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see you're bound to have a square meal,“ said the signor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After Phil had had it, he was bound to confess that he did not feel uncomfortably full. Yet he had spent twice as much as the signor, who dispensed with the tea and pie as superfluous luxuries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the evening Signor Orlando bent his steps toward Bowerman's Varieties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope in a day or two to get a complimentary ticket for you, Mr. Brent,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How much is the ticket?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Fifteen cents. Best reserved seats twenty-five cents.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I believe I will be extravagant for once,“ said Phil, ”and go at my own expense.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good!“ said the signor huskily. ”You'll feel repaid I'll be bound. Bowerman always gives the public their money's worth. The performance begins at eight o'clock and won't be out until half-past eleven.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Less than five cents an hour,“ commented Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What a splendid head you've got!“ said Signor Orlando admiringly. ”I couldn't have worked that up. Figures ain't my province.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed to Phil rather a slender cause for compliment, but he said nothing, since it seemed clear that the computation was beyond his companion's ability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As to the performance, it was not refilled, nor was the talent employed first-class. Still Phil enjoyed himself after a fashion. He had never had it in his power to attend many amusements, and this was new to him. He naturally looked with interest for the appearance of his new friend and fellow-lodger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Signor Orlando appeared, dressed in gorgeous array, sang a song which did credit to the loudness of his voice rather than its quality, and ended by a noisy clog-dance which elicited much applause from the boys in the gallery, who shared the evening's entertainment for the moderate sum of ten cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The signor was called back to the stage. He bowed his thanks and gave another dance. Then he was permitted to retire. As this finished his part of the entertainment he afterward came around in citizen's dress, and took a seat in the auditorium beside Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How did you like me, Mr. Brent?“ he asked complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I thought you did well, Signor Orlando. You were much applauded.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, the audience is very loyal,“ said the proud performer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two half-grown boys heard Phil pronounce the name of his companion, and they gazed awe-stricken at the famous man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's Signor Orlando!“ whispered one of the others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know it,“ was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Such is fame,“ said the Signor, in a pleased tone to Phil. ”People point me out on the streets.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very gratifying, no doubt,“ said our hero, but it occurred to him that he would not care to be pointed out as a performer at Bowerman's. Signor Orlando, however, well-pleased with himself, didn't doubt that Phil was impressed by his popularity, and perhaps even envied it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They didn't stay till the entertainment was over. It was, of course, familiar to the signor, and Phil felt tired and sleepy, for he had passed a part of the afternoon in exploring the city, and had walked in all several miles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went back to his lodging-house, opened the door with a pass-key which Mrs. Schlessinger had given him, and climbing to his room in the third story, undressed and deposited himself in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bed was far from luxurious. A thin pallet rested on slats, so thin that he could feel the slats through it, and the covering was insufficient. The latter deficiency he made up by throwing his overcoat over the quilt, and despite the hardness of his bed, he was soon sleeping soundly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To-morrow I must look for a place,“ he said to Signor Orlando. ”Can you give me any advise?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, my dear boy. Buy a daily paper, the Sun or Herald , and look at the advertisements. There may be some prominent business man who is looking out for a boy of your size.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil knew of no better way, and he followed Signor Orlando's advice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a frugal breakfast at the Bowery restaurant, he invested a few pennies in the two papers mentioned, and began to go the rounds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first place was in Pearl Street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered, and was directed to a desk in the front part of the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You advertised for a boy,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We've got one,“ was the brusque reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course no more was to be said, and Phil walked out, a little dashed at his first rebuff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the next place he found some half a dozen boys waiting, and joined the line, but the vacancy was filled before his turn came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the next place his appearance seemed to make a good impression, and he was asked several questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is your name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How old are you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just sixteen.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How is your education?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have been to school since I was six.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you ought to know something. Have you ever been in a place?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you live with your parents?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir; I have just come to the city, and am lodging in Fifth Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you won't do. We wish our boys to live with their parents.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Phil! He had allowed himself to hope that at length he was likely to get a place. The abrupt termination of the conversation dispirited him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made three more applications. In one of them he again came near succeeding, but once more the fact that he did not live with his parents defeated his application.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It seems to be very hard getting a place,“ thought Phil, and it must be confessed he felt a little homesick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't make any more applications to-day,“ he decided, and being on Broadway, walked up that busy thoroughfare, wondering what the morrow would bring forth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was winter, and there was ice on the sidewalk. Directly in front of Phil walked an elderly gentleman, whose suit of fine broadcloth and gold spectacles, seemed to indicate a person of some prominence and social importance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly he set foot on a treacherous piece of ice. Vainly he strove to keep his equilibrium, his arms waving wildly, and his gold-headed cane falling to the sidewalk. He would have fallen backward, had not Phil, observing his danger in time, rushed to his assistance.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII. THE HOUSE IN TWELFTH STREET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WITH some difficulty the gentleman righted himself, and then Phil picked up his cane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you are not hurt, sir?“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should have been but for you, my good boy,“ said the gentleman. ”I am a little shaken by the suddenness of my slipping.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you wish me to go with you, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, if you please. I do not perhaps require you, but I shall be glad of your company.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you live in the city?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; that is, I propose to do so. I have come here in search of employment.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil said this, thinking it possible that the old gentleman might exert his influence in his favor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you dependent on what you may earn?“ asked the gentleman, regarding him attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have a little money, sir, but when that is gone I shall need to earn something.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is no misfortune. It is a good thing for a boy to be employed. Otherwise he is liable to get into mischief.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At any rate, I shall be glad to find work, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you applied anywhere yet?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil gave a little account of his unsuccessful applications, and the objections that had been made to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, yes,“ said the old gentleman thoughtfully, ”more confidence is placed in a boy who lives with his parents.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two walked on together until they reached Twelfth Street. It was a considerable walk, and Phil was surprised that his companion should walk, when he could easily have taken a Broadway stage, but the old gentleman explained this himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I find it does me good,“ he said, ”to spend some time in the open air, and even if walking tires me it does me good.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At Twelfth Street they turned off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am living with a married niece,“ he said, ”just on the other side of Fifth Avenue.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the door of a handsome four-story house, with a brown-stone front, the old gentleman paused, and told Phil that this was his residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then, sir, I will bid you good-morning,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, no; come in and lunch with me,“ said Mr. Carter hospitably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had, by the way, mentioned that his name was Oliver Carter, and that he was no longer actively engaged in business, but was a silent partner in the firm of which his nephew by marriage was the nominal head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was sure that the invitation was intended to be accepted, and he saw no reason why he should not accept it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hannah,“ said the old gentleman to the servant who opened the door, ”tell your mistress that I have brought a boy home to dinner with me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Hannah, surveying Phil in some surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come up to my room, my young friend,“ said Mr. Carter. ”You may want to prepare for lunch.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter had two connecting rooms on the second floor, one of which he used as a bed-chamber. The furniture was handsome and costly, and Phil, who was not used to city houses, thought it luxurious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil washed his face and hands, and brushed his hair. Then a bell rang, and following his new friend, he went down to lunch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lunch was set out in the front basement. When Phil and Mr. Carter entered the room a lady was standing by the fire, and beside her was a boy of about Phil's age. The lady was tall and slender, with light-brown hair and cold gray eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Lavinia,“ said Mr. Carter, ”I have brought a young friend with me to lunch.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I see,“ answered the lady. ”Has he been here before?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; he is a new acquaintance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I would speak to him if I knew his name.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”His name is—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the old gentleman hesitated, for in truth he had forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may sit down here, Mr. Brent,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, for this was the lady's name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, ma'am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And so you made my uncle's acquaintance this morning?“ she continued, herself taking a seat at the head of the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; he was of service to me,“ answered Mr. Carter for him. ”I had lost my balance, and should have had a heavy fall if Philip had not come to my assistance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He was very kind, I am sure,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, but her tone was very cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip,“ said Mr. Carter, ”this is my grand-nephew, Alonzo Pitkin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He indicated the boy already referred to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you do?“ said Alonzo, staring at Philip not very cordially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, thank you,“ answered Philip politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where do you live?“ asked Alonzo, after a moment's hesitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In Fifth Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's near the Bowery, isn't it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy shrugged his shoulders and exchanged a significant look with his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fifth Street was not a fashionable street—indeed quite the reverse, and Phil's answer showed that he was a nobody. Phil himself had begun to suspect that he was unfashionably located, but he felt that until his circumstances improved he might as well remain where he was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, though he lived in an unfashionable street, it could not be said that Phil, in his table manners, showed any lack of good breeding. He seemed quite at home at Mrs. Pitkin's table, and in fact acted with greater propriety than Alonzo, who was addicted to fast eating and greediness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Couldn't you walk home alone, Uncle Oliver?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin presently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then it was a pity to trouble Mr. Brent to come with you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was no trouble,“ responded Philip promptly, though he suspected that it was not consideration for him that prompted the remark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I admit that I was a little selfish in taking up my young friend's time,“ said the old gentleman cheerfully; ”but I infer, from what he tells me, that it is not particularly valuable just now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you in a business position, Mr. Brent?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, madam. I was looking for a place this morning.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you lived for some time in the city?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I came here only yesterday from the country.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think country boys are very foolish to leave good homes in the country to seek places in the city,“ said Mrs. Pitkin sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There may be circumstances, Lavinia, that make it advisable,“ suggested Mr. Carter, who, however, did not know Phil's reason for coming.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt; I understand that,“ answered Mrs. Pitkin, in a tone so significant that Phil wondered whether she thought he had got into any trouble at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And besides, we can't judge for every one. So I hope Master Philip may find some good and satisfactory opening, now that he has reached the city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a short time, lunch, which in New York is generally a plain meal, was over, and Mr. Carter invited Philip to come up-stairs again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to talk over your prospects, Philip,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was silence till after the two had left the room. Then Mrs. Pitkin said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Alonzo, I don't like this.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What don't you like, ma?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle bringing this boy home. It is very extraordinary, this sudden interest in a perfect stranger.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think he'll leave him any money?“ asked Alonzo, betraying interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know what it may lead to, Lonny, but it don't look right. Such things have been known.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'd like to punch the boy's head,“ remarked Alonzo, with sudden hostility. ”All uncle's money ought to come to us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So it ought, by rights,“ observed his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We must see that this boy doesn't get any ascendency over him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil would have been very much amazed if he had overheard this conversation.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX. THE OLD GENTLEMAN PROVES A FRIEND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE OLD gentleman sat down in an arm-chair and waved his hand toward a small rocking-chair, in which Phil seated himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I conclude that you had a good reason for leaving home, Philip,“ said Mr. Carter, eying our hero with a keen, but friendly look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; since my father's death it has not been a home to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is there a step-mother in the case?“ asked the old gentleman shrewdly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Any one else?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She has a son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you two don't agree?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You seem to know all about it, sir,“ said Phil, surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know something of the world—that is all.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil began to think that Mr. Carter's knowledge of the world was very remarkable. He began to wonder whether he could know anything more—could suspect the secret which Mrs. Brent had communicated to him. Should he speak of it? He decided at any rate to wait, for Mr. Carter, though kind, was a comparative stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well,“ continued the old gentleman, ”I won't inquire too minutely into the circumstances. You don't look like a boy that would take such an important step as leaving home without a satisfactory reason. The next thing is to help you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's courage rose as he heard these words. Mr. Carter was evidently a rich man, and he could help him if he was willing. So he kept silence, and let his new friend do the talking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You want a place,“ continued Mr. Carter. ”Now, what are you fit for?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is a hard question for me to answer, sir. I don't know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you a good education?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; and I know something of Latin and French besides.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can write a good hand?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shall I show you, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; write a few lines at my private desk.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil did so, and handed the paper to Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very good,“ said the old gentleman approvingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is in your favor. Are you good at accounts?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Better still.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Sit down there again,“ he continued. ”I will give you a sum in interest.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil resumed his seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is the interest of eight hundred and forty-five dollars and sixty cents for four years, three months and twelve days, at eight and one-half per cent?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's pen moved fast in perfect silence for five minutes. Then he announced the result.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Let me look at the paper. I will soon tell you whether it is correct.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a brief examination, for the old gentleman was himself an adept at figures, he said, with a beaming smile:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is entirely correct. You are a smart boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir,“ said Phil, gratified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you deserve a good place—better than you will probably get.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil listened attentively. The last clause was not quite so satisfactory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ said Mr. Carter, evidently talking to himself, ”I must get Pitkin to take him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil knew that the lady whom he had already met was named Pitkin, and he rightly concluded that it was her husband who was meant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope he is more agreeable than his wife,“ thought Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, Philip,“ said Mr. Carter, who had evidently made up his mind, ”I will try to find you a place this afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shall be very much obliged, sir,“ said Philip gladly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have already told you that my nephew and I are in business together, he being the active and I the silent partner. We do a general shipping business. Our store is on Franklin Street. I will give you a letter to my nephew and he will give you a place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Wait a minute and I will write the note.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes later Phil was on his way down town with his credentials in his pocket.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X. PHIL CALLS ON MR. PITKIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL paused before an imposing business structure, and looked up to see if he could see the sign that would show him he had reached his destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had not far to look. On the front of the building he saw in large letters the sign: ENOCH PITKIN &amp; CO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the door-way there was another sign, from which he learned that the firm occupied the second floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went up-stairs, and opening a door, entered a spacious apartment which looked like a hive of industry. There were numerous clerks, counters piled with goods, and every indication that a prosperous business was being carried on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nearest person was a young man of eighteen, or perhaps more, with an incipient, straw-colored mustache, and a shock of hair of tow-color. This young man wore a variegated neck-tie, a stiff standing-collar, and a suit of clothes in the extreme of fashion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil looked at him hesitatingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man observed the look, and asked condescendingly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What can I do for you, my son?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such an address from a person less than three years older than himself came near upsetting the gravity of Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is Mr. Pitkin in?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I believe so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Can I see him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have no objection,“ remarked the young man facetiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where shall I find him?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The youth indicated a small room partitioned off as a private office in the extreme end of the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you,“ said Phil, and proceeded to find his way to the office in question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arrived at the door, which was partly open, he looked in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In an arm-chair sat a small man, with an erect figure and an air of consequence. He was not over forty-five, but looked older, for his cheeks were already seamed and his look was querulous. Cheerful natures do not so soon show signs of age as their opposites.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin?“ said Phil interrogatively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well?“ said the small man, frowning instinctively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have a note for you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil stepped forward and handed the missive to Mr. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The latter opened it quickly and read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy who will present this to you did me a service this morning. He is in want of employment. He seems well educated, but if you can't offer him anything better than the post of errand boy, do so. I will guarantee that he will give satisfaction. You call send him to the post-office, and to other offices on such errands as you may have. Pay him five dollars a week and charge that sum to me. Yours truly, OLIVER CARTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pitkin's frown deepened as he read this note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Pish!“ he ejaculated, in a tone which, though low, was audible to Phil. ”Uncle Oliver must be crazy. What is your name?“ he demanded fiercely, turning suddenly to Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When did you meet—the gentleman who gave you this letter?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil told him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know what is in this letter?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose, sir, it is a request that you give me a place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you read it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered Phil indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Humph! He wants me to give you the place of errand boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will try to suit you, sir,“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When do you want to begin?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As soon as possible, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come to-morrow morning, and report to me first.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Another freak of Uncle Oliver's!“ he muttered, as he turned his back upon Phil, and so signified that the interview was at an end.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI. PHIL ENTERS UPON HIS DUTIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL presented himself in good season the next morning at the store in Franklin Street. As he came up in one direction the youth whom he had seen in the store the previous day came up in the opposite direction. The latter was evidently surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Halloo, Johnny!“ said he. ”What's brought you here again?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Business,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Going to buy out the firm?“ inquired the youth jocosely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not to-day.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Some other day, then,“ said the young man, laughing as if he had said a very witty thing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Phil didn't know that this form of expression, slightly varied, had become a popular phrase of the day, he did not laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you belong to the church?“ asked the youth, stopping short in his own mirth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What makes you ask?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Because you don't laugh.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I would if I saw anything to laugh at.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come, that's hard on me. Honor bright, have you come to do any business with us?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is rather amusing to see how soon the cheapest clerk talks of ”us,“ quietly identifying himself with the firm that employs him. Not that I object to it. Often it implies a personal interest in the success and prosperity of the firm, which makes a clerk more valuable. This was not, however, the case with G. Washington Wilbur, the young man who was now conversing with Phil, as will presently appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to work here,“ answered Phil simply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Going to work here!“ repeated Mr. Wilbur in surprise. ”Has old Pitkin engaged you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin engaged me yesterday,“ Phil replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I didn't know he wanted a boy. What are you to do?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Go to the post-office, bank, and so on.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You're to be errand boy, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's the way I started,“ said Mr. Wilbur patronizingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you now?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A salesman. I wouldn't like to be back in my old position. What wages are you going to get?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Five dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Five dollars a week!“ ejaculated Mr. G. Washington Wilbur, in amazement. ”Come, you're chaffing.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why should I do that? Is that anything remarkable?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should say it was,“ answered Mr. Wilbur slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Didn't you get as much when you were errand boy?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I only got two dollars and a half. Did Pitkin tell you he would pay you five dollars a week.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; Mr Carter told me so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The old gentleman—Mr. Pitkin's uncle?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. It was at his request that Mr. Pitkin took me on.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur looked grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's a shame!“ he commenced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is a shame; that I should get five dollars a week?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, but that I should only get a dollar a week more than an errand boy. I'm worth every cent of ten dollars a week, but the old man only gives me six. It hardly keeps me in gloves and cigars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Won't he give you any more?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; only last month I asked him for a raise, and he told me if I wasn't satisfied I might go elsewhere.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You didn't?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, but I mean to soon. I will show old Pitkin that he can't keep a man of my experience for such a paltry salary. I dare say that Denning or Claflin would be glad to have me, and pay me what I am worth.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil did not want to laugh, but when Mr. Wilbur, who looked scarcely older than himself, and was in appearance but a callow youth, referred to himself as a man of experience he found it hard to resist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hadn't we better be going up stairs?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right. Follow me,“ said Mr. Wilbur, ”and I'll take you to the superintendent of the room.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am to report to Mr. Pitkin himself, I believe.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He won't be here yet awhile,“ said Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But just then up came Mr. Wilbur himself, fully half an hour earlier than usual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil touched his hat politely, and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good-morning.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good-morning!“ returned his employer, regarding him sharply. ”Are you the boy I hired yesterday?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come up-stairs, then.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil followed Mr. Pitkin up-stairs, and they walked together through the sales-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you understand,“ said Mr. Pitkin brusquely, ”that I have engaged you at the request of Mr. Carter and to oblige him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I feel grateful to Mr. Carter,“ said Phil, not quite knowing what was coming next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shouldn't myself have engaged a boy of whom I knew nothing, and who could give me no city references.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you won't be disappointed in me,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope not,“ answered Mr. Pitkin, in a tone which seemed to imply that he rather expected to be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil began to feel uncomfortable. It seemed evident that whatever he did would be closely scrutinized, and that in an unfavorable spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pitkin paused before a desk at which was standing a stout man with grayish hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Sanderson,“ he said, ”this is the new errand boy. His name is—what is it, boy?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will give him something to do. Has the mail come in?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; we haven't sent to the post-office yet.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may send this boy at once.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Sanderson took from the desk a key and handed it to Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is the key to our box,“ he said. ”Notice the number—534. Open it and bring the mail. Don't loiter on the way.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip took the key and left the warehouse. When he reached the street he said to himself:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wonder where the post-office is?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not like to confess to Mr. Sanderson that he did not know, for it would probably have been considered a disqualification for the post which he was filling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I had better walk to Broadway,“ he said to him self. ”I suppose the post-office must be on the principal street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this Phil was mistaken. At that time the post-office was on Nassau Street, in an old church which had been utilized for a purpose very different from the one to which it had originally been devoted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reaching Broadway, Phil was saluted by a bootblack, with a grimy but honest-looking face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shine your boots, mister?“ said the boy, with a grin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not this morning.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Some other morning, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Sorry you won't give me a job,“ said the bootblack. ”My taxes comes due to-day, and I ain't got enough to pay 'em.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was amused, for his new acquaintance scarcely looked like a heavy taxpayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you pay a big tax?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A thousand dollars or less,“ answered the knight of the brush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I guess it's less,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's where your head's level, young chap.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is the post-office far from here?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Over half a mile, I reckon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it on this street?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, it's on Nassau Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you will show me the way there I'll give you ten cents.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right! The walk'll do me good. Come on!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What's your name?“ asked Phil, who had become interested in his new acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The boys call me Ragged Dick.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was indeed the lively young bootblack whose history was afterward given in a volume which is probably familiar to many of my readers. At this time he was only a bootblack, and had not yet begun to feel the spur of that ambition which led to his subsequent prosperity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a queer name,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I try to live up to it,“ said Dick, with a comical glance at his ragged coat, which had originally been worn by a man six feet in height.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He swung his box over his shoulder, and led the way to the old post-office.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII. MR. LIONEL LAKE AGAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL continued his conversation with Ragged Dick, and was much amused by his quaint way of expressing himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they reached Murray Street, Dick said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Follow me. We'll cut across the City Hall Park. It is the shortest way.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon they reached the shabby old building with which New Yorkers were then obliged to be content with as a post-office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil secured the mail matter for Pitkin &amp; Co., and was just about leaving the office, when he noticed just ahead of him a figure which looked very familiar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It flashed upon him of a sudden that it was his old train acquaintance, Lionel Lake. He immediately hurried forward and touched his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Lake, who had several letters in his hand, started nervously, and turned at the touch. He recognized Phil, but appeared not to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you wish, boy?“ he asked, loftily.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to speak a word with you, Mr. Lake.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are mistaken in the person,“ he said. ”My name is not Lake.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very likely not,“ said Phil significantly, ”but that's what you called yourself when we met on the train.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I repeat, boy, that you are strangely mistaken. My name is“—he paused slightly—”John Montgomery.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just as you please. Whatever your name is, I have a little business with you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't stop. My business is urgent,“ said Lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I will be brief. I lent you five dollars on a ring which I afterward discovered to be stolen. I want you to return that money.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Lake looked about him apprehensively, for he did not wish any one to hear what Phil was saying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You must be crazy!“ he said. ”I never saw you before in the whole course of my life.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shook off Phil's detaining hand, and was about to hurry away, but Phil said resolutely:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can't deceive me, Mr. Lake. Give me that money, or I will call a policeman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, it happened that a policeman was passing just outside, and Lake could see him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is an infamous outrage!“ he said, ”but I have an important appointment, and can't be detained. Take the money. I give it to you in charity.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil gladly received and pocketed the bank-note, and relinquishing his hold of Mr. Lake, rejoined Dick, who had been an interested eye-witness of the interview.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see you've got pluck,“ said Dick. ”What's it all about?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil told him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I ain't a bit s'prised,“ said Dick. ”I could tell by his looks that the man was a skin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, I'm even with him, at any rate,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Now I'll be getting back to the office. Thank you for your guidance. Here's a quarter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You only promised me ten cents.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's worth a quarter. I hope to meet you again.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We'll meet at Astor's next party,“ said Dick, with a grin. ”My invite came yesterday.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mine hasn't come yet,“ said Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Maybe it'll come to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He's a queer chap,“ thought Phil. ”He's fit for something better than blacking boots. I hope he'll have the luck to get it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil had been detained by his interview with Mr. Lake, but he made up for it by extra speed, and reached the warehouse in fair time. After delivering the letters he was sent out on another errand, and during the entire day he was kept busy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving him for the moment we go back to the Pitkin mansion, and listen to &amp; conversation between Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver is getting more and more eccentric every day,“ said the lady. ”He brought home a boy to lunch to-day—some one whom he had picked up in the street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Was the boy's name Philip Brent?“ asked her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I believe so. What do you know about him?“ asked the lady in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have engaged him as errand boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have! What for?“ exclaimed Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I couldn't help it. He brought a letter from your uncle, requesting me to do so, and offering to pay his wages out of his own pocket.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is really getting very serious,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, annoyed. ”Suppose he should take a fancy to this boy?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He appears to have done so already,“ said her husband dryly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I mean, suppose he should adopt him?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are getting on pretty fast, Lavinia, are you not?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Such things happen sometimes,“ said the lady, nodding. ”If it should happen it would be bad for poor Lonny.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Even in that case Lonny won't have to go to the poor-house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin, you don't realize the danger. Here's Uncle Oliver worth a quarter of a million dollars, and it ought to be left to us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Probably it will be.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He may leave it all to this boy. This must be prevented.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You must say the boy doesn't suit you, and discharge him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, well, give me time. I have no objection; but I suspect it will be hard to find any fault with him. He looks like a reliable boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To me he looks like an artful young adventurer,“ said Mrs. Pitkin vehemenntly. ”Depend upon it, Mr. Pitkin, he will spare no pains to ingratiate himself into Uncle Oliver's favor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be seen that Mrs. Pitkin was gifted—if it can be called a gift—with a very suspicious temperament. She was mean and grasping, and could not bear the idea of even a small part of her uncle's money going to any one except her own family. There was, indeed, another whose relationship to Uncle Oliver was as close—a cousin, who had estranged her relatives by marrying a poor bookkeeper, with whom she had gone to Milwaukee. Her name was never mentioned in the Pitkin household, and Mrs. Pitkin, trusting to the distance between them, did not apprehend any danger from this source. Had she known Rebecca Forbush was even now in New York, a widow with one child, struggling to make a living by sewing and taking lodgers, she would have felt less tranquil. But she knew nothing of all this, nor did she dream that the boy whom she dreaded was the very next day to make the acquaintance of this despised relation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the way that it happened:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil soon tired of the room he had taken in Fifth Street. It was not neatly kept, and was far from comfortable. Then again, he found that the restaurants, cheap as they were, were likely to absorb about all his salary, though the bill-of-fare was far from attractive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chance took him through a side-street, between Second and Third Avenues, in the neighborhood of Thirteenth Street,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the three and four-story buildings that lined the block was one frame-house, two-story-and-basement, on which he saw a sign, ”Board for Gentlemen.“ He had seen other similar signs, but his attention was specially drawn to this by seeing a pleasant-looking woman enter the house with the air of proprietor. This woman recalled to Philip his own mother, to whom she bore a striking resemblance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I would like to board with one whose face recalled that of my dear dead mother,“ thought Phil, and on the impulse of the moment, just after the woman had entered, he rang the door-bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened almost immediately by the woman he had just seen enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed to Phil almost as if he were looking into his mother's face, and he inquired in an unsteady voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you take boarders?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ was the answer. ”Won't you step in?“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. PHIL'S NEW HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE HOUSE was poorly furnished with cheap furniture, but there was an unexpected air of neatness about it. There is a great difference between respectable and squalid poverty. It was the first of these that was apparent in the small house in which our hero found himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am looking for a boarding-place,“ said Philip. ”I cannot afford to pay a high price.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And I should not think of asking a high price for such plain accommodations as I can offer,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”What sort of a room do you desire?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A small room will answer.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have a hall-bedroom at the head of the stairs. Will you go up and look at it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should like to do so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Forbush led the way up a narrow staircase, and Philip followed her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opening the door of the small room referred to, she showed a neat bed, a chair, a wash-stand, and a few hooks from which clothing might be hung. It was plain enough, but there was an air of neatness which did not characterize his present room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I like the room,“ he said, brightening up. ”How much do you charge for this room and board?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Four dollars. That includes breakfast and supper,“ answered Mrs. Forbush. ”Lunch you provide for yourself.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That will be satisfactory,“ said Phil. ”I am in a place down town, and I could not come to lunch, at any rate.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When would you like to come, Mr.—?“ said the widow interrogatively.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My name is Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will come some time to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Generally I ask a small payment in advance, as a guarantee that an applicant will really come, but I am sure I can trust you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, but I am quite willing to conform to your usual rule,“ said Phil, as he drew a two-dollar bill from his pocket and handed it to the widow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So they parted, mutually pleased. Phil's week at his present lodging would not be up for several days, but he was tired of it, and felt that he would be much more comfortable with Mrs. Forbush. So he was ready to make the small pecuniary sacrifice needful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conversation which has been recorded took but five minutes, and did not materially delay Phil, who, as I have already said, was absent from the store on an errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Phil became installed at his new boarding-place, and presented himself at supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were three other boarders, two being a young salesman at a Third Avenue store and his wife. They occupied a square room on the same floor with Phil. The other was a female teacher, employed in one of the city public schools. The only remaining room was occupied by a drummer, who was often called away for several days together. This comprised the list of boarders, but Phil's attention was called to a young girl of fourteen, of sweet and attractive appearance, whom he ascertained to be a daughter of Mrs. Forbush. The young lady herself, Julia Forbush, cast frequent glances at Phil, who, being an unusually good-looking boy, would naturally excite the notice of a young girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the whole, it seemed a pleasant and social circle, and Phil felt that he had found a home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day, as he was occupied in the store, next to G. Washington Wilbur, he heard that young man say:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, there's Mr. Carter coming into the store!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Oliver Carter, instead of making his way directly to the office where Mr. Pitkin was sitting, came up to where Phil was at work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How are you getting along, my young friend?“ he asked familiarly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you find your duties very fatiguing?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, no, sir. I have a comfortable time.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's right. Work cheerfully and you will win the good opinion of your employer. Don't forget to come up and see me soon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You seem to be pretty solid with the old man,“ remarked Mr. Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are on very good terms,“ answered Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish you had introduced him to me,“ said Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't you know him?“ asked Phil, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He doesn't often come to the store, and when he does he generally goes at once to the office, and the clerks don't have a chance to get acquainted.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should hardly like to take the liberty, then,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, keep him to yourself, then, if you want to,“ said Mr. Wilbur, evidently annoyed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't care to do that. I shall be entirely willing to introduce you when there is a good chance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed to appease Mr. Wilbur, who became once more gracious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip,“ he said, as the hour of closing approached, ”why can't you come around and call upon me this evening?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I will,“ answered Phil readily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed, he found it rather hard to fill up his evenings, and was glad to have a way suggested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do. I want to tell you a secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where do you live?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No.—East Twenty-second Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right. I will come round about half-past seven.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Wilbur lived in a larger house than he, Phil did not like his room as well. There being only one chair in the room, Mr. Wilbur put his visitor in it, and himself sat on the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something of a mystery in the young man's manner as, after clearing his throat, he said to Phil:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to tell you a secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil's curiosity was somewhat stirred, and he signified that he would like to hear it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have for some time wanted a confidant,“ said Mr. Wilbur. ”I did not wish to trust a mere acquaintance, for—ahem!—the matter is quite a delicate one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil regarded him with increased interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am flattered by your selecting me,“ said he. ”I will keep your secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Phil,“ said Mr. Wilbur, in a tragic tone, ”you may be surprised to hear that I am in LOVE!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil started and wanted to laugh, but Mr. Wilbur's serious, earnest look restrained him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ain't you rather young?“ he ventured to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I am nineteen,“ answered Mr. Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The heart makes no account of years.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whether this was original or borrowed, Phil could not tell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you been in love long?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Three weeks.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Does the lady know it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not yet,“ returned Mr. Wilbur. ”I have worshiped her from afar. I have never even spoken to her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then the matter hasn't gone very far?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, not yet.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where did you meet her first?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In a Broadway stage.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is her name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't know much about her, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; I know where she lives.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”On Lexington Avenue.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Whereabouts?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Between Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth Streets. Would you like to see her house?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil, who saw that Mr. Wilbur wished him so to answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then come out. We might see her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys—for Mr. Wilbur, though he considered himself a young man of large experience, was really scarcely more than a boy—bent their steps to Lexington Avenue, and walked in a northerly direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had reached Twenty-eighth Street, when the door of house farther up on the avenue was opened and a lady came out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's she!“ ejaculated Mr. Wilbur, clutching Phil by the arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil looked, and saw a tall young lady, three or four inches taller than his friend and as many years older. He looked at his companion with surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is that the young lady you are in love with?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; isn't she a daisy?“ asked the lover fervently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am not much of a judge of daisies,' answered Phil, a little embarrassed, for the young lady had large features, and was, in his eyes, very far from pretty.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV. CONSULTING THE ORACLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL did not like to hurt the feelings of his companion, and refrained from laughing, though with difficulty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She doesn't appear to know you,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ said Wilbur; ”I haven't had a chance to make myself known to her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think you can make a favorable impression upon—the daisy?“ asked Phil, outwardly sober, but inwardly amused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I always had a taking way with girls,“ replied Mr. Wilbur complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil coughed. It was all that saved him from laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While he was struggling with the inclination, the lady inadvertently dropped a small parcel which she had been carrying in her hand. The two boys were close behind. Like an arrow from the bow Mr. Wilbur sprang forward, picked up the parcel, and while his heart beat wildly, said, as he tendered it to the owner, with a graceful bow and captivating smile:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Miss, I believe you dropped this.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, my good boy,“ answered the daisy pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur staggered back as if he had been struck. He fell back in discomfiture, and his face showed the mortification and anguish he felt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you hear what she said?“ he asked, in a hollow voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She called you a boy, didn't she?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Mr. Wilbur sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps she may be near-sighted,“ said Phil consolingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think so?“ asked Mr. Wilbur hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is quite possible. Then you are short, you know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it must be so,“ said G. Washington Wilbur, his face more serene. ”If she hadn't been she would have noticed my mustache.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”True.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She spoke kindly. If—if she had seen how old I was, it would have been different, don't you think so?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, no doubt.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There is only one thing to do,“ said Mr. Wilbur, in a tone of calm resolve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is that?“ inquired Phil, in some curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I must wear a stove-pipe hat! As you say, I am small, and a near-sighted person might easily suppose me to be younger than I am. Now, with a stove-pipe hat I shall look much older.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I presume so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I can make her acquaintance again, and she will not mistake me. Phil, why don't you wear a stove-pipe?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Because I don't want to look any older than I am. Besides, an errand-boy wouldn't look well in a tall hat.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, perhaps not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And Mr. Pitkin would hardly like it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course. When you are a salesman like me it will be different.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur was beginning to recover his complacency, which had been so rudely disturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose you wouldn't think of marrying on your present salary?“ said Phil. ”Six dollars a week wouldn't support a married pair very well.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The firm would raise my salary. They always do when a man marries. Besides, I have other resources.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Indeed?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; I am worth two thousand dollars. It was left me by an aunt, and is kept in trust for me until I am twenty-one. I receive the interest now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I congratulate you,“ said Phil, who was really pleased to hear of his companion's good fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That money will come in handy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Besides, I expect she's got money,“ continued Mr. Wilbur. ”Of course, I love her for herself alone—I am not mercenary—still, it will be a help when we are married.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So it will,“ said Phil, amused at the confident manner in which Mr. Wilbur spoke of marriage with a lady of whom he knew absolutely nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip,“ said Mr. Wilbur, ”when I marry, I want you to stand up with me—to be my groomsman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If I am in the city, and can afford to buy a dress-suit, I might consent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you. You are a true friend!“ said Mr. Wilbur, squeezing his hand fervently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two returned to Mr. Wilbur's room and had a chat. At an early hour Phil returned to his own boarding-place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As time passed on, Phil and Wilbur spent considerable time together out of the store. Mr. G. Washington Wilbur, apart from his amusing traits, was a youth of good principles and good disposition, and Phil was glad of his company. Sometimes they went to cheap amusements, but not often, for neither had money to spare for such purposes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some weeks after Phil's entrance upon his duties Mr. Wilbur made a proposal to Phil of a startling nature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Suppose we have our fortunes told, Phil?“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If it would help my fortune, or hurry it up, I shouldn't object,“ said Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to know what fate has in store for me,“ said Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think the fortune-tellers know any better than you do?“ asked Phil incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They tell some strange things,“ said Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What, for instance?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”An aunt of mine went to a fortune-teller and asked if she would ever be married, and when? She was told that she would be married before she was twenty-two, to a tall, light-complexioned man.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did it come true?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, every word,“ said Mr. Wilbur solemnly. ”She was married three months before her twenty-second birthday, and her husband was just the kind of man that was predicted. Wasn't that strange?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The fortune-teller might easily have guessed all that. Most girls are married as young as that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But not to tall, light-complexioned men!“ said Wilbur triumphantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is there anything you wish particularly to know?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should like to know if I am going to marry— you know who.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The daisy?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was not much in favor of the scheme, but finally agreed to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a certain ”Veiled Lady,“ who advertised her qualifications in the Herald , as the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, and therefore gifted with the power to read the future. Mr. Wilbur made choice of her, and together they went to call upon her one evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were shown into an anteroom, and in due time Mr. Wilbur was called into the dread presence. He was somewhat nervous and agitated, but ”braced up,“ as he afterward expressed it, and went in. He wanted Phil to go in with him, but the attendant said that madam would not allow it, and he went forward alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fifteen minutes afterward he re-entered the room with a radiant face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you heard good news?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur nodded emphatically and whispered, for there were two others in waiting:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's all right. I am to marry her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did the fortune-teller say so?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did she give her name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, but she described her so that I knew her at once.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will it be soon?“ asked Phil slyly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not till I am twenty-four,“ answered Mr. Wilbur soberly. ”But perhaps she may be mistaken about that. Perhaps she thought I was older than I am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you doubt her knowledge, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; at any rate, I can wait, since she is to be mine at last. Besides, I am to be rich. When I am thirty years old I am to be worth twenty thousand dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I congratulate you, Wilbur,“ said Phil, smiling. ”You are all right, at least,“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The next gentleman!“ said the attendant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil entered the inner room, and looked about him in curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A tall woman sat upon a sort of throne, with one hand resting on a table beside her. A tall wax-taper supplied the place of the light of day, which was studiously excluded from the room by thick, dark curtains. Over the woman's face was a black veil, which gave her an air of mystery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come hither, boy!“ she said, in a clear, commanding voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil advanced, not wholly unimpressed, though he felt skeptical.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman bent forward, starting slightly and scanned his face eagerly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV. PHIL AND THE FORTUNE-TELLER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DO YOU wish to hear of the past or the future?“ asked the fortune-teller.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Tell me something of the past,“ said Phil, with a view of testing the knowledge of the seeress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have left an uncongenial home to seek your fortune in New York. You left without regret, and those whom you have left behind do not miss you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil started in amazement. This was certainly true.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shall I find the fortune I seek?“ asked our hero earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, but not in the way you expect. You think yourself alone in the world!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fortune-teller paused, and looked searchingly at the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I am,“ returned Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No boy who has a father living can consider himself alone.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My father is dead!“ returned Phil, growing skeptical.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are mistaken.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am not likely to be mistaken in such a matter. My father died a few months since.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your father still lives!“ said the fortune-teller sharply. ”Do not contradict me!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't see how you can say that. I attended his funeral.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You attended the funeral of the man whose name you bear. He was not your father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was much excited by this confirmation of his step-mother's story. He had entertained serious doubts of its being true, thinking it might have been trumped up by Mrs. Brent to drive him from home, and interfere with his succession to any part of Mr. Brent's property.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is my step-mother's story true, then?“ he asked breathlessly. ”She told me I was not the son of Mr. Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Her story was true,“ said the veiled lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who is my real father, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lady did not immediately reply. She seemed to be peering into distant space, as she said slowly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see a man of middle size, dark-complexioned, leading a small child by the hand. He pauses before a house—it looks like an inn. A lady comes out from the inn. She is kindly of aspect. She takes the child by the hand and leads him into the inn. Now I see the man go away—alone. The little child remains behind. I see him growing up. He has become a large boy, but the scene has changed. The inn has disappeared. I see a pleasant village and a comfortable house. The boy stands at the door. He is well-grown now. A lady stands on the threshold as his steps turn away. She is thin and sharp-faced. She is not like the lady who welcomed the little child. Can you tell me who this boy is?“ asked the fortune-teller, fixing her eyes upon Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is myself!“ he answers, his flushed face showing the excitement he felt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have said!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know how you have learned all this,“ said Phil, ”but it is wonderfully exact. Will you answer a question?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ask!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You say my father—my real father—is living?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The veiled lady bowed her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where is he?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That I cannot say, but he is looking for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is in search of me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why has he delayed it so long?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There are circumstances which I cannot explain which have prevented his seeking and claiming you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will he do so?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have told you that he is now seeking for you. I think he will find you at last.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What can I do to bring this about?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do nothing! Stay where you are. Circumstances are working favorably, but you must wait.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are some drawbacks.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are they?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have two enemies, or rather one, for the other does not count.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is that enemy a man?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, it is a woman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My step-mother!“ ejaculated Phil, with immediate conviction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have guessed aright.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And who is the other?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is the son of the woman whom you call your step-mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What harm can they do me? I am not afraid of them,“ said Phil, raising his head proudly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do not be too confident! The meanest are capable of harm. Mrs. Brent does not like you because she is a mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She fears that I will interfere with her son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are all right.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is there anything more you can tell me?“ asked Phil. ”Have I any other enemies?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; there are two more—also a woman and her son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That puzzles me. I can think of no one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They live in the city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know. It is Mrs. Pitkin, my employer's wife. Why should she dislike me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There is an old man who likes you. That is the cause.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see. She doesn't want him to be kind to any one out of the family.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is all I have to tell you,“ said the fortune-teller abruptly. ”You can go.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have told me strange things,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you tell me how it is you know so much about a stranger?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have nothing more to tell you. You can go!“ said the veiled lady impatiently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At least tell me how much I am to pay you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Nothing.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But I thought you received fees.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not from you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you not take something from my friend who was in here before me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You told him a good fortune.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is a fool!“ said the fortune-teller contemptuously. ”I saw what he wanted and predicted it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She waved her hand, and Phil felt that he had no excuse for remaining longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He left the room slowly, and found Mr. Wilbnr anxiously awaiting him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What did she tell you, Phil?“ he asked eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did she tell you what sort of a wife you would have?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No. I didn't ask her,“ answered Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should think you'd want to know. What did she tell you, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She told me quite a number of things about my past life and the events of my childhood.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shouldn't have cared about that,“ said Wilbur, shrugging his shoulders. ”Why, I know all about that myself. What I want to know about is, whether I am to marry the girl I adore.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But you see, Wilbur, I don't adore anybody. I am not in love as you are.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course that makes a difference,“ said Wilbur. ”I'm glad I came, Phil. Ain't you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You see, it's such a satisfaction to know that all is coming right at last. I am to marry her , you know, and although it isn't till I am twenty-four—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She will be nearly thirty by that time,“ said Phil slyly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She won't look it!“ said Mr. Wilbur, wincing a little. ”When I am thirty I shall be worth twenty thousand dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can't save it very soon out of six dollars a week.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is true. I feel sure I shall be raised soon. Did the fortune-teller say anythimg about your getting rich?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No. I can't remember that she did. Oh, yes! she said I would make my fortune, but not in the way I expected.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is queer!“ said Mr. Wilbur, interested. ”What could she mean?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose she meant that I would not save a competence out of five dollars a week.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Maybe so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have been thinking, Wilbur, you have an advantage over the young lady you are to marry. You know that you are to marry her, but she doesn't know who is to be her husband.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is true,“ said Wilbur seriously. ”If I can find out her name, I will write her an anonymous letter, asking her to call on the veiled Lady.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI. MRS. BRENT'S STRANGE TEMPTATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOW THAT Phil is fairly established in the city, circumstances require us to go back to the country town which he had once called home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent is sitting, engaged with her needle, in the same room where she had made the important revelation to Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas entered the house, stamping the snow from his boots.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is supper most ready, mother?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Jonas; it is only four o'clock,“ replied Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'm as hungry as a bear. I guess it's the skating.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish you would go to the post-office before supper, Jonas. There might be a letter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you expect to hear from Phil?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He said nothing about writing,“ said Mrs. Brent indifferently. ”He will do as he pleases about it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I did't know but he would be writing for money,“ chuckled Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If he did, I would send him some,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You would!“ repeated Jonas, looking at his mother in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I would send him a dollar or two, so that people needn't talk. It is always best to avoid gossip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you expecting a letter from anybody, mother?“ asked Jonas, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I dreamed last night I should receive an important letter,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”With money in it?“ asked Jonas eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If any such letter comes, will you give me some of the money?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you bring me a letter containing money,“ said Mrs. Brent, ”I will give you a dollar.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Enough said!“ exclaimed Jonas, who was fond of money; ”I'm off to the post-office at once.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent let the work fall into her lap and looked intently before her. A flush appeared on her pale face, and she showed signs of restlessness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is strange,“ she said to herself, ”how I have allowed myself to be affected by that dream. I am not superstitious, but I cannot get over the idea that a letter will reach me to-night, and that it will have an important bearing upon my life. I have a feeling, too, that it will relate to the boy Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose from her seat and began to move about the room. It was a, relief to her in the restless state of her mind. She went to the window to look for Jonas, and her excitement rose as she saw him approaching. When he saw his mother looking from the window, he held aloft a letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The letter has come,“ she said, her heart beating faster than its wont. ”It is an important letter. How slow Jonas is.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And she was inclined to be vexed at the deliberation with which her son was advancing toward the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But he came at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, mother, I've got a letter—a letter from Philadelphia,“ he said. ”It isn't from Phil, for I know his writing.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Give it to me, Jonas,“ said his mother, outwardly calm, but inwardly excited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know any one in Philadelphia, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She cut open the envelope and withdrew the inclosed sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is there any money in it?“ asked Jonas eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just my luck!“ said Jonas sullenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Wait a minute,“ said his mother. ”If the letter is really important, I'll give you twenty-five cents.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She read the letter, and her manner soon showed that she was deeply interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We will look over her shoulders and read it with her: ”CONTINENTAL HOTEL, PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 5. ”DEAR MADAM:—I write to you on a matter of the greatest importance to my happiness, and shall most anxiously await your reply. I would come to you in person, but am laid up with an attack of rheumatism, and my physician forbids me to travel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are, as I have been informed, the widow of Gerald Brent, who thirteen years since kept a small hotel in the small village of Fultonville, in Ohio. At that date I one day registered myself as his guest. I was not alone. My only son, then a boy of three, accompanied me. My wife was dead, and my affections centered upon this child. Yet the next morning I left him under the charge of yourself and your husband, and pursued my journey. From that day to this I have not seen the boy, nor have I written to you or Mr. Brent. This seems strange, does it not? It requires an explanation, and that explanation I am ready to give.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To be brief, then, I was fleeing from undeserved suspicion. Circumstances which a need not detail had connected my name with the mysterious disappearance of a near friend, and the fact that a trifling dispute between us had taken place in the presence of witnesses had strengthened their suspicions. Knowing myself to be innocent, but unable to prove it, I fled, taking my child with me. When I reached Fultonville, I became alive to the ease with which I might be traced, through the child's companionship. There was no resource but to leave him. Your husband and yourself impressed me as kind and warm-hearted. I was specially impressed by the gentleness with which you treated my little Philip, and I felt that to you I could safely trust him. I did not, however, dare to confide my secret to any one. I simply said I would leave the boy with you till he should recover from his temporary indisposition, and then, with outward calmness but inward anguish, I left my darling, knowing not if I should ever see him again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, time passed. I went to Nevada, changed my name, invested the slender sum I had with me in mining, and, after varying fortune, made a large fortune at last. But better fortune still awaited me. In a poor mining hut, two months since, I came across a man who confessed that he was guilty of the murder of which I had been suspected. His confession was reduced in writing, sworn to before a magistrate, and now at last I feel myself a free man. No one now could charge me with a crime from which my soul revolted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When this matter was concluded, my first thought was of the boy whom I had not seen for thirteen long years. I could claim him now before all the world; I could endow him with the gifts of fortune; I could bring him up in luxury, and I could satisfy a father's affectionate longing. I could not immediately ascertain where you were. I wrote to Fultonville, to the postmaster, and learned that you and Mr. Brent had moved away and settled down in Gresham, in the State of New York. I learned also that my Philip was still living, but other details I did not learn. But I cared not, so long as my boy still lived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And now you may guess my wish and my intention. I shall pay you handsomely for your kind care of Philip, but I must have my boy back again. We have been separated too long. I can well understand that you are attached to him, and I will find a home for you and Mr. Brent near my own, where you can see as often as you like the boy whom you have so tenderly reared. Will you do me the favor to come at once, and bring the boy with you? The expenses of your journey shall, of course, be reimbursed, and I will take care that the pecuniary part of my obligations to you shall be amply repaid. I have already explained why I cannot come in person to claim my dear child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Telegraph to me when you will reach Philadelphia, and I will engage a room for you. Philip will stay with me. Yours gratefully, ”OSCAR GRANVILLE.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mother, here is a slip of paper that has dropped from the letter,“ said Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He picked up and handed to his mother a check on a Philadelphia bank for the sum of one hundred dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, that's the same as money, isn't it?“ asked Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you'll keep your promise, won't you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent silently drew from her pocket-book a two-dollar bill and handed it to Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas,“ she said, ”if you won't breathe a word of it, I will tell you a secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right, mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We start for Philadelphia to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By gosh! that's jolly,“ exclaimed Jonas, overjoyed. ”I'll keep mum. What was in the letter, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will not tell you just now. You shall know very soon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent did not sleep much that night. Her mind was intent upon a daring scheme of imposture. Mr. Granville was immensely wealthy, no doubt. Why should she not pass off Jonas upon him as his son Philip, and thus secure a fortune for her own child?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII. JONAS JOINS THE CONSPIRACY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LATER in the evening Mrs. Brent took Jonas into her confidence. She was a silent, secretive woman by nature, and could her plan have been carried out without imparting it to any one, she would gladly have had it so. But Jonas must be her active accomplice, and it was as well to let him know at once what he must do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the evening, when Jonas, tired with his day's skating, was lying on the lounge, Mrs. Brent rose deliberately from her seat, peeped into the adjoining room, then went to each window to make sure there was no eavesdropper, then resumed her seat and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas, get up. I want to speak to you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am awfully tired, mother. I can hear you while I lie here.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas, do you hear me? I am about to speak to you of something no other person must hear. Get a chair and draw it close to mine.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas rose, his curiosity stimulated by his mother's words and manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it about the letter, mother?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it relates to the letter and our journey to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas had wondered what the letter was about and who had sent his mother the hundred-dollar check, and he made no further objection. He drew a chair in front of his mother and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Go ahead, mother, I'm listening.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you like to be rich, Jonas?“ asked Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Wouldn't I?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you like to be adopted by a very rich man, have a pony to ride, plenty of pocket-money, fine clothes and in the end a large fortune?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That would just suit me, mother,“ answered the boy eagerly. ”Is there any chance of it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, if you follow my directions implicitly.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will, mother,“ said Jonas, his eyes shining with desire. ”Only tell me what to do and I'll do it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you remember what I told Philip the evening before he went away?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”About his being left at Mr. Brent's hotel? Yes, I remember it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And about his true father having disappeared?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas, the letter I received this afternoon was from Philip's real father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By gosh!“ ejaculated Jonas, altering his usual expression of surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is in Philadelphia. He is a very rich man.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then Phil will be rich,“ said Jonas, disappointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I thought you said it would be me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip's father has never seen him since he was three years old,“ continued Mrs. Brent, taking no notice of her son's tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What difference does that make, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas,“ said Mrs. Brent, bending toward her son, ”if I choose to tell him that you are Philip, he won't know the difference. Do you understand?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas did understand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a bully idea, mother! Can we pull the wool over the old man's eyes, do you think?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish you would not use such expressions, Jonas. They are not gentlemanly, and you are to be a young gentleman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right, mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We can manage it if you are very careful. It is worth the trouble, Jonas. I think Mr. Granville— that is his name—must be worth a quarter of a million dollars, and if he takes you for Philip the whole will probably go to you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What a head you've got, mother!“ exclaimed Jonas admiringly. ”It is a tip-top chance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it is one chance in ten thousand. But you must do just as I tell you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, I'll do that, mother. What must I do?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To begin with, you must take Philip's name. You must remember that you are no longer Jonas Webb, but Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That'll be a bully joke!“ said Jonas, very much amused. ”What would Phil say if he knew I had taken his name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He must not know. Henceforth we must endeavor to keep out of his way. Again, you must consider me your step-mother, not your own mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I understand. What are you going to do first, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We start for Philadelphia to-morrow. Your father is lying sick at the Continental Hotel.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas roared with delight at the manner in which his mother spoke of the sick stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, it'll be fun, mother! Shall we live in Philadelphia?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. That will be as Mr. Granville thinks best.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where are you going, mother? Are you going to live here?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course I shall be with you. I will make that a condition. I cannot be parted from my only boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But I shall be Mr. Granville's boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To the public you will be. But when we are together in private, we shall be once more mother and son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am afraid you will spoil all,“ said Jonas. ”Old Granville will suspect something if you seem to care too much for me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The selfish nature of Jonas was cropping out, and his mother felt, with a pang, that he would be reconciled to part with her forever for the sake of the brilliant prospects and the large fortune which Mr. Granville could offer him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was outwardly cold, but such affection as she was capable of she expended on this graceless and ungrateful boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You seem to forget that I may have some feeling in the matter,“ said Mrs. Brent coldly, but with inward pain. ”If the result of this plan were to be that we should be permanently separated, I would never consent to it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just as you like, mother,“ said Jonas, with an ill grace. ”I don't look much like Phil.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, there will be a difficulty. Still Mr. Granville has never seen Philip since he was three years old, and that is in our favor. He thinks I am Mr. Brent's first wife.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shall you tell him?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. I will be guided by circumstances. Perhaps it may be best. I wouldn't like to have it discovered that I had deceived him in that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How are you going to manage about this place, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to write to your Uncle Jonas to take charge of it. I will let him have it at a nominal rent. Then, if our plan miscarries we shall have a place to come back to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Were you ever in Philadelphia, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; but there will be no trouble in journeying there. I shall pack your clothes and my own to-night. Of course, Jonas, when you meet Mr. Granville you must seem to be fond of him. Then you must tell him how kind I have been to you. In fact, you must act precisely as Philip might be expected to do.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, mother; and you must be careful not to call me Jonas. That will spoil all, you know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Rest assured that I shall be on my guard. If you are as careful as I am, Philip—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas burst into a guffaw at the new name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's just like play-acting, mother,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But it will pay better,“ said Mrs. Brent quietly. ”I think it will be best for me to begin calling you Philip at once—that is, as soon as we have left town—so that we may both get accustomed to it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right, mother. You've got a good headpiece.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will manage things properly. If you consent to be guided by me, all will be right.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, I'll do it mother. I wish we were on our way.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can go to bed if you like. I must stay up late to-night. I have to pack our trunks.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day the pair of adventurers left Gresham. From the earliest available point Mrs. Brent telegraphed to Mr. Granville that she was on her way, with the son from whom he had so long been separated.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII. THE CONSPIRACY SUCCEEDS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN A HANDSOME private parlor at the Continental Hotel a man of about forty-five years of age sat in an easy-chair. He was of middle height, rather dark complexion, and a pleasant expression. His right foot was bandaged, and rested on a chair. The morning Daily Ledger was in his hand, but he was not reading. His mind, judging from his absorbed look, was occupied with other thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can hardly realize,“ he said half-aloud, ”that my boy will so soon be restored to my arms. We have been separated by a cruel fate, but we shall soon be together again. I remember how the dear child looked when I left him at Fultonville in the care of the kind inn-keeper. I am sorry he is dead, but his widow shall be suitably repaid for her kind devotion.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had reached this point when a knock was heard at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come in!“ said Mr. Granville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A servant of the hotel appeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A lady and a boy are in the parlor below, sir. They wish to see you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Mr. Granville had considerable control over his feelings, his heart beat fast when he heard these words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you show them up at once?“ he said, in a tone which showed some trace of agitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The servant bore the message to Mrs. Brent and Jonas, who were sitting in the hotel parlor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If Mr. Granville was agitated, the two conspirators were not wholly at their ease. There was a red spot on each of Mrs. Brent's cheeks—her way of expressing emotion—and Jonas was fidgeting about uneasily in his chair, staring about him curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mind what I told you,“ said his mother, in a low voice. ”Remember to act like a boy who has suddenly been restored to his long-lost father. Everything depends on first impressions.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish it was all over; I wish I was out of it,“ said Jonas, wiping the perspiration from his face. ”Suppose he suspects?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He won't if you do as I tell you. Don't look gawky, but act naturally.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then the servant reappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are to come up-stairs,“ he said. ”The gentleman will see you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you,“ said Mrs. Brent, rising. ”Come, Jonas rose, and with the manner of a cur that expected a whipping, followed his mother and the servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's only one flight,“ said the servant, ”but we can take the elevator.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is of no consequence,“ Mrs. Brent began, but Jonas said eagerly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Let's ride on the elevator, ma!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, Philip,“ said Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A minute later the two stood at the door of Mr. Granville's room. Next they stood in his presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Granville, looking eagerly toward the door, passed over Mrs. Brent, and his glance rested on the boy who followed her. He started, and there was a quick feeling of disappointment. He had been picturing to himself how his lost boy would look, but none of his visions resembled the awkward-looking boy who stood sheepishly by the side of Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Granville, I presume,“ said the lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, madam. You are—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent, and this,“ pointing to Jonas, ”is the boy you left at Fultonville thirteen years ago. Philip, go to your father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas advanced awkwardly to Mr. Granville's chair, and said in parrot-like tones:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'm so glad to see you, pa!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you are really Philip?“ said Mr. Granville slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I'm Philip Brent; but I suppose my name is Granville now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come here, my boy!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Granville drew the boy to him, and looked earnestly in his face, then kissed him affectionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He has changed since he was a little child, Mrs. Brent,“ he said, with a half-sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's to be expected, sir. He was only three years old when you left him with us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But it seems to me that his hair and complexion are lighter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can judge of that better than I,“ said Mrs. Brent plausibly. ”To me, who have seen him daily, the change was not perceptible.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am greatly indebted to you for your devoted care—to you and your husband. I am grieved to hear that Mr. Brent is dead.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; he left me six months since. It was a grievous loss. Ah, sir, when I give up Philip also, I shall feel quite alone in the world,“ and she pressed a handkerchief to her eyes. ”You see, I have come to look upon him as my own boy!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My dear madam, don't think that I shall be so cruel as to take him from you. Though I wish him now to live with me, you must accompany him. My home shall be yours if you are willing to accept a room in my house and a seat at my table.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Mr. Granville, how can I thank you for your great kindness? Ever since I received your letter I have been depressed with the thought that I should lose dear Philip. If I had a child of my own it would be different; but, having none, my affections are centered upon him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And very naturally,“ said Mr. Granville. ”We become attached to those whom we benefit. Doubtless he feels a like affection for you. You love this good lady, Philip, who has supplied to you the place of your own mother, who died in your infancy, do you not?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Jonas stolidly. ”But I want to live with my pa!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To be sure you shall. My boy, we have been separated too long already. Henceforth we will live together, and Mrs. Brent shall live with us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where do you live, pa?“ asked Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have a country-seat a few miles from Chicago,“ answered Mr. Granville. ”We will go there as soon as I am well enough. I ought to apologize, Mrs. Brent, for inviting you up to my room, but my rheumatism makes me a prisoner.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope your rheumatism will soon leave you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think it will. I have an excellent physician, and already I am much better. I may, however, have to remain here a few days yet.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And where do you wish Philip and I to remain in the meantime?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Here, of course. Philip, will you ring the bell?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't see any bell,“ answered Jonas, bewildered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Touch that knob!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas did so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will that ring the bell?“ he asked curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it is an electric bell.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By gosh!“ ejaculated Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't use such language, Philip!“ said Mrs. Brent hastily. ”Your father will be shocked. You see, Mr. Granville, Philip has associated with country boys, and in spite of my care, he has adopted some of their language.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Granville himself was rather disturbed by this countrified utterance, and it occurred to him that his new-found son needed considerable polishing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ah, I quite understand that, Mrs. Brent,“ he said courteously. ”He is young yet, and there will be plenty of time for him to get rid of any objectionable habits and phrases.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the servant appeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Tell the clerk to assign this lady and the boy rooms on this floor if any are vacant. Mrs. Brent, Philip may have a room next to you for the present. When I am better I will have him with me. John, is dinner on the table?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then, after taking possession of your rooms, you and Philip had better go to dinner. I will send for him later.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Mrs. Brent was ushered into her handsome apartment her face was radiant with joy and exultation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All has gone well!“ she said. ”The most difficult part is over.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX. A NARROW ESCAPE FROM DETECTION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CONSPIRACY into which Mrs. Brent had entered was a daring one, and required great coolness and audacity. But the inducements were great, and for her son's sake she decided to carry it through. Of course it was necessary that she should not be identified with any one who could disclose to Mr. Granville the deceit that was being practiced upon him. Circumstances lessened the risk of detection, since Mr. Granville was confined to his room in the hotel, and for a week she and Jonas went about the city alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day she had a scare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was occupying a seat in a Chestnut Street car, while Jonas stood in front with the driver, when a gentleman whom she had not observed, sitting at the other end of the car, espied her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, Mrs. Brent, how came you here?“ he asked, in surprise, crossing over and taking a seat beside her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her color went and came as, in a subdued tone, she answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am in Philadelphia on a little visit, Mr. Pearson.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you not rather out of your latitude?“ asked the gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, perhaps so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How is Mr. Brent?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you not hear that he was dead?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, indeed! I sympathize with you in your sad loss.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ sighed the widow. ”It is a great loss to us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose Jonas is a large boy now,“ said the other. ”I haven't seen him for two or three years.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, he has grown,“ said the widow briefly. She hoped that Mr. Pearson would not discover that Jonas was with her, as she feared that the boy might betray them unconsciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is he with you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you stay long in Philadelphia?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I think not,“ answered Mrs. Brent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I go back to New York this afternoon, or I would ask permission to call on you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent breathed more freely. A call at the hotel was by all means to be avoided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course I should have been glad to see you, she answered, feeling quite safe in saying so. ”Are you going far?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I get out at Thirteenth Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank Heaven!“ said Mrs. Brent to herself. ”Then he won't discover where we are.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Continental Hotel is situated at the corner of Chestnut and Ninth Streets, and Mrs. Brent feared that Jonas would stop the car at that point. As it was, the boy did not observe that his mother had met an acquaintance, so intent was he on watching the street sights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they reached Ninth Street mother and son got out and entered the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I guess I'll stay down stairs awhile,“ said Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Philip, I have something to say to you. Come up with me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to go into the billiard-room,“ said Jonas, grumbling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is very important,“ said Mrs. Brent emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now the curiosity of Jonas was excited, and he followed his mother into the elevator, for their rooms were on the third floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, mother, what is it?“ asked Jonas, when the door of his mother's room was closed behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I met a gentleman who knew me in the horse-car,“ said Mrs. Brent abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you? Who was it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pearson.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He used to give me candy. Why didn't you call me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is important that we should not be recognized,“ said his mother. ”While we stay here we must be exceedingly prudent. Suppose he had called upon us at the hotel and fallen in with Mr. Granville. He might have told him that you are my son, and that your name is Jonas, not Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then the fat would be in the fire!“ said Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Exactly so; I am glad you see the danger. Now I want you to stay here, or in your own room, for the next two or three hours.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It'll be awfully tiresome,“ grumbled Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is necessary,“ said his mother firmly. ”Mr. Pearson leaves for New York by an afternoon train. It is now only two o'clock. He left the car at Thirteenth Street, and might easily call at this hotel. It is a general rendezvous for visitors to the city. If he should meet you down stairs, he would probably know you, and his curiosity would be aroused. He asked me where I was staying, but I didn't appear to hear the question.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's pretty hard on me, ma.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am out of all patience with you,“ said Mrs. Brent. ”Am I not working for your interest, and you are doing all you can to thwart my plans. If you don't care anything about inheriting a large fortune, let it go! We can go back to Gresham and give it all up.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'll do as you say, ma,“ said Jonas, subdued.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The very next day Mr. Granville sent for Mrs. Brent. She lost no time in waiting upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent,“ he said, ”I have decided to leave Philadelphia to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you quite able, sir?“ she asked, with a good assumption of sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My doctor tells me I may venture. We shall travel in Pullman cars, you know. I shall secure a whole compartment, and avail myself of every comfort and luxury which money can command.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ah, sir! money is a good friend in such a case.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”True, Mrs. Brent. I have seen the time when I was poorly supplied with it. Now I am happily at ease. Can you and Philip be ready?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, Mr. Granville,“ answered Mrs. Brent promptly. ”We are ready to-day, for that matter. We shall both be glad to get started.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad to hear it. I think Philip will like his Western home. I bought a fine country estate of a Chicago merchant, whose failure compelled him to part with it. Philip shall have his own horse and his own servants.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He will be delighted,“ said Mrs. Brent warmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He has been used to none of these things, for Mr. Brent and I, much as we loved him, had not the means to provide him with such luxuries.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, Mrs. Brent, I understand that fully. You were far from rich. Yet you cared for my boy as if he were your own.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I loved him as much as if he had been my own son, Mr. Granville.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sure you did. I thank Providence that I am able to repay to some extent the great debt I have incurred. I cannot repay it wholly, but I will take care that you, too, shall enjoy ease and luxury. You shall have one of the best rooms in my house, and a special servant to wait upon you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, Mr. Granville,“ said Mrs. Brent, her heart filled with proud anticipations of the state in which she should hereafter live. ”I do not care where you put me, so long as you do not separate me from Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She certainly loves my son!“ said Mr. Granville to himself. ”Yet her ordinary manner is cold and constrained, and she does not seem like a woman whose affections would easily be taken captive. Yet Philip seems to have found the way to her heart. It must be because she has had so much care of him. We are apt to love those whom we benefit.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But though Mr. Granville credited Mrs. Brent with an affection for Philip, he was uneasily conscious that the boy's return had not brought him the satisfaction and happiness he had fondly anticipated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To begin with, Philip did not look at all as he had supposed his son would look. He did not look like the Granvilles at all. Indeed, he had an unusually countrified aspect, and his conversation was mingled with rustic phrases which shocked his father's taste.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose it comes of the way in which he has been brought up and the country boys he has associated with,“ thought Mr. Granville. ”Fortunately he is young, and there is time to polish him. As soon as I reach Chicago I will engage a private tutor for him, who shall not only remedy his defects of education, but do what he can to improve my son's manners. I want him to grow up a gentleman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day the three started for Chicago, while Mr. Granville's real son and heir continued to live at a cheap lodging-house in New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The star of Jonas was in the ascendant, while poor Philip seemed destined to years of poverty and hard work. Even now, he was threatened by serious misfortune.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX. LEFT OUT IN THE COLD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OF COURSE Phil was utterly ignorant of the audacious attempt to deprive him of his rights and keep him apart from the father who longed once more to meet him. There was nothing before him so far as he knew except to continue the up-hill struggle for a living.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gave very little thought to the prediction of the fortune-teller whom he had consulted, and didn't dream of any short-cut to fortune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do all he could, he found he could not live on his wages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His board cost him four dollars a week, and washing and lunch two dollars more, thus compelling him to exceed his salary by a dollar each week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had, as we know, a reserve fund, on which he could draw, but it was small, and grew constantly smaller. Then, again, his clothes were wearing out, and he saw no way of obtaining money to buy new.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil became uneasy, and the question came up to his mind, ”Should he write to his step-mother and ask her for a trifling loan?“ If the money had been hers, he would not have done so on any condition; but she had had nothing of her own, and all the property in her hands came through Mr. Brent, who, as he knew, was attached to him, even though no tie of blood united them. He certainly meant that Phil should be cared for out of the estate, and at length Phil brought himself to write the following letter: ”NEW YORK, March 10, 18—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”DEAR MRS. BRENT: I suppose I ought to have written you before, and have no good excuse to offer. I hope you and Jonas are well, and will continue so. Let me tell you how I have succeeded thus far.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have been fortunate enough to obtain a place in a large mercantile establishment, and for my services I am paid five dollars a week. This is more than boys generally get in the first place, and I am indebted to the partiality of an old gentleman, the senior member of the firm, whom I had the chance to oblige, for faring so well. Still I find it hard to get along on this sum, though I am as economical as possible. My board and washing cost me six dollars a week, and I have, besides, to buy clothing from time to time. I have nearly spent the extra money I had with me, and do not know how to keep myself looking respectable in the way of clothing. Under the circumstances, I shall have to apply to you for a loan, say of twenty-five dollars. In a year or two I hope to earn enough to be entirely independent. At present I cannot expect it. As my father—Mr. Brent—undoubtedly intended to provide for me, I don't think I need to apologize for making this request. Still I do it reluctantly, for I would prefer to depend entirely upon myself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”With regards to you and Jonas, I am yours truly, PHILIP BRENT.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil put this letter in the post-office, and patiently waited for an answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent surely cannot refuse me,“ he said to himself, ”since I have almost wholly relieved her of the expense of taking care of me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil felt so sure that money would be sent to him that he began to look round a little among ready-made clothing stores to see at what price he could obtain a suit that would do for every-day use. He found a store in the Bowery where he could secure a suit, which looked as if it would answer, for thirteen dollars. If Mrs. Brent sent him twenty-five, that would leave him twelve for underclothing, and for a reserve fund to meet the weekly deficit which he could not avoid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three—four days passed, and no letter came in answer to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It can't be that Mrs. Brent won't at least answer my letter,“ he thought uneasily. ”Even if she didn't send me twenty-five dollars, she couldn't help sending me something.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still he felt uneasy, in view of the position in which he would find himself in case no letter or remittance should come at all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was during this period of anxiety that his heart leaped for joy when on Broadway he saw the familiar form of Reuben Gordon, a young man already mentioned, to whom Phil had sold his gun before leaving Gresham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, Reuben, how are you?“ exclaimed Phil joyfully. ”When did you come to town?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Phil Brent!“ exclaimed Reuben, shaking hands heartily. ”I'm thunderin' glad to see you. I was thinkin' of you only five minutes ago, and wonderin' where you hung out.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But you haven't told me when you came to New York.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Only this morning! I'm goin' to stay with a cousin of my father's, that lives in Brooklyn, over night.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wanted to ask you about Mrs. Brent and Jonas. I was afraid they might be sick, for I wrote four days ago and haven't got any answer yet.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where did you write to?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To Gresham, of course,“ answered Phil, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't mean to say you hain't heard of their leavin' Gresham?“ said Reuben, in evident astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who has left Gresham?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your mother—leastwise, Mrs. Brent—and Jonas. They cleared out three weeks ago, and nobody's heard a word of them since—that is, nobody in the village.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't you know where they've gone?“ asked Phil, in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No. I was goin' to ask you. I s'posed, of course, they'd write and let you know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I didn't even know they had left Gresham.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, that's what I call cur'us. It ain't treatin' you right accordin' to my ideas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is the house shut up?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was till two days ago. Then a brother of Mrs. Brent came and opened it. He has brought his wife and one child with him, and it seems they're goin' to live there. Somebody asked him where his sister and Jonas were, but they didn't get no satisfaction. He said he didn't rightly know himself. He believed they was travelin'; thought they might be in Canada.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil looked and felt decidedly sober at this information. He understood, of course, now, why his letter had not been answered. It looked as if he were an outcast from the home that had been his so long. When he came to New York to earn a living he felt that he was doing so voluntarily, and was not obliged to do so. Now he was absolutely thrown upon his own resources, and must either work or starve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They've treated you real mean,“ said Reuben.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I never did like Mrs. Brent, or Jonas either, for that matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where are you working?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil answered this question and several others which his honest country friend asked, but his mind was preoccupied, and he answered some of the questions at random. Finally he excused himself on the ground that he must be getting back to the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That evening Phil thought seriously of his position. Something must be done, that was very evident. His expenses exceeded his income, and he needed some clothing. There was no chance of getting his wages raised under a year, for he already received more pay than it was customary to give to a boy. What should he do?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil decided to lay his position frankly before the only friend he had in the city likely to help him— Mr. Oliver Carter. The old gentleman had been so friendly and kind that he felt that he would not at any rate repulse him. After he had come to this decision he felt better. He determined to lose no time in calling upon Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After supper he brushed his hair carefully, and made himself look as well as circumstances would admit. Then he bent his steps toward Twelfth Street, where, as the reader will remember, Mr. Carter lived with his niece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ascended the steps and rang the bell. It was opened by Hannah, who recognized him, having admitted him on the former occasion of his calling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good-evening,“ said Phil pleasantly. ”Is Mr. Carter at home?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir,“ answered Hannah. ”Didn't you know he had gone to Florida?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Gone to Florida!“ repeated Phil, his heart sinking. ”When did he start?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He started this afternoon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who's asking after Uncle Oliver?“ asked a boy's voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking behind Hannah, Phil recognized the speaker as Alonzo Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI. ”THEY MET BY CHANCE.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHO WAS asking after Uncle Oliver?“ demanded Alonzo superciliously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I was,“ answered Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh! it's you, is it?“ said Alonzo, rather disdainfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil calmly, though he felt provoked at Alonzo's tone, which was meant to be offensive. ”You remember me, don't you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are the boy that got round Uncle Oliver, and got him to give you a place in pa's store.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I deny that I got round him,“ returned Phil warmly. ”I had the good luck to do him a favor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose you have come after money?“ said Alonzo coarsely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I sha'n't ask you for any, at any rate,“ said Phil angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; it wouldn't do any good,“ said Alonzo; ”and it's no use asking ma, either. She says you are an adventurer, and have designs on Uncle Oliver because he is rich.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shall not ask your mother for any favor,“ said Phil, provoked. ”I am sorry not to meet your uncle.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I dare say!“ sneered Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then a woman, poorly but neatly dressed, came down stairs. Her face was troubled. Just behind her came Mrs. Pitkin, whose face wore a chilly and proud look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Carter has left the city, and I really don't know when he will return,“ Phil heard her say. ”If he had been at home, it would not have benefited you. He is violently prejudiced against you, and would not have listened to a word you had to say.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I did not think he would have harbored resentment so long,“ murmured the poor woman. ”He never seemed to me to be a hard man.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil gazed at the poorly dressed woman with a surprise which he did not attempt to conceal, for in her he recognized the familiar figure of his landlady. What could she have to do in this house? he asked himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush!“ he exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip!“ exclaimed Mrs. Forbush, in a surprise as great as his own, for she had never asked where her young lodger worked, and was not aware that he was in the employ of her cousin's husband and well acquainted with the rich uncle whom she had not seen for years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know each other?“ demanded Mrs. Pitkin, whose turn it was to be surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This young gentleman lodges in my house,“ answered Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young gentleman!“ repeated Alonzo, with a mocking laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip looked at him sternly. He had his share of human nature, and it would have given him satisfaction to thrash the insolent young patrician, as Alonzo chose to consider himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And what do you want here, young man?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin in a frosty tone, addressing Phil of course.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wished to see Mr. Carter,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Really, Mr. Carter seems to be very much in request!“ sneered Mrs. Pitkin. ”No doubt he will be very much disappointed when he hears what he has lost. You will have to go to Florida to see him, I think, however.“ She added, after a pause: ”It will not be well for either of you to call again. Mr. Carter will understand the motive of your calls.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How cruel you are, Lavinia!“ said Mrs. Forbush sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My name is Mrs. Pitkin!“ said that lady frigidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have not forgotten that we are cousins, surely?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I do not care to remember it, Mrs. Forbush. Good-day.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no alternative but for Mrs. Forbush to say ”good-day“ also, and to descend the steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip joined her in the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you really the cousin of Mrs. Pitkin?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Mrs. Forbush. ”I bear the same relationship to Mr. Carter that she does. We were much together as girls, and were both educated at the same expensive schools. I offended my relatives by marrying Mr. Forbush, whose fault was that he was poor, and chiefly, I think, through the efforts of Lavinia Pitkin I was cast out by the family. But where did you meet Uncle Oliver?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip explained the circumstances already known to the reader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Carter seems to me to be a kind-hearted man,“ he said. ”I don't believe he would have cast you off if he had not been influenced by other parties.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I think,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”I will tell you,“ she continued, after a pause, ”what drew me here this afternoon. I am struggling hard to keep my head above water, Mr. Brent, but I find it hard to meet my expenses. I cannot meet my rent due to-morrow within fifteen dollars, and I dared to hope that if I could meet Uncle Oliver face to face and explain matters to him, he would let me have the money.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sure he would,“ said Phil warmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But he is in Florida, and will probably remain there for a month or two at least,“ said Mrs. Forbush, sighing. But even if he were in the city I suppose Lavinia would do all in her power co keep us apart.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have no doubt she would, Mrs. Forbush. Though she is your cousin, I dislike her very much.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose the boy with whom you were talking was her son Alonzo?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; he is about the most disagreeable boy I ever met. Both he and his mother seem very much opposed to my having an interview with your uncle.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Lavinia was always of a jealous and suspicious disposition,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”I have not seen Alonzo since he was a baby. He is two years older than my Julia. He was born before I estranged my relatives by marrying a poor man.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you going to do, Mrs. Forbush, about the rent?“ asked Phil, in a tone of sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. I shall try to get the landlord to wait, but I don't know how he will feel about it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish I had plenty of money. I would gladly lend you all you need.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sure you would, Philip,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”The offer does me good, though it is not accompanied by the ability to do what your good heart dictates. I feel that I am not without friends.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am a very poor one,“ said Phil. ”The fact is, I am in trouble myself. My income is only five dollars a week, and my expenses are beyond that. I don't know how I am going to keep up.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may stay with me for three dollars a week, if you cannot pay four,“ said Mrs. Forbush, forgetting her own troubles in her sympathy with our hero.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Mrs. Forbush, you can't afford it. You need money as much as I do, and perhaps more; for you have more than yourself to support.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, poor Julia!“ sighed the mother. ”She is born to a heritage of poverty. Heaven only knows how we are going to get along.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”God will provide for us, Mrs. Forbush,“ said Philip. ”I don't know how it is, but in spite of my troubles I feel cheerful. I have a confidence that things will come out well, though I cannot possibly imagine how.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are young, and youth is more inclined to be hopeful than maturer years. However, I do not wish to dampen your cheerfulness. Keep it, and let it comfort you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If Phil could have heard the conversation that took place between Mrs. Pitkin and Alonzo after their departure, he might have felt less hopeful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is dreadfully annoying that that woman should turn up after all these years!“ said Mrs. Pitkin, in a tone of disgust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is she really your cousin, ma?“ asked Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, but she disgraced herself by a low marriage, and was cast off.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That disposes of her, then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. If she could meet Uncle Oliver, I am afraid she would worm herself into his confidence and get him to do something for her. Then it is unfortunate that she and that boy have fallen in with each other. She may get him to speak to Uncle Oliver in her behalf.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Isn't he working for pa?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why don't you get pa to discharge him while Uncle Oliver is away?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well thought of, Alonzo! I will speak to your father this very evening.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII. PHIL IS ”BOUNCED.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SATURDAY, as is usual in such establishments, was pay-day at the store of Phil's employers. The week's wages were put up in small envelopes and handed to the various clerks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Phil went up to the cashier to get his money he put it quietly into his vest-pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daniel Dickson, the cashier, observing this, said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Brent, you had better open your envelope.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rather surprised, Phil nevertheless did as requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the envelope, besides the five-dollar bill representing his week's salary, he found a small slip of paper, on which was written these ominous words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your services will not be required after this week.“ Appended to this notice was the name of the firm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil turned pale, for to him, embarrassed as he was, the loss of his place was a very serious matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What does this mean, Mr. Dickson?“ he asked quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't inform you,“ answered the cashier, smiling unpleasantly, for he was a selfish man who sympathized with no one, and cared for no one as long as he himself remained prosperous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who handed you this paper?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The boss.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pitkin was still in his little office, and Phil made his way directly to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”May I speak to you, sir?“ asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Be quick about it then, for I am in a hurry,“ answered Pitkin, in a very forbidding tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why am I discharged, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't go into details. We don't need you any longer.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you not satisfied with me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No!“ said Pitkin brusquely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In what respect have I failed to satisfy you, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't put on any airs, boy!“ returned Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We don't want you, that's all.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You might have given me a little notice,“ said Phil indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We made no stipulation of that kind, I believe.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It would only be fair, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No impertinence, young man! I won't stand it! I don't need any instructions as to the manner of conducting my business.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil by this time perceived that his discharge was decided upon without any reference to the way in which he had performed his duties, and that any discussion or remonstrance would be unavailing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I see, sir, that you have no regard for justice, and will leave you,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better, and without delay!“ said Pitkin irascibly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil emerged upon the street with a sinking heart. His available funds consisted only of the money he had just received and seventy-five cents in change, and what he was to do he did not know. He walked home with slow steps, looking sad in spite of his usually hopeful temperament.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he entered the house he met Mrs. Forbush in the hall. She at once noticed his gravity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you had any bad luck, Philip?“ she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil. ”I have lost my situation.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Indeed!“ returned the landlady, with quick sympathy. ”Have you had any difficulty with your employer?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not that I am aware of.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did he assign any reason for your discharge?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I asked him for an explanation, but he merely said I was not wanted any longer.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Isn't there any chance of his taking you back?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sure there is not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't be discouraged, Philip. A smart boy like you won't be long out of a place. Meanwhile you are welcome to stay here as long as I have a roof to cover me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, Mrs. Forbush,“ said Phil warmly. ”you are a true friend. You are in trouble yourself, yet you stand by me!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have had a stroke of good luck to-day,“ said Mrs. Forbush cheerfully. ”A former boarder, whom I allowed to remain here for five or six weeks when he was out of employment, has sent me thirty dollars in payment of his bill, from Boston, where he found a position. So I shall be able to pay my rent and have something over. I have been lucky, and so may you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was cheered by the ready sympathy of his landlady, and began to take a more cheerful view of matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will go out bright and early on Monday and see if I can't find another place,“ he said. ”Perhaps it may be all for the best.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet on the day succeeding he had some sober hours. How differently he had been situated only three months before. Then he had a home and relatives. Now he was practically alone in the world, with no home in which he could claim a share, and he did not even know where his step-mother and Jonas were. Sunday forenoon he attended church, and while he sat within its sacred precincts his mind was tranquilized, and his faith and cheerfulness increased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Monday he bought the Herald , and made a tour of inquiry wherever he saw that a boy was wanted. But in each place he was asked if he could produce a recommendation from his last employer. He decided to go back to his old place and ask for one, though he was very reluctant to ask a favor of any kind from a man who had treated him so shabbily as Mr. Pitkin. It seemed necessary, however, and he crushed down his pride and made his way to Mr. Pitkin's private office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin!“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You here!“ exclaimed Pitkin, scowling. ”You needn't ask to be taken back. It's no use.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't ask it,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then what are you here for?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I would like a letter of recommendation, that I may obtain another place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, well!“ said Pitkin, wagging his head. ”If that isn't impudence.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is impudence?“ asked Phil. ”I did as well as I could, and that I am ready to do for another employer. But all ask me for a letter from you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You won't get any!“ said Pitkin abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where is your home?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have none except in this city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where did you come from?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”From the country.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I advise you to go back there. You may do for the country. You are out of place in the city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Phil! Things did indeed look dark for him. Without a letter of recommendation from Mr. Pitkin it would be almost impossible for him to secure another place, and how could he maintain himself in the city? He didn't wish to sell papers or black boots, and those were about the only paths now open to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am having a rough time!“ he thought, ”but I will try not to get discouraged.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned upon his heel and walked out of the store.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he passed the counter where Wilbur was standing, the young man said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am awfully sorry, Philip. It's a shame! If I wasn't broke I'd offer to lend you a fiver.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you all the same for your kind offer Wilbur,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come round and see me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I will—soon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He left the store and wandered aimlessly about the streets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four days later, sick with hope deferred, he made his way down to the wharf of the Charleston and Savannah boats, with a vague idea that he might get a job of carrying baggage, for he felt that he must not let his pride interfere with doing anything by which he could earn an honest penny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It so happened that the Charleston boat was just in, and the passengers were just landing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil stood on the pier and gazed listlessly at them as they disembarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All at once he started in surprise, and his heart beat joyfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, just descending the gang-plank, was his tried friend, Mr. Oliver Carter, whom he supposed over a thousand miles away in Florida.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Carter!“ exclaimed Phil, dashing forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip!“ exclaimed the old gentleman, much surprised. ”How came you here? Did Mr. Pitkin send you?“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII. AN EXPLANATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT WOULD be hard to tell which of the two was the more surprised at the meeting, Philip or Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't understand how Mr. Pitkin came to hear of my return. I didn't telegraph,“ said the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think he knows anything about it,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Didn't he send you to the pier?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then how is it that you are not in the store at this time?“ asked Mr. Carter, puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Because I am no longer in Mr. Pitkin's employ. I was discharged last Saturday.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Discharged! What for?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin gave no reason. He said my services were no longer required. He spoke roughly to me, and has since declined to give me a recommendation, though I told him that without it I should be unable to secure employment elsewhere.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter frowned. He was evidently annoyed and indignant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil stood on the pier as Mr. Carter descended the gang-plank. (See page 151.) Phil watching Mr. Carter descending the gang-plank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This must be inquired into,“ he said. ”Philip, call a carriage, and I will at once go to the Astor House and take a room. I had intended to go at once to Mr. Pitkin's, but I shall not do so until I have had an explanation of this outrageous piece of business.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was rejoiced to hear this, for he was at the end of his resources, and the outlook for him was decidedly gloomy. He had about made up his mind to sink his pride and go into business as a newsboy the next day, but the very unexpected arrival of Mr. Carter put quite a new face on matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He called a carriage, and both he and Mr. Carter entered it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you happen to be back so soon, sir?“ asked Phil, when they were seated. ”I thought you were going to Florida for a couple of months.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I started with that intention, but on reaching Charleston I changed my mind. I expected to find some friends at St. Augustine, but I learned that they were already returning to the North, and I felt that I should be lonely and decided to return. I am very glad I did, now. Did you receive my letter?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your letter?“ queried Philip, looking at Mr. Carter in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly. I gave Alonzo a letter for you, which I had directed to your boarding-house, and requested him to mail it. It contained a ten-dollar bill.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I never received any such letter, sir. It would have been of great service to me—the money, I mean; for I have found it hard to live on five dollars a week. Now I have not even that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it possible that Alonzo could have suppressed the letter?“ said Mr. Carter to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At any rate I never received it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Here is something else to inquire into,“ said Mr. Carter. ”If Alonzo has tampered with my letter, perhaps appropriated the money, it will be the worse for him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hardly think he would do that, sir; though I don't like him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are generous; but I know the boy better than you do. He is fond of money, not for the sake of spending it, but for the sake of hoarding it. Tell me, then, how did you learn that I had gone to Florida?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I learned it at the house in Twelfth Street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you called there?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; I called to see you. I found it hard to get along on my salary, and I did not want Mrs. Forbush to lose by me, so I—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush?“ repeated the old gentleman quickly. ”That name sounds familiar to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush is your niece,“ said Phil, a hope rising in his heart that he might be able to do his kind landlady a good turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did she tell you that?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir; that is, I was ignorant of it until I met her just as I was going away from Mrs. Pitkin's.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did she call there, too—to see me?“ asked the old gentleman,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; but she got a very cold reception. Mrs. Pitkin was very rude to her, and said that you were so much prejudiced against her that she had better not call again.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's like her cold selfishness. I understand her motives very well. I had no idea that Mrs. Forbush was in the city. Is she—poor?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; she is having a hard struggle to maintain herself and her daughter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you board at her house?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How strangely things come about! She is as nearly related to me as Lavinia—Mrs. Pitkin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She told me so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She married against the wishes of her family, but I can see now that we were all unreasonably prejudiced against her. Lavinia, however, trumped up stories against her husband, which I am now led to believe were quite destitute of foundation, and did all she could to keep alive the feud. I feel now that I was very foolish to lend myself to her selfish ends. Of course her object was to get my whole fortune for herself and her boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil had no doubt of this, but he did not like to say so, for it would seem that he, too, was influenced by selfish motives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you are not so much prejudiced against Mrs. Forbush as she was told?“ he allowed himself to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, no!“ said Mr. Carter earnestly. ”Poor Rebecca! She has a much better nature and disposition than Mrs. Pitkin. And you say she is poor?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She had great difficulty in paying her last month's rent,“ said Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where does she live?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil told him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What sort of a house is it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It isn't a brown-stone front,“ answered Phil, smiling. ”It is a poor, cheap house; but it is as good as she can afford to hire.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you like her?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very much, Mr. Carter. She has been very kind to me, and though she finds it so hard to get along, she has told me she will keep me as long as she has a roof over her head, though just now I cannot pay my board, because my income is gone.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It will come back again, Philip,“ said the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil understood by this that he would be restored to his place in Mr. Pitkin's establishment. This did not yield him unalloyed satisfaction, for he was sure that it would be made unpleasant for him by Mr. Pitkin. Still he would accept it, and meet disagreeable things as well as he could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time they had reached the Astor House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil jumped out first, and assisted Mr. Carter to descend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took Mr. Carter's hand-bag, and followed him into the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter entered his name in the register.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is your name?“ he asked—”Philip Brent?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will enter your name, too.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Am I to stay here?“ asked Phil, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; I shall need a confidential clerk, and for the present you will fill that position. I will take two adjoining rooms—one for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil listened in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you, sir,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter gave orders to have his trunk sent for from the steamer, and took possession of the room. Philip's room was smaller, but considerably more luxurious than the one he occupied at the house of Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you any money, Philip?“ asked the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have twenty-five cents,“ answered Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That isn't a very large sum,“ said Mr. Carter, smiling. ”Here, let me replenish your pocketbook.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew four five-dollar bills from his wallet and handed them to Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How can I thank you, sir?“ asked Phil gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Wait till you have more to thank me for. Let me tell you this, that in trying to harm you, Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin have done you a great service.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should like to see Mrs. Forbush this evening, if you can spare me, to let her know that she needn't be anxious about me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By all means. You can go.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Am I at liberty to mention that I have seen you, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. Tell her that I will call to-morrow. And you may take her this.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter drew a hundred-dollar bill from his wallet and passed it to Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Get it changed at the office as you go out,“ he said. ”Come back as soon as you can.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a joyful heart Phil jumped on a Fourth Avenue car in front of the hotel, and started on his way up town.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV. RAISING THE RENT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEAVING Phil, we will precede him to the house of Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had managed to pay the rent due, but she was not out of trouble. The time had come when it was necessary to decide whether she would retain the house for the following year. In New York, as many of my young readers may know, the first of May is moving-day, and leases generally begin at that date. Engagements are made generally by or before March 1st.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stone, the landlord, called upon the widow to ascertain whether she proposed to remain in the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suppose I may as well do so,“ said Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had had difficulty in making her monthly payments, but to move would involve expense, and it might be some time before she could secure boarders in a new location.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can't do better,“ said the landlord. ”At fifty dollars a month this is a very cheap house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You mean forty-five? Mr. Stone?“ said Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I don't,“ said the landlord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But that is what I have been paying this last year.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is true, but I ought to get fifty dollars, and if you won't pay it somebody else will.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Stone,“ said the widow, in a troubled voice, ”I hope you will be considerate. It has been as much as I could do to get together forty-five dollars each month to pay you. Indeed, I can pay no more.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Pardon me for saying that that is no affair of mine,“ said the landlord brusquely. ”If you can't pay the rent, by all means move into a smaller house. If you stay here you must be prepared to pay fifty dollars a month.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't see how I can,“ answered the widow in dejection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'll give you three days to consider it,“ said the landlord indifferently. ”You'll make a mistake if you give the house up. However, that is your affair.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The landlord left the house, and Mrs. Forbush sat down depressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Julia,“ she said to her daughter, ”I wish you were old enough to advise me. I dislike to move, but I don't dare to engage to pay such a rent. Fifty dollars a month will amount to—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Six hundred dollars a year!“ said Julia, who was good at figures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And that seems a great sum to us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It would be little enough to Mrs. Pitkin,“ said Julia, who felt that lady's prosperity unjust, while her poor, patient mother had to struggle so hard for a scanty livelihood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, yes; Lavinia is rolling in wealth,“ sighed Mrs. Forbush. ”I can't understand how Uncle Oliver can bestow his favors on so selfish a woman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why don't you ask Philip's advice about keeping the house?“ said Julia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It must be explained that Philip and Julia were already excellent friends, and it may be said that each was mutually attracted by the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Poor Philip has his own troubles,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”He has lost his place through the malice and jealousy of Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin, for I am sure that Lavinia is the cause of his dismissal, and I don't know when he will be able to get another.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You won't send him away, mother, if he can't pay his board?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered her mother warmly. ”Philip is welcome to stay with us as long as we have a roof over our heads, whether he can pay his board or not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This answer seemed very satisfactory to Julia, who rose impulsively and kissed her mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a good mother,“ she said. ”It would be a pity to send poor Philip into the street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You seem to like Philip,“ said Mrs. Forbush, smiling faintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, mother. You know I haven't any brother, and Phil seems just like a brother to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then the door opened, and Philip himself entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Generally he came home looking depressed, after a long and ineffectual search for employment. Now he was fairly radiant with joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Phil, you've got a place; I know you have!“ exclaimed Julia, noticing his glad expression. ”Where is it? Is it a good one?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you really got a place, Philip?“ asked Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, for the present.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think you shall like your employer?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is certainly treating me very well,“ said Phil, smiling. ”He has paid me twenty dollars in advance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then the age of wonders has not passed,“ said the widow. ”Of course I believe you, Philip, but it seems extraordinary.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There is something more extraordinary to come,“ said Phil. ”He has sent you some money, too.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Me!“ exclaimed Mrs. Forbush, in great surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What can he know about me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I told him about you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But we are strangers.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He used to know you, and still feels an interest in you, Mrs. Forbush.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who can it be?“ said the widow, looking bewildered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't want to keep you in suspense any longer, so I may as well say that it is your Uncle Oliver.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver! Why, he is in Florida.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; he came home from Charleston. I happened to be at the pier—I went down to see if I could get a job at smashing baggage—when I saw him walking down the gang-plank.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Has he gone to his old quarters at Mr. Pitkin's?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; what I told about the way they treated you and me made him angry, and he drove to the Astor House. I have a room there, too, and am to act as his private secretary.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So that is your new situation, Phil?“ said Julia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, and it is a good one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And he really feels kindly to me?“ said Mrs. Forbush hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He sends you this and will call to-morrow,“ said Phil. ”Actions speak louder than words. There are a hundred dollars in this roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He sent all this to me?“ she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, and of his own accord. It was no suggestion of mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Julia,“ said Mrs. Forbush, turning to her daughter, ”I believe God has heard my prayer, and that better days are in store for all of us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip included,“ added Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. I want you to share in our good fortune.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mother, you had better consult Phil about keeping the house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Forbush thereupon told Philip of the landlord's visit and his proposal to ask a higher rent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hesitated about taking the house,“ she said; ”but with this handsome gift from Uncle Oliver, I don't know but I may venture. What do you think?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think, Mrs. Forbush, you had better not decide till you have seen your uncle. He may have some plan of his own for you. At any rate, you had better consult him. He will call to-morrow. And now, let me pay you for my week's board.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Philip. I shall not want it with all this money, which I should not have received but for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A debt is a debt, Mrs. Forbush, and I prefer to pay it. I shall not be here to supper, as Mr. Carter is expecting me back to the Astor House. I shall probably come with him when he calls upon you to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his return to the hotel, as he was walking on Broadway, Phil came face to face with Alonzo Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think I'll ask him about that letter his uncle gave him to post to me,“ thought Phil, and he waited until Alonzo was close at hand.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV. ALONZO IS PUZZLED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALONZO, who had his share of curiosity, as soon as he saw Phil's approach, determined to speak to him, and ascertain what were his plans and what he was doing. With the petty malice which he inherited from his mother, he hoped that Phil had been unable to find a place and was in distress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It would serve him right,“ said Alonzo to himself, ”for trying to get into Uncle Oliver's good graces. ”I s'pose he would like to cut me out, but he'll find that he can't fight against ma and me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, it's you, is it?“ was Alonzo's salutation when they met.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Pa bounced you, didn't he?“ continued Alonzo complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Phil. ”That is, he discharged me. I suppose that is what you meant.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You've got it right the first time,“ said Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you got another place?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you ask because you feel interested in me?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, not particularly,“ answered Alonzo appearing quite amused by the suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you ask out of curiosity?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”S'pose I do?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't mind telling you that I have found a place, then.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What sort of a place?“ asked Alonzo, disappointed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There is no need of going into particulars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No. I s'pose not,“ sneered Alonzo. ”You're probably selling papers or blacking boots.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are mistaken. I have a much better situation than I had with your father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo's lower jaw fell. He was very sorry to hear it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Didn't your employer ask for a recommendation?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He didn't seem to think one necessary!“ replied Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If he'd known pa had sacked you, he wouldn't have wanted you, I guess.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He knows it. Have you got through asking questions, Alonzo?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are too familiar. You can call me Mr. Pitkin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil laughed at Alonzo's assumption of dignity, but made no comment upon it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to ask you what you did with that letter Mr. Carter gave you to post for me?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo was indeed surprised, not to say dismayed. The truth was that, judging from the ”feel“ of the letter, it contained money, and he had opened it and appropriated the money to his own use. Moreover he had the bank-note in his pocket at that very moment, not having any wish to spend, but rather to hoard it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a queer question,“ he stammered. ”What letter do you refer to?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A letter Mr. Carter gave you to mail to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If he gave me any such letter I mailed it,“ answered Alonzo, scarcely knowing what to say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I didn't receive it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you know he gave me any letter?“ demanded Alonzo, puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't care to tell. I only know that there was such a letter handed to you. Do you know what was in it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Writing, I s'pose,“ said Alonzo flippantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, there was, but there was also a ten-dollar bill. I didn't receive the letter,“ and Phil fixed his eyes searchingly upon the face of Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's a pretty story!“ said Alonzo. ”I don't believe Uncle Oliver would be such a fool as to send you ten dollars. If he did, you got it, and now want to get as much more, pretending you haven't received it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are mistaken,“ said Phil quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you didn't get the letter, how do you know any was written, and that there was anything in it?“ asked Alonzo triumphantly, feeling that the question was a crusher.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't care to tell you how I know it. Do you deny it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't remember whether Uncle Oliver gave me any letter or not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you be kind enough to give me his address in Florida, so that I may write to him and find out?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I won't,“ said Alonzo angrily, ”and I think you are very cheeky to ask such a thing. Ma was right when she said that you were the most impudent boy she ever came across.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's enough, Alonzo,“ said Phil quietly. ”I've found out all I wanted to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What have you found out?“ asked Alonzo, his tone betraying some apprehension.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Never mind. I think I know what became of that letter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you mean to say I opened it and took out the money?“ demanded Alonzo, reddening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wouldn't charge anybody with such a mean act, unless I felt satisfied of it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better not!“ said Alonzo, in a bullying tone. ”If I find out who you're working for, I'll let him know that pa bounced you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just as you please! I don't think that any words of yours will injure me with the gentleman I have the good fortune to work for.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't you be too sure! If you think he wouldn't mind a boy, I'll refer him to pa and ma. They'll give you a good setting out.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't doubt it,“ said Phil indifferently, and turned to go away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was called back by Alonzo, who had not quite satisfied his curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Say, are you boarding with that woman who came to see ma the same day you were at the house?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I have left her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo looked well pleased. He knew that his mother felt rather uneasy at the two being together, dreading lest they should make a concerted attempt to ingratiate themselves with her rich uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ma says she behaved very badly,“ Alonzo could not help adding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush is an excellent Lady,“ said Phil warmly, for he could not hear one of his friends spoken against.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Lady! She's as poor as poverty,“ sneered Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She is none the worse for that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver can't bear her!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Indeed!“ said Phil; pausing to see what else Alonzo would say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ma says she disgraced herself, and all her relations gave her up. When you see her tell her she had better not come sneaking round the house again.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If you will write a letter to that effect, I will see that she gets it,“ said Phil. ”That letter won't miscarry.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't care to take any notice of her,“ said Alonzo loftily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are very kind to have wasted so much notice upon me,“ said Phil, amused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo did not see fit to answer this, but walked away with his head in the air. He was, however, not quite easy in mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How in the world,“ he asked himself, ”could that boy have found out that Uncle Oliver gave me a letter to post? If he should learn that I opened it and took the money, there'd be a big fuss. I guess I'd better not meet him again. If I see him any day I'll go in a different direction. He's so artful he may get me into trouble.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is needless to say that neither Mr. or Mrs. Pitkin knew of Alonzo's tampering with the letter. Much as they would have been opposed to Phil's receiving such a letter, they would have been too wise to sanction such a bold step.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well,“ said Mr. Carter, when Phil returned, ”did you see Rebecca—Mrs. Forbush?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir, and handed her the money. She was overjoyed; not so much at receiving so generous a sum as at learning that you were reconciled to her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Poor girl!“ said the old man, forgetting that she was now a worn woman. ”I am afraid that she must have suffered much.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She has met with many hardships, sir, but she won't mind them now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If I live her future shall be brighter than her past. I will call to-morrow. You, Philip, shall go with me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should like to do so, sir. By the way, I met Alonzo on Broadway.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He detailed the conversation that had taken place between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am afraid he took the money,“ said Mr. Carter. ”I am sorry any relative of mine should have acted in that way. Let him keep it. Any benefit he may derive from it will prove to have been dearly purchased.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI. A WONDERFUL CHANGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">YOU MAY order a carriage, Philip,“ said Mr. Carter the next morning. ”Pick out a handsome one with seats for four.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In five minutes the carriage was at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Now, Philip, we will go to see my long-neglected niece, Mrs. Forbush. Give the driver the necessary directions.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush does not have many carriage-callers,“ said Philip, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps she will have more hereafter,“ said Mr. Carter, ”I ought not so long to have lost sight of her. I always liked Rebecca better than Lavinia, yet I let the latter prejudice me against her cousin, who is in disposition, education and sincerity her superior. You see, Philip, there are old fools in the world as well as young ones.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is never too late to mend, Mr. Carter,“ said Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's very true, even if it is a young philosopher who says it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't claim any originality for it, Mr. Carter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By the way, Philip, I have noticed that you always express yourself very correctly. Your education must be good.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir, thanks to my father, or the man whom I always regarded as my father. I am a fair Latin scholar, and know something of Greek.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Were you preparing for college?“ asked Mr. Carter, with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you like to go?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should have gone had father lived, but my step-mother said it was foolishness and would be money thrown away.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps she preferred to incur that expense for her own son?“ suggested the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas wouldn't consent to that. He detests study, and would decidedly object to going to college.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”By the way, you haven't heard from them lately?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Only that they have left our old home and gone no one knows where.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is strange.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time they had reached the humble dwelling occupied by Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And so this is where Rebecca lives?“ said Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir. It is not quite so nice as Mrs. Pitkin's.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ returned Mr. Carter thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip rang the bell, and the two were admitted into the humble parlor. They had not long to wait for Mrs. Forbush, who, with an agitation which she could not overcome, entered the presence of her long estranged and wealthy uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Rebecca!“ exclaimed the old gentleman, rising, and showing some emotion as he saw the changes which fifteen years had made in the niece whom he had last met as a girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver! how kind you are to visit me!“ cried Mrs. Forbush, the tears starting from her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Kind! Nonsense! I have been very unkind to neglect you so long. But it wasn't all my fault. There were others who did all they could to keep us apart. You have lost your husband?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, uncle. He was poor, but he was one of the kindest and best of men, and made me happy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I begin to think I have been an old fool, Rebecca. Philip thinks so, too.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Mr. Carter!“ exclaimed our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, you do, Philip,“ asserted Mr. Carter, ”and you are quite right. However, as you told me, it is never too late to mend.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Forbush will think I take strange liberties with you, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't object to good advice, even from a boy. But who is this?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julia had just entered the room. She was a bright, attractive girl, but held back bashfully until her mother said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Julia, this is Uncle Oliver Carter. You have heard me speak of him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, mamma.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And scold about him, I dare say. Well, Julia, come and give your old uncle a kiss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julia blushed, but obeyed her uncle's request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should know she was your child, Rebecca. She looks as you did at her age. Now tell me, have you any engagement this morning, you two?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Uncle Oliver.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I will find one for you. I have a carriage at the door. You will please put on your bonnets. We are going shopping.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Shopping?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I am going to fit out both of you in a manner more befitting relatives of mine. The fact is, Niece Rebecca, you are actually shabby.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know it, uncle, but there has been so many ways of spending money that I have had to neglect my dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very likely. I understand. Things are different now. Now, don't be over an hour getting ready!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are not fashionable, uncle,“ said Mrs. Forbush, ”and we haven't any change to make.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They entered the carriage, and drove to a large and fashionable store, where everything necessary to a lady's toilet, including dresses quite complete, could be obtained. Mrs. Forbush was in favor of selecting very plain articles, but her uncle overruled her, and pointed out costumes much more costly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But, uncle,“ objected Mrs. Forbush, ”these things won't at all correspond with our plain home and mode of living. Think of a boarding-house keeper arrayed like a fine lady.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are going to give up taking boarders—that is, you will have none but Philip and myself.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you really live with us, uncle? But the house is too poor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course it is, but you are going to move. I will speak further on this point when you are through your purchases.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length the shopping was over, and they re-entered the carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Drive to No.— Madison Avenue,“ said Mr. Carter to the driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver, you have given the wrong direction.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Rebecca, I know what I am about.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you live on Madison Avenue?“ asked Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am going to and so are you. You must know that I own a furnished house on Madison Avenue. The late occupants sailed for Europe last week, and I was looking out for a tenant when I found you. You will move there to-morrow, and act as house keeper, taking care of Philip and myself. I hope Julia and you will like it as well as your present home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How can I thank you for all your kindness, Uncle Oliver?“ said Mrs. Forbush, with joyful tears. ”It will be living once more. It will be such a rest from the hard struggle I have had of late years.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You can repay me by humoring all my whims,“ said Uncle Oliver, smiling. ”You will find me very tyrannical. The least infraction of my rules will lead me to send you all packing.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Am I to be treated in the same way, Mr. Carter?“ asked Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Exactly.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then, if you discharge me, I will fly for refuge to Mr. Pitkin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That will be `out of the frying-pan into the fire' with a vengeance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time they had reached the house. It was an elegant brown-stone front, and proved, on entrance, to be furnished in the most complete and elegant manner. Mr. Carter selected the second floor for his own use; a good-sized room on the third was assigned to Philip, and Mrs. Forbush was told to select such rooms for Julia and herself as she desired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is much finer than Mrs. Pitkin's house,“ said Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it is.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She will be jealous when she hears of it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt. That is precisely what I desire. It will be a fitting punishment for her treatment of her own cousin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was arranged that on the morrow Mrs. Forbush and Julia should close their small house, leaving directions to sell the humble furniture at auction, while Mr. Carter and Philip would come up from the Astor House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What will the Pitkins say when they hear of it?“ thought Philip. ”I am afraid they will feel bad.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII. AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHILE these important changes were occurring in the lives of Philip Brent and the poor cousin, Mrs. Pitkin remained in blissful ignorance of what was going on. Alonzo had told her of his encounter with Phil on Broadway and the intelligence our hero gave him of his securing a place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may rest assured the boy was lying, Lonny,“ said Mrs. Pitkin. ”Boys don't get places so easily, especially when they can't give a recommendation from their last employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's just what I thought, ma,“ said Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Still Phil looked in good spirits, and he was as saucy as ever.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can believe the last very well, Lonny. The boy is naturally impertinent. They were probably put on to deceive you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But how does he get money to pay his way?“ said Alonzo puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As to that, he is probably selling papers or blacking boots in the lower part of the city. He could make enough to live on, and of course he wouldn't let you know what he was doing.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hope you're right, ma. I'd give ever so much to catch him blacking boots in City Hall Park, or anywhere else; I'd give him a job. Wouldn't he feel mortified to be caught?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt he would.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I've a great mind to go down town to-morrow and look about for him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, Lonny. You may to if you want to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo did go; but he looked in vain for Phil. The latter was employed in doing some writing and attending to some accounts for Mr. Carter, who had by this time found that his protege was thoroughly well qualified for such work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So nearly a week passed. It so chanced that though Uncle Oliver had now been in New York a considerable time, not one of the Pitkins had met him or had reason to suspect that he was nearer than Florida.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day, however, among Mrs. Pitkin's callers was Mrs. Vangriff, a fashionable acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Oliver Carter is your uncle, I believe?“ said the visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I met him on Broadway the other day. He was looking very well.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It must have been a fortnight since, then. Uncle Oliver is in Florida.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In Florida!“ repeated Mrs. Vangriff, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When did he go?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When was it, Lonny?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin, appealing to her son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It will be two weeks next Thursday.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There must be some mistake,“ said the visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I saw Mr. Carter on Broadway, near Twentieth Street, day before yesterday.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Quite a mistake, I assure you, Mrs. Vangriff,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, smiling. ”It was some other person. You were deceived by a fancied resemblance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is you who are wrong, Mrs. Pitkin,“ said Mrs. Vangriff, positively. ”I am somewhat acquainted with Mr. Carter, and I stopped to speak with him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you sure of this?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin, looking startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly, I am sure of it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you call him by name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly; and even inquired after you. He answered that he believed you were well. I thought he was living with you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So he was,“ answered Mrs. Pitkin coolly as possible, considering the startling nature of the information she had received. ”Probably Uncle Oliver returned sooner than he anticipated, and was merely passing through the city. He has important business interests at the West.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think he was merely passing through the city, for a friend of mine saw him at the Fifth Avenue Theater last evening.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Pitkin actually turned as pale as her sallow complexion would admit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am rather surprised to hear this, I admit,“ she said. ”Was he alone, do you know?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; he had a lady and a boy with him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it possible that Uncle Oliver has been married to some designing widow?“ Mrs. Pitkin asked herself. ”It is positively terrible!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She did not dare to betray her agitation before Mrs. Vangriff, and sat on thorns till that lady saw fit to take leave. Then she turned to Alonzo and said, in a hollow voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Lonny, you heard what that woman said?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You bet!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think Uncle Oliver has gone and got married again?“ she asked, in a hollow voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shouldn't wonder a mite, ma,“ was the not consolitary reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If so, what will become of us? My poor boy, I looked upon you and myself as likely to receive all of Uncle Oliver's handsome property. As it is—“ and she almost broke down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps he's only engaged?“ suggested Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To be sure!“ said his mother, brightening up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If so, the affair may yet be broken off. Oh, Lonny, I never thought your uncle was so artful. His trip to Florida was only a trick to put us off the scent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you going to do about it, ma?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I must find out as soon as possible where Uncle Oliver is staying. Then I will see him, and try to cure him of his infatuation. He is evidently trying to keep us in the dark, or he would have come back to his rooms.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How are you going to find out, ma?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. That's what puzzles me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”S'pose you hire a detective?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wouldn't dare to. Your uncle would be angry when he found it out.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you s'pose Phil knows anything about it?“ suggested Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know; it is hardly probable. Do you know where he lives?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”With the woman who called here and said she was your cousin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I remember, Lonny. I will order the carriage, and we will go there. But you must be very careful not to let them know Uncle Oliver is in New York. I don't wish them to meet him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”All right! I ain't a fool. You can trust me, ma.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon the Pitkin carriage was as the door, and Mrs. Pitkin and Alonzo entered it, and were driven to the shabby house so recently occupied by Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's a low place!“ said Alonzo contemptuously, as he regarded disdainfully the small dwelling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; but I suppose it is as good as she can afford to live in. Lonny, will you get out and ring the bell? Ask if Mrs. Forbush lives there.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo did as requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened by a small girl, whose shabby dress was in harmony with the place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Rebecca's child, I suppose!“ said Mrs. Pitkin, who was looking out of the carriage window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Does Mrs. Forbush live here?“ asked Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, she doesn't. Mrs. Kavanagh lives here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Didn't Mrs. Forbush used to live here?“ further asked Alonzo, at the suggestion of his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I believe she did. She moved out a week ago.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know where she moved to?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I don't.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Does a boy named Philip Brent live here?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, he doesn't.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know why Mrs. Forbush moved away?“ asked Alonzo again, at the suggestion of his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Guess she couldn't pay her rent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very likely,“ said Alonzo, who at last had received an answer with which he was pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, ma, there isn't any more to find out here,“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Tell the driver—home!“ said his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they reached the house in Twelfth Street, there was a surprise in store for them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who do you think's up-stairs, mum?“ said Hannah, looking important.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who? Tell me quick!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's your Uncle Oliver, mum, just got home from Florida; but I guess he's going somewhere else mum, for he's packing up his things.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Alonzo, we will go up and see him,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, excited. ”I must know what all this means.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII. AN UNSATISFACTORY CONFERENCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. CARTER was taking articles from a bureau and packing them away in an open trunk, when Mrs. Pitkin entered with Alonzo. It is needless to say that his niece regarded his employment with dismay, for it showed clearly that he proposed to leave the shelter of her roof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Uncle Oliver!“ she exclaimed, sinking into a chair and gazing at the old gentleman spell-bound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter, whose back had been turned, turned about and faced his niece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, it is you, Lavinia!“ he said quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you doing?“ asked his niece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As you see, I am packing my trunk.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you intend to leave us?“ faltered Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think it will be well for me to make a change,“ said Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is, indeed, a sad surprise,“ said Mrs Pitkin mournfully. When did you return from Florida?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have never been there. I changed my mind when I reached Charleston.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How long have you been in the city?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”About a week.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And never came near us. This is, indeed, unkind. In what way have we offended you?“ and Mrs. Pitkin put her handkerchief to her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were no tears in them, but she was making an attempt to touch the heart of her uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you aware that Rebecca Forbush is in the city?“ asked the old gentleman abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ye-es,“ answered Mrs. Pitkin, startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you seen her?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ye-es. She came here one day.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And how did you treat her?“ asked Mr. Carter, severely. ”Did you not turn the poor woman from the house, having no regard for her evident poverty? Did you not tell her that I was very angry with her, and would not hear her name mentioned?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ye-es, I may have said so. You know, Uncle Oliver, you have held no communication with her for many years.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is true—more shame to me!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And I thought I was carrying out your wishes in discouraging her visits.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You also thought that she might be a dangerous rival in my favor, and might deprive you and Alonzo of an expected share in my estate.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Uncle Oliver! how can you think so poorly of me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter eyed his niece with a half-smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I do you injustice, do I, Lavinia?“ he returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, great injustice.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad to hear it. I feel less objection now to telling you what are my future plans.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are they?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin apprehensively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have lived for ten years under your roof, and have had no communication, as you say, with Rebecca. I think it is only fair now that I should show her some attention. I have accordingly installed her as mistress of my house in Madison Avenue, and shall henceforth make my home with her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Pitkin felt as if the earth was sinking under her feet. The hopes and schemes of so many years had come to naught, and her hated and dreaded cousin was to be constantly in the society of the rich uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Rebecca has played her cards well,“ she said bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She has not played them at all. She did not seek me. I sought her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How did you know she was in the city?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I learned it from—Philip!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was fresh dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So that boy has wormed his way into your confidence!“ said Mrs. Pitkin bitterly. ”After acting so badly that Mr. Pitkin was obliged to discharge him, he ran to you to do us a mischief.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why was he discharged?“ demanded Mr. Carter sternly. ”Why did your husband seize the opportunity to get rid of a boy in whom he knew me to be interested as soon as he thought I was out of the way? Why, moreover, did he refuse the boy a reference, without which Philip could scarcely hope to get employment?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will have to ask Mr. Pitkin. I am sure he had good reason for the course he took. He's an impudent, low upstart in my opinion.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So he is, ma!“ chimed in Alonzo, with heartiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ah! I have something to say to you, Alonzo,“ said Mr. Carter, turning his keen glances upon the boy. ”What became of that letter I gave to you to post just before I went away?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I put it in the letter-box,“ said Alonzo nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know what was in it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered Alonzo, but he looked frightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There were ten dollars in it. That letter never reached Phil, to whom it was addressed.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I—don't know anything about it,“ faltered Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There are ways of finding out whether letters have been posted,“ said Mr. Carter. ”I might put a detective on the case.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alonzo turned pale, and looked much discomposed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of what are you accusing my boy?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin, ready to contend for her favorite. ”So that boy has been telling lies about him, has he? and you believe scandalous stories about your own flesh and blood?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not exactly that, Lavinia.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, your near relation, and that on the testimony of a boy you know nothing about. When Lonny is so devoted to you, too!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I never noticed any special devotion,“ said Mr. Carter, amused. ”You are mistaken, however, about Philip trying to injure him. I simply asked Philip whether he had received such a letter, and he said no.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I dare say he did receive it,“ said Mrs. Pitkin spitefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We won't argue the matter now,“ said the old gentleman. ”I will only say that you and Alonzo, and Mr. Pitkin also, have gone the wrong way to work to secure my favor. You have done what you could to injure two persons, one your own cousin, because you were jealous.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You judge me very hardly, uncle,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, seeing that she must adopt a different course.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have no bad feeling against Rebecca, and as to the boy, I will ask my husband to take him back into the store. I am sure he will do it, because you wish it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't wish it,“ answered Mr. Carter, rather unexpectedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, well,“ answered Mrs. Pitkin, looking relieved, ”that is as you say.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have other views for Philip,“ said Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is with me as my private secretary.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is he living with you?“ asked his niece, in alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There was no need of taking a stranger, Uncle Oliver. We should be glad to have Alonzo act as your secretary, though of course we should want him to stay at home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shall not deprive you of Alonzo,“ said Mr. Carter, with a tinge of sarcasm in his tone. ”Philip will suit me better.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter turned and resumed his packing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you quite determined to leave us?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin, in a subdued tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; it will be better.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But you will come back—say after a few weeks?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I think not,“ he answered dryly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And shall we not see you at all?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, I shall call from time to time, and besides, you will know where I am, and can call whenever you desire.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”People will talk about your leaving us,“ complained Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Let them talk. I never agreed to have my movements controlled by people's gossip. And now, Lavinia, I shall have to neglect you and resume my packing. To-morrow I shall bring Philip here to help me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Would you like to have Alonzo help you, Uncle Oliver?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This offer, much to Alonzo's relief, was declined. He feared that he should be examined more closely by the old gentleman about the missing money, which at that very moment he had in his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Pitkin went down stairs feeling angry and baffled. All that she had done to retain her ascendency over Uncle Oliver had failed, and Mrs. Forbush and Philip seemed to have superseded herself and Alonzo in his regard. She conferred with Mr. Pitkin on his return from the store, but the more they considered the matter the worse it looked for their prospects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Could anything be done?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIX. A TRUCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NO MORE distasteful news could have come to the Pitkins than to learn that Philip and their poor cousin had secured a firm place in the good graces of Uncle Oliver. Yet they did not dare to show their resentment. They had found that Uncle Oliver had a will of his own, and meant to exercise it. Had they been more forbearing he would still be an inmate of their house instead of going over to the camp of their enemies, for so they regarded Mrs. Forbush and Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hate that woman, Mr. Pitkin!“ said his wife fiercely. ”I scorn such underhanded work. How she has sneaked into the good graces of poor, deluded Uncle Oliver!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have played your cards wrong, Lavinia,“ said her husband peevishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I? That is a strange accusation, Mr. Pitkin. It was you, to my thinking. You sent off that errand boy, and that is how the whole thing came about. If he had been in your store he wouldn't have met Uncle Oliver down at the pier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You and Alonzo persuaded me to discharge him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, of course it's Alonzo and me! When you see Rebecca Forbush and that errand boy making ducks and drakes out of Uncle Oliver's money you may wish you had acted more wisely.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Really, Lavinia, you are a most unreasonable woman. It's no use criminating and recriminating. We must do what we can to mend matters.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What can we do?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They haven't got the money yet—remember that! We must try to re-establish friendly relations with Mr. Carter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps you'll tell me how?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly! Call as soon as possible at the house on Madison Avenue.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Call on that woman?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; and try to smooth matters over as well as you can. Take Alonzo with you, and instruct him to be polite to Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't believe Lonny will be willing to demean himself so far.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He'll have to,“ answered Mr. Pitkin firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We've all made a mistake, and the sooner we remedy it the better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Pitkin thought it over. The advice was unpalatable, but it was evidently sound. Uncle Oliver was rich, and they must not let his money slip through their fingers. So, after duly instructing Alonzo in his part, Mrs. Pitkin, a day or two later, ordered her carriage and drove in state to the house of her once poor relative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is Mrs. Forbush at home?“ she asked of the servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I believe so, madam,“ answered a dignified man-servant,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Take this card to her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Pitkin and Alonzo were ushered into a drawing-room more elegant than their own. She sat on a sofa with Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who would think that Rebecca Forbush would come to live like this?“ she said, half to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And that boy,“ supplemented Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To be sure! Your uncle is fairly infatuated.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Mrs. Forbush entered, followed by her daughter. She was no longer clad in a shabby dress, but wore an elegant toilet, handsome beyond her own wishes, but insisted upon by Uncle Oliver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad to see you, Lavinia,“ she said simply. ”This is my daughter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julia, too, was stylishly dressed, and Alonzo, in spite of his prejudices, could not help regarding this handsome cousin with favor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not propose to detail the interview. Mrs. Pitkin was on her good behavior, and appeared very gracious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Forbush could not help recalling the difference between her demeanor now and on the recent occasion, when in her shabby dress she called at the house in Twelfth Street, but she was too generous to recall it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As they were about to leave, Mr. Carter and Philip entered the room, sent for by Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you do, Philip?“ said Mrs. Pitkin, graciously. ”Alonzo, this is Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do?“ growled Alonzo, staring enviously at Phil's handsome new suit, which was considerably handsomer than his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, Alonzo.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You must come and see Lonny,“ said Mrs. Pitkin pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you!“ answered Phil politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not say it was a pleasure, for he was a boy of truth, and he did not feel that it would be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Uncle Oliver was partially deceived by his niece's new manner. He was glad that there seemed to be a reconciliation, and he grew more cordial than he had been since his return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After awhile Mrs. Pitkin rose to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she was fairly in the carriage once more, she said passionately:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How I hate them!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You were awful sweet on them, ma!“ said Alonzo, opening his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I had to be. But the time will come when I will open the eyes of Uncle Oliver to the designs of that scheming woman and that artful errand boy.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Mrs. Pitkin's true self that spoke.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXX. PHIL'S TRUST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AMONG the duties which devolved upon Phil was Mr. Carter's bank business. He generally made deposits for Uncle Oliver, and drew money on his personal checks whenever he needed it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has already been said that Mr. Carter was a silent partner in the firm of which Mr. Pitkin was the active manager. The arrangement between the partners was, that each should draw out two hundred dollars a week toward current expenses, and that the surplus, if any, at the end of the year, should be divided according to the terms of the partnership.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Phil first presented himself with a note from Mr. Carter, he was an object of attention to the clerks, who knew that he had been discharged by Mr. Pitkin. Yet here he was, dressed in a new suit provided with a watch, and wearing every mark of prosperity. One of the most surprised was Mr. G. Washington Wilbur, with whom, as an old friend, Phil stopped to chat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is old Pitkin going to take you back?“ he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No,“ answered Phil promptly. ”He couldn't have me if he wanted me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Have you got another place?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What's the firm?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It isn't in business. I am private secretary to Mr. Carter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur regarded him with surprise and respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it a soft place?“ he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's a very pleasant place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What wages do you get?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Twelve dollars a week and board.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't mean it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I do.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Say, doesn't he want another secretary?“ asked Mr. Wilbur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, I think not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'd like a place of that sort. You're a lucky fellow, Phil.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I begin to think I am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course you don't live at the old place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; I live on Madison Avenue. By the way, Wilbur, how is your lady-love?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Wilbur looked radiant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think I'm getting on,“ he said. ”I met her the other evening, and she smiled.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is encouraging,“ said Phil, as soberly as possible. ”All things come to him who waits! That's what I had to write in my copy-book once.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was received by Mr. Pitkin with more graciousness than he expected. He felt that he must do what he could to placate Uncle Oliver, but he was more dangerous when friendly in his manner than when he was rude and impolite. He was even now plotting to get Phil into a scrape which should lose him the confidence of Uncle Oliver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Generally Phil was paid in a check payable to the order of Mr. Carter. But one Saturday two hundred dollars in bills were placed in his hands instead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You see how much confidence I place in your honesty,“ said Mr. Pitkin. ”You couldn't use the check. This money you could make off with.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It would be very foolish, to say the least,“ responded Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course, of course. I know you are trustworthy, or I would have given you a check instead.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Phil left the building he was followed, though he did not know it, by a man looking like a clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah, Phil, you are in danger, though you don't suspect it.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXI. PHIL IS SHADOWED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL felt that he must be more than usually careful, because the money he had received was in the form of bills, which, unlike the check, would be of use to any thief appropriating it. That he was in any unusual danger, however, he was far from suspecting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He reached Broadway, and instead of taking an omnibus, started to walk up-town. He knew there was no haste, and a walk up the great busy thoroughfare had its attractions for him, as it has for many others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Behind him, preserving a distance of from fifteen to twenty feet, walked a dark-complexioned man of not far from forty years of age. Of course Phil was not likely to notice him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whatever the man's designs might be, he satisfied himself at first with simply keeping our hero in view. But as they both reached Bleecker Street, he suddenly increased his pace and caught up with Phil. He touched the boy on the shoulder, breathing quickly, as if he had been running.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil turned quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you want me, sir?“ he asked, eying the stranger in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know. Perhaps I am mistaken. Are you in the employ of Mr. Oliver Carter?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ah I then you are the boy I want. I have bad news for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Bad news!“ repeated Phil, alarmed. ”What is it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Carter was seized with a fit in the street half an hour since.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is he—dead?“ asked Phil, in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, no! I think he will come out ail right.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where is he?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In my house. I didn't of course know who he was, but I found in his pocket a letter directed to Oliver Carter, Madison Avenue. There was also a business card. He is connected in business with Mr. Pitkin, is he not?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Phil; ”where is your house?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In Bleecker Street, near by. Mr. Carter is lying on the bed. He is unconscious, but my wife heard him say: `Call Philip.' I suppose that is you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; my name is Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I went around to his place of business, and was told that you had just left there. I was given a description of you and hurried to find you. Will you come to the house and see Mr. Carter?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ answered Phil, forgetting everything except that his kind and generous employer was sick, perhaps dangerously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you; I shall feel relieved. Of course you can communicate with his friends and arrange to have him carried home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; I live at his house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is well.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had turned down Bleecker Street, when it occurred to Phil to say:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't understand how Mr. Carter should be in this neighborhood.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is something I can't explain, as I know nothing about his affairs,“ said the stranger pleasantly. ”Perhaps he may have property on the street.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think so. I attend to much of his business, and he would have sent me if there had been anything of that kind to attend to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I dare say you are right,“ said his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Of course I know nothing about it. I only formed a conjecture.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Has a physician been sent for?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you know of any we can call in?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My wife agreed to send for one on Sixth Avenue,“ said the stranger. ”I didn't wait for him to come, but set out for the store.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nothing could be more ready or plausible than the answers of his new acquaintance, and Phil was by no means of a suspicious temperament. Had he lived longer in the city it might have occurred to him that there was something rather unusual in the circumstances, but he knew that Mr. Carter had spoken of leaving the house at the breakfast-table, indeed had left it before he himself had set out for the store. For the time being the thought of the sum of money which he carried with him had escaped his memory, but it was destined very soon to be recalled to his mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had nearly reached Sixth Avenue, when his guide stopped in front of a shabby brick house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is where I live,“ he said. ”We will go in.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He produced a key, opened the door, and Phil accompanied him up a shabby staircase to the third floor. He opened the door of a rear room, and made a sign to Phil to enter.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXII. PHIL IS ROBBED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN he was fairly in the room Phil looked about him expecting to see Mr. Carter, but the room appeared unoccupied. He turned to his companion, a look of surprise on his face, but he was destined to be still more surprised, and that not in a pleasant way. His guide had locked the door from the inside and put the key in his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What does that mean?“ asked Phil, with sudden apprehension.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you refer to?“ asked his guide with an unpleasant smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why do you lock the door?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I thought it might be safest,“ was the significant answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't believe Mr. Carter is in the house at all,“ said Phil quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't believe he is either, youngster.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why did you tell me he was here?“ demanded Phil, with rising indignation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I thought you wouldn't come if I didn't,“ replied his companion nonchalantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Answer me one thing, is Mr. Carter sick at all?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not that I know of.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I am trapped!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Precisely. You may as well know the truth now.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil had already conjectured the reason why he had been enticed to this poor dwelling. The two hundred dollars which he had in his pocket made him feel very uncomfortable. I think I may say truly that if the money had been his own he would have been less disturbed. But he thought, with a sinking heart, that if the money should be taken from him, he would himself fall under suspicion, and he could not bear to have Mr. Carter think that he had repaid his kindness with such black ingratitude. He might be mistaken. The man before him might not know he had such a sum of money in his possession, and of course he was not going to give him the information.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad Mr. Carter is all right,“ said Phil. ”Now tell me why you have taken such pains to get me here?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, as to that,“ said his companion, ”there were at least two hundred good reasons.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil turned pale, for he understood now that in some way his secret was known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you mean?“ he asked, not wholly able to conceal his perturbed feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You know well enough, boy,“ said the other significantly. ”You've got two hundred dollars in your pocket. I want it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Are you a thief, then?“ said Phil, with perhaps imprudent boldness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Just take care what you say. I won't be insulted by such a whipper-snapper as you. You'd better not call names. Hand over that money!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you know I have any money?“ Phil asked, trying to gain a little time for deliberation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No matter. Hand it over, I say!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't take it!“ said Phil, agitated. ”It isn't mine!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you needn't mind giving it up.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It belongs to Mr. Carter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He has plenty more.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But he will think I took it. He will think I am dishonest.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is nothing to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Let me go,“ pleaded Phil, ”and I will never breathe a word about your wanting to rob me. You know you might get into trouble for it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's all bosh! The money, I say!“ said the man sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't give it to you!“ said Phil boldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You won't, hey? Then I shall have to take it. If I hurt you, you will have yourself to blame.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying the man seized Phil, and then a struggle ensued, the boy defending himself as well as he could. He made a stouter resistance than the thief anticipated, and the latter became irritated with the amount of trouble he had to take it. I should be glad to report that Phil made a successful defense, but this was hardly to be expected. He was a strong boy, but he had to cope with a strong man, and though right was on his side, virtue in his case had to succumb to triumphant vice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was thrown down, and when prostrate, with the man's knee on his breast, the latter succeeded in stripping him of the money he had so bravely defended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There, you young rascal!“ he said, as he rose to his feet; ”you see how much good you have done. You might as well have given up the money in the first place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was my duty to keep it from you, if I could,“ said Phil, panting with his exertions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, if that's any satisfaction to you, you're welcome to it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went to the door and unlocked it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”May I go now?“ asked Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not much. Stay where you are!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A moment later and Phil found himself alone and a prisoner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil is seized, thrown down and robbed of his money. Phil lying on the bedroom floor as the robber stands over him with money in his hand.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIII. A TERRIBLE SITUATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL tried the door, but now it was locked on the outside, and he found that he was securely trapped. He went to the window, but here, too, there was no chance of escape. Even if he had been able to get safely out, he would have landed in a back-yard from which there was no egress except through the house, which was occupied by his enemies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What shall I do?“ Phil asked himself, despairingly. ”Mr. Carter will be anxious about me, and perhaps he may think I have gone off with the money!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This to Phil was the worst of his troubles. He prized a good reputation and the possession of an honorable name, and to be thought a thief would distress him exceedingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What a fool I was to walk into such a trap!“ he said to himself. ”I might have known Mr. Carter would not be in such a neighborhood.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was too severe upon himself. I suspect that most of my boy readers, even those who account themselves sharp, might have been deceived as easily. The fact is, rogues are usually plausible, and they are so trained in deception that it is no reflection upon their victims that they allow themselves to be taken in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hours passed, and still Phil found himself a prisoner. Each moment he became more anxious and troubled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How long will they keep me?“ he asked himself. ”They can't keep me here forever.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About six o'clock the door was opened slightly, and a plate of bread and butter was thrust in, together with a glass of cold water. Who brought it up Phil did not know, for the person did not show himself or herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil ate and drank what was provided, not that he was particularly hungry, but he felt that he must keep up his strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”They don't mean to starve me, at any rate,“ he reflected. ”That is some consolation. While there is life, there is hope.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little over an hour passed. It became dark in Phil's prison, but he had no means of lighting the gas. There was a small bed in the room, and he made up his mind that he must sleep there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All at once there was a confused noise and disturbance. He could not make out what it meant, till above all other sounds he heard the terrible cry of ”Fire!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Fire! Where is it?“ thought Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not long before he made a terrible discovery. It was the very house in which he was confined! There was a trampling of feet and a chorus of screams. The smoke penetrated into the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Heavens! Am I to be burned alive!“ thought our poor hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He jumped up and down on the floor, pounded frantically on the door, and at last the door was broken open by a stalwart fireman, and Phil made his way out, half-suffocated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once in the street, he made his way as fast as possible homeward.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIV. PHIL'S FRIENDS AND HIS ENEMIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEANWHILE, Phil's long absence had excited anxiety and alarm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What can have become of Philip?“ said Mr. Carter when supper time came and he did not arrive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't think,“ answered Mrs. Forbush. ”He is generally very prompt.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is what makes me feel anxious. I am afraid something must have happened to him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you send him anywhere, Uncle Oliver?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; he called, as usual, to get my check from Mr. Pitkin.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And he ought to have been here earlier?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly. He wouldn't have to wait for that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Philip is very careful. I can't think that he has met with an accident.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Even the most prudent and careful get into trouble sometimes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were finally obliged to sit down to supper alone. None of the three enjoyed it. Not only Mr. Carter and Mrs. Forbush, but Julia was anxious and troubled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I didn't know I cared so much for the boy,“ said Uncle Oliver. ”He has endeared himself to me. I care nothing for the loss of the money if he will only return safe.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about a quarter of eight when the door-bell rang, and the servant ushered in Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin and Alonzo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the usual greetings were interchanged, Mrs. Pitkin said, looking about her:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where is Philip?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are very much concerned about him,“ said Mr. Carter, his face showing his trouble. ”He has not been home since morning. Did he call at your store, Pitkin?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hasn't he been home since?“ asked Pitkin, in a tone unpleasantly significant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No. At what time did he leave the store?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hours since. I—I am not sure but I may be able to throw some light on his failure to return.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do so, if you can!“ said Uncle Oliver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In place of giving him a check, I gave the boy two hundred dollars in bills.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't you see? The temptation has proved too strong for him. I think, Uncle Oliver, you won't see him back in a hurry.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you mean to say the boy would steal?“ demanded the old gentleman indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think it more than likely that he has appropriated the money.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am sure he has not,“ said Mrs. Forbush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And so am I,“ chimed in Julia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pitkin shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So you think,“ he answered; ”but I don't agree with you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Nor I!“ said Mrs. Pitkin, nodding her head vigorously. ”I never had any confidence in the boy. I don't mind telling you now that I have warned Alonzo not to get too intimate with him. You remember it, Lonny?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes'm,“ responded Lonny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you think the boy capable of appropriating the money?“ asked Mr. Carter quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I do.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, I don't!“ said Uncle Oliver emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are very easily deceived,“ said Mrs. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't be too sure of that,“ returned Mr. Carter, with a significant glance, that made his niece feel uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I suspect you will have to admit it,“ said Mr. Pitkin. ”If, contrary to my anticipation, the boy returns, and brings the money with him, I will own myself mistaken.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then the front door was heard to open; there was a sound of steps in the hall, and Phil came hurriedly into the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. and Mrs. Pitkin exchanged looks of surprise and dismay; but Mrs. Forbush, her daughter and Uncle Oliver looked delighted.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXV. THE PITKINS RETIRE IN DISGUST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHERE have you been, Philip?“ asked Mr. Carter, breaking the silence. ”We were getting anxious about you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have bad news for you, sir,“ returned Phil, saying what stood first in his mind. ”I have lost the two hundred dollars Mr. Pitkin paid me this morning.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So you lost it?“ observed Mr. Pitkin with a sneer, emphasizing the word ”lost“ to show his incredulity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir, I lost it,“ answered Phil, looking him fearlessly in the eye; ”or, rather, it was stolen from me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh! now it is stolen, is it?“ repeated Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Really, Uncle Oliver, this is getting interesting.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I believe I am the proper person to question Philip,“ said Mr. Carter coldly. ”It was my money, I take it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it was yours. As I made the payment, I cannot, of course, be responsible for its not reaching you. You will pardon my saying that it would have been wiser to employ a different messenger.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why?“ demanded Uncle Oliver, looking displeased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, really, Uncle Oliver,“ said Mr. Pitkin, ”I should think the result might convince you of that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We had better let Philip tell his story,“ said Mr. Carter quietly. ”How did it happen, Philip?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thereupon Philip told the story already familiar to the reader.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Upon my word, quite a romantic story!“ commented Mr. Pitkin, unable to repress a sneer. ”So you were tracked by a rascal, lured into a den of thieves, robbed of your money, or, rather, Mr. Carter's, and only released by the house catching fire?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is exactly what happened to me, sir,“ said Philip, coloring with indignation, for he saw that Mr. Pitkin was doing his best to discredit him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It quite does credit to your imagination. By the way, boy, have you been in the habit of reading dime novels?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I never read one in my life, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I think you would succeed in writing them. For a boy of sixteen, you certainly have a vivid imagination.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I quite agree with my husband,“ said Mrs. Pitkin. ”The boy's story is ridiculously improbable. I can't understand how he has the face to stand there and expect Uncle Oliver to swallow such rubbish.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't expect you to believe it, either of you,“ said Philip manfully, ”for you have never treated me fairly.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think you will find, also, that my uncle is too sensible a man to credit it, also,“ retorted Mrs Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Speak for yourself, Lavinia,“ said Mr. Carter, who had waited intentionally to let his relatives express themselves. ”I believe every word of Philip's story.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You do?“ ejaculated Mrs. Pitkin, rolling her eyes and nodding her head, in the vain endeavor to express her feelings. ”Really, Uncle Oliver, for a man of your age and good sense—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Thank you for that admission, Lavinia,“ said Mr. Carter mockingly. ”Go on.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I was about to say that you seem infatuated with this boy, of whom we know nothing, except from his own account. To my mind his story is a most ridiculous invention.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Pitkin, did any one enter your store just after Philip left it to inquire after him?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, sir,“ answered Pitkin triumphantly. ”That's a lie, at any rate.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will remember that Philip did not make the assertion himself. This was the statement of the thief who robbed him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, of course,“ sneered Pitkin. ”He told his story very shrewdly.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Carter,“ said Philip, ”I can show you or any one else the house in which I was confined in Bleecker Street, and there will be no trouble in obtaining proof of the fire.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I dare say there may have been such a fire,“ said Mr. Pitkin, ”and you may have happened to see it, and decided to weave it into your story.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think I stole the money or used it for my own purpose?“ asked Philip pointedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pitkin shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young man,“ he said, ”upon this point I can only say that your story is grossly improbable. It won't hold water.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Permit me to judge of that, Mr. Pitkin,“ said Mr. Carter. ”I wish to ask you one question.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To ask me a question!“ said Pitkin, surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes; why did you pay Philip in bills to-day? Why didn't you give him a check, as usual?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why,“ answered Pitkin, hesitating, ”I thought it wouldn't make any difference to you. I thought you would be able to use it more readily.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did you suppose I would specially need to use money instead of a check this week? Why break over your usual custom?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Really, I didn't give much thought to the matter,“ answered Pitkin, hesitating. ”I acted on a sudden impulse.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your impulse has cost me two hundred dollars. Do me the favor, when Philip calls next week, to hand him a check.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You mean to retain him in your employ after this?“ asked Mrs. Pitkin sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, I do. Why shouldn't I?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You are very trustful,“ observed the lady, tossing her head. ”If this had happened to Lonny here, we should never have heard the last of it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps not!“ responded the old gentleman dryly. ”When a young gentleman is trusted with a letter to mail containing money, and that letter never reaches its destination, it may at least be inferred that he is careless.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be remember that this was the first knowledge Mrs. Pitkin or her husband had of the transaction referred to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you mean, Uncle Oliver?“ demanded Mr. Pitkin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Carter explained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This is too much!“ said Mrs. Pitkin angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You mean to accuse my poor boy of opening the letter and stealing the money?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If I was as ready to bring accusations as you, Lavinia, I should undoubtedly say that it looked a little suspicious, but I prefer to let the matter rest.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think, Mr. Pitkin, we had better go,“ said Mrs. Pitkin, rising with dignity. ”Since Uncle Oliver chooses to charge his own nephew with being a thief—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I beg pardon, Lavinia, I have not done so.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You might just as well,“ said Lavinia Pitkin, tossing her head. ”Come, Mr. Pitkin; come, my poor Lonny, we will go home. This is no place for you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good-evening, Lavinia,“ said Mr. Carter calmly. ”I shall be glad to see you whenever you feel like calling.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When you have discharged that boy, I may call again,“ said Mrs. Pitkin spitefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will have to wait some time, then. I am quite capable of managing my own affairs.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mr. Pitkin had left the house, by no means in a good humor, Phil turned to his employer and said gratefully:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Carter, for your kind confidence in me. I admit that the story I told you is a strange one, and I could not have blamed you for doubting me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”But I don't doubt you, my dear Philip,“ said Mr. Carter kindly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Nor I,“ said Mrs. Forbush. ”I feel provoked with Lavinia and her husband for trying to throw discredit upon your statement.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In fact,“ said Mr. Carter humorously, ”the only one of us that suspected you was Julia.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Uncle Oliver!“ exclaimed Julia, in dismay. ”I never dreamed of doubting Phil.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then,“ said Mr. Carter, ”it appears that you have three friends, at least.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If,“ said Phil? ”you would allow me to make up part of the loss, by surrendering a part of my salary—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Couldn't be thought of, Philip!“ said Uncle Oliver resolutely. ”I don't care for the money, but I should like to know how the thief happened to know that to-day you received money instead of a check.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without saying a word to Phil, Uncle Oliver called the next day on a noted detective and set him to work ferreting out the secret.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVI. THE FALSE HEIR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN THE suburbs of Chicago, perhaps a dozen miles from the great city, stands a fine country house, in the midst of a fine natural park. From the cupola which surmounts the roof can be seen in the distance the waters of Lake Michigan, stretching for many miles from north to south and from east to west, like a vast inland sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The level lawns, the greenhouses, the garden with rare plants and flowers, show clearly that this is the abode of a rich man. My readers will be specially interested to know that this is the luxurious and stately home of Mr. Granville, whose son's fortunes we have been following.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This, too, is the home of Mrs. Brent and Jonas, who, under false representations, have gained a foothold in the home of the Western millionaire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Surely it is a great change for one brought up like Jonas to be the recognized heir and supposed son of so rich a man! It is a change, too, for his mother, who, though she dare not avow the relationship, is permitted to share the luxury of her son. Mrs. Brent has for her own use two of the best rooms in the mansion, and so far as money can bring happiness, she has every right to consider herself happy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is she?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not as happy as she anticipated. To begin with, she is always dreading that some untoward circumstance will reveal the imposition she has practiced upon Mr. Granville. In that case what can she expect but to be ejected in disgrace from her luxurious home? To be sure, she will have her husband's property left, but it would be a sad downfall and descent in the social scale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides, she finds cause for anxiety in Jonas, and the change which his sudden and undeserved elevation has wrought in him. It requires a strong mind to withstand the allurements and temptations of prosperity, and Jonas is far from possessing a strong mind. He is, indeed, if I may be allowed the expression, a vulgar little snob, utterly selfish, and intent solely upon his own gratification. He has a love for drink, and against the protests of his mother and the positive command of Mr. Granville, indulges his taste whenever he thinks he can do so without fear of detection. To the servants he makes himself very offensive by assuming consequential airs and a lordly bearing, which excites their hearty dislike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He is making his way across the lawn at this moment. He is dressed in clothes of the finest material and the most fashionable cut. A thick gold chain is displayed across his waistcoat, attached to an expensive gold watch, bought for him by his supposed father. He carries in his hand a natty cane, and struts along with head aloft and nose in the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two under-gardeners are at work upon a flowerbed as he passes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What time is it, Master Philip?“ says one, a boy about a year older than Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My good boy,“ said Jonas haughtily, ”I don't carry a watch for your benefit.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gardener bit his lip, and surveyed the heir with unequivocal disgust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well,“ he retorted; ”I'll wait till a gentleman comes this way.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A flush of anger was visible on the cheek of Jonas despite his freckles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you mean to say I'm not a gentleman!“ he demanded angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You don't act like one,“ returned Dan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better not be impertinent to me!“ exclaimed Jonas, his small gray eyes flashing with indignation. ”Take that back!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't, for it's true!“ said Dan undauntedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Take that, then!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas raised his cane and brought it down smartly on the young gardener's shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He soon learned that he had acted imprudently. Dan dropped his rake, sprang forward, and seizing the cane, wrenched it from the hands of the young heir, after which he proceeded to break it across his knee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There's your cane!“ he said contemptuously, as he threw the pieces on the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What did you do that for?“ demanded Jonas, outraged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Because you insulted me. That's why.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How can I insult you? You're only a poor working boy!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wouldn't change places with you,“ said Dan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'd like well enough to be rich, but I wouldn't be willing to be as mean as you are.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'll suffer for this!“ said Jonas, his little bead-like eyes glowing with anger. ”I'll have you turned off this very day, or as soon as my father get's home.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If he says I'm to go, I'll go!“ said Dan. ”He's a gentleman.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas made his way to his mother's room. She noticed his perturbed look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What's the matter, my dear boy?“ she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What's the matter, Jonas?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish you'd stop calling me your dear boy,“ said Jonas angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I—I forget sometimes,“ said Mrs. Brent, with a half-sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you ought not to forget. Do you want to spoil everything?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are alone now, Jonas, and I cannot forget that I am your mother.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better, if you know what's best for both of us,“ said Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent was far from being a kind-hearted woman. Indeed she was very cold, but Jonas was her only son, and to him she was as much attached as it was possible for her to be to any one. Formerly he had returned her affection in a slight degree, but since he had figured as a rich man's son and heir he had begun, incredible as it may appear, to look down upon his own mother. She was not wholly ignorant of this change in his feelings, and it made her unhappy. He was all she had to live for. But for him she would not have stooped to take part in the conspiracy in which she was now a participant. It seemed hard that her only son, for whom she had sinned, should prove so ungrateful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My boy,“ she said, ”I would not on any account harm you or injure your prospects, but when we are alone there can be no harm in my treating you as my son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It can't do any good,“ grumbled Jonas, ”and we might be overheard.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will be cautious. You may be sure of that. But why do you look so annoyed?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why? Reason enough. That boy Dan, the under-gardener, has been impudent to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He has?“ said Mrs. Brent quickly. ”What has he done?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas rehearsed the story. He found in his mother a sympathetic listener.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is bold!“ she said, compressing her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, he is. When I told him I would have him turned off, he coolly turned round and said that my father was a gentleman, and wouldn't send him away. Ma, will you do me a favor?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is it, Jonas?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Send him off before the governor gets home. You can make it all right with him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mr. Granville might think I was taking a liberty.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, you can make it all right with him. Say that he was very impudent to me. After what has happened, if he stays he'll think he can treat me just as he pleases.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again Mrs. Brent hesitated, but her own inclination prompted her to do as her son desired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You may tell Dan to come here. I wish to speak to him,“ she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas went out and did the errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent wants to see me?“ said Dan. ”I have nothing to do with her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'd better come in if you know what's best for yourself.“ said Jonas, with an exultation he did not attempt to conceal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, well, I have no objection to meeting Mrs. Brent,“ said Dan. ”I'll go in.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent eyed the young gardener with cold animosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have been impudent to Master Philip,“ she said. ”Of course you cannot remain any longer in his father's employment. Here are five dollars— more than is due you. Take it, and leave the estate.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't take your money, Mrs. Brent,“ said Dan independently, ”and I won't take my dismissal from any one but Mr. Granville himself.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you defy me, then?“ said Mrs. Brent, with a firmer compression of her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Mrs. Brent, I don't defy you, but you have nothing to do with me, and I shall not take any orders or any dismissal from you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't be impertinent to my—“ burst forth from Jonas, and then he stopped in confusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To your—what?“ asked Dan quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To my—nurse,“ faltered Jonas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dan looked suspiciously from one to the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There's something between those two,“ he said to himself. ”Something we don't know of.“</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVII. MRS. BRENT'S PANIC.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CHAMBERMAID in the Granville household was a cousin of Dan, older by three years. She took a warm interest in Dan's welfare, though there was nothing but cousinly affection between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fresh from his interview with Mrs. Brent, Dan made his way to the kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, Aggie,“ he said, ”I may have to say good-by soon.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What, Dan! You're not for lavin', are you?“ asked Aggie, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent has just given me notice,“ answered Dan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Mrs. Brent! What business is it of her's, and how did it happen, anyway?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She thinks it's her business, and it's all on account of that stuck-up Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Tell me about it, Cousin Dan.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dan did so, and wound up by repeating his young master's unfinished sentence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's my belief,“ he said, ”that there's something between those two. If there wasn't, why is Mrs. Brent here?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, indeed, Dan?“ chimed in Aggie. ”Perhaps I can guess something.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Never you mind. I'll only say I overheard Mrs. Brent one day speaking to Master Philip, but she didn't call him Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What then?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">” Jonas! I'm ready to take my oath she called him Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Perhaps that is his real name. He may have it for his middle name.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't believe it. Dan, I've an idea. I'm going to see Mrs. Brent and make her think I know something. You see?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do as you think best, Aggie. I told her wouldn't take a dismissal from her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent was in her own room. She was not a woman who easily forgave, and she was provoked with Dan, who had defied her authority. She knew very well that in dismissing him she had wholly exceeded her authority, but this, as may readily be supposed, did not make her feel any more friendly to the young gardener. Jonas artfully led her indignation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Dan doesn't have much respect for you, mother,“ he said. ”He doesn't mind you any more than he does a kitchen-girl.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He may find he has made a mistake,“ said Mrs. Brent, a bright red spot in each cheek, indicating her anger. ”He may find he has made a mistake in defying my authority.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wouldn't stand it if I was you, ma.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't!“ said Mrs. Brent decidedly, nodding vigorously and compressing her lips more firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon after a knock was heard at Mrs. Brent's door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come in!“ she said in a sharp, incisive voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door was opened and Aggie entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you want of me, Aggie?“ asked Mrs. Brent, in some surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I hear you've been tellin' Dan he'll have to go,“ said the chambermaid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ answered Mrs. Brent, ”but I fail to see what business it is of yours.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Dan's me cousin, ma'am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's nothing to me. He has been impertinent to Master Philip, and afterward to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I know all about it, ma'am. He told me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you understand why he must leave. He will do well to be more respectful in his next place.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It wasn't his fault, ma'am, accordin' to what he told me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No doubt!“ sneered Mrs. Brent. ”It is hardly likely that he would admit himself to be in fault.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Dan's a good, truthful boy, ma'am.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What did he tell you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moment had come for Aggie's master-stroke, and she fixed her eyes keenly on Mrs. Brent to watch the effect of her words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He said he was at work in the garden, ma'am, when Master Jonas</field>
      <field name="fulltext">” What! “ exclaimed Mrs. Brent, staring at the girl in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He was at work in the garden, ma'am when Master Jonas—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you mean, girl? Who is Master Jonas?“ asked Mrs. Brent, trying to conceal her agitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Did I say Jonas, ma'am. La, what could I be thinking of? Of course I mean Master Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What should have put the name of Jonas into your head?“ demanded Mrs. Brent nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I must have heard it somewhere,“ said Aggie, with a quick, shrewd look out of the corner of her eyes. ”Well, Dan just asked the young master a civil question, and Master Philip, he snapped him up rude-like. Mrs. Brent I think you'd better not make any fuss about Dan. It wasn't so much his fault as the fault of Master Jonas—oh, dear! I beg pardon, I mean Master Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't repeat that ridiculous name again, Aggie!“ said Mrs. Brent. ”Your young master has nothing to do with it. You ought to know that his name is Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I should say so!“ broke in Jonas. ”I ain't goin' to be called out of my name!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”As to Dan,“ proceeded Mrs. Brent. ”I am willing to overlook his impertinence this time. I won't say a word to Mr. Granville, but he must be more careful hereafter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I'm sure I'm obliged to you, ma'am,“ said Aggie demurely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she was out of the room she nodded to herself triumphantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Sure, I've got the old lady under me thumb, but divil a bit I know how. It's all in the word Jonas. When I want a favor, all I've got to do is to say that word. I wonder what it manes now, anyhow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, Aggie communicated to Dan the welcome intelligence that he would have no trouble with Mrs. Brent or Philip, but as to the way in which she had managed she kept that to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I want to think it over,“ she said. ”There's a secret, and it's about Jonas. I'll wait patiently, and maybe I'll hear some more about it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for Mrs. Brent, she was panic-stricken. Uncertain how much Aggie knew, she feared that she knew all. But how could she have discovered it? And was it come to this that she and Jonas were in the power of an Irish chambermaid? It was galling to her pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned to her son when they were left alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How could she have found out?“ she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Found out what, mother?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That your name is Jonas. She evidently knows it. I could see that in her eyes.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She must have heard you calling me so. I've told you more than once, ma, that you must never call me anything but Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is hard to have to keep silent always, never to speak to you as my own boy. I begin to think it is a dear price to pay, Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There you go again, mother!“ said Jonas, peevishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His mother had seated herself and spoke despondently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am afraid it will all come out some day,“ she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It will if you don't take better care, ma. I tell you, it would be the best thing for you to go away. Mr. Granville will give you a good income. If I was left alone, there'd be no fear of its leaking out.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Jonas! would you really have me leave you? Would you really have me live by myself, separated from my only child?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cold as she was, her heart was keenly wounded, for, looking at the boy, she saw that he was in earnest, and that he would prefer to have her go, since thereby he would be safer in the position he had usurped.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVIII. AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. CARTER, can you spare me a couple of days?“ asked Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Certainly, Phil,“ answered the old gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”May I ask how you wish to dispose of the time?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I would like to go to Planktown to see my friends there. It is now some months since I left the village, and I would like to see my old friends.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The desire is a natural one. Your home is broken up, is it not?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, but I can stay at the house of Tommy Kavanagh. I know he will be glad to have me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is strange that your step-mother and her son have left no trace behind them,“ said Mr. Carter thoughtfully. ”It looks suspicious, as if they had some good reason for their disappearance.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can't understand why they should have left Planktown,“ said Philip, appearing puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is the house occupied?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. I hear that a cousin of Mrs. Brent occupies it. I shall call and inquire after her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very well, Philip. Go when you please. You may be sure of a welcome when you return.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”In Planktown, though his home relations latterly had not been pleasant, Philip had many friends, and when he appeared on the street, he met everywhere glances of friendly welcome. One of the first to meet him was Tommy Kavanagh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where did you come from, Phil?“ he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am glad enough to see you. Where are you staying?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Nowhere, Tommy, at present. If your mother can take me in, I will stay at your house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Take you? Yes, and will be glad enough to have you stay with us. You know we live in a small house, but if you don't mind—“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What do you take me for, Tommy?“ Whatever is good enough for you and your mother will be good enough for me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you doing, Phil? You don't look as if you had hard work making a living.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am well fixed now, but I have had some anxious days. But all's well that ends well. I am private secretary to a rich man, and live in a fine brown-stone house on Madison Avenue.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good for you, Phil! I knew you'd succeed.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Where is Mrs. Brent?“ Has anything been heard from her?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think anybody in the village knows where she is—that is, except her cousin, who lives in your old house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is his name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hugh Raynor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What sort of a man is he?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The people in the village don't like him. He lives alone, and I hear that he cooks for himself. He is not at all social, and no one feels very much acquainted with him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I shall call upon him and inquire after Mrs. Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then, Phil, you had better go alone, for he doesn't like callers, and he will be more ready to receive one than two.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip enjoyed his visit, and was busied making calls on his old acquaintances. He was much pleased with the cordiality with which he had been received.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not till the afternoon of the second day that he turned his steps toward the house which had been his home for so long a time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We will precede him, and explain matters which made his visit very seasonable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the sitting-room sat Hugh Raynor, the present occupant of the house. He was a small, dark-complexioned man, with a large Roman nose, and his face was at this moment expressive of discontent. This seemed to be connected with a letter which he had just been reading. Not to keep the reader in suspense, it was mailed at Chicago, and was written by Mrs. Brent. We will quote a paragraph:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You seem to me very unreasonable in expecting me not only to give you the house rent-free, but also to give you a salary. I would like to know what you do to merit a salary. You merely take care of the house. As for that, there are plenty who would be glad to take charge of so good a house, and pay me a fair rent. Indeed, I am thinking that it will be best for me to make some such arrangement, especially as you do not seem satisfied with your sinecure position. You represent me as rolling in wealth. Jonas and I are living very comfortably, and we have nothing to complain of, but that is no reason for my squandering the small fortune left me by my husband. I advise you to be a little more reasonable in your demands, or I shall request you to leave my house.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Selfish as ever,“ muttered Mr. Raynor, after reading this letter over again. ”Cousin Jane never was willing that any one elso should prosper. But she has made a mistake in thinking she can treat me meanly. I am in a position to turn the tables upon her! This paper—if she dreamed I had found it, she would yield to all my demands.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laid his hand upon a paper, folded lengthwise, and presenting the appearance of a legal document.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the paper and read aloud:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To the boy generally known as Philip Brent and supposed, though incorrectly, to be my son, I bequeath the sum of five thousand dollars, and direct the same to be paid over to any one whom he may select as guardian, to hold in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”This will Mrs. Brent carefully concealed,“ continued Mr. Raynor, ”in order to save the money for herself and Jonas. I wonder she was not prudent enough to burn it, or, at any rate, to take it with her when she left Planktown. It is a damaging secret, but I hold it, and I mean to use it, too. Let me see, what is it best to do?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Raynor spent some time in quiet thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed to him that it might be well to hint his discovery in a letter to Mrs. Brent, and to make it the basis of a demand for a generous sum of hush-money—one thousand dollars, at least. He might have decided to do this but for an incident which suggested another course.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door-bell rang, and when he opened the door with some surprise, for callers were few, he saw standing before him a tall, handsome boy, whom he did not recognize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you wish to see me?“ he asked. ”What is your name?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My name is Philip Brent.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What!“ exclaimed Mr. Raynor, in visible excitement, ”are you the son of the late Mr. Brent?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I was always regarded as such,“ answered Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come in, then. I am glad to see you,“ said Mr. Raynor; and Phil entered the house, surprised at a reception much more cordial than he had expected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In that brief moment Mr. Raynor had decided to reveal the secret to Phil, and trust to his gratitude for a suitable acknowledgment. In this way he would revenge himself upon Mrs. Brent, who had treated him so meanly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I have been wishing to see you, for I have a secret of importance to communicate,“ said Mr. Raynor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If it relates to my parents, I know it already,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No; it is something to your advantage. In revealing it I make Mrs. Brent my enemy, and shall forfeit the help she is giving me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”If it is really of advantrge to me, and I am able to make up your loss to you, I will do it,“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is sufficient. I will trust to your honor. You look like a boy who will keep a promise though not legally bound.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You only do me justice, Mr. Raynor.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then cast your eye upon this paper and you will know the secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it a will?“ exclaimed Phil, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, it is the will of the late Gerald Brent. By it he bequeaths to you five thousand dollars.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then he did not forget me,“ said Phil, more pleased with the assurance that he had been remembered than by the sum of money bequeathed to him. ”But why have I not known this before?“ he asked, looking up from the will</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You must ask that of Mrs. Brent!“ said Mr. Raynor significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you think she suppressed it purposely?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I do,“ answered Raynor laconically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I must see her. Where can I find her?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I can only say that her letters to me are mailed in Chicago, but she scrupulously keeps her address a secret.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then I must go to Chicago. May I take this paper with me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. I advise you to put it into the hands of a lawyer for safe keeping. You will not forget that you are indebted to me for it?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Mr. Raynor. I will take care you lose nothing by your revelation.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning Phil returned to New York. Phil is shown the will giving him five thousand dollars. Phil and Mr. Raynor looking over a will.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIX. AT THE PALMER HOUSE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT MAY be readily supposed that Phil's New York friends listened with the greatest attention to his account of what he had learned in his visit to Planktown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your step-mother is certainly an unscrupulous woman,“ said Mr. Carter. ”Doubtless she has left your old town in order to escape accountability to you for your stolen inheritance. What puzzles me however, is her leaving behind such tell-tale evidence. It is a remarkable oversight. Do you think she is aware of the existence of the will?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I think she must be, though I hope not,“ answered Phil. ”I should like to think that she had not conspired to keep back my share of father's estate.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At any rate, the first thing to do is evidently to find her out, and confront her with the evidence of her crime—that is, supposing her to be really culpable.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you approve of my going to Chicago?“ said Phil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Most emphatically. Nay, more—I will go with you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Will you indeed, sir?“ said Phil joyfully. ”You are very kind. I shrank from going alone, being a boy ignorant of business.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”A pretty shrewd boy, however,“ said Mr. Carter, smiling. ”I don't claim much credit, however, as I have some interests in Chicago to which I can attend with advantage personally. I am interested in a Western railroad, the main office of which is in that city.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”When shall we go, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”To-morrow,“ answered Mr. Carter promptly. ”The sooner the better. You may go down town and procure the necessary tickets, and engage sleeping-berths.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here followed the necessary directions, which need not be repeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is enough to say that twenty-four hours later Phil and his employer were passengers on a lightning express train bound for Chicago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They arrived in due season, without any adventure worth naming, and took rooms at the Palmer House.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, it so happened that in the same hotel at the very same moment were three persons in whom Phil was vitally interested. These were Mrs. Brent, Jonas, otherwise called Philip Granville, and Mr. Granville himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me explain their presence in Chicago, when, as we know, Mr. Granville's house was situated at some distance away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jonas had preferred a petition to go to Chicago for a week, in order to attend some of the amusements there to be enjoyed, alleging that it was awfully dull in the country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Granville was inclined to be very indulgent, to make up for the long years in which he had been compelled practically to desert his son. The petition therefore received favor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is only natural that you should wish to see something of the city, my son,“ he said. ”I will grant your request. We will go to Chicago, and remain a week at the Palmer House. Mrs. Brent, will you accompany us?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”With pleasure, Mr. Granville,“ answered that lady. ”It is not dull here for me, still I shall no doubt enjoy a little excitement. At any rate, I shall be best pleased to be where you and your son are.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then so let it be. We will go to-morrow.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One secret wish and scheme of Mrs. Brent has not been referred to. She felt that her present position was a precarious one. She might at any time be found out, and then farewell to wealth and luxury! But if she could induce Mr. Granville to marry her, she would then be secure, even if found out, and Jonas would be the son of Mr. Granville, though detected as a usurper. She, therefore, made herself as agreeable as possible to Mr. Granville, anticipated his every wish, and assumed the character, which she did not possess, of a gracious and feminine woman of unruffled good humor and sweetness of disposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I say, ma,“ Jonas observed on one occasion, ”you've improved ever so much since you came here. You're a good deal better natured than you were.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent smiled, but she did not care to take her son into her confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Here I have no cares to trouble me,“ she said. ”I live here in a way that suits me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But when they were about starting for Chicago, Mrs. Brent felt herself becoming unaccountably depressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Jonas,“ she said, ”I am sorry we are going to Chicago.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Why, ma? We'll have a splendid time.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I feel as if some misfortune were impending over us,“ said his mother, and she shivered apprehensively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it was too late to recede. Besides, Jonas wished to go, and she had no good reason to allege for breaking the arrangement.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XL. A SCENE NOT ON THE BILLS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL was in Chicago, but that was only the first step toward finding those of whom he was in search. Had he been sure that they were in the city, it would have simplified matters, but the fact that Mrs. Brent directed her letters to be sent to that city proved nothing. It did not make it certain that she lived in the town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are only at the beginning of our perplexities, Philip,“ said Mr. Carter. ”Your friends may be near us, or they may be a hundred miles away.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That is true, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”One method of finding them is barred, that of advertising, since they undoubtedly do not care to be found, and an advertisement would only place them on their guard.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What would you advise, sir?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We might employ a detective to watch the post-office, but here again there might be disappointment. Mrs. Brent might employ a third person to call for her letters. However, I have faith to believe that sooner or later we shall find her. Time and patience accomplishes much.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Were you ever a detective, sir?“ asked Phil, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No, Philip, but I have had occasion to employ them. Now how would you like to go to the theater this evening?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Very much, sir.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There is a good play running at McVicker's Theatre. We will go there.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Anywhere will suit me, Mr. Carter.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Young people are easily satisfied,“ he said. ”When they get older they get more fastidious. However, there is generally something attractive at McVicker's.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It so happened that Philip and his employer took a late dinner, and did not reach the theater till ten minutes after the hour. They had seats in the seventh row of orchestra chairs, a very eligible portion of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The curtain had risen, and Philip's attention was given to the stage till the end of the first act. Then he began to look around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly he started and half rose from his seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is the matter, Philip?“ asked Mr. Carter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”There, sir! look there!“ said the boy, in excitement, pointing to two persons in the fourth row in front.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Do you recognize acquaintances, Philip?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is my step-mother and Jonas,“ answered Philip eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is, indeed, wonderful!“ said Mr. Carter, sharing the boy's excitement. ”You are confident, are you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, sir, I couldn't be mistaken about that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Mrs. Brent turned to a gentleman at her side and spoke. It was Mr. Granville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Who is that gentleman?“ said Mr. Carter reflectively. ”Do you think Mrs. Brent is married again?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know what to think!“ said Philip, bewildered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will tell you what to do. You cannot allow these people to elude you. Go to the hotel, ask a direction to the nearest detective office, have a man detailed to come here directly, and let him find, if necessary, where your step-mother and her son are living.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip did so, and it was the close of the second act before he returned. With him was a small, quiet gentleman, of unpretending appearance, but skilled as a detective.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Now,“ continued Mr. Carter, ”you may venture at any time to go forward and speak to your friends—if they can be called such.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't think they can, sir. I won't go till the last intermission.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil was forestalled, however. At the close of the fourth act Jonas happened to look back, and his glance fell upon Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A scared, dismayed look was on his face as he clutched his mother's arm and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Ma, Philip is sitting just back of us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent's heart almost ceased to beat. She saw that the moment of exposure was probably at hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With pale face she whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Has he seen us?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He is looking right at us.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had time to say no more. Philip left his seat, and coming forward, approached the seat of his step-mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How do you do, Mrs. Brent?“ he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stared at him, but did not speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How are you, Jonas?“ continued our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My name isn't Jonas,“ muttered the boy addressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Granville meanwhile had been eagerly looking at Philip. There appeared to be something in his appearance which riveted the attention of the beholder. Was it the voice of nature which spoke from the striking face of the boy?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You have made a mistake, boy,“ said Mrs. Brent, summoning all her nerve. ”I am not the lady you mention, and this boy does not bear the name of Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What is his name, then?“ demanded Philip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My name is Philip Granville,“ answered Jonas quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Is it? Then it has changed suddenly,“ answered Phil, in a sarcastic voice. ”Six months ago, when we were all living at Planktown, your name was Jonas Webb.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You must be a lunatic!“ said Mrs. Brent, with audacious falsehood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”My own name is Philip, as you very well know.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Your name Philip?“ exclaimed Mr. Granville, with an excitement which he found it hard to control.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir; the lady is my step-mother, and this boy is her son Jonas.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And you—whose son are you?“ gasped Mr. Granville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't know, sir. I was left at an early age at a hotel kept by this lady's husband, by my father, who never returned.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Then you must be my son!“ said Mr. Granville. ”You and not this boy!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You, sir? Did you leave me?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I left my son with Mr. Brent. This lady led me to believe that the boy at my side was my son.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here, then, was a sudden and startling occurrence. Mrs. Brent fainted. The strain had been too much for her nerves, strong as they were. Of course she must be attended to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Come with me; I cannot lose sight of you now, my son! “ said Mr. Granville. ”Where are you staying?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”At the Palmer House.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So am I. Will you be kind enough to order a carriage.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent was conveyed to the hotel, and Jonas followed sullenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course Philip, Mr. Granville and M. Carter left the theater.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Later the last three held a conference in the parlor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It took little to convince Mr. Granville that Philip was his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I am overjoyed!“ he said. ”I have never been able to feel toward the boy whom you call Jonas as a father should. He was very distasteful to me.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It was an extraordinary deception on the part of Mrs. Brent,“ said Mr. Carter thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”She is a very unprincipled woman,“ said Mr. Granville. ”Even now that matters have come right, I find it hard to forgive her.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You do not know all the harm she has sought to do your son. The sum of five thousand dollars was left him by Mr. Brent, and she suppressed the will.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Good heavens! is this true?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We have the evidence of it.“ —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day an important interview was held at the Palmer House. Mrs. Brent was forced to acknowledge the imposition she had practiced upon Mr. Granville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What could induce you to enter into such a wicked conspiracy?“ asked Mr. Granville, shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The temptation was strong—I wished to make my son rich. Besides, I hated Philip.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It is well your wicked plan has been defeated; it might have marred my happiness forever.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What are you going to do with me?“ she asked coolly, but not without anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was finally settled that the matter should be hushed up. Philip wished to give up the sum bequeathed him by Mr. Brent; but to this Mr. Granville objected, feeling that it would constitute a premium on fraud. Besides, Mrs. Brent would have the residue of the estate, amounting to nearly ten thousand dollars. Being allowed to do what he chose with this money, he gave it in equal portions to Tommy Kavanagh and Mr. Raynor, who had informed him of the existence of Mr. Brent's will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Brent decided not to go back to Planktown. She judged that the story of her wickedness would reach that village and make it disagreeable for her. She opened a small millinery store in Chicago, and is doing fairly well. But Jonas is her chief trouble, as he is lazy and addicted to intemperate habits. His chances of success and an honorable career are small.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”How can I spare you, Philip?“ said Mr. Carter regretfully. ”I know your father has the best right to you, but I don't like to give you up.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You need not,“ said Mr. Granville. ”I propose to remove to New York; but in the summer I shall come to my estate near Chicago, and hope, since the house is large enough, that I may persuade you and your niece, Mrs. Forbush, to be my guests.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This arrangement was carried out. Mrs. Forbush and her daughter are the recognized heirs of Mr. Carter, who is wholly estranged from the Pitkins. He ascertained, through a detective, that the attack upon Philip by the man who stole from him the roll of bills was privately instigated by Mr. Pitkin himself, in the hope of getting Philip into trouble. Mr. Carter, thereupon, withdrew his capital from the firm, and Mr. Pitkin is generally supposed to be on the verge of bankruptcy. At any rate, his credit is very poor, and there is a chance that the Pitkins may be reduced to comparative poverty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I won't let Lavinia suffer,“ said Uncle Oliver; ”if the worst comes to the worst, I will settle a small income, say twelve hundred dollars, on her, but we can never be friends.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Phil grew older—he is now twenty-one—it seems probable that he and Mr. Carter may be more closely connected, judging from his gallant attentions to Julia Forbush, who has developed into a charming young lady. Nothing would suit Mr. Carter better, for there is no one who stands higher in his regard than Philip Granville, the Errand Boy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XLI. FRED SARGENT'S REVENGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRED SARGENT, upon this day from which my story dates, went to the head of his Latin class, in the high school of Andrewsville. The school was a fine one, the teachers strict, the classes large, the boys generally gentlemanly, and the moral tone pervading the whole, of the very best character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To lead a class in a school like this was an honor of which any boy might have been proud; and Fred, when he heard his name read off at the head of the roll, could have thrown up his well-worn Latin grammar, which he happened to have in his hand just at that moment, and hurrahed. It was quite a wonder to him afterward that he did not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a class, boys are supposed to be generous. I really don't know whether they deserve to be considered so or not, but some four or five only in this large school envied Fred. The rest would probably have hurrahed with him; for Fred was a ”capital good fellow,“ and quite a favorite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Bully for you!“ whispered Ned Brown, his right-hand neighbor; but Ned was instantly disgraced, the eye of the teacher catching the words as they dropped from his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When school was over several of the boys rushed to the spot where Fred—his cap in his hand, and his dark hair blowing about every way—was standing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I say,“ said James Duncan, ”I thought you would get it. You've worked like a Trojan and you deserve it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”It's as good as getting the valedictory,“ said Joe Stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”And that is entering into any college in the land without an examination,“ said Peter Crane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Peter had run shoulder to shoulder with Fred and it does him great credit that, being beaten, he was thoroughly good-natured about it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I say, Fred, you ought to treat for this;“ and Noah Holmes, standing on tiptoe, looked over the heads of the other boys significantly at Fred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I wish I could; but here's all the money I've got,“ said Fred, taking about twenty-five cents from his pocket—all that was left of his monthly allowance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's better than nothing. It will buy an apple apiece. Come on! Let's go down to old Granger's. I saw some apples there big as your head; and bigger, too,“ said Noah, with a droll wink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Well, come on, then;“ and away went the boys at Fred's heels, pushing and shouting, laughing and frolicking, until they came to Abel Granger's little grocery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Now hush up, you fellows,“ said Noah, turning round upon them. ”Let Fred go in by himself. Old Grange can't abide a crowd and noise. It will make him cross, and all we shall get will be the specked and worm-eaten ones. Come, fall back, there!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very quietly and obediently the boys, who always knew their leader, fell back, and Fred went into the little dark grocery alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was so pleasant and gentlemanly that, let him go where he would and do what he would, in some mysterious way he always found the right side of people and got what he wanted, in the most satisfactory manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Abel Granger was ”as cross as a meat axe.“ Noah said, and all the boys were afraid of him. If the apples had been anywhere else they would have been much surer of their treat; but in spite of their fears, back came Fred in a few moments, with a heaping measure of nice red apples—apples that made the boys' mouths water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred said that old Abel had given him as near a smile as could come to his yellow, wrinkled face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Treat 'em,“ he said, ”treat 'em, eh? Wal, now, 'pears likely they'd eat you out of house and home. I never see a boy vet that couldn't go through a tenpenny nail, easy as not.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”We are always hungry, I believe,“ said Fred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Allers, allers—that's a fact,“ picking out the best apples as he spoke and heaping up the measure. ”There, now if you'll find a better lot than that, for the money, you are welcome to it, that's all.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Couldn't do it. Thank you very much,“ said Fred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the boys took the apples eagerly and began to bite them, they saw the old face looking out of the dirty panes of window glass upon them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred loved to make everybody happy around him, and this treating was only second best to leading his class; so when, at the corner of the street turning to his father's house, he parted from his young companions, I doubt whether there was a happier boy in all Andrewsville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not think we shall blame him very much if he unconsciously carried his head pretty high and looked proudly happy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out from under the low archway leading to Bill Crandon's house a boy about as tall as Fred, but stout and coarse, in ragged clothes, stood staring up and down the street as Fred came toward him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Something in Fred's looks and manner seemed especially to displease him. He moved directly into the middle of the sidewalk, and squared himself as if for a fight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no other boy in town whom Fred disliked so much, and of whom he felt so afraid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam Crandon, everybody knew, was a bully. He treated boys who were larger and stronger than himself civilly, but was cruel and domineering over the poor and weak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So far in his life, though they met often, Fred had avoided coming into contact with Sam, and Sam had seemed to feel just a little awe of him; for Mr. Sargent was one of the wealthiest leading men in town, and Sam, in spite of himself, found something in the handsome, gentlemanly boy that held him in check; but to-day Sam's father had just beaten him, and the boy was smarting from the blows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I dare say he was hungry, and uncomfortable from many other causes; but however this may have been, he felt in the mood for making trouble; for seeing somebody else unhappy beside himself. This prosperous, well-dressed boy, with his books under his arm, and his happy face, was the first person he had come across—and here then was his opportunity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred saw him assume the attitude of a prize fighter and knew what it meant. Sam had a cut, red and swollen, across one cheek, and this helped to make his unpleasant face more ugly and lowering than usual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What was to be done? To turn and run never occurred to Fred. To meet him and fight it out was equally impossible; so Fred stopped and looked at him irresolutely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You're afraid of a licking?“ asked Sam, grinning ominously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I don't want to fight,“ said Fred, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”No more you don't, but you've got to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred's blood began to rise. The words and looks of the rough boy were a little too much for his temper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Move out of the way,“ he said, walking directly up to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam hesitated for a moment. The steady, honest, bold look in Fred's eyes was far more effective than a blow would have been; but as soon as Fred had passed him he turned and struck him a quick, stinging blow between his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”That's mean,“ said Fred, wheeling round.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Strike fair and in front if you want to, but don't hit in the back—that's a coward's trick.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Take it there, then,“ said Sam, aiming a heavy blow at Fred's breast. But the latter skillfully raised his books, and Sam's knuckles were the worse for the encounter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Hurt, did it?“ said Fred, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What if it did?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Say quits, then.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Not by a good deal;“ and in spite of himself Fred was dragged into an ignominious street fight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, how grieved and mortified he was when his father, coming down the street, saw and called to him. Hearing his voice Sam ran away and Fred, bruised and smarting, with his books torn and his clothes, too, went over to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not a word did Mr. Sargent say. He took Fred's hand in his, and the two walked silently to their home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I doubt whether Mr. Sargent was acting wisely. Fred never had told him an untruth in his life, and a few words now might have set matters right. But to this roughness in boys Mr. Sargent had a special aversion. He had so often taken pains to instill its impropriety and vulgarity into Fred's mind that he could not now imagine an excuse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He should not have done so under any circumstances,“ said his father sternly, to himself. ”I am both surprised and shocked, and the punishment must be severe.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unfortunately for Fred, his mother was out of town for a few days—a mother so much sooner than a father reaches the heart of her son—so now his father said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You will keep your room for the next week. I shall send your excuse to your teacher. Ellen will bring your meals to you. At the end of that time I will see and talk with you.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without a word Fred hung his cap upon its nail, and went to his room. Such a sudden change from success and elation to shame and condign punishment was too much for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He felt confused and bewildered. Things looked dark around him, and the great boughs of the Norway spruce, close up by his window, nodded and winked at him in a very odd way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had been often reproved, and sometimes had received a slight punishment, but never anything like this. And now he felt innocent, or rather at first he did not feel at all, everything was so strange and unreal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He heard Ellen come into his room after a few minutes with his dinner, but he did not turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A cold numbing sense of disgrace crept over him. He felt as if, even before this Irish girl, he could never hold up his head again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not wish to eat or do anything. What could it all mean?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly the whole position in which he was placed came to him. The boys gathering at school; the surprise with which his absence would be noted; the lost honor, so lately won; his father's sad, grave face; his sisters' unhappiness; his mother's sorrow; and even Sam's face, so ugly in its triumph, all were there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What an afternoon that was! How slowly the long hours dragged themselves away! And yet until dusk Fred bore up bravely. Then he leaned his head on his hands. Tired, hungry, worn out with sorrow, he burst into tears and cried like a baby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Don't blame him. I think any one of us would have done the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, mother! mother!“ said Fred aloud, to himself, ”do come home! do come home!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ellen looked very sympathizing when she came in with his tea, and found his dinner untouched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Eat your tea, Master Fred,“ she said, gently. ”The like of ye can't go without your victuals, no way. I don't know what you've done, but I ain't afeared there is any great harm in it, though your collar is on crooked and there's a tear in your jacket, to say nothing of a black and blue place under your left eye. But eat your tea. Here's some fruit cake Biddy sent o' purpose.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somebody did think of and feel sorry for him! Fred felt comforted on the instant by Ellen's kind words and Biddy's plum cake; and I must say, ate a hearty, hungry boy's supper; then went to bed and slept soundly until late the next morning</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have not space to follow Fred through the tediousness of the following week. His father strictly carried out the punishment to the letter No one came near him but Ellen, though he heard the voices of his sisters and the usual happy home sounds constantly about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Had Fred really been guilty, even in the matter of a street fight, he would have been the unhappiest boy living during this time; but we know he was not, so we shall be glad to hear that with his books and the usual medley of playthings with which a boy's room is piled, he contrived to make the time pass without being very wretched. It was the disgrace of being punished, the lost position in school, and above all, the triumph which it would be to Sam, which made him the most miserable. The very injustice of the thing was its balm in this case. May it be so, my young readers, with any punishment which may ever happen to you!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All these things, however, were opening the way to make Fred's revenge, when it came, the more complete. —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred Sargent, of course, had lost his place, and was subjected to a great many curious inquiries when he returned to school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had done his best, in his room, to keep up with his class, but his books, studied ”in prison,“ as he had learned to call it, and in the sitting-room, with his sister Nellie and his mother to help him, were very different things. Still, ”doing your best“ always brings its reward; and let me say in passing, before the close of the month Fred had won his place again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was more easily done than satisfying the kind inquiries of the boys. So after trying the first day to evade them, Fred made a clean breast of it and told the whole story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think, perhaps, Mr. Sargent's severe and unjust discipline had a far better effect upon the boys generally than upon Fred particularly. They did not know how entirely Fred had acted on the defensive, and so they received a lesson which most of them never forgot on the importance which a kind, genial man, with a smile and a cheery word for every child in town, attached to brawling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After all, the worst effect of this punishment came upon Sam Crandon himself. Very much disliked as his wicked ways had made him before, he was now considered as a town nuisance. Everybody avoided him, and when forced to speak to him did so in the coldest, and often in the most unkind manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam, not three weeks after his wanton assault upon Fred, was guilty of his first theft and of drinking his first glass of liquor. In short, he was going headlong to destruction and no one seemed to think him worth the saving. Skulking by day, prowling by night—hungry, dirty, beaten and sworn at—no wonder that he seemed God-forsaken as well as man-forsaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Sargent had a large store in Rutgers street. He was a wholesale dealer in iron ware, and Andrewsville was such an honest, quiet town ordinary means were not taken to keep the goods from the hands of thieves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Back doors, side doors and front doors stood open all the day, and no one went in or out but those who had dealings with the firm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly, however, articles began to be missed—a package of knives, a bolt, a hatchet, an axe, a pair of skates, flat-irons, knives and forks, indeed hardly a day passed without a new thing being taken, and though every clerk in the store was on the alert and very watchful, still the thief, or thieves remained undetected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last matters grew very serious. It was not so much the pecuniary value of the losses—that was never large—but the uncertainty into which it threw Mr. Sargent. The dishonest person might be one of his own trusted clerks; such things had happened, and sad to say, probably would again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Fred,“ said his father, one Saturday afternoon, ”I should like to have you come down to the store and watch in one of the rooms. There is a great run of business to-day, and the clerks have their hands more than full. I must find out, if possible who it is that is stealing so freely. Yesterday I lost six pearl-handled knives worth two dollars apiece. Can you come?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ said Fred, promptly, ”I will be there at one, to a minute; and if I catch him, let him look out sharp, that is all.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This acting as police officer was new business to Fred and made him feel very important, so when the town clock was on the stroke of one he entered the store and began his patrol.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was fun for the first hour, and he was so much on the alert that old Mr. Stone, from his high stool before the desk, had frequently to put his pen behind his ear and watch him. It was quite a scene in a play to see how Fred would start at the least sound. A mouse nibbling behind a box of iron chains made him beside himself until he had scared the little gray thing from its hole, and saw it scamper away out of the shop. But after the first hour the watching for nothing became a little tedious. There was a ”splendid“ game of base ball to come off on the public green that afternoon; and after that the boys were going to the ”Shaw-seen“ for a swim; then there was to be a picnic on the ”Indian Ridge,“ and—well, Fred had thought of all these losses when he so pleasantly assented to his father's request, and he was not going to complain now. He sat down on a box, and commenced drumming tunes with his heels on its sides. This disturbed Mr. Stone. He looked at him sharply, so he stopped and sauntered out into a corner of the back store, where there was a trap-door leading down into the water. A small river ran by under the end of the store, also by the depot, which was near at hand, and his father used to have some of his goods brought down in boats and hoisted up through this door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was always one of the most interesting places in the store to Fred; he liked to sit with his feet hanging down over the water, watching it as it came in and dashed against the cellar walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To-day it was high, and a smart breeze drove it in with unusual force. Bending down as far as he could safely to look under the store, Fred saw the end of a hatchet sticking out from the corner of one of the abutments that projected from the cellar, to support the end of the store in which the trap-door was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What a curious place this is for a hatchet!“ thought Fred, as he stooped a little further, holding on very tight to the floor above. What he saw made him almost lose his hold and drop into the water below. There, stretched along on a beam was Sam Crandon, with some stolen packages near him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment Fred's astonishment was too great to allow him to speak; and Sam glared at him like a wild beast brought suddenly to bay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, Sam! Sam!“ said Fred, at length, ”how could you?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam caught up a hatchet and looked as if he was going to aim it at him, then suddenly dropped it into the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred's heart beat fast, and the blood came and went from his cheeks; he caught his breath heavily, and the water, the abutment and even Sam with his wicked ugly face were for a moment darkened. Then, recovering himself, he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Was it you, Sam? I'm sorry for you!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't lie!“ said Sam, glowering back, ”you know you're glad!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Glad? Why should I be glad to have you steal?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Cause I licked you, and you caught it.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”So I did; but I am sorry, for all that.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You lie!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred had thought very fast while this conversation was going on. He had only to lift his head and call his father, then the boat would be immediately pushed in under the store, Sam secured and his punishment certain. There were stolen goods enough to convict him, and his mode of ingress into the store was now certain. This trap-door was never locked; very often it was left open—the water being considered the most effectual bolt and bar that could be used; but Sam, a good swimmer and climber, had come in without difficulty and had quite a store of his own hidden away there for future use. This course was very plain; but for some reason, which Fred could not explain even to himself, he did not feel inclined to take it; so he sat looking steadily in Sam's face until he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Look here, Sam, I want to show you I mean what I say. I'm sorry you have turned thief and if I can help you to be a better boy, I should be glad to.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again Fred's honest kindly face had the same effect upon Sam that it had at the commencement of their street fight; he respected and trusted it unconsciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Here!“ said he, crawling along on the beam and handing back the package of knives, the last theft of which his father had complained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, that is right,“ said Fred, leaning down and taking it, ”give them all back, if you can; that is what my father calls `making restitution,' and then you won't be a thief any longer.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Something in the boy's tone touched Sam's heart still more; so he handed back one thing after another as rapidly as he could until nearly everything was restored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Bravo for you, Sam! I won't tell who took them, and there is a chance for you. Here, give me your hand now, honor bright you'll never come here again to steal, if I don't tell my father.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam looked at him a moment, as if he would read his very soul; then he said sulkily:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You'll tell; I know you will, 'cause I licked you when you didn't want me to; but you've got 'em all back, and I s'pose it won't go very hard.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”What won't go very hard?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”The prison.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”You sha'n't go to prison at all. Here, give me your hand; I promise not to tell if you will promise not to steal any more. Ain't that fair?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes,“ said Sam, a sudden change coming over his face, ”but you will!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Try me and see.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sam slowly and really at a great deal of peril, considering his situation, put his rough, grimed hand into Fred's—a dishonest hand it was, and that more than the other thing made Fred recoil a little as he touched it; but that clasp sealed the compact between these two boys. It began Fred Sargent's revenge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Now be off, will you, before the clerks come? They will see the things and catch you here. I'll be round to your house soon and we will see.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even in this short time Fred had formed a general plan for saving Sam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy, stretching himself out flat, slipped down the tranverse beam into the water, dived at once and came up under the bridge a few rods distant, then coolly passed down the river and swam to shore under a bunch of alder-bushes, by which he was concealed from the sight of the passers-by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred sought his father, told him the story, then brought him to the spot, showed the goods which the boy had returned, and begged as a reward for the discovery to be allowed to conceal his name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His father of course hesitated at so unusual a proposition; but there was something so very much in earnest in all Fred did and said that he became convinced it was best, for the present at least, to allow him to have his own way; and this he was very glad he had done when a few days after Fred asked him to do something for Sam Crandon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Sam Crandon?“ he asked in surprise. ”Is not that the very boy I found you fighting in the street with?“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes, sir,“ said Fred, hanging his head, ”but he promises to do well, if he can only find work— honest work; you see, sir, he is so bad nobody helps him.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Sargent smiled. ”A strange recommendation, Fred,“ he said, ”but I will try what can be done. A boy who wants to reform should have a helping hand.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”He does want to—he wants to heartily; he says he does. Father, if you only will!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fred, as he stood there, his whole face lit up with the glow of this generous, noble emotion, never was dearer to his father's heart; indeed his father's eyes were dim, and his voice a little husky, as he said again:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”I will look after him, Fred, for your sake.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so he did; but where and how I have not space now to tell my readers. Perhaps, at some future time, I may finish this story; for the present let me say there is a new boy in Mr. Sargent's store, with rough, coarse face, voice and manners; everybody wonders at seeing him there; everybody prophesies future trouble; but nobody knows that this step up in Sam Crandon's life is Fred Sargent's revenge.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XLII THE SMUGGLER'S TRAP.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HUBERT had accompanied his father on a visit to his uncle, who lived in a fine old country mansion, on the shore of Caermarthen Bay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In front of the house spread a long beach, which terminated in precipitous cliffs and rocky ledges. On the, afternoon of the day following his arrival, he declared his intention of exploring the beach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't get caught in `The Smuggler's Trap,' “ said his uncle, as he mentioned his plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">” `The Smuggler's Trap?' “</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Yes. It's at the end of the beach where you see the cliffs. It's a hollow cave, which you can only walk at very low tide. You'd better not go in there.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Oh, never fear,“ said Hubert carelessly, and in a few minutes he was wandering over the beach, and after walking about two miles reached the end of the beach at the base of the great cliffs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The precipice towered frowningly overhead, its base all worn and furrowed by the furious surges that for ages had dashed against it. All around lay a chaos of huge boulders covered with seaweed. The tide was now at the lowest ebb. The surf here was moderate, for the seaweed on the rocks interfered with the swell of the waters, and the waves broke outside at some distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Between the base of the precipice and the edge of the water there was a space left dry by the ebb tide about two yards in width; and Hubert walked forward over the space thus uncovered to see what lay before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He soon found himself in a place which seemed like a fissure rent in a mountain side, by some extraordinary convulsion of nature. All around rose black, precipitous cliffs. On the side nearest was the precipice by whose base he had passed; while over opposite was a gigantic wall of dark rock, Which extended far out into the sea. Huge waves thundered at its feet and dashed their spray far upward into the air. The space was about fifty yards across.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fissure extended back for about two hundred yards, and there terminated in a sharp angle formed by the abrupt walls of the cliffs which enclosed it. All around there were caverns worn into the base of the precipices by the action of the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The floor of this place was gravelly, but near the water it was strewn with large boulders. Further in there were no boulders and it was easy to walk about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the furthest extremity there was a flat rock that seemed to have fallen from the cliff above in some former age. The cliffs around were about two hundred feet in height. They were perfectly bare, and intensely black. On their storm-riven summits not a sign of verdure appeared. Everything had the aspect of gloom, which was heightened by the mournful monotone of the sea waves as they dashed against the rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the first feeling of awe had passed, Hubert ran forward, leaping from rock to rock, till he came to where the beach or floor of the fissure was gravelly. Over this he walked and hastened to the caverns, looking into them one after another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he busied himself by searching among the pebbles for curious stones and shells. He found here numerous specimens of the rarest and finest treasures of the sea—shells of a delicacy of tint and perfection of outline; seaweeds of new and exquisite forms with rich hues which he had hitherto believed impossible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the hollows of the rocks, where the water yet lay in pools, he found little minnows; and delicate jelly fish, with their long slender fibers; and sea anemones; and sea urchins with their spires extended; and star-fish moving about with their innumerable creepers. It was a new world, a world which had thus far been only visible to him in the aquarium, and now as it stood before him he forgot all else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not feel the wind as it blew in fresh from the sea—the dread ”sou'wester,“ the terror of fishermen. He did not notice the waves that rolled in more furiously from without, and were now beginning to break in wrath upon the rocky ledges and boulders. He did not see that the water had crept on nearer to the cliff, and that a white line of foam now lay on that narrow belt of beach which he had traversed at the foot of the cliff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly a sound burst upon his ears that roused him, and sent all the blood back to his heart. It was his own name, called out in a voice of anguish and almost of despair by his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sprang to his feet, started forward and rushed with the speed of the wind to the place by which he had entered the enclosure. But a barrier lay before him. The rolling waves were there, rushing in over the rocks, dashing against the cliff, tossing their white and quivering spray exulting in the air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At once Hubert knew his danger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was caught in the ”Smuggler's Trap,“ and the full meaning of his uncle's warning flashed upon his mind as in his terror he shrieked back to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then there was silence for a time</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While Hubert had been in the ”Trap,“ his father and uncle had been walking along the beach, and the former heard for the first time the nature and danger of the ”Smuggler's Trap.“ He was at once filled with anxiety about his son, and had hurried to the place to call him back, when to his horror he found that the tide had already covered the only way by which the dangerous place might be approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No sooner had he heard Hubert's answering cry than he rushed forward to try and save him. But the next moment a great wave came rolling in and dashed him upon the cliff. Terribly bruised, he clung to the cliff till the surf fell back, and then ran on again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He slipped over a rock and fell, but instantly regaining his feet he advanced further, and in his haste fell into a hollow which was filled with water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before he could emerge another wave was upon him. This one beat him down, and it was only by clinging to the seaweed that he escaped being sucked back by the retreating surge. Bold and frenzied though he was, he had to start back from the fury of such an assault as this. He rushed backward and waited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His eyes searched wildly around. He noticed that the surf grew more violent every moment, and every moment took away hope. But he would not yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more he rushed forward. The waves rolled in, but he grasped the rocks and withstood the surf, and still advanced. Another followed. He bowed before it, and clinging to the rocks as before came forth triumphant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Already he was nearly halfway. He sprang upon a rock that rose above the level of the seething flood, and stood for a moment panting and gasping. But now a great wave came rolling in upon him. He fell on his knees and clung to the seaweed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The wave struck. It hurled him from the rock. He rolled over and over. Blinded, bruised and half drowned, he felt himself dashed against the cliff. He threw his arms wildly about, but found nothing which he could seize. The retreating wave sucked him back. But a rock stayed him. This he grasped and was saved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then, hastily scrambling to his feet, he staggered back to the place from which he had started. Before he could get back another wave threw him down, and this time he might have been drowned had not his brother plunged in and dragged him out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all this Hubert had seen nothing, and known nothing. He waited for some time in silence, and then called. There was no answer. He called again and again. But at that time his father was struggling with the waves and did not hear him. At last, after what seemed an interminable time, he heard once more his father's voice. He shouted back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Don't be afraid!“ cried the voice. ”I'll get you out. Wait.“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then there were no more voices.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about two o'clock when Hubert had entered the gorge. It was after three when his father had roused him, and made his vain effort to save him. Hubert was now left alone with the rising tide, whose waters rolled forward with fearful rapidity. The beach inside was nearly level and he saw that in an hour or so it would be covered with the waters. He tried to trust to his father's promise, but the precious moments passed and he began to look with terror upon the increasing storm; for every moment the wind grew fiercer, and the surf rolled in with ever increasing impetuosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked all around for a place of refuge, and saw nothing except the rock which arose at the extremity of the place, at the foot of the overhanging cliffs. It was about five feet high, and was the only place that afforded anything like safety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up this he clambered, and from this he could survey the scene, but only to perceive the full extent of his danger. For the tide rushed in more and more swiftly, the surf grew higher and higher and he saw plainly that before long the water would reach the summit of the rock, and that even before then the surf in its violence would sweep him away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moments passed slowly. Minutes seemed in his suspense to be transformed to hours. The sky was overspread now with black clouds; and the gloom increased. At length the waves rolled in until they covered all the beach in front, and began to dash against the rock on which he had taken refuge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The precious moments passed. Higher and higher grew the waters. They came rolling into the cave, urged on by the fury of the billows outside, and heaping themselves up as they were compressed into this narrow gorge. They dashed up around the rock. The spray was tossed in his face. Already he felt their inexorable grasp. Death seemed so near that hope left him. He fell upon his knees with his hands clasped, and his white face upturned. Just then a great wave rolled up and flung itself over the rock, and over his knees as he knelt, and over his hands as he clasped them in prayer. A few more moments and all would be over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As hope left a calmness came—the calmness that is born of despair. Face to face with death, he had tasted the bitterness of death, but now he flung aside the agony of his fear and rose to his feet, and his soul prepared itself for the end. Just then, in the midst of the uproar of wind and wave, there came a sudden sound, which roused to quick, feverish throbs the young lad's heart. It was a voice—and sounded just above him:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">” Hubert! “</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There far above him, in the gloom, he saw faces projecting over the edge of the cliff. The cry came again; he recognized the voice of his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment Hubert could not speak. Hope returned. He threw up his arms wildly, and cried:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">”Make haste! Oh, make haste!“</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A rope was made fast about Hubert's father, and he was let down over the edge of the cliff. He would allow no other than himself to undertake this journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had hurried away and gathered a number of fishermen, whose stout arms and sinewy hands now held the rope by which he descended to save his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a perilous journey. The wind blew and the rope swayed more and more as it was let down, and sometimes he was dashed against the rocky sides of the precipice; but still he descended, and at last stood on the rock and clasped his son in his arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there was no time to lose. Hubert mounted on his father's shoulders, holding the rope while his father bound his boy close to him. Then the word was given, and they were slowly pulled up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They reached the summit in safety, and as they reached it those who looked down through the gloom saw the white foam of the surf as it boiled in fury over the rock where Hubert had been standing.</field>
