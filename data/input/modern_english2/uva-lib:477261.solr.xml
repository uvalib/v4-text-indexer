      <field name="heading_text">Shakespeare's portrait in a locket with accompanying ornamental design A Woman to Shakspere By STEPHEN PHILLIPS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MY days are beyond reproach or breathing of scandal In the placid inland town; No man I owe; as I pass, all stand bareheaded; A tale will empty my purse. Each Sabbath I rustle soft to the seat set apart for me; All eyes in the church are fixed. Faultlessly, dimly attired, my lavender rarest, About me voices are hushed; And sweet is my little garden just after sunrise, Sweet in the coming of night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet, ah, my God! I am lone, lonely forever, Am well, but wither within; And in dead of night I lack the cry of a boy child Or the struggling lisp of a girl. Must I linger on and languish among the townfolk, Who guess not the ache at my soul? Must I drift away to the everlasting lumber That cumbers a thriftless world?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the young wife dies in my street, but really survives me,— At least she has felt in the sun,— And the girl deceived by her lover and thrown from the house-door, Her tears are richer than mine. Yes, better the plunge in Thames, the sudden seeking, Than a death which was never a death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O Shakspere, of women confessor, from whom no secret Of a woman's bosom was hid! Thou from an ancient page, my comforter, comest, Leaping from print to my life. No woman so understood, or sang of a woman, As a man with a poet's heart. Spite of this placid, speckless, reproachless dungeon, Thou understandest; enough!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I read, I am wafted afar, am backward wafted, To the gorgeous-dreaming East. To be young in Egypt, to lie with Cleopatra, To have some Antony's kiss! She drank of a heaven by Nile, a world in the balance; Even with the asp at her breast, She gave as a mother her breast to a mortal baby, For a long immortal kiss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Have centuries past? Shall centuries, then, oppress me, This dimness in place of the glow? This soul can love as they loved, whose stars were huger, This dim town is for a time. For the bare passing of time can touch not my spirit, Though a moment may mar it quite. And often the glimpse of a moon on an ebon night-sky Hath wildered a boy and a girl. For a while I am pent from life, am hindered from living; For a while and but for a while.</field>
