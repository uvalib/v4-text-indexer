      <field name="fulltext">A good example of how much may be done with a modest one or two talents is afforded by Elia W. Peattie's unpretentious little volume, The Edge of Things . The author is in no sense a long-distance writer; she is best at ease in the simple, short storyâ€”and she knows it. And so, in undertaking a more sustained effort, she has frankly adopted the short story form, developing her plot through a series of more or less connected pictures, each complete in itself, yet each forming an essential part of the whole. Her style is simple, too; she is not prodigal of words and phrases; and yet it is a question whether even Norris has pictured with more compelling power the desolation of the Southwestern desert lands, and the morbid influence they have upon men who try to live too long in these regions which are literally the "edge of things." The central theme is not without interest, it concerns a young fellow from the East, who goes out there full of brave plans for building up a golden fortune from his sheep ranch. And then, after a time, luck goes against him, and his sheep die, and his funds run low, and the horror of the desert seizes him, and he thinks he is going mad, like many another poor fellow whose fate he hears of. But from this he is saved by a simple air-castle that he weaves during his hours of loneliness. In the old adobe house, to which he has temporarily fallen heir, he finds a woman's glove; and later, scratched on the wall, a verse in a woman's writing. And from these trifles he reconstructs a personality, and fills the place with the companionship of an imaginary form and face. And for the sake of rounding out the story, the girl whom he has constructed in his day-dreams turns out to be a real person after all. But the value of the book is not in the story, but in the atmosphere, the wonderful sense that you have of loneliness and isolation and endless monotony.</field>
