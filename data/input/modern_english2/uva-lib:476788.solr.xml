      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, A Garden within the Tower. Enter the Lieutenant with a Servant. LIEUTENANT Has King Henry walk'd forth this Morning? SERVANT No, Sir, but 'tis near his Hour. LIEUTENANT At any time when you see him here, Let no Stranger into the Garden: I wou'd not have him star'd at — See ! Who's that Now entring at the Gate ? SERVANT Sir, the Lord Stanley. LIEUTENANT Leave me. — [Ex. Servant. Enter Lord Stanley. Ny Noble Lord you're welcome to the Tower, I heard last Night you late arriv'd with News Of Edward's Victory to his joyful Queen. STANLEY Yes, Sir; and I am proud to be the Man That first brought home the last of Civil Broils, The Houses now of York, and Lancaster, Like Bloody Brothers fighting for Birth-right, No more shall wound the Parent that wou'd part 'em. Edward now sits secure on England's Throne. LIEUTENANT Near Tewkesbury, my Lord I think they fought: Has the Enemy lost any Men of Note ? STANLEY Sir I was Posted Home E're an Account was taken of the Slain, But as I left the Field, a Proclamation From the King was made in Search of Edward, Son to your Prisoner, King Henry the Sixth, Which gave Reward to those Discover'd him, And him his Life, if he'd surrender. LIEUTENANT That Brave Young Prince, I fear's unlike his Father, Too high of Heart to brook submissive Life: This will be heavy News to Henry's Ear: For on thei Battles cast his All was set. STANLEY King Henry, and ill Fortune are familiar: He ever threw with an indifferent Hand, But never yet was known to lose his Patience: How does he pass the Time in his Confinement? LIEUTENANT As one whose Wishes never reacht a Crown, The King seems Dead in him: But as a man He sighs sometimes in want of Liberty. Sometimes he Reads, and Walks, wishes That Fate had blest him with an humbler Birth. Not to have felt the falling from a Throne. STANLEY Were it not possible to see this King? They say he'll freely talk with Edward's Friends, And ever treats him with Respect, and Honour. LIEUTENANT This is his usual Time of walking forth. (For he's allow'd the freedom of the Garden;) After his Morning-Prayer; he seldom fails: Behind this Arbor we unseen may stand A while t'observe him. (They retire.) Enter King Henry the Sixth in Mourning. KING HENRY By this time the Decisive Blow is struck, Either my Queen and son are blest with Victory, Or I'm the cause no more of Civil Broils. Wou'd I were Dead if Heavens good Will were so, 'For what is in this World but Grief and Care? What Noise, and Bustle do Kings make to find it? When Life's but a short Chace, our Game content Which most pursued is most compell'd to fly' And he that mounts him on the swiftest Hope, Shall often Run his Courser to a stand, While the poor Peasant from some distant Hill Undanger'd, and at Ease views all the Sport, And sees Content take shelter in his Cottage. STANLEY He seems Extreamly mov'd. (Aside) LIEUTENANT Does he know you? (Aside) STANLEY No! nor wou'd I have him. (Aside) LIEUTENANT We'll show ourselves. (Aside) (They come forward.) KING HENRY Why, there's another Check to Proud Ambition. That Man receiv'd his Charge from me, and now I'm his Prisoner, he lock's me to my Rest: Such an unlook'd for Change who cou'd suppose, That saw him kneel to Kiss the Hand that rais'd him? But that I shou'd not now complain off, Since I from thence may happily derive His Civil Treatment of me, — 'Morrow Lieutenant, Is any News arriv'd? — Who's that with you? LIEUTENANT A Gentleman that came last Night Express From Tewkesbury. We've had a Battle, Sir. KING HENRY Comes he to me with Letters or Advice? LIEUTENANT Sir, he's King Edward's Officer, your Foe. KING HENRY Then he won't flatter me, you're welcome, Sir; Not less because you are King Edward's Friend; For I have almost learn'd my self to be so: Cou'd I but once forget I was a King, I might be truly Happy, and his Subject. You've gain'd a Battle? Is't not so? STANLEY We have, Sir; How, will reach your Ear too soon. KING HENRY If to my Loss, It can't too soon? Pray speak, For Fear makes Mischief greater than it is: My Queen! my Son! say, Sir! are they living! STANLEY Since my Arrival, Sir, another Post Came in, who brought us word your Queen, and Son Were Prisoners now at Tewkesbury. KING HENRY Heav'ns Will be done! the Hunters have 'em now — And I have only Sighs, and Prayers to help 'em! STANLEY King Edward, Sir, depends upon his Sword, Yet prays heartily, when the Battle's won: And Soldiers love a Bold and Active Leader, Fortune like Women will be close pursu'd; The English are high Mettl'd, Sir, and 'tis No easie part to Sit 'em well. King Edward Feels their Temper, and 'twill be hard to throw him. KING HENRY Alas, I thought 'em Men, and rather hop'd To win their Hearts by Mildness, than Severity. My Soul was never form'd for Cruelty, In my Eye Justice has seem'd bloody, When on the City Gates I have beheld A Traytor's Quarters parching in the Sun, My Blood has turn'd with Horror at the Sight, I took 'em down, and Buried with his Limbs The Memory of the Dead Man's Deeds: Perhaps That Pity make me look less Terrible, Giving the mind of weak Rebellion Spirit: For King's are put in Trust for all Mankind, And when themselves take Injuries, who is safe? If so I have deserv'd these frowns of Fortune. Enter a Servant to the Lieutenant. SERVANT Sir, here's a Gentleman brings a Warrant For his Access to King Henry's Presence. LIEUTENANT I come to him. STANLEY His Business may require your Privacy, I'll leave you, Sir, wishing you all the Good That can be wish'd, not wronging him I serve. (Ex. Lord Stan. KING HENRY Farewell: Who can this be? A sudden Coldness Like the Damp Hand of Death has seiz'd my Limbs: I fear some heavy News! — Enter Lieutenant. Who is it, good Lieutenant? LIEUTENANT A Gentleman, Sir, from Tewkesbury, he seems A melancholly Messenger: For when I ask'd What News? His Answer was a deep faught Sigh: I wou'd urge him, but I fear 'tis fatal. Enter Tressell in Mourning. KING HENRY Fatal indeed! His Brows the Title Page That speaks the Nature of a Tragick Volume; 'Say, Friend, how does my Queen, my Son! Thou tremblest, and the whiteness of thy Cheek Is apter than thy Tongue to tell the Errand, Ev'n such a Man, so Faint, so Spiritless, So Dull, so Dead in Look, so Woe be gone, Drew Priam's Curtain in the Dead of Night, And wou'd have told him half his Troy was burn'd, But Priam found the Fire, e're he his Tongue, And I my poor Son's Death e're thou relatest it; Now wou'd'st thou say: Your Son did thus and thus, 'And thus your Queen; So fought the Valiant Oxford, Stopping my greedy Ear with their bold Deeds, But in the End (to stop my Ear indeed,) Thou hast a Sigh to blow away this Praise, 'Ending with Queen and Son, and all are Dead. TRESSELL 'Your Queen yet Lives, and many of your Friends, 'But for my Lord you Son — KING HENRY Why, he is Dead; — yet speak, I Charge thee! 'Tell thou thy Master his Suspicion lies, And I will take it as a kind Disgrace, 'And thank thee well, for doing me such wrong. TRESSELL Wou'd it were wrong to say, but, Sir, your Fears are true. KING HENRY Yet for all this, say not my Son is Dead. TRESSELL Sir, I am sorry I must force you to Believe, what wou'd to Heav'n I had not seen! But in this last Battle, near Tewkesbury, 'Your Son, whose Active Spirit lent a Fire 'En'n to the dullest Peasant in your Camp, Still made his way, where Danger stood t'oppose him, A beraver Youth of more Couragious Heat, 'Ne'er spurr'd his Courser at the Trumpets sound: But who can Rule th'uncertain Chance of War, In Fine, King Edward won the Bloody Field, Where both your Queen, and Son were made his Prisoners. KING HENRY 'Yet, hold! for oh! this Prologue lets me in 'To a most fatal Tragedy to come. — Dy'd he Prisoner, say'st thou? How? By Grief, Or by the bloody Hands of those, that caught him? TRESSELL After the Fight, Edward in Triumph ask'd To see the Captive Prince; the Prince was brought, Whom Edward roughly Chid for bearing Arms, Asking what Reparation he cou'd make For having stirr'd his Subjects to Rebellion? Your Son impatient of such Taunts, reply'd, 'Bow like a Subject, Proud Ambitious York! 'While I now speaking with my Father's Mouth, 'Propose the self same Rebel Words to thee, 'Which, Traytor, thou wou'dst have me answer to: From these, more Words arose, till in the End King Edward swell'd with what th'unhappy Prince At such a time too freely spoke, his Gauntlet In his young Face with Indignation struck: At which Crook'd Richard, Clarence, and the rest Buried their fatal Daggers in his Heart: In Bloody State I saw him on the Earth, From whence with Life he never more sprung up. KING HENRY 'O had'st thou stabb'd at every Words deliverance, 'Sharp Ponyards in my Flesh, while this was told 'Thy Wounds had giv'n less Anguish than thy Words. — O Hean'ns! methinks I see my tender Lamb Gasping beneath the Ravenous Wolves fell gripe? But say, did all? Did they all strike him, say'st thou? TRESSELL All, Sir: But the first Wound Duke Richard gave. KING HENRY There let him stop! be that his last of Ills! O barbarous Act; Unhospitable Men! Against the rigid Laws of Arms to kill him! Was't not enough, his hope of Birth-right gone, But must your Hate be levell'd at his Life? Nor cou'd his Father's Wrongs content you? Nor cou'd a Father's Grief disswade the Deed? 'You have no Children, (Butchers if you had) 'The thought of them wou'd sure have stirr'd Remorse. TRESSELL Take Comfort, Sir; and Hope a better Day. KING HENRY O! who can hold a Fire in his Hand, By thinking of the Frosty Caucasus? Or wallow Naked in December's Snow, 'By bare remembrance of the Summer's Heat? Away! by Heav'n, I shall abhor his Sight, Whoever bids me be of Comfort more: If thou wilt sooth my Sorrows, then I'll thank thee: Ay! now thou'rt kind indeed! these Tears oblige me. TRESSELL Alas, my Lord! I fear more Evils toward you. KING HENRY Why, let it come! I scarce shall feel it now, My present Woes have beat me to the Ground, And my hard Fate can make me fall no lower: What can it be? Give it its ugliest Shape, — O my poor Boy! — TRESSELL A word does that it comes in Gloucester's Form. KING HENRY Frightful indeed! give me the worst that threatens. TRESSELL After the Murther of your Son, stern Richard, As if unsated with the Wounds he had giv'n, With unwash'd Hands went from his Friends in hast, And being ask'd by Clarence of the Cause, He low'ring cry'd, Brother, I must, to the Tower! I've Business there, excuse me to the King, Before you reach the Town, expect some News: This said, he vanish'd, and I hear's arriv'd. KING HENRY Why, then the Period of my Woes is set; For Ills but thoughtby him are half perform'd. Enter Lieutenant with a Paper. LIEUTENANT Forgive me, Sir; what I'm compell'd to'bey An Order for your close Confinement. KING HENRY Whence comes it, good Lieutenant? LIEUTENANT Sir, from the Duke of Gloucester. KING HENRY Good Night to all then: I obey it — And now good Friend suppose me on my Death-bed, And take of me, thy last, short, Living leave: — Ney, keep thy Tears till thou hast seen me Dead: And when in tedious Winter Nights, with Good Old Folks, thou sit'st up late To hear 'em tell thee Dismal Tales 'Of times long past, even now with Woe remember'd; Before thou bidst good night, to quit their Grief, Tell thou the lamentable fall of me, And send thy hearers weeping to their Beds. (Exeunt Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester. Solus. RICHARD Now are our Brows bound with Victorious wreaths, Our stern allarms are changed to Merry-meetings, Our dreadfull marches to delightful measures. Grim visaged War has smoothed his wrinkled Front, And now instead of mounting Barbed Steeds To fright the Souls of fearful Adversaries He Capers nimbly in a Ladies Chamber To the Lascivious Pleasing of a Lute; But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks, I that am curtailed of Man's fair proportion, Deform'd, Unfinish'd, sent before my time Into this breathing World scarce hald made up, And that so lamely and unfashionable That Dogs bark at me as I halt by 'em; Why I, in this weak, this piping time of Peace, Have no delight to pass away my hours, Unless to see my shadow in the Sun, And descant on my own deformity: —Then since this Earth affords no joy to me, But to Command, to Check, and to Orebear such, 'As are of Happier Person than my self, 'Why then to me this restless World's but Hell, Till this mishapen trunks aspiring head 'Be circled in a glorious Diadem — But then 'tis fixt on such an heighth, O! I Must stretch the utmost reaching of my Soul. I'll climb betimes without Remorse or Dread, And my first step shall be on Henry's Head. (Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene, a Chamber in the Tower: K. Henry sleeping. Enter Lieutenant. LIEUTENANT Asleep so soon! But sorrow minds no seasons, The Morning, Noon, and Night with her's the same, She's fond of any hour that yields Repose. KING HENRY (rising. Who's there? Lieutenant! is it you? Come hither. LIEUTENANT You shake, my Lord, and look affrighted. KING HENRY O! I have had the fearfull'st Dream; such sights, That, as I live — I would not pass another hour so dreadful Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days. Reach me a Book — I'll try if reading can Divert these melancholy thoughts. Enter Richard. RICHARD Good day, my Lord; what, at your Book so hard? I disturb you. KING HENRY You do indeed — (sighing. RICHARD Go, Friend, leave us to our selves; we must confer. (Exit Lieu. KING HENRY What Bloody Scene has Roscius now to Act? RICHARD Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind, The Thief does fear each bush an Officer. KING HENRY Where Thieves without Controulment rob and kill, The Traveller does fear each bush a Thief: The poor bird that has been already lim'd With trembling Wings misdoubts of every Bush, And I, the hapless Male to one sweet Bird, Have now the fatal object in my Eye, 'By whom my young one bled, was caught and kill'd. RICHARD Why, what a peevish Fool was that of Creet, That taught his Son the office of a Fowl? And yet for all his Wings the fool was drown'd: Thou should'st have taught thy Boy his Prayers alone, And then he had not broke his neck with Climbing. KING HENRY Ah, kill me with thy weapons, not with words, My breast can better brook thy Daggers Point, 'Than can my ears that piercing story. But wherefore dost thou come, is't for my life? RICHARD Thinkest thou I am an Executioner? KING HENRY If Murthering Innocents be Executing 'Thou'rt then the worst of Executioners. RICHARD Thy Son I kill'd for his Presumption. KING HENRY Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst Presume, Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a Son of mine. But thou wert born to Massacre Mankind. 'How many Old Mens sighs, and Widows moans, 'How many Orphans Water standing eyes, 'Men, for their sons, Wives for their Husbands Fate, 'And Children, for their Parents timeless death, 'Will rue the hour that ever thou wert born? The Owl shriek'd at thy Birth: An Evil sign. 'The night Crow cry'd, foreboding luckless time, Dogs howl'd, and hideous Tempests shook down Trees; The Raven rook'd her on the Chimenys top, And chattering Pies in Dismal discords sung. They Mother felt more than a Mothers Pain, And yet brought forth less than a Mothers Hope: Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wert born, Which plainly said, Thou cam'st to bite Mankind, And if the rest be true which I have heard, Thou cam'st — RICHARD I'll hear no more: Dye, Prophet, in thy speech. (Stabs him. For this, amongst the rest was I ordain'd. KING HENRY O! and for much more slaughter after this. 'Just Heaven forgive my sins, and pardon thee. [Dies. RICHARD What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground? — I thought it would have mounted. See how my Sword weeps for the poor King's death; —O, may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the Downfall of our House. If any spark of Life be yet remaining, Down, down to Hell! and say, I sent thee thither. (stabs him again. I that have neither Pity, Love nor Fear: Indeed 'tis true, what Henry told me of, For I have often heard my Mother say, I came into the World with my Leg's forward: The Midwife wonder'd, and the Women cry'd, Good Heaven bless us, he is born with Teeth; And so I was, which plainly signified, That I should snarl and bite, and play the Dog. Then since the Heavens have shap'd my body so, Let Hell make crooked my mind to answer it — I have no Brother, am like no Brother, And this word Love, which Gray beards call Divine, Be resident in Men, like one another, And not in me — I am — my self alone. Clarence, beware, thou keep'st me from the Light, But if I fail not in my deep intent, Thou'st not another day to live, which done, Heaven take the weak King Edward to his Mercy, And leave the World for me to bustle in : But soft — I'm sharing spoil before the Field is won, Clarence still Breaths, Edward still Lives and Reigns, When they are gone, then I must count my gains. (Exit. The End of the first ACT.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">ACT the Second</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE, St. Pauls. Enter Tressel meeting Lord Stanley. TRESSELL My Lord, your Servant, pray what brought you to Paul's? STANLEY I came amongst the Crowd to see the Corps Of poor King Henry. 'Tis a dismal sight, But yesterday I saw him in the Tower; His talk is still so fresh within my memory: That I could weep to think how Fate has us'd him. I wonder where's Duke Richard's policy Is suffering him to lie exposed to view? Can he believe that Men will love him for't? TRESSELL O yes, Sir, love him, as he loves his Brothers: When was you with King Edward, pray, my Lord? I hear he leaves his Food, is Melancholy, And his Physicians fear him mightily. STANLEY 'Tis thought he'll scarce recover: Shall we to Court, and hear more News of Him? TRESSELL I am oblig'd to pay Attendance here, The Lady LADY ANN has license to remove King Henry's Corps to be Interr'd at Chertsey, And I am engag'd to follow her. STANLEY Mean you King Henry's Daughter-in-Law? TRESSELL The same, Sir, Widow to the late Prince Edward, Whom Cloucester kill'd at Tewkesbury. STANLEY Alas, poor Lady, she'd severely used. And yet I hear Richard attempts her Love: Methinks the wrongs he's done her should discourage him. TRESSELL Neither those wrongs nor his own shape can fright him; He sent for leave to visit her this morning, And she was forc'd to keep her Bed to avoid him. But see, she is arriv'd: Will you along To see this doleful Ceremony? STANLEY I'll wait on you. (Exeunt. Richard. Solus. RICHARD 'Twas her excuse t'avoid me — Alas! She keeps no Bed — She has health enough to progress far as Chertsey, Tho' not to bear the sight of me; — I cannot blame her — Why Love forswore me in my Mothers Womb, And for I should not deal in his soft Laws, He did corrupt frail Nature with some Bribe To shrink my Arm up like a wither'd Shrub, To make an envious Mountain on my bvack, Where sits Deformity to mock by Body, To shape my Legs of an unequal size, To disproportion me in every part: And am I then a man to be belov'd? O monstrous Thought! more vain my Ambition. Enter Lieutenant hastily. Lieutenant My Lord, I beg your Grace — RICHARD Be gone, Fellow — I'm not at leisure — Lieutenant My Lord, the King your Brother's taken ill. RICHARD I'll wait on him, leave me, Friend — [Exit Lieutenant.] Ha! Edward ta'en ill! — Wou'd he were wasted, Marrow-bones and all, 'That from his loins no more young Brats may rise 'To cross me in the golden time I look for — But see, my Love appears: Look where she shines, Darting pale Lustre, like the Silver Moon Through her dark Veil of Rainy sorrow: So mourn'd the Dame of Ephesus her Love, And thus the Soldier arm'd with Resolution Told his soft tale, and was a thriving Woer. 'Tis true, my Form perhaps, will little move her, But I've a Tongue shall wheadle with the Devil. Yet hold; She mourns the Man whom I have kill'd : First, let her sorrows take some vent — Stand here; I'll take her passion in its wain, and turn This storm of grief to gentle drops of pity For his Repentant Murderer. — (He retires. Enter Bearers with King Henry's Body, the Lady LADY ANN in Mourning, Lord Stanley, Tressel, and Guards, who all advance from the middle Isle of the Church. LADY ANN 'Hung be the Heavens with black, yield day to night, 'Comets importing change of Times and States, 'Brandish your fiery Tresses in the Sky, 'And with'em scourge the bad revolting Stars 'That have consented to King Henry's death: O be accurst the Hand that shed this Blood; Accurst the Head that had the Heart to do it, More direful hap betide that hated Wretch Than I can wish to Wolves, to Spiders, Toads, Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives: If ever he have Wife, let her be made 'More miserable by the Life of him, 'Than I am now by Edward's death and thine. RICHARD Poor Girl! What pains she takes to curse her self? (apart. LADY ANN If ever he have Child Abortive be it, Prodigious and Untimely brought to Light, 'Whose hideous Form, whose most unnatural Aspect May fright the hopeful Mother at the view, And that be Heir to his unhappiness. 'Now on, to Chertsey with your sacred Load. Richard comes forward. RICHARD Stay, you that bear the Coarse, and set it down. LADY ANN What black Magician Conjures up this Fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds? RICHARD Villains, set down the Coarse, or by St. Paul, I'll made a Coarse of him that disobeys. GUARD My Lord, stand back, and let the Coffin pass. RICHARD 'Unmanner'd Slave! Stand thou, when I command: Advance thy Halbert higher than my Breast, Or, by St. Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot, And spurn thee, beggar, for this boldness. LADY ANN Why dost thou haunt him thus, unsated Fiend? Thou hadst but power over his mortal Body, His soul thou canst not reach; therefore be gone. RICHARD Sweet Saint, be not so hard for Charity. LADY ANN If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds, Behold this pattern of thy Butcheries. Why didst thou do this deed? Cou'd not the Laws Of Man, of Nature, nor of Heavan disswade thee? No Beast so fierce, but knows some touch of pity. RICHARD If want of pity be a Crime so hateful, Whense is it thou, fair Excellence, art guilty? LADY ANN What means the slanderer? RICHARD Vouchsafe, Divine Perfection of a Woman, Of these my Crimes suppos'd to give me leave By Circumstance, but to acquit my self. LADY ANN Then take that Sword, whose bloody point still reeks With Henry's Life, with my lov'd Lord young Edwards, And here let out thy own t'appease their Ghosts. RICHARD By such despair I shou'd accuse my self. LADY ANN Why by despairing only canst thou stand excused? Dist thou not kill this King? RICHARD I grant ye. LADY ANN O! he was Gentle, Loving, Mild and Vertuous; But he's in Heaven, where thou canst never come. RICHARD Was I not kind to send him thither then? He was much fitter for that place than Earth. LADY ANN And thou unfit for any place but Hell. RICHARD Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it. LADY ANN Some Dungeon. RICHARD Your Bed Chamber. LADY ANN Ill rest betide the Chamber where thou liest. RICHARD So it will, Madam, till I lie in yours. LADY ANN I hope so. RICHARD I know so. But gentle Lady LADY ANN, 'To leave this keen encounter of our Tongues, 'And fall to something a more serious method. Is not the cause of th'untimely deaths Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward, As blameful as the Executioner? LADY ANN Thou wert the cause, and most accurst effect. RICHARD your Beauty was the cause of that effect: Your Beauty that did haunt me in my sleep, To undertake the Death of all the World, So I might live one hour in that soft Bosom. LADY ANN If I thought that, I tell thee, Homicide, 'These Hands shou'd rend that Beauty from my Cheeks. RICHARD These Eyes cou'd not endure that Beauties rack, You shou'd not blemish it, if I stood by. 'As all the World is nourish'd by the Sun, So I by that: It is my Day, my Life. LADY ANN I wou'd it were to be reveng'd on thee. RICHARD It is a Quarrel most Unnatural To wish revenge on him that loves thee. LADY ANN Say rather 'tis my duty, 'To seek revenge on him that kill'd my Husband. RICHARD Fair Creature, he that kill'd thy Husband 'Did it to — help thee to a better Husband. LADY ANN His better does not breath upon the Earth. RICHARD He lives that lov'd thee better, than he could. LADY ANN Name him. RICHARD. Plantagenet. LADY ANN Why, that was he. RICHARD The self same Name, but one of softer Nature. LADY ANN Where is he? RICHARD Ah! take sore pity in thy Eyes, and see him -here. LADY ANN Wou'd they were Basilisks to strike thee dead. RICHARD I wou'd they were, that I might die at once, For now they kill me with a living death, Darting with cruel aim unpitied Love, I never sued to Friend or Enemy, My Tongue could never learn sweet smoothing Works, But now thy Beauty is propos'd my Fee My proud Heart sues, and prompts my Tongue to speak. LADY ANN Is there a Tongue on Earth can speak for thee? Why dost thou Court my hate? ___ TRESSELL Where will this end ? she frowns upon him yet. aside. STANLEY But yet she hears him in her frowns ; I fear him. aside. ___ RICHARD 'O! teach not thy soft lip such cold contempt — If thy Relentless Heart cannot forgive, Lo, here I lend thee this sharp pointed Sword, Which if thou please to hide in this true Breast, And let the honest Soul out, that adores thee, I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, And humbly beg that Death upon my knee. LADY ANN What shall I say or do? Direct me Heaven; Aside. When stones weep sure the tears are natural, Aside. And Heaven it self instructs us to forgive, Aside. When they do flow from a sincere Repentance. Aside. RICHARD Nay, do not pause: For I did kill King Henry, But 'twas thy wondrous Beauty that provoked me; Nay now dispatch: 'Twas I that stab'd young Edward, But 'twas thy Heavenly face that set me on, And I might still persist (so stubborn is My Temper) to rejoice at what I've done, But that thy powerful Eyes (as roaring Seas Obey the changes of the Moon) have turn'd My Heart, and made it flow with Penitence. (She lets fall the Sword. Take up the Sword again, or take up me. LADY ANN No, tho' I wish thy Death, I will not be thy Executioner. RICHARD Then bid me kill my self, and I will do it. LADY ANN I have already. RICHARD That was in they rage: Say it again, and even with thy word 'This guilty hand that rob'd thee of thy Love 'Shall for thy Love revenge thee on thy Lover; To both their deaths shalt thou be Accessary. TRESSELL By Heaven she wants the heart to bid him do't. aside. STANLEY What think you now, Sir? aside. TRESSELL } aside. I'm struck! I scarce can credit what I see. aside. STANLEY Why, you see — A Woman. TRESSELL When future Chronicles shall speak of this aside. They will be thought Romance, not History. aside. — RICHARD What, not a word to pardon or condemn, me? But thou art wise — and canst with silence kill me; Yet even in death my fleeting Soul pursues thee: Dash not the tears of Penitence away. I ask but leave t'indulge my cold despair: By Heaven, there's Joy in this extravagance Of Woe; 'tis Melting, Soft, 'tis pleasing Ruin. Oh! 'tis too much, too much for Life to bear This aching tenderness of thought. LADY ANN Wou'dst thou not blame me to forgive thy Crimes? RICHARD They are not to be forgiven: No, not even Penitence can atone 'em. O misery Of Thought! that strikes me with at once Repentance And Despair; tho' unpardon'd yield me pity. LADY ANN I Wou'd I knew thy heart. RICHARD 'Tis figur'd in my Tongue. LADY ANN I fear me both are false. RICHARD Then never Man was true. LADY ANN Put up thy Sword. RICHARD Say then, my Peace is made. LADY ANN That shalt thou know hereafter. RICHARD But shall I live in hope? LADY ANN All Men, I hope, live so. RICHARD I swear, bright Saint, I am not what I was: Those Eyes have turn'd my stubborn heart to Woman, This goodness makes me soft in Penitence, And my harsh thoughts are tun'd to Peace and Love. O! if they poor devoted Servant might But beg one favour at they gracious hand, Thou wouldst confirm his Happiness for ever. LADY ANN What is it? RICHARD That it may please thee, leave these sad designs To him that has most cause to be a Mourner, And presently repair to Crosby House, Where, after I have solemnly Interr'd At Chertsey Monastery, this Injur'd King, And wet his Grave with my repentant Tears, I will with all expedient duty see you: For divers unknown reasons I beseech you 'Grant me this favour. LADY ANN I do my Lord, and much it joys me too To see you are become so Penitent, Tressel and Berkley go along with me. RICHARD Bid me Farewell. LADY ANN 'Tis more that you deserve; But since you teach me how to flatter you, Imagine I have said Farewell already. [Exit with Tress. and Berk. GUARD Towards Chertsey, my Lord? RICHARD Now to White-Fryars, there attend my coming. [Exit with the Body. Richard Solus RICHARD (smiling) Was ever Woman in this humour wooed? Was ever Woman in this humour won? I'll have her: But I will not keep her long. What! I that kill'd her Husband and her Father, To take her in her Hearts extreamest hate, With Curses in her mouth, Tears in her Eyes, The bleeding witness of my hatred by, Having Heaven, her Conscience, and these Bars against me, And I no Friends to back my suit withal, But the plain Devil, and dissembling looks? And yet to win her! All the world to nothing. Can she abase her Beauteous eyes on me? Whose all not equals Edward's moiety? On me! that halt and am mishapen, Thus 'My Dukedom to a Widows Chastity I do mistake my Person all this while! Upon my life! she finds, altho I cannot, My self to be a marvellous proper Man, 'I'll have my Chambers lin'd with Looking-glass And entertain a score or two of Taylors To study fashions to adorn my body. Since I am crept in favour with my self, I will maintain it with some little cost. 'But first, I'll turn St. Harry to his grave, And then return lamenting to my Love. 'Shine out fair Sun till I salute my Glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass. ( Exit.</field>

BUCKINGHAM His Grace of Gloucester, did you see him? STANLEY Not lately, my Lord -I hope no ill news. Buckingham The worst that heard e're bore, or tongue can utter. Edward the King! his Royal Brother's Dead. STANLEY 'Tis sad indeed -I wish by your impatience To acquaint him tho you think it so to him. aside. Did the King, by Lord, make any mention Of a Protector for his Crown and Children? BUCKINGHAM He did, Duke Richard has the care of both. STANLEY That sad news you are afraid to tell him too. (aside.

My lord, is not that the Dutchess of York, The King's Mother? coming I fear to visit him. BUCKINGHAM 'Tis she ! little thinking what has befallen us. Enter Dutchess of York. DUTCHESS Good day, my Lords! How takes the King his Rest. BUCKINGHAM Alas! Madam, too well! he sleeps for ever ? DUTCHESS Dead! -Good Heav'n support me! BUCKINGHAM Madam, 'twas my unhappy lot to hear His last Departing Groans, and close his eyes. DUTCHESS Another taken from me too! why just Heav'n Am I still left the last in life and woe? 'First I bemoan'd a nobel Husbands death, 'Yet liv'd with looking on his Images. 'But now my last support is gone, First Clarence, Now Edward is forever taken from me. Both Crutches now the unrelenting hand Of Death has stricken from my feeble Arms And I must now of force sink down with sorrow. BUCKINGHAM Your youngest Son, the Noble Richard lives. His love I know will feel his Mothers Cares, And bring new comfort to your latter days. DUTCHESS 'Twere new indeed! for yet of him I've none, Unless a churlish disobedieence may Be counted for a Child a Mothers Comfort: 'From his malicious grudge I know my Son. 'His brother Clarence death was first contriv'd But may his Penitence find Heav'n's mercy. Where is the Queen, my Lord? BUCKINGHAM I left her with her kinsmen deep in Sorrow, Who have with much adoe perswaded her To leave the Body — Madam they are here. Enter the Queen attended with Rivers and Dorset, and others. QUEEN Why do you thus oppose my grief, unless To make me Rave, and Weep the faster? Ha! My Mother too in Tears! Fresh Sorrow strikes My heart, at sight of every Friend, that lov'd My Edward living — O Mother! He's Dead! Edward, my Lord, thy Son, our King is Dead. O that my eyes cou'd weep away my Soul! Than I might follow worthy of his Hearse. STANLEY Your Duty, Madam, of a Wife is Dead, And not the Mother's only claims your care. Think on the Prince your Son: send for him strait, And let his Coronation clear your eyes. Bury your griefs in the dead Edward's Grave, Revive your Joys on living Edward's Throne. QUEEN Alas! That thought, but adds to my Afflictions. New Tears for Edward gone, and fears for Edward living, 'An helpless Child, and his Minority 'Is in the Trust of his stern Uncle Gloucester, A man that frowns on me, and all of mine. (Weeps. BUCKINGHAM Judge not so hardly, Madam, of his love, Your Son will find in him a Father's Care. Enter Richard behind. RICHARD Why ay! — These tears look well! sorrow's the mode, And every one at Court must wear it now — With all my heart, I'll not be out of Fashion. (aside. QUEEN My Lord, just Heav'n knows I never hated Richard, But wou'd on any terms embrace his friendship. BUCKINGHAM These words would make him weep, — I know him yours. See where he comes in sorrow for our loss. RICHARD My Lords, — good morrow — Cousin of Buckingham, I am yours — (Weeping. BUCKINGHAM Good-morning to your Grace.

RICHARD By all means, my Lords, come let's in to Counsel, And appoint who shall be the messengers. Madam, and you my Sister, please you go 'To give your sentiments on this occasion?

The weary way has made you melancholy. PRINCE EDWARD No, Uncle, but our crosses on the way Have made it Tedious, Wearisome and Heavy, I want more Uncles here to welcome me. TRESSEL More Uncles!

LORD MAYOR Vouchsafe, most Gracious Sovereign to accept The general Homage of your Loyal City; We farther beg your Royal leave to speak In deep Condolement of your Father's loss: And, far as our true sorrow will permit To gratulate your Accession to the Throne. PRINCE EDWARD I thank you, good my Lord, and thank you all. Alas, my youth is yet unfit to govern, Therefore the Sword of Justice is in abler hands: But be assur'd of this, so much already I perceive I love you, that tho' I know not yet To do you offices of good, yet this I know, I'll sooner die, than basely do you wrong. RICHARD So wise, so young, they say do never live long. [Aside. PRINCE EDWARD My Lords, I thought my Mother and my Brother York Wou'd long e're this have met us on the way: Say, Uncle Gloucester, if your Brother come, Where shall we sojourn till our Coronation? RICHARD Where it shall seem best to your Royal self, May I advise you, Sir, some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower, Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit For your best Health and Recreation. PRINCE EDWARD Why at the Tower? But be it it as you please. BUCKINGHAM My Lord, your Brother's Grace of York. Enter the young Duke of York attended. PRINCE EDWARD Richard of York! How fares our dearest Brother? DUKE OF YORK O! my dear Lord! So I must call you now. [embracing. PRINCE EDWARD I, Brother, to our grief, as it is yours: 'Too soon he dy'd who might have better worn 'That Title, which in me will loose its Majesty. RICHARD How fares our Cousin, Noble Lord of York? DUKE OF YORK Thank you kindly, dear Uncle. O my Lord, You said that Idle Weeds were fast in growth, The King my Brother has out grown me far. RICHARD He has my Lord. DUKE OF YORK And therefore is he Idle? RICHARD O pretty Cousin, I must not say so. DUKE OF YORK Nay, Uncle, I don't believe the sayings true, For if it were, you'd be an Idle Weed. RICHARD How so, cousin? DUKE OF YORK Because I've heard Folds say you grew so fast Your Teeth wou'd gnaw a Crust at two hours old, Now 'twas two years e'er I cou'd get a Tooth. RICHARD Indeed — I find the Brat is taught this lesson. (Aside. Who told thee this, my pretty merry Cousin? DUKE OF YORK Why, your Nurse, Uncle. RICHARD My Nurse, Child, she was dead before thou wert born. DUKE OF YORK If 'twas not she, I can't tell who told me. RICHARD So subtle too; 'tis pity thou art short liv'd. [Aside. PRINCE EDWARD My Brother, Uncle, will be cross in talk. RICHARD O, fear not, my Lord, we shall never Quarrel. PRINCE EDWARD I hope your Grace knows how to bear with him? DUKE OF YORK You mean to bear me; not to bear With me, Uncle, my Brother mocks both you and me, Because that I am little, like and Ape, He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders. PRINCE EDWARD Fie, Brother, I have no such meaning. STANLEY With what a sharp, provided Wit he reasons, Aside. To mitigate the scorn he gives his Uncle: Aside. He prettily and aptly taunts himself.

PRINCE EDWARD What shou'd you fear, Brother? DUKE OF YORK My Uncle Clarence Ghost, my Lord. My Grandmother told me he was kill'd there. PRINCE EDWARD I fear no Uncles dead. RICHARD 'Nor any, Sir, that live, I hope. PRINCE EDWARD 'I hope so too. But come, my Lords, 'To the Tower, since it must be so. [Ex. all but R. and B. BUCKINGHAM Think you, my Lord, this little prating York Was not instructed by his subtle Mother To taunt and scorn you thus Opprobriously? RICHARD 'No doubt, no doubt. O! 'tis a shrewd young Master: Stubborn, Bold, Quick, Forward, and Capable; He is all the Mothers from Top to Toe. But let them rest: now what says Catesby? BUCKINGHAM My Lord, 'tis much as I suspected, and He's here himself to inform you. Enter Catesby RICHARD So, Catesby, hast thou been tampering? What News? CATESBY My Lord, according to the instruction given me, With words at distance dropt I sounded Hastings, Piercing how far he did affect your purpose, To which indeed I found him Cold, Unwilling. The sum is this, he seem'd a while to understand me not. At length from plainer speaking urg'd to answer, He said in heart, rather than wrong the Head To whom the Crown was due, he'd lose his own. RICHARD Indeed, his own then answer for that saying, He shall be taken care of: Mean while Catesby, Be thou near me: Cousin of Buckingham Lets lose no time: The Mayor and Citizens Are now in buisie meeting in Guild-Hall, 'Thither I'd have you haste immediately, 'And at your meetest 'vantage of the time 'Improve those Hints I gave you late to speak of: But above all, infer the Bastardy Of Edward's Children; Nay, for a need, thus far come near my Person, Tell'em, when my Mother went with Child of him, My Princely Father then had Wars in France, And by true Computation of his time Found, that the issue was not his begot, Which in his lineaments too plain appear'd, Being nothing like the Noble York my Father: Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far of, Because, my Lord, you know my Mother lives. BUCKINGHAM 'Doubt not, my Lord, I'll play the Orator 'As if my self might wear the Golden Fee, 'For which I Plead. RICHARD If you thrive well, bring 'em to see me here, 'Where you shall find me seriously employ'd 'With the most Learned Fathers of the Church. BUCKINGHAM I fly, my Lord, to serve you. RICHARD To serve thy self, my Cousin; For look, when I am King, claim thou of me The Earldom of Hereford, and all those Moveables, Whereof the King my Brother stood possest. BUCKINGHAM I shall remember that your Grace was Bountiful. RICHARD Cousin, I have said it. BUCKINGHAM I am gone, my Lord. [Exit Buck. RICHARD So — I've secur'd my Cousin here: These Moveables Will never let his Brains have rest till I am King: Catesby, Go thou with speed to Doctor Shaw, and thence 'To Fryar Beuker: Haste, and bid 'em both 'Attend me here, within an hour at farthest: [Exit Catesby. Mean while my private orders shall be given To lock up all admittance to the Princes. Now, by St. Paul, the work goes bravely on — How many frightful stops wou'd Conscience make In some soft heads to undertake like me: — Come; this Conscience is a convenient Scarecrow, It Guards the fruit which Priests and Wisemen tast, Who never set it up to fright themselves: They know 'tis rags, and gather in the face on't, While half-starv'd shallow Daws thro Fear are honest. Why were Laws made, but that we're Rogues by Nature? Conscience! 'tis our Coin, we live by parting with it, And he thrives best that has the most to spare: The protesting Lover buys hope with it, And the deluded Virgin short liv'd pleasure. Old gray beards cram their Avarice with it, Your Lank-jaw'd hungry Judge will dine upon't, And hang the Guiltless rather than eat his Mutton cold. The crown'd Head quits it for Despotick sway, The stubborn People for unaw'd Rebellion: There's not a Slave but has his share of Villain; Why then shall after Ages think my deeds Inhumane? Since my worst are but Ambition: Ev'n all Mankind to some lov'd Ills incline, Great Men chuse Greater Sins — Ambition's mine. [ Exit. Enter Lady Ann, Sola. ANN When, when shall I have rest? Was Marriage made To be the Scourge of our Offences here? Ah no! 'Twas meant a Blessing to the Vertuous, It once was so to me, tho' now my Curse: The fruit of Edward's Love was sweet and pleasing: But oh! Untimely cropt by cruel Richard, Who rudely having grafted on his stock Now makes my Life yield only sorrow. Let me have Musick to compose my thoughts. [Song here. It will not be: Nought but the grave can close my Eyes. — How many labouring Wretches take their rest, While I, night after night, with cares lie waking, As if the gentle Nurse of Nature, Sleep, Had vow'd to rock my peevish sense no more. 'O partial sleep! Canst thou in smoaky Cottages 'Stretch out the Peasants Limbs on Beds of Straw, 'And lay him fast, cram'd with distressful Bread? Yet in the softest breeze of Peaceful Night 'Under the Canopis of costly State, 'Tho' lull'd with sounds of sweetest melody, Refuse one moments slumber to a Princess? O mockery of Greatness! But see, He comes! The rude disturber of my Pillow. Enter Richard, Aloof. RICHARD Ha! still in tears; let 'em flow on; they're signs (Aside. Of a substantial grief — Why don't she die? (Aside. She must: My Interest will not let her live. (Aside. The fair Elizabeth hath caught my Eye, (Aside. My Heart's vacant; and she shall fill her place (Aside. They say that Women have but tender hearts, (Aside. 'Tis a mistake, I doubt; I've found 'em tough: (Aside. They'll bend, indeed: But he must strain that cracks 'em. (Aside. All I can hope's to throw her into sickness: (Aside. Then I may send her a Physicians help. (Aside. So, Madam: What, you still take care, I see To let the World believe I love you not, This outward Mourning now has malice in't, So have these sullen disobedient tears: I'll have you tell the World I doat on you. ANN I wish I could, but 'twill not be believ'd: Have I deserv'd this usage? RICHARD You have: You do not please me as at first. ANN What have I done? What horrid Crime committed? RICHARD To me the worst of Crimes, out-liv'd my liking. ANN If that be Criminal, Just Heaven be kind, And take me while my Penitence is warm: O Sir, forgive and kill me. RICHARD Umh! No, — The medling World will call it murder, And I wou'd have 'em think me pitifull: Now wert thou not afraid of self-Destruction, Thou hast a fair excuse for't. ANN How fain wou'd I be Friends with Death? O name it. RICHARD Thy Husbands hate: Nor do I hate thee only From the dull'd edge of sated Appetite But from the eager Love I bear another: Some call me Hypocrite: What think'st thou now, Do I dissemble? ANN Thy Vows of Love to me were all dissembled. RICHARD Not one: For when I told thee so, I lov'd: Thou art the only Soul I never yet deceiv'd: And 'tis my honesty that tells thee now With all my heart, I hate thee — If this have no Effect, she is immortal. [Aside. ANN Forgive me ;Heave, that I forgave this Man. O may my story told in after Ages, Give warning to our easie Sexes ears: May it Unveil the heartsof Men, and strike Them deaf to their dissimulated Love. [Enter Catesby. CATESBY My Lord, his Grace of Buckingham attends Your Highness Pleasure. RICHARD Wait on him; I'll expect him here. (Exit Cat. Your Absence, Madam, will be necessary. ANN Wou'd my death were so. (Exit. RICHARD It may be shortly. So my Cousin, What say the Citizens? Enter Buckingham. BUCKINGHAM 'Now, by our hopes, my Lord, they're senseless stones, 'Their hesitating fear has struck 'em dumb. RICHARD Touch'd you the Bastardy of Edward's Children? BUCKINGHAM I did, with his Contract to Lady Lucy. Nay, his own Bastardy and Tyranny for Trifles; — Laid open all your Victories in Scotland, Your Discipline in War, Wisdom in Peace: Your Bounty, Justice, fair Humility. Indeed left nothing that might gild our Cause Untouch'd, or slightly handled in my talk, And when my Oration drew towards an end, I urg'd of them that lov'd their Countries good To do you right, and cry, Long live King Richard. RICHARD And did they so? BUCKINGHAM 'Not one, by Heaven: But each like Statues fix'd 'Speechless and Pale, star'd in his fellows Face, Which when I saw, I reprehended them, And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence? His answer was, the people were not us'd To be spoken to but by the Recorder, 'Who then took on him to repeat my words. Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd: But nothing urg'd in Warrant from himself. When he had done, some Followers of my own At lower end of th'Hall, hurl'd up their Caps, And some ten voices cry'd, God save King Richard, At which I took the 'vantage of those few, And cry'd, Thanks gentle Citizens and Friends, This general applause and chearful shout Argues your Wisdom, and your Love of Richard, And even here broke of, and came away. RICHARD O Tongueless Blocks! Wou'd they not speak? Will not the Mayor then and his Brethren come? BUCKINGHAM The Mayor is here at hand: Feign you some fear, And be not spoke with, but by mighty suit: 'A Prayer-Book in your hand, my Lord, were well, Standing between two Churchmen of Repute, For on that ground I'll make an holy descant: Yet be not easily won to our Repuests, 'Seem, like the Virgin, fearful of our wishes. RICHARD 'My other self! My Counsel's Consistory! 'My Oracle! my Prophet! My dear Cousin! [Embracing. 'I, as a Child, will go by thy direction. BUCKINGHAM Hark! the Lord Mayor's at hand: Away, my Lord; Nor doubt, but yet we reach our point propos'd. RICHARD We cannot fail, my Lord, while you are Pilot. A little flattery sometimes does well. [Aside.] [Exit Rich. Enter Lord Mayor, and Citizens. BUCKINGHAM Welcome, my Lord, I dance attendance here; I'm afraid the Duke will not be spoke withal. [Enter Catesby. Now, Catesby, what says your Lord to my request? CATESBY My Lord, he humbly does intreat your Grace To visit him to morrow, or next day. He's now retir'd with two Right Reverend Fathers Divinely bent to Meditation, And in no worldly suits wou'd he be mov'd, To interrupt his Holy Exercise. BUCKINGHAM Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke; Tell him, my Self, the Mayor, and Citizens, In deep designs, in matters of great moment, No less imooirting than our general good, Are come to have some Conference with his Grace. CATESBY My Lord, I'll instantly inform his Highness. BUCKINGHAM Ah! my good Lord! This Prince is not an Edward, He is not lolling on a lewd Love-bed; But on his knees at Meditation: Not dallying with a brace of Curtizans, But with two deep Divines in secret praying. Happy were England wou'd this Vertuous Prince Take on himself the toil of Sovereignty. LORD MAYOR Happy indeed, my Lord. He will not sure refuse our profer'd Love? BUCKINGHAM Alas my Lord, you know him not, his mind's Above this World; he's for a Crown Immortal! Look there! His door opens: Now where's our hope? LORD MAYOR See where his Grace stands 'tween two Clergymen? BUCKINGHAM Ay, ay; 'tis there he's caught: There's his Ambition. LORD MAYOR How low he bows to thank 'em for their care! And, see, a Prayer-Book in his hand! BUCKINGHAM Wou'd he were King, we'd give him leave to pray. Methinks I wish it for the love he bears the City. How have I heard him vow hethought it Hard The Mayor should lose his Title with his Office? Well! who knows? he may be won? LORD MAYOR Ah! my Lord! BUCKINGHAM See! He comes forth: my Friends be resolute, I know he's cautious to a fault but do not Leave him till our honest suit be granted. Enter Richard with a Book. RICHARD Cousin of Buckingham! I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, Who, earnest in my Zealous Meditation, So long deferr'd the service of my Friends: Now do I fear I've done some strange offence, That looks disgracious in the City's Eye; If so, 'Tis Just you shou'd reprove my Ignorance. BUCKINGHAM You have, my Lord: We wish your Grace On our entreaties wou'd amend your fault. RICHARD Else wherefore breath I in a Christian Land? BUCKINGHAM Know then it is your fault, that you resign The Sceptred Office of your Ancestors, Fair England's Throne, your own due right of Birth, To the Corruption of a blemisht stock, While in the Mildness of your sleeping thoughts, (Which here we waken to our Country's good) This wounded Isle does want her proper Limbs, 'Which to secure, joyn'd with these Loyal Men, 'Your very Worshipful and Loving Friends, And by your vehement Instigation, In this Just Cause, I come to move your Highness, That on your gracious self you'd take the Charge And Kingly Government of this your Land, Not as protector, Steward, Substitute, Or lowly Factor for another's Gain: But as successively from Blood to Blood, Your own, by right of Birth, and lineal Glory. RICHARD I cannot tell, if to depart in silence, Or bitterly to speak in your reproof, Fits best with my Degree or your Condition: 'Therefore to speak in just refusal of your suit, And then in speaking not to check my Friends. Definitively thus I answer you; Your Love deserves my thanks, but my desert Unmeritable shuns your fond Request: For, Heaven be thanked, there is no need of me; The Royal stock has left us Royal fruit, Which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, Will well become the seat of Majesty, And make us (no doubt) happy by his Reign. On him I lay what you wou'd lay on me, The Right and Fortune of his happy Stars, 'Which Heaven forbid my thoughts shou'd rob him of. BUCKINGHAM My Lord, this argues Conscience in your Grace, But Circumstances well consider'd: The weak respects thereof are nice and trivial. You say that Edward was your Brothers Son So say we too, but not by Edward's Wife: 'If solemn Contracts are of any force 'That Title Justice gave to Lady Lucy: 'Even of his Birth cou'd I severely speak; 'Save that for reverence to some alive, I give a spairing limit to my Tongue. LORD MAYOR Upon our knees, my Lord, we beg your Grace To wear this precious Robe of dignity, Which on a Child must sit too loose and heavy. 'Tis yours; befitting both your Wisdom and your Birth. CATESBY My Lord, this coldness is unkind, Nor suits it with such ardent Loyalty? BUCKINGHAM O make 'em happy: Grant their Lawful Suit. RICHARD Alas! Why wou'd you heap this care on me? I am unfit for State and Majesty. I thank you for your Loves, but must declare (I do beseech you take it not amiss) I will not! dare not! must not yield to you. BUCKINGHAM If you refuse us through a soft remorse, Loth to depose the Child, your Brother's Son: (As well we know your tenderness of Heart) Yet know, tho' you deny us to the last, Your Brother's Son shall never Reign our King: But we will plant some other in the Throne, To the disgrace and downfall of your House. 'And thus resorlv'd I bid you, Sir, Farewell. My Lord, and Gentlemen, I crave your pardon For this vain trouble: M'intent was good, I wou'd have serv'd my Country and my King; But 'twill not be: Farewel! When next we meet — LORD MAYOR Be not too rash, my Lord, his Grace relents. BUCKINGHAM Away, you but decieve your selves — [Exit Buc. CATESBY Call him again; sweet Prince accept their suit. LORD MAYOR If you deny us, all the Land will rue it. RICHARD Call him again — You will enforce me to A World of cares; I am not make of stone, But penetrable to your kind entreaties: Tho' Heaven knows against my own Inclining. Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave Men. [Re-enter Buc. Since you will buckle Fortune on my Back to bear her burthen whether I will or no, I must have patience to endure the load: But if black Scandal or foul-fac's Reproach Attend the sequel of your Imposition, Your meer Enforcement shall Aquittance me: For Heaven knows, as you may all partly see, How far I am from the desire of this. LORD MAYOR Heaven guard your Grace: We see it, and will say it. RICHARD You will but say the truth, my Lord. BUCKINGHAM My heart's so full it scarce has vent for words; My knee will better speak my duty now. [Kneels. Long live our Soveraign, Richard King of England. RICHARD Indeed your words have touch'd me nearly Cousin: Pray rise. I wish you cou'd recall 'em. BUCKINGHAM It wou'd be Treason now, my Lord: To morrow, 'If it so please your Majesty, from Counsel 'Orders shall be given for your Coronation. RICHARD Even when you please: for you will have it so. BUCKINGHAM To morrow then we will attend your Majesty: And now we take our leaves with joy. RICHARD Cousin Adieu! my loving Friends farewel: I must to my Holy Work again. [Exeunt B. and Citizens. Richard. Solus. Why now my golden dream is out — Ambition like an early Friend throws back My Curtains with an eager Hand, o'rejoy'd To tell me what I dreamt is true — A Crown! Thou bright reward of ever daring minds, O! How thy awful Glory fills my Soul! Nor can the means that got thee dim thy lustre; For, not mens Love, Fear pays thee Adoration: And Fame not more survives from Good than Evil deeds. Th'aspiring youth that fir'd th'Ephesian Dome Out-lives in Fame the pious Fool that rais'd it: Conscience, lie still — More lives must yet be drain'd, Crowns got with Blood must be with Blood maintain'd.

PRINCE EDWARD Pray, Madam, do not leave me yet, For I have many more complaints to tell you. QUEEN And I unable to redress the least: What wou'dst thou say, my Child? PRINCE EDWARD O Mother! Since I first have lain in'th'Tower My rest has still been broke with frightful Dreams, Of shocking News has wak'd me into tears. I'm scarce allow'd a Friend to visit me: All my old honest Servants are turn'd off, And in their rooms are strange ill-natur'd fellows, Who look so bold, as they were all my Masters; And, I'm afraid, they'll shortly take you from me. DUTCHESS OF YORK O mournful hearing! ANN O unhappy Prince! DUKE OF YORK Dear Brother, why do you weep so? You make me cry too. QUEEN Alas, poor Innocence! PRINCE EDWARD Wou'd I but knew at what my Uncle aims; If 'twere my Crown, I'd freely give it him, So he'd but let me 'joy my life in quiet. DUKE OF YORK Why! will my Uncle kill us, Brother? PRINCE EDWARD I hope he wo'n't: We never injur'd him. QUEEN I cannot bear to see 'em thus. — [Weeping. Enter to them, Lord Stanley.

I doubt my turn is next. ANN Nor mine, I fear, far off. QUEEN Why, then let's welcome Blood and Massacre, Yield all our Throats to fierce Tygers rage, And die lamenting one another's wrongs. O! I foresaw this ruin of our House. [Weeps. Enter Catesby to Lady Ann. CATESBY Madam, the King Has sent me to inform your Majesty That you prepare (as is advis'd from Counsel) To morrow for your Royal Coronation. QUEEN What do I hear? Support me, Heaven! ANN Despightful Tydings! O unpleasing News! Alas, I heard of this before, but cou'd not For my soul take heart to tell you of it. CATESBY The King does further wish your Majesty Wou'd less employ your visits at the Tower. He gives me leave t'attend you to the Court, And is impatient, Madam, till he sees you. ANN Farewel to all, and thou, poor injur'd Queen: Forgive the unfriendly duty I must pay. QUEEN Alas, kind Soul, I envy not thy Glory, Nor think I'm pleas'd thou'rt partner in our sorrow. CATESBY Madam. — ANN I come — QUEEN Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of Glory. CATESBY Shall I attend your Majesty? ANN Attend me! Whither, to be Crown'd?

ANN No more than with my Soul I mourn for yours: A long farewel to all. — (Exit Lady A. and Cat. STANLEY Take comfort, Madam. QUEEN Alas, where is it to be found? Death and Destruction follow us so close, They shortly must o'retake us. STANLEY In Brittany My Son-in-Law the Earl of Richmond still Resides, who with a jealous Eye observes The lawless actions of aspiring Richard: To him, (wou'd I advise you) Madam, fly Forthwith for Aid, Protection, and Redress. He will I'm sure with open arms receive you. DUTCHESS OF YORK Delay not Madam, For 'tis the only hope that Heaven has left us. QUEEN Do with me what you please: For any Change Must surely better our Condition. STANLEY I farther wou'd advise you, Madam, this Instant to remove the Princes to some Remote Abode, where you your self are Mistress.

QUEEN Come then, my pretty young ones, lets away: For here you lie within the Falcon's reach, Who watches but th' unguarded hour to seize you. Enter Lieutenant with an Order. LIEUTENANT I beg your Majesty will pardon me: But the young Princes must, on no account, Have egress from the Tower, Nor must, without the King's especial License, Of what degree soever, any Person Have admittance to 'em. — All must retire. QUEEN 'I am their Mother, Sir, who else commands 'em? 'If I pass freely, they shall follow me. 'For you — I'll take the peril of your fault upon my self.

QUEEN Support me Heaven! For life can never bear the pangs of such a parting. O my poor Children! O distracting thought! I dare not bid 'em (as I shou'd) farewel, And then to part in silence stabs my Soul. PRINCE EDWARD What, must you leave us, Mother? QUEEN What shall I say? (Aside. But for a time, my Loves — we shall meet again, At least in Heaven. [To her sons. DUKE OF YORK Won't you take me with you, Mother? I shall be so 'fraid to stay when you are gone.

BUCKINGHAM My gracious Sovereign. RICHARD Give me thy hand: At length by thy advice and thy assistance Is Richard seated on the English Throne. But say, my cousin, what, Shall we wear these Glories for a day? Or shall they last, and we rejoyce in 'em? BUCKINGHAM I hope for Ages, Sir, Long may they Grace you. RICHARD O Buckingham! now do I play the touch-stone, 'To try if thou be current Friend indeed. 'Young Edward lives: So does his Brother York. 'Now think what I wou'd speak! BUCKINGHAM 'Say on, my gracious Lord. RICHARD I tell thee, Cuz, I've lately had two Spiders Crawling upon my startled hopes: Now tho' Thy friendly hand has brush'd'em from me, Yet still they Crawl offensive to my Eyes, I wou'd have some Friend to tread upon 'em. I wou'd be King, my Cousin — BUCKINGHAM Why so I think you are, my Royal Lord. RICHARD Ha, am I King? 'Tis so -But -Edward lives! BUCKINGHAM Most true, my Lord. RICHARD Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull — Shall I be plain? I wish the Bastards dead. And I wou'd have it suddenly perform'd - 'Now cousin, canst thou answer me? BUCKINGHAM None dare dispute your Highness Pleasure. RICHARD 'Indeed, methinks thy kindness freezes Cousin; 'Thou dost refuse me then! -They shall not die? BUCKINGHAM 'My Lord, since 'tis an action cannot be 'Recall'd, allow me but some pause to think, 'I'll instantly resolve your Highness. (Ex. Buc. CATESBY The King seems angry; see he gnaws his lip. RICHARD I'll henceforth deal with shorter sighted Fools, None are for me that look into my Deeds, 'With thinking Eyes — High reaching Buckingham grows Circumspect. The best on't is it may be done without him, Tho' not so well perhaps -had he consented, Why, then the murther had been his, not mine. — — We'll make a shift as 'tis — Come hither, Catesby. Where's that same Tirrel whom thou toldst me of? Hast thou given him those sums of Gold I order'd? CATESBY I have, my Liege. RICHARD Where is he? CATESBY He waits your Highness pleasure. RICHARD Give him this Ring, and say my self Will bring him farther Orders instantly. (Ex. Cat. 'The deep revolving Duke of Buckingham No more shall be the Neighbour of my Counsels: Has he so long held out with me untir'd, And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.— Enter Lord Stanley. How now, Lord Stanley? What's the News? STANLEY I hear, my Liege, the Lord Marquess of Dorset Is fled to Richmond, now in Brittany. RICHARD Why let him go, my Lord, he may be spar'd. Hark thee, Ratcliff, when saw'st thou Ann, my Queen? Is she still weak? Has my Physician seen her? RATCLIFF He has, my Lord, and fears her mightily. RICHARD But he's excelling skillful, she'll mend shortly. RATCLIFF I hope she will, my Lord. RICHARD And, if she does, I have mistook my man. (aside. I must be married to my Brother's Daughter, At whom I know the Brittain Richmond aims; And by that knot looks proudly on the Crown. But then to stain me with her Brother's Blood: Is that the way to wooe the Sisters Love? '-No matter what's the way -For while they live 'My goodly Kingdom's on a weak Foundation. 'Tis done: My daring heart's resolv'd -they're dead. Re-enter Duke of Buckingham. BUCKINGHAM My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind, The late Request that you did sound me in. RICHARD Well, let that rest: Dorset is fled to Richmond. BUCKINGHAM I have heard the News, my Lord. RICHARD Stanley, he's your near Kinsman -Well, look to him. BUCKINGHAM My Lord, I claim that gift, my due by promise, 'For which your Honour and your Faith's engag'd; 'The Earldom of Hereford, and those Moveables, 'Which you have promis'd I shall possess. RICHARD Stanley, look to your Wife; if she convey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it. BUCKINGHAM 'What says your Highness to my Just request? RICHARD I do remember me, Henry the Sixth Did Prophecy that Richmond should be King, When Richmond was a peevish Boy! ''Tis odd — A King perhaps. Enter Catesby. CATESBY My Lord, I have obey'd your Highness Orders. BUCKINGHAM May it please you to resolve me in my Suit? RICHARD Lead Tirrel to my Closet, I'll meet him. BUCKINGHAM I beg your Highness ear my Lord — RICHARD I'm busie: Thou troubl'st me — I'm not i'th'vein. [Ex. Rich. BUCKINGHAM O patience, Heaven! Is't thus he pays my service? Was it for this I rais'd him to the Throne? Since he forgets the Hand that lifted him, That seated still supports him; then 'tis time To loose my hold, and let him fall as low, As this contemn'd, this out-cast Buckingham. O! if the peaceful dead have any sence Of those vile injuries they bore, while living: Then sure the joyful Souls of Blood-suck'd Edward, Henry, Clarence, Hastings, and All that through His foul corrupted dealings have miscarried, Will from the Walls of Heav'n in smiles look down to see this Tyrant tumbling from his Throne, His Fall unmourn'd, and Bloody as their own.

Well, No matter where — Has any careful Friend Discover'd yet the number of the Rebels? NORFOLK 'My Lord, as I from certain Spies am well 'Inform'd, six or seven thousand is their 'Utmost Power.

Here may each leader know his several Charge: My Lord of Oxford, you Sir Walter Herbert, And Sir William Brandon, stay with me: The Earl of Pembroke keeps his Regiment. Enter a Soldier. SOLDIER Sir, a Gentleman that calls himself Stanley, Desires admittance to the Earl of Richmond. RICHMOND Now by our hopes, my Noble Father-in-Law, Addmit him — My good Friends, your leave a while. [They retire. Enter Lord Stanley in a Cloak. My Honour'd Father! On my Soul The joy of seeing you this night is more, Than my most knowing hopes presag'd — What News? STANLEY I, by Commission bless thee from they Mother, Who prays continually for Richmond's good: 'The Queen too, has with tears of joy consented, 'Thou should'st espouse Elizabeth her Daughter, At whom the Tyrant Richard closely aims: 'In brief (for now the shortest moment of 'My stay is bought with hazard of my Life) Prepare thy Battle early in the morning, (For so the season of Affairs requires) 'And this be sure of, I, upon the first Occasion offer'd, will deceive some Eyes, And aid thee in this doubtful shock of Arms; 'In which I had more forward been e'er this, 'But that the Life of thy young Brother George (Whom for my pawn of Faith stern Richard keeps) 'Wou'd then be forfeit to his wild Revenge. Farewel: The rude enforcement of the time 'Denies me to revive those Vows of Love — Which so long sunder'd Friends shou'd dwell upon. RICHMOND We may meet again, my Lord — STANLEY Till then, once more farewel: Be resolute and Conquer. RICHMOND Give him safe Conduct to is Regiment. [Exit Ld. Stan. Well, Sirs, to morrow proves a busie day: But come, the night's far spent — Let's in to Counsel. Captain, an hour before the Sun gets up Let me be wak'd; I will in Person walk From Tent to Tent, and early chear the Soldiers. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene, before Richard's Tent: Richard, Ratcliff, Norfolk and Catesby. RICHARD Catesby! CATESBY Here, my Lord. RICHARD Send out a Pursuivant at Arms To Stanley's Regiment: Bid him 'fore Sun-rise, Meet me with his Power, or young George's Head Shall pay the forfeit of his cold delay. What, is my Beaver easier than it was? And all my Armour laid into my Tent? CATESBY It is, my Liege: All is in readiness. RICHARD Good Norfolk, hye thee to thy Charge; Use careful Watch: Chuse trusty Centinals. NORFOLK Doubt not, my Lord. RICHARD Be stirring with the Lark, good Norfolk. NORFOLK I shall, my Lord. [Exit Duke of Norfolk. RICHARD Saddle White Surrey for the Field to morrow. Is Ink and Paper ready? CATESBY It is, my Lord. RICHARD An hour after Midnight, come to my Tent, And help to Arm me. A good night, my Friends. (Exit. RATCLIFF Methinks the King has not that pleas'd Alacrity Nor Cheer of Mind that he was wont to have. CATESBY The meer effect of business — You'll find him, Sir, another Man i'th'Field, When you shall see him with his Beavour up, Ready to mount his Neighing Steed, with whom He smiling, seems to have some wanton talk, Clapping his pamper'd sides to hold him still; Then, with a motion swift, and light as Air, Like fiery Mars he Vaults him to the saddle; Looks Terror to the Foe, and Courage to his Soldiers. RATCLIFF Good night to Richmond then; for, as I hear, His numbers are so few, and those so sick And famish'd in their march, if he dares fight us — He jumps into the Sea to cool his Feaver. But come, 'tis late: Now let's to our Tents, We've few hours good before the Trumpet wakes us. (Ex. (Ed. note: In the 1718 edition the assignment of these final lines between Catesby and Ratcliff is reversed.) Enter Richard from his Tent. Solus. RICHARD 'Tis now the dead of Night, and half the World Is with a lonely solemn darkness hung; Yet I (so coy a dame is sleep to me) With all the weary Courtship of My Care-tir'd thoughts can't win her to my Bed; Tho' ev'n the Stars do wink as 'twere, with over watching — I'll forth, and walk a while — The Air's refreshing. And the ripe Harvest of the new mown Hay Gives it a sweet and wholesome Odour: 'How awful is this gloom — and hark from Camp to Camp 'The humm of either Army stilly sounds: That the fixt Centinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other watch. 'Steed threatens Steed in high and boastful neighings, 'Piercing the nights dull Ear. Hark from the Tents, The Armourers accomplishing the Knights, 'With clink of hammers closing rivets up Give Dreadful note of Preparation; while some 'Like sacrifices by their fires of watch, 'With patience sit, and inly ruminate 'The mornings danger. By yon Heav'n my stern 'Impatience chides this tardy-gated night, 'Who, like a foul and ugly Witch, does limp So tediously away: I'll to my Couch, And once more try to sleep her into morning. (lies down. A Groan is heard. Ha! What means that dismal voice? Sure 'tis The Eccho of some yawning Grave, That teems with an untimely Ghost. — 'Tis gone! 'Twas but my Fancy, or perhaps the Wind Forcing his entrance thro' some hollow Cavern; No matter what — I feel my eyes grow heavy. (Sleeps. The Ghost of Henry VI. rises KING HENRY'S GHOST O thou, whose unrelenting thoughts, not all The hideous Terrours of thy Guilt can shake, Whose Conscience with thy Body ever sleeps: Sleep on, while I by Heavens high Ordinance In dreams of horror wake thy frighted Soul: Now give thy thoughts to me, let 'em behold These gaping Wounds, which thy Death-dealing hand Within the Tower gave my Anointed Body, Now shall thy own devouring Conscience gnaw Thy heart, and terribly revenge my Murder. The Ghosts of the young Princes rise. PRINCES' GHOSTS Richard, dream on; and see the wandring spirits Of thy young Nephews, murder'd in the Tower: Cou'd not our Youth, our Innocence perswade Thy cruel heart to spare our harmless lives? Who, but for thee, alas, might have enjoy'd Our many promis'd years of Happiness. No Soul, save thine, but pitties our misusage: O! 'twas a cruel deed! therefore alone, Unpittying, unpittied shalt thou fall. (Vanish. The Ghost of Ann his Wife rises. ANN'S GHOST Think on the wrongs of wretched Ann thy Wife, Ev'n in the Battles heat remember me, And edgeless fall they Sword — Despair, and Die. KING HENRY'S GHOST The mornings dawn has summon'd me away: Now Richard wake in all the Hells of Guilt, And let that wild despair which now does prey Upon thy mangled thoughts, allarm the World. Awake Richard, awake! To guilty minds A terrible Example. — (sinks (Rich. starts out of his sleep. RICHARD Give me another Horse: Bind up my wounds! 'Have mercy, Heaven. Ha! -soft! -'Twas but a dream: But then so terrible, it shakes my Soul. Cold drops of sweat hang on my trembling Flesh, My blood grows chilly, and I freze with horror. O Tyrant Consciene! how dost thou aflict me! When I look back, 'tis terrible Retreating: I cannot bear the thought, nor dare repent: I am but Man, and Fate, do thou dispose me. Who's there? Enter Catesby. CATESBY 'Tis I, my Lord; the Village Cock Has thrice done salutation to the morn: Your Friends are up, and buckle on their Armour. RICHARD 'O Catesby! I have had such horrid dreams. — CATESBY 'Shadows, my Lord, below the Soldier's heeding. RICHARD Now, by my this days hopes, shadows to night Have struck more terror in the Soul of Richard, Than can the substance of ten Thousand Soldiers Arm'd all in Proof, and led by shallow Richmond. CATESBY 'Be more your self, my Lord: Consider, Sir: 'Were it but known a dream had frighted you, 'How wou'd your animated Foes presume on't. RICHARD Perish that thought: No, never be it said, That Fate it self could awe the Soul of Richard. Hence, Babling dreams, you threaten here in vain: Conscience avant; Richard's himself again. Hark! the shrill Trumpet sounds, to Horse: Away! My Soul's in Arms, and eager for the Fray. [Exeunt. Enter Richmond, Oxford, Soldiers, etc. Marching. RICHMOND Halt.— (Soldiers halt, halt, etc.) How far is it into the morning, Friends? OXFORD Near four, my Lord. RICHMOND 'Tis well: I'm glad to find we are such early stirers. OXFORD Methinks the Foe's less forward than we thought 'em. Worn as we are, we brave the Field before 'em. RICHMOND Come, there looks life in such a cheerful haste: 'If dreams should animate a Soul resolv'd, 'I'm more than pleas'd with those I've had to night. 'Methought that all the Ghosts of them, whose Bodies 'Richard murther'd, came mourning to my Tent, 'And rous'd me to revenge 'em. OXFORD A good Omen, Sir: Hark! the Trumpet of The Enemy. It speaks them on the march. RICHMOND 'Why, then let's on, my Friends, to face 'em: 'In Peace there's nothing so becomes a Man 'As mild behaviour and humility: 'But when the blast of War blows in our ears, 'Let us be Tygers in our fierce deportment. For me, the ransome of my bold attempt 'Shall be this Body, on the Earth's cold Face: But, if we thrive, the Glory of the Action The meanest here shall share his part of. 'Advance your Standards, draw your willing Swords: 'Sound, Drums and Trumpets, boldly and cheerfully. The Word's Saint George, Richmond, and Victory. (Exeunt. Enter Richard, Catesby, marching. RICHARD Who saw the Sun to day? CATESBY He has not yet broke forth, my Lord. RICHARD Then he disdains to shine; For, by the Clock, He should have brav'd the East an hour ago. Not shine to day? — Why, what is that to me, 'More than to Richmond? For the self-same Heaven 'That frowns on me, looks lowring upon him. Enter Norfolk with a Paper. NORFOLK Prepare, my Lord, the Foe's in the Field. RICHARD Come, bustle, bustle; Caparison my Horse: Call forth Lord Stanley; bid him bring his Power. My self will lead the Soldiers to the Plain. (Exit Catesby. Well, Norfolk, what thinkst thou now? NORFOLK That we shall Conquer, Sir; but on my Tent This morning early was this Paper found. RICHARD [reads.] Jockey of Norfolk be not too bold, For Dickon thy Master is bought and sold. 'A weak invention of the Enemy. 'Come, Gentlemen, now each man to his Charge. What shall I say more than I have infer'd: Remember whom you are to Cope withal, A scum of Britains, Rascals, Run-aways; Whom their o'er cloy'd Country vomits forth To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction. If we be Conquer'd, let Men Conquer us, And not these Bastard Britains, whom our Fathers 'Have in their own Land, beaten, spurn'd, and trod on. And left 'em on Record, the Heirs of shame; Are these Men fit to be the Heirs of England? Enter Catesby. What says Lord Stanley: Will he bring his Power? CATESBY He does refuse, my Lord: He will not, Sir. RICHARD Off with his Son Georges head. (Trumpet sounds. NORFOLK My Lord, the Foe's already past the Marsh: After the Battle let young Stanley die. RICHARD Why, after be it then — A thousand hearts are swelling in my bosom. 'Draw Archers, draw your Arrows to the head, 'Spur your proud Horses hard, and ride in blood: And thou, our Warlike Champion, thrice Renown'd St. George inspire me with the Rage of Lyons — Upon 'em! Charge! —Follow me — (Exeunt. An Allarm is heard: Richard re-enters alone. RICHARD What, ho! young Richmond, ho! 'tis Richard calls. I hate thee, Harry, for thy blood of Lancaster; 'Now if thou dost not hide thee from my Sword, 'Now while the angry Trumpet sounds Allarms, 'And dead mens groans transpierce the wounded Air. 'Richmond, I say, come forth, and single face me: 'Richard is Hoarse with Daring thee to Arms. The Allarm continues: Enter Catesby, and the D. of Nor. in disorder. CATESBY Rescue! rescue! my Lord of Norfolk, haste. The King Enacts more wonders than a Man, Daring an opposite to every danger: His Horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, Seeking for Richmond in the throat of Death. 'Nay, haste, my Lord: the day's against us. (Exeunt. Enter Richard and Ratcliff in disorder. RICHARD A Horse! a Horse! my Kingdom for a Horse! RATCLIFF 'This way, this way, my Lord; below yon thicket 'Stands a swift Horse, Away, ruin pursues us. 'Withdraw, my Lord, for only flight can save you. RICHARD Slave, I have set my Life upon a Cast And I will stand the hazard of the Dye. I think there be six Richmonds in the Field; Five have I slain to day, instead of him. An Horse! an Horse! my Kingdom for an Horse. (Ex. Re-enter Richard, and Richmond meeting. RICHARD 'Of one, or both of us the time is come. RICHMOND Kind Heaven I thank thee, for my Cause is thine; If Richard's fit to live let Richmond fall. RICHARD Thy Gallant bearing, Harry, I cou'd plaud, But that the spotted Rebel stains the Soldier. RICHMOND Nor shou'd thy Prowess, Richard, want my praise, But that thy cruel deeds have stampt thee Tyrant. So thrive my Sword as Heaven's high Vengeance draws it. RICHARD 'My Soul and Body on the Action both. RICHMOND A dreadful lay: Here's to decide it. (Allarm, fight. RICHARD Perdition catch thy Arm. The chance is thine: (Richard is wounded. But oh! the vast Renown thou hast acquired In Conquering Richard, does afflict him more Than even his Bodies parting with its Soul: 'Now let the World no longer be a Stage 'To feed contention in a lingring Act: 'But let one spirit of the First-born Cain 'Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set 'On bloody Actions, the rude Scene may end, 'And darkness be the Burier of the Dead. (Dies. RICHMOND Farewel, Richard, and from thy dreadful end May future Kings from Tyranny be warn'd; Had thy aspring Soul but stir'd in Vertue With half the Spirit it has dar'd in Evil, How might thy Fame have grac'd our English Annals: But as thou art, how fair a Page thou'st blotted. Hark! the glad Trumpets speak the Field our own. Enter Oxford and Lord Stanley: Soldiers follow with Richard's Crown. O welcome, Friends: My Noble Father welcome. Heaven and our Arms be prais'd the day is ours. See there, by Lords, stern Richard is no more. STANLEY Victorious Richmond well hast thou acquitted thee: — And see, the just reward that Heaven has sent thee. 'Among the Glorious spoils of Bosworth Field, 'We've found the Crown, which now in right is thine: 'Tis doubly thine by Conquest, and by Choice. 'Long Live Henry the Seventh, King of England. (Shouts here. RICHMOND Next to Just Heaven, my Noble Countrymen, I owe my thanks to you, whose love I'm proud of, And Ruling well shall speak my Gratitude. But now, my Lords, what Friends of us are missing? Pray tell me; Is young George Stanley living? STANLEY He is, my Liege, and safe in Leicester Town, Whither, if you please, we may withdraw us. Enter Blunt. BLUNT My Lord, the Queen and fair Elizabeth, Her beautious Daughter, some few miles of, are On their way to Gratulate your Victory. RICHMOND Ay, there indeed my toil's rewarded. Let us prepare to meet 'em, Lords, and then, As we're already bound by solemn Vows; 'We'll twine the Roses red and white together, 'And both from one kind stalk shall flourish: England has long been mad, and scarr'd her self. 'The Brother blindly shed the Brother's blood: 'The Father rashly slaughter'd his own Son: 'The bloody Son compell'd, has kill'd his Sire. 'O! Now let Henry and Elizabeth, The true Successors of each Royal House 'Conjoyn'd together, heal those deadly wounds: 'And be that wretch of all mankind abhor'd, 'That wou'd reduce those bloody days again: 'Ne'er let him live to taste our Joys encrease, 'That wou'd with Treason wound fair England's Peace.
