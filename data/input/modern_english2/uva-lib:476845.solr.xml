      <field name="fulltext">I little tree little silent Christmas tree you are so little you are more like a flower who found you in the green forest and were you very sorry to come away? see       i will comfort you because you smell so sweetly i will kiss your cool bark and hug you safe and tight just as your mother would, only don't be afraid look       the spangles that sleep all the year in a dark box dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, put up your little arms and i'll give them all to you to hold. every finger shall have its ring and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy then when you're quite dressed you'll stand in the window for everyone to see and how they'll stare! oh but you'll be very proud and my little sister and i will take hands and looking up at our beautiful tree we'll dance and sing "Noel Noel" Image of page 23, poems II &amp; III</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II the bigness of cannon is skilful, but i have seen death's clever enormous voice which hides in a fragility of poppies. . . . i say that sometimes on these long talkative animals are laid fists of huger silence. I have seen all the silence full of vivid noiseless boys at Roupy i have seen between barrages, the night utter ripe unspeaking girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III Buffalo Bill's defunct       who used to       ride a watersmooth-silver       stallion and break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat       Jesus he was a handsome man       and what i want to know is how do you like your blueeyed boy Mister Death Image of page 24, poems IV &amp; V</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV when god lets my body be From each brave eye shall sprout a tree fruit that dangles therefrom the purpled world will dance upon Between my lips which did sing a rose shall beget the spring that maidens whom passion wastes will lay between their little breasts My strong fingers beneath the snow Into strenuous birds shall go my love walking in the grass their wings will touch with her face and all the while shall my heart be With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V why did you go little fourpaws? you forgot to shut your big eyes. where did you go? like little kittens are all the leaves which open in the rain. little kittens who are called spring, is what we stroke maybe asleep? Image of page 25, poems V, VI, &amp; VII do you know? or maybe did something go away ever so quietly when we weren't looking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VI when life is quite through with and leaves say alas, much is to do for the swallow, that closes a flight in the blue; when love's had his tears out, perhaps shall pass a million years (while a bee doses on the poppies, the dears; when all's done and said, and under the grass lies her head, by oaks and roses deliberated.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII O Distinct Lady of my unkempt adoration if I have made a fragile curtain song under the window of your soul it is not like any songs (the singers the others they have been faithful Image of page 26, poem VII to many things and which die i have been sometimes true to Nothing and which lives they were fond of the handsome moon       never spoke ill of the pretty stars       and to the serene the complicated and the obvious they were faithful and which i despise, frankly admitting i have been true only to the noise of worms in the eligible day under the unaccountable sun) Distinct Lady swiftly take my fragile certain song that we may watch together how behind the doomed exact smile of life's placid obscure palpable carnival where to a normal melody of probable violins dance the square virtues with the oblong sins perfectly gesticulate the accurate strenuous lips of incorruptible Nothing       under the ample sun, under the insufficient day under the noise of worms I.
