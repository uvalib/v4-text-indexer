      <field name="heading_text">A NEW ENGLAND "ADAM BEDE"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She Pictures New England Decay Three-quarter length photographic portrait in three-quarter profile. Mrs. Wharton stands, apparently reading a letter. Pitiless in the perfect freedom of her art, Mrs. Wharton shows us how full «Summer« always is of flies «crossing in the sunshine.«</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOCIAL DECAY in a Massachusetts village is the background of Mrs. Edith Wharton's latest novel, which is likened to «Adam Bede« by a contributor to the Boston Transcript . The concise and gentle title «Summer« may suggest to the casual eye that the book is for hammock reading, but it is far from being of that character, for it «revives that ticklish question of long standing, the sad and scandalous decadence of the so-called 'hill towns' and the degeneracy of their population.« The characters of «Summer« are the victims of the social decay of one of these towns, and the incidents are the reactions of the natives to summer visitors from Springfield and other nearer flourishing towns with their foreign operatives. Of the novelist's method this critic observes:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">«It is her persistent, yet not unsympathetic, detachment that permits her to study the situations until the perfect balance and adjustment are reached in the development of character and episode. All that happens seems inevitable—and hopeless! It is the ruthless working out of the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest. It is the play of the primitive passions amid the operation of the social law that to those who have every social advantage more shall be given, while from those who have none, and never have had any, shall be taken even that which they have. The events, tho comprest within two months, or three at the most, for the main part, and confined within a single county, are of the most powerful and violent kind—rank, shocking, and fierce—that is to say, in physical character and implications—compared with anything in the stories of Mr. Howells or Henry James. Maupassant was not more cruel. The wonder of the art with which they have been assembled is that they seem necessary, inevitable, almost commonplace, so naturally and inextricably are all knit up together. Analysis, moral preachment, literary ornament—all are likewise so worked into the fabric and made part of it that the reader is unconscious of anything of this kind from beginning to end—the story is all.«</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As an example of Mrs. Wharton's gift for picturization this critic offers us the same scene when the young architect from the city visits a maiden lady who is the one rich resident of the village and the sole patroness of the public library. The librarian is «a waif brought from the mountain in her infancy.« The architect suggests a rose window for the rear wall of the building to give it ventilation and relieve it of the damp and stuffiness of a vault. One afternoon the little librarian escapes from this vault, runs up the hillside and lies on the ridge above a small hollow, and, to quote the novelist—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">«her face prest to the earth and the warm currents of the grass running through her. Directly in her line of vision a blackberry branch laid its frail white flowers and blue-green leaves against the sky. Just beyond, a tuft of sweet fern uncurled between the beaded shoots of the grass, and a small yellow butterfly vibrated over them like a fleck of sunshine. This was all she saw, but she felt above her and about her the strong growth of the beeches clothing the ridge, the rounding of pale green cones on countless spruce branches, the push of myriads of sweet fern fronds in the cracks of the stony slope below the wood, and the growing shoots of meadow sweet and yellow flags in the pasture beyond. All this bubbling of sap and slipping of sheaths and bursting of calyxes was carried to her on mingled currents of fragrance. Every leaf and bud and blade seemed to contribute its exhalation to the pervading sweetness in which the pungency of pine sap prevailed over the spice of thyme and the subtle perfume of fern, and all were merged in a moist earth-smell that was like the breath of some huge, sun-warmed animal.«</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In theme «Summer« is likened to «Faust,« «The Scarlet Letter,« and «Adam Bede,« for it is the «old, old story« of all lands and times, but Mrs. Wharton has projected it into western Massachusetts and brought it down to to-day, and The Transcript contributor adds:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">«We do not have to allow for 'other times, other morals'—for, say, the romantic setting of Goethe's Gretchen —and pity the privations of the peasant class in Europe; we do not have occasion to thank Heaven, with Hawthorne, that we do not live any nearer to the grim old Puritan epoch of New England; we can not escape in such convenient refuges, we have to face the music here and now: there are holes and corners of our own rich old State where neglected humanity—especially neglected are the very old and the very young—are worse sheltered, fed, and cared for than cattle, with the inevitable consequences of the depraved environment. But Mrs. Wharton does not descend to moralizing; she simply reproduces this environment as in so many movie films; and as she must be pitiless in her perfect freedom, she shows us how full 'Summer' always is of flies 'crossing in the sunshine,' as Wordsworth said of 'Wilhelm Meister.' . . . It is the pessimism into which the world-war plunged that gayest of astronomers, Camille Flammarion: 'It is not a planet much worth fighting for, anyway, where man can only live by devouring its fauna and flora,' he said, in a Sunday lecture at the Sorbonne, just after the battle of the Marne had barely saved Paris.«</field>
