      <field name="heading_text">PART THE FIRST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving The illustrator is not identified. The illustration depicts a head and shoulders portrait of the Ancient Mariner. He is wearing a brimmed rain hat and rain coat, and his long white hair and beard are blowing in the wind. His brow furrowed, the Ancient Mariner stares at something to his left. The words "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" are written in decorative script over the background of the portrait.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration From the Sampson Low, Son &amp; Co. 1858 edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT is an ancient Mariner, And he stoppeth one of three. "By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, And I am next of kin; The guests are met, the feast is set: May'st hear the merry din."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration From the Sampson Low, Son &amp; Co. 1858 edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He holds him with his skinny hand, "There was a ship," quoth he. "Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!" Eftsoons his hand dropt he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He holds him with his glittering eye— The Wedding-Guest stood still, And listens like a three years child: The Mariner hath his will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: He cannot chuse but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The Ancient Mariner, barefooted and wearing long white robes, grabs the sleeve of a younger man who is passing by with two other men. The three younger men are wearing tight pants, fancy capes and hats with feathers. Two of them look apprehensively at the Ancient Mariner, while the third looks ahead. They seem eager to get away from the older man, as they have continued to walk away after he has apprehended them. The setting of this illustration is quite different from the others, as the group is next to a large tree in the middle of a field, rather than near the walled city which appears in the earlier illustrations in this book. The dress and appearance of the characters is also different than in the other drawings, suggesting that this illustration was drawn by someone other than Gustave Doré.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, Merrily did we drop Below the kirk, below the hill, Below the light-house top.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. The Ancient Mariner, the Wedding-Guest and one other man stand at the bottom of a stone staircase next to a stone wall near a large castle. The Mariner rests his right hand on the right shoulder of the Wedding-Guest, and they stare intensely at one another. The other young man, who is held against the wall by the outstretched arm of the Mariner, looks away from both of the other men, and has a concerned look on his face. A fourth man is walking up the steps toward a group of people at the top. He looks apprehensively over his right shoulder at the group at the bottom of the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sun came up upon the left, Out of the sea came he! And he shone bright, and on the right Went down into the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Higher and higher every day, Till over the mast at noon— The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, For he heard the loud bassoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bride hath paced into the hall, Red as a rose is she; Nodding their heads before her goes The merry minstrelsy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Birket Foster. The ship is sailing away from a mountainous port, on fairly calm seas. The sky is partly covered with clouds, and a breeze fills the sails of the boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast, Yet he cannot chuse but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. The Ancient Mariner bends over the Wedding-Guest, who is sitting on a bench next to the wall close to the village and church. The Mariner's hands grip the shoulders of the young man, and the two men stare closely and intently at one another. The Mariner is dressed in tattered robes and sandals, and the Wedding-Guest in a fancy cloak, vest and hat. Well-dressed men and women are crowded in the distance, close to the church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The bride is escorted through a hall by a young man. In front of her, a group of musicians announce her entrance with trumpets. Behind her, several veiled women huddle together and watch her proceed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he Was tyrannous and strong: He struck with his o'ertaking wings, And chased south along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With sloping masts and dipping prow, As who pursued with yell and blow Still treads the shadow of his foe And forward bends his head, The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, And southward aye we fled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration From the Sampson Low, Son &amp; Co. 1858 edition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now there came both mist and snow, And it grew wondrous cold: And ice, mast-high, came floating by, As green as emerald.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And through the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen: Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken— The ice was all between.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ice was here, the ice was there, The ice was all around: It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, Like noises in a swound!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length did cross an Albatross: Thorough the fog it came; As if it had been a Christian soul, We hailed it in God's name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It ate the food it ne'er had eat, And round and round it flew. The ice did split with a thunder-fit; The helmsman steered us through!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The ship, darkened against the seascape, leans with a strong wind blowing against it. There are ice floes floating in the rough water, and the albatross flies near the boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And a good south wind sprung up behind; The Albatross did follow, And every day, for food or play, Came to the mariners' hollo!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner sits on the deck of the ship, gazing at the albatross flying above his head. Other sailors have gathered in a semi-circle behind the Mariner, and they too look with wonder at the bird. One of the young sailors holds out his hand, presumably with food, to the creature as it swoops down toward the deck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, It perched for vespers nine; Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, Glimmered the white Moon-shine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God save thee, ancient Mariner! From the fiends, that plague thee thus!— Why look'st thou so?"—With my cross-bow I shot the ALBATROSS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner stands on the deck of the ship, holding the cross-bow with which he has just shot the albatross. With an arrow stuck in its breast, the bird falls toward the deck. Several other sailors stand behind the Mariner, in the shadows of the sails, and look gravely at the bird and the Mariner. A male spirit floats above the Mariner, looking down with anger at what has just taken place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner, his back to the other sailors who have gathered around him, stares defiantly at the dead albatross. The Mariner is holding his cross-bow in his left hand, and has his right hand on his hip. A young sailor, crouching along with two others on the deck at the Mariner's feet, holds the bird in his arms and looks up at the Mariner. Three older sailors standing behind the Mariner look with shock and fear at the assassin.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PART THE SECOND.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Sun now rose upon the right: Out of the sea came he, Still hid in mist, and on the left Went down into the sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the good south wind still blew behind But no sweet bird did follow, Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariners' hollo!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And I had done an hellish thing, And it would work 'em woe: For all averred, I had killed the bird That made the breeze to blow. Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay That made the breeze to blow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. This illustration depicts the shooting of the albatross. The background of this illustration is very dark, and ice floes are the only shapes visible in the sea. The white albatross stands out against the darkness, and a white arrow is shooting toward its breast. One of the ship's yardarms, to which the sail is attached, is visible in the lower left corner of the illustration, and appears to be covered with icicles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor dim nor red, like God's own head, The glorious Sun uprist: Then all averred, I had killed the bird That brought the fog and mist. 'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay, That bring the fog and mist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, The furrow followed free: We were the first that ever burst Into that silent sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down, 'Twas sad as sad could be; And we did speak only to break The silence of the sea!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All in a hot and copper sky, The bloody Sun, at noon, Right up above the mast did stand, No bigger than the Moon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Water, water, every where, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The very deep did rot: O Christ! That ever this should be! Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs Upon the slimy sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About, about, in reel and rout The death-fires danced at night; The water, like a witch's oils, Burnt green, and blue and white.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And some in dreams assured were Of the spirit that plagued us so: Nine fathom deep he had followed us From the land of mist and snow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The ship sits upon still, glassy waters in which its reflection appears. The sails hang slackly, and no men are visible on the deck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And every tongue, through utter drought, Was withered at the root; We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah! well a-day! what evil looks Had I from old and young! Instead of the cross, the Albatross About my neck was hung.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner stands on the deck of the ship, the albatross hanging from a rope around his neck. The bird's wing-span is as large as the man's height. The Mariner holds his head in his right hand, looking remorseful. Four other sailors sit with their backs to the Mariner, gazing into the distance over the side of the ship.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PART THE THIRD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE passed a weary time. Each throat Was parched, and glazed each eye. A weary time! a weary time! How glazed each weary eye, When looking westward, I beheld A something in the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner kneels among a group of weary and ill sailors who are lying on the deck. He is pointing with both hands over the side of the ship, and appears to be calling something out to his shipmates. Several of the other sailors are lifting their heads to see what the Mariner is pointing to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At first it seemed a little speck, And then it seemed a mist: It moved and moved, and took at last A certain shape, I wist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! And still it neared and neared: As if it dodged a water-sprite, It plunged and tacked and veered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, We could not laugh nor wail; Through utter drought all dumb we stood! I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, And cried, A sail! a sail!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. The Ancient Mariner, standing on the crow's nest of the ship, gazes at the ship and the stormy sea beneath him. The boat tilts steeply in the strong wind, and the Mariner must grip tightly to the ratlines of a rope ladder in order to keep his balance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, Agape they heard me call: Gramercy! they for joy did grin, And all at once their breath drew in, As they were drinking all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more! Hither to work us weal; Without a breeze, without a tide, She steadies with upright keel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by H. Harral. The Mariner's ship sails toward a second ship visible against the setting sun in the distance. The sea and sky are both clear and calm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The western wave was all a-flame The day was well nigh done! Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun; When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. Many men, dressed in tattered clothing, and many of them naked from the waist up, have gathered on the bow and the bowsprit of the Mariner's ship to watch the second ship, which is visible in this illustration only as a blur on the horizon. The men have haggard looks on their faces, and many of them do not look encouraged by the sight of the ship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) As if through a dungeon-grate he peered, With broad and burning face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud) How fast she nears and nears! Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, Like restless gossameres!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Are those her ribs through which the Sun Did peer, as through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a DEATH? and are there two? Is DEATH that woman's mate?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The naked hulk alongside came, And the twain were casting dice; "The game is done! I've won! I've won!" Quoth she, and whistles thrice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out: At one stride comes the dark; With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea. Off shot the spectre-bark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We listened and looked sideways up! Fear at my heart, as at a cup, My life-blood seemed to sip!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. Death, a skeletal figure hooded and cloaked with sheets, sits in the bow of the Mariner's ship, holding a cup from which he has just rolled a pair of dice. Life-in-Death, a pale specter with long golden hair and a long, loose dress, crouches at Death's feet on the deck of the ship, looking at the dice. The ship surrounding them is a site of destruction, with broken beams, torn sails, and fraying ropes decaying everywhere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. Death and Life-in-Death sit face-to-face at a table on board the ship, playing dice. Death is a skeleton, shrouded in a white cloth which covers its body as well as its face. Life-in-Death is a beautiful young woman with long, curly hair; she is dressed in a white gown and beaded jewelry. She holds a dice cup high in the air with her left hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stars were dim, and thick the night, The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white; From the sails the dew did drip— Till clombe above the eastern bar The horned Moon, with one bright star Within the nether tip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner sits on the deck of the ship, amidst the corpses of his shipmates. He holds his head in his hands in sorrow. The spirits of the deceased men float above the ship, gazing upward and holding their hands in prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One after one, by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh, Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, And cursed me with his eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four times fifty living men, (And I heard nor sigh nor groan) With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, They dropped down one by one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The souls did from their bodies fly,— They fled to bliss or woe! And every soul, it passed me by, Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PART THE FOURTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Wedding Guest stands facing the Ancient Mariner, who sits on a stump in front of a tree. The young man appears taken aback by the Mariner's tale, and he stares at the old man in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I FEAR thee, ancient Mariner! I fear thy skinny hand! And thou art long, and lank, and brown, As is the ribbed sea-sand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I fear thee and thy glittering eye, And thy skinny hand, so brown."— Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest! This body dropt not down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alone, alone, all, all alone, Alone on a wide wide sea! And never a saint took pity on My soul in agony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The many men, so beautiful! And they all dead did lie: And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on; and so did I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The Mariner's ship sits on a calm sea at night. The full moon is partially covered by clouds, and reflects the ship in the still water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I looked upon the rotting sea, And drew my eyes away; I looked upon the rotting deck, And there the dead men lay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray: But or ever a prayer had gusht, A wicked whisper came, and made my heart as dry as dust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I closed my lids, and kept them close, And the balls like pulses beat; For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky Lay like a load on my weary eye, And the dead were at my feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cold sweat melted from their limbs, Nor rot nor reek did they: The look with which they looked on me Had never passed away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An orphan's curse would drag to Hell A spirit from on high; But oh! more horrible than that Is a curse in a dead man's eye! Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, And yet I could not die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moving Moon went up the sky, And no where did abide: Softly she was going up, And a star or two beside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her beams bemocked the sultry main, Like April hoar-frost spread; But where the ship's huge shadow lay, The charmed water burnt alway A still and awful red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. The Ancient Mariner sits on the bowsprit of the ship, looking hopelessly to his right, toward the rest of the boat. The albatross, almost as large as the man, hangs around his nck. In front of the boat, to the Mariner's left, several large water snakes swim in the still water. One of them has surfaced and looks in the Mariner's direction. It is night and the water is calm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beyond the shadow of the ship, I watched the water-snakes: They moved in tracks of shining white, And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire: Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O happy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare: A spring of love gushed from my heart, And I blessed them unaware: Sure my kind saint took pity on me, And I blessed them unaware.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The Mariner, the albatross no longer hanging around his neck, kneels in prayer on the deck of the ship. His arms are crossed over his chest, feeling the absence of the bird. Behind him lay the corpses of his shipmates, and there is a full moon in the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The self same moment I could pray; And from my neck so free The Albatross fell off, and sank Like lead into the sea.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PART THE FIFTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OH sleep! it is a gentle thing, Beloved from pole to pole! To Mary Queen the praise be given! She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, That slid into my soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The silly buckets on the deck, That had so long remained, I dreamt that they were filled with dew; And when I awoke, it rained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. The Mariner is sitting on the deck of the ship, leaning against the railing and sleeping. The albatross is no longer around his neck. The bodies of several of his shipmates lay on the deck. Two birds fly overhead, and several female angel-like figures float over the Mariner's head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My lips were wet, my throat was cold, My garments all were dank; Sure I had drunken in my dreams, And still my body drank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I moved, and could not feel my limbs: I was so light—almost I thought that I had died in sleep, And was a blessed ghost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And soon I heard a roaring wind: It did not come anear; But with its sound it shook the sails, That were so thin and sere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The upper air burst into life! And a hundred fire-flags sheen, To and fro they were hurried about! And to and fro, and in and out, The wan stars danced between.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the coming wind did roar more loud, And the sails did sigh like sedge; And the rain poured down from one black cloud; The Moon was at its edge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The thick black cloud was cleft, and still The Moon was at its side: Like waters shot from some high crag, The lightning fell with never a jag, A river steep and wide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The loud wind never reached the ship, Yet now the ship moved on! Beneath the lightning and the Moon The dead men gave a groan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, Nor spake, nor moved their eyes; It had been strange, even in a dream, To have seen those dead men rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; Yet never a breeze up blew; The mariners all 'gan work the ropes, Were they were wont to do: They raised their limbs like lifeless tools— We were a ghastly crew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The ship sails on a calm sea, the masts full with the breeze. The sun is shining through the clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The body of my brother's son, Stood by me, knee to knee: The body and I pulled at one rope, But he said nought to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I fear thee, ancient Mariner!" Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest! 'Twas not those souls that fled in pain, Which to their corses came again, But a troop of spirits blest:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For when it dawned—they dropped their arms, And clustered round the mast; Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, And from their bodies passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Around, around, flew each sweet sound, Then darted to the Sun; Slowly the sounds came back again, Now mixed, now one by one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sometimes a-dropping from the sky I heard the sky-lark sing; Sometimes all little birds that are, How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now 'twas like all instruments, Now like a lonely flute; And now it is an angel's song, That makes the Heavens be mute.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">An image of a black and white engraving by Gustave Doré. In the foreground, a winged and crowned female angel lies on her stomach on the shore of the sea, gazing outward at the tiny ship in the distance. To her right and left, several other angels float over the water, also gazing at the ship. Though there are dark clouds in the distance, the sky above the angels is clear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Till noon we quietly sailed on, Yet never a breeze did breathe: Slowly and smoothly went the ship, Moved onward from beneath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the keel nine fathom deep, From the land of mist and snow, The spirit slid: and it was he That made the ship to go. The sails at noon left off their tune, And the ship stood still also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Sun, right up above the mast, Had fixed her to the ocean: But in a minute she 'gan stir, With a short uneasy motion— Backwards and forwards half her length With a short uneasy motion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then like a pawing horse let go, She made a sudden bound: It flung the blood into my head, And I fell down in a swound.</field>

The Ancient Mariner, here depicted as dark-haired, beardless, and dressed in dark pants and shirt, has fainted on the deck at the bow of the ship.

      <field name="fulltext">SECOND VOICE. Still as a slave before his lord, The OCEAN hath no blast; His great bright eye most silently Up to the Moon is cast— If he may know which way to go; For she guides him smooth or grim See, brother, see! how graciously She looketh down on him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIRST VOICE. But why drives on that ship so fast, Without or wave or wind?</field>

Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high Or we shall be belated: For slow and slow that ship will go, When the Mariner's trance is abated. An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. Two winged female angels float above the water, looking at one another. They are wearing long, sheer gowns, and have long, golden hair. One of the angels is pointing across the sea at the silhouette of the Mariner's ship in the distance. It is night, and the sky is clear. I woke, and we were sailing on As in a gentle weather: 'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high; The dead men stood together. All stood together on the deck, For a charnel-dungeon fitter: All fixed on me their stony eyes, That in the Moon did glitter. The pang, the curse, with which they died, Had never passed away: I could not draw my eyes from theirs, Nor turn them up to pray. And now this spell was snapt: once more I viewed the ocean green. And looked far forth, yet little saw Of what had else been seen— Additional illustration. A 400-dpi, 24-bit color image of a black and white engraving by E. H. Wehnert from the 1858 Sampson Low, Son, &amp; Co. (London) edition. The dead men stand in a group on the deck. They wear long robes which cover their bodies and, for many of them, their faces. They all gaze intently at a point outside of the frame of the image. Like one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having once turned round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows, a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. But soon there breathed a wind on me, Nor sound nor motion made: Its path was not upon the sea, In ripple or in shade. It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek Like a meadow-gale of spring— It mingled strangely with my fears, Yet it felt like a welcoming. Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, Yet she sailed softly too: Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze— On me alone it blew. Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed The light-house top I see? Is this the hill? is this the kirk? Is this mine own countree! An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. On a completely still sea, the Mariner's ship approaches the shore, which is dotted with several buildings. It is night, the moon is full, and the ship appears as a silhouette against a partly clouded sky. We drifted o'er the harbour-bar, And I with sobs did pray— O let me be awake, my God! Or let me sleep alway. The harbour-bay was clear as glass, So smoothly it was strewn! And on the bay the moonlight lay, And the shadow of the moon. The rock shone bright, the kirk no less, That stands above the rock: The moonlight steeped in silentness The steady weathercock. And the bay was white with silent light, Till rising from the same, Full many shapes, that shadows were, In crimson colours came. A little distance from the prow Those crimson shadows were: I turned my eyes upon the deck— Oh, Christ! what saw I there! Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat, And, by the holy rood! A man all light, a seraph-man, On every corse there stood. This seraph band, each waved his hand: It was a heavenly sight! They stood as signals to the land, Each one a lovely light: This seraph-band, each waved his hand, No voice did they impart— No voice; but oh! the silence sank Like music on my heart. An image of a black and white engraving. The illustrator is not identified. The Mariner's ship approaches the shore, upon which several other ships are beached. The silhouette of a large castle on a rocky hill is apparent against the night sky, and it casts a dark shadow over the water in which the Mariner's ship is afloat. But soon I heard the dash of oars; I heard the Pilot's cheer; My head was turned perforce away, And I saw a boat appear. The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy, I heard them coming fast: Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy The dead men could not blast. I saw a third—I heard his voice: It is the Hermit good! He singeth loud his godly hymns That he makes in the wood. He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away The Albatross's blood.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">PART THE SEVENTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THIS Hermit good lives in that wood Which slopes down to the sea. How loudly his sweet voice he rears! He loves to talk with marineres That come from a far countree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He kneels at morn and noon and eve— He hath a cushion plump: It is the moss that wholly hides The rotted old oak-stump.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk, "Why this is strange, I trow! Where are those lights so many and fair, That signal made but now?"</field>

Three men in a rowboat gaze at the ragged ship floating close to them. Two of the men sit, while the third has stood up in the boat to get a better look at the wreckage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said— "And they answered not our cheer! The planks looked warped! and see those sails, How thin they are and sere! I never saw aught like to them, Unless perchance it were</field>

Three men — the Pilot, the Pilot's son and the Hermit — row a small boat toward the Mariner's ship.

      <field name="fulltext">The boat came closer to the ship, But I nor spake nor stirred; The boat came close beneath the ship, And straight a sound was heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the water it rumbled on, Still louder and more dread: It reached the ship, it split the bay; The ship went down like lead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound, Which sky and ocean smote, Like one that hath been seven days drowned My body lay afloat; But swift as dreams, myself I found Within the Pilot's boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the whirl, where sank the ship, The boat spun round and round; And all was still, save that the hill Was telling of the sound.</field>

Three men sit in a rowboat near the Mariner's ship, which is not in the illustration. The youngest of the boatmen stands up in the boat, his arms outstretched and a look of surprise on his face. One of the other men sits in the boat,clasping his hands to his chest as he, too, looks out of the frame at the ship. The third man also sits in the boat, his back to the ship, and mans the oars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I moved my lips—the Pilot shrieked And fell down in a fit; The holy Hermit raised his eyes, And prayed where he did sit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I took the oars: the Pilot's boy, Who now doth crazy go, Laughed loud and long, and all the while His eyes went to and fro. "Ha! ha!" quoth he, "full plain I see, The Devil knows how to row."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now, all in my own countree, I stood on the firm land! The Hermit stepped forth from the boat, And scarcely he could stand.</field>

The Hermit stands on the rocky shore, and the Mariner kneels before him and buries his head in the old man's chest. The Hermit wears a long, hooded cloak, and around his neck hangs a cross. His walking stick rests on a rock next to the two men. The Mariner is bare-chested, and wears tattered pants. The Hermit rests his left hand on the shoulder of the Mariner. In the water just off the shore, the Pilot and his son stand up in their rowboat, watching the scene on shore. In the distance, the castle and town are faintly visible through the fog.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!" The Hermit crossed his brow. "Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say— What manner of man art thou?"</field>
