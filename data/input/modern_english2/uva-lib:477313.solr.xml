      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tittlemouse looking at her garden Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lived in a bank under a hedge. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUCH a funny house! There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to storerooms and nut-cellars and seed-cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge. Mrs. Tittlemouse in her storeroom Mrs. Tittlemouse sleeping in her bed which is a box! Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THERE was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Also, there was Mrs. Tittlemouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed! Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. TITTLEMOUSE was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!'' said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dust-pan. The fastidious Mrs. Tittlemouse chasing a beetle out of her house. Mrs. Tittlemouse and Mother Ladybird, a ladybug. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird! Fly away home to your children!'' Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANOTHER day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go away, you bold bad spider! Leaving ends of cob- web all over my nice clean house!'' Mrs. Tittlemouse scolding a bold bad spider. Mrs. Tittlemouse pushing the spider out of her house. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHE bundled the spider out at a window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. TITTLEMOUSE went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherry-stones and thistle-down seed for dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge? I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet.'' Mrs. Tittlemouse with a basket. Mrs. Tittlemouse meets Babbitty Bumble, a bumble-bee. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUDDENLY round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble —"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!'' said the bumble bee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely. She wished that she had a broom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some beeswax. But what are you doing down here? Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?'' Mrs. Tittle-mouse began to get cross. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"ZIZZ, Wizz, Wizzz!'' replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak. She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it was full of untidy dry moss. Mrs. Tittlemouse makes her way to the acorn storeroom Mrs. Tittlemouse pulls out some moss and bees poke their heads out. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. TITTLEMOUSE began to pull out the moss. Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!'' said Mrs. Tittlemouse. "I will have them turned out—'' "Buzz! Buzz! Buzzz!''—"I wonder who would help me?'' "Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">—"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet.'' Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. TITTLEMOUSE decided to leave the bees till after dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she got back to the parlour, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was sitting all over a small rocking-chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch. Mrs. Tittlemouse walks in on Mr. Jackson, a toad, in the parlour. A portrait of Mr. Jackson, the toad. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"HOW do you do, Mr. Jackson? Deary me, you have got very wet!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! I'll sit awhile and dry myself,'' said Mr. Jackson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HE sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First she offered him cherry- stones. "Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!'' said Mr. Jackson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head. Mrs. Tittlemouse offers Mr. Jackson some cherry-stones, but Mr. Jackson, the toad, doesn't have any teeth. Mr. Jackson, the toad, blows thistle-down seed all over the parlour. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN she offered him thistle-down seed— "Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Pouff, pouff, puff.'' said Mr. Jackson. He blew the thistle- down all over the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse! Now what I really— really should like—would be a little dish of honey!'' Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I AM afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!'' said Mrs. Tittlemouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!'' said the smiling Mr. Jackson, "I can smell it; that is why I came to call.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cup- boards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dish-cloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlour floor. Mrs. Tittlemouse wipes Mr. Jacksons toad footprints off her floor as heads to the cupboards. Mr. Jackson, the toad, heads to Mrs. Tittlemouse's pantry in search of honey. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr.Jackson!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!'' Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIRST he squeezed into the pantry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tiddly, widdly, widdly? no honey? no honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were three creepy- crawly people hiding in the plate-rack. Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught. Mr. Jackson, the toad, discovers some creepy-crawly people in the pantry. Miss Butterfly tasting sugar. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEN he squeezed into the larder. Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And without any invitation!'' said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEY went along the sandy passage—"Tiddly widdly—'' "Buzz! Wizz! Wizz!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not like bumble bees. They are all over bristles,'' said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat-sleeve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get out, you nasty old toad!'' shrieked Babbitty Bumble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall go distracted!'' scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse. Babbitty Bumble, the bumble-bee tells Mr. Jackson, the toad, to get out! Mrs. Tittlemouse in the nut-cellar. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHE shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled outthe bees- nest. He seemed to have no objection to stings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out—every- body had gone away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the untidiness was something dreadful—"Never did I see such a mess—smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown—and marks of big and little dirty feet—all over my nice clean house!'' Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHE gathered up the moss and the remains of the beeswax.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!'' Mrs. Tittlemouse fetching twigs. Mrs. Tittlemouse asleep in a rocking chair. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHE fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. But she was too tired to do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will it ever be tidy again?'' said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEXT morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fortnight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with beeswax, and polished her little tin spoons. Mrs. Tittlemouse being fastidious and polishing her spoons. Text page</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door. A tit-mouse party. The tit-mouse party wishes Mr. Jackson, the toad, good health! Concluding text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SO they handed him out acorn-cupfuls of honey- dew through the window, and he was not at all offended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat outside in the sun, and said—"Tiddly, widdly, widdly! Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!''</field>
