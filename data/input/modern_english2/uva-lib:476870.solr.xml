      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 1 The Project</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 003.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On one of those exciting occasions during a contest for the presidency of the United States, a number of gentlemen met in the city of Baltimore. They were few in number, and appeared little concerned about the affairs of the general government. Though men of intelligence, their time and attention appeared to be entirely absorbed in an adventure of self-interest. They met for the purpose of completing arrangements for refitting the old ship “Merchantman,” which then lay in the harbor near Fell's Point. Colonel Stephen Franks, Major James Armsted, Captain Richard Paul, and Captain George Royer composed those who represented the American side — Captain Juan Garcia and Captain Jose Castello, those of Cuban interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here a conversation ensued upon what seemed a point of vital importance to the company; it related to the place best suited for the completion of their arrangements. The Americans insisted on Baltimore as affording the greatest facilities, and having done more for the encouragement and protection of the trade than any other known place, whilst the Cubans, on the other side, urged their objections on the ground that the continual increase of liberal principles in the various political parties, which were fast ushering into existence, made the objection beyond a controversy. Havana was contended for as a point best suited for adjusting their arrangements, and that too with many apparent reasons; but for some cause, the preference for Baltimore prevailed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Subsequently to the adjustment of their affairs by the most complete arrangement for refitting the vessel, Colonel Franks took leave of the party for his home in the distant state of Mississippi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 004.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 2 Colonel Franks at Home</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the return of Colonel Stephen Franks to his home at Natchez, he met there Mrs. Arabella, the wife of Judge Ballard, an eminent jurist of one of the Northern States. She had arrived but a day before him, on a visit to some relatives, of whom Mrs. Franks was one. The conversation, as is customary on the meeting of Americans residing in such distant latitudes, readily turned on the general policy of the country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Ballard possessed the highest intelligence, and Mrs. Maria Franks was among the most accomplished of Southern ladies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me, Madam Ballard, how will the North go in the present issue?” enquired Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Give yourself no concern about that, Colonel,” replied Mrs. Ballard, “you will find the North true to the country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What you consider true, may be false — that is, it might be true to you, and false to us,” continued he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You do not understand me, Colonel,” she rejoined, “we can have no interests separate from yours; you know the time-honored motto, `united we stand,' and so forth, must apply to the American people under every policy in every section of the Union.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So it should, but amidst the general clamor in the contest for ascendancy, may you not lose sight of this important point?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can we? You, I'm sure, Colonel, know very well that in our country commercial interests have taken precedence of all others, which is a sufficient guarantee of our fidelity to the South.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That may be, madam, but we are still apprehensive.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, sir, we certainly do not know what more to do to give you assurance of our sincerity. We have as a plight of faith yielded Boston, New York, and Philadelphia — the intelligence and wealth of the North — in carrying out the Compromise measures for the interests of the South; can we do more?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True, Madam Ballard, true! I yield the controversy. You have already done more than we of the South expected. I now remember that the Judge himself tried the first case under the Act, in your city, by which the measures were tested.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 005.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He did, sir, and if you will not consider me unwomanly by telling you, desired me, on coming here, to seek every opportunity to give the fullest assurance that the judiciary are sound on that question. Indeed, so far as an individual might be concerned, his interests in another direction — as you know — place him beyond suspicion,” concluded Mrs. Ballard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am satisfied, madam, and by your permission, arrest the conversation. My acknowledgements, madam!” bowed the Colonel, with true Southern courtesy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maria, my dear, you look careworn; are you indisposed?” inquired Franks of his wife, who during conversation sat silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not physically, Colonel,” replied she, “but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just at this moment a servant, throwing open the door, announced dinner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides a sprightly black boy of some ten years of age, there was in attendance a prepossessing, handsome maidservant, who generally kept, as much as the occasion would permit, behind the chair of her mistress. A mutual attachment appeared to exist between them, the maid apparently disinclined to leave the mistress, who seemed to keep her as near her person as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now and again the fat cook, Mammy Judy, would appear at the door of the dining room bearing a fresh supply for the table, who with a slight nod of the head, accompanied with an affectionate smile and the word “Maggie,” indicated a tie much closer than that of mere fellow servants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maggie had long been the favorite maidservant of her mistress, having attained the position through merit. She was also nurse and foster mother to the two last children of Mrs. Franks, and loved them, to all appearance, as her own. The children reciprocated this affection, calling her “Mammy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Judy, who for years had occupied this position, ceded it to her daughter; she preferring, in consequence of age, the less active life of the culinary department.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy Tony would frequently cast a comic look upon Mrs. Ballard, then imploringly gaze in the face of his mistress. So intent was he in this, that twice did his master admonish him by a nod of the head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear,” said the Colonel, “you are dull today; pray tell me what makes you sad?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 006.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not bodily afflicted, Colonel Franks, but my spirit is heavy,” she replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How so? What is the matter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That will be best answered at another time and place, Colonel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Giving his head an unconscious scratch accompanied with a slight twitch of the corner of the mouth, Franks seemed to comprehend the whole of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On one of her Northern tours to the watering places — during a summer season some two years previous, having with her Maggie the favorite — Mrs. Franks visited the family of the Judge, at which time Mrs. Ballard first saw the maid. She was a dark mulatto of a rich, yellow, autumnlike complexion, with a matchless, cushionlike head of hair, neither straight nor curly, but handsomer than either.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Franks was herself a handsome lady of some thirty-five summers, but ten years less in appearance, a little above medium height, between the majestic and graceful, raven-black hair, and dark, expressive eyes. Yet it often had been whispered that in beauty the maid equalled if not excelled the mistress. Her age was twenty-eight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The conduct of Mrs. Franks toward her servant was more like that of an elder sister than a mistress, and the mistress and maid sometimes wore dresses cut from the same web of cloth. Mrs. Franks would frequently adjust the dress and see that the hair of her maid was properly arranged. This to Mrs. Ballard was as unusual as it was an objectionable sight, especially as she imagined there was an air of hauteur in her demeanor. It was then she determined to subdue her spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Acting from this impulse, several times in her absence, Mrs. Ballard took occasion to administer to the maid severities she had never experienced at the hands of her mistress, giving her at one time a severe slap on the cheek, calling her an “impudent jade.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At this, Mrs. Franks, on learning, was quite surprised; but on finding that the maid gave no just cause for it, took no further notice of it, designedly evading the matter. But before leaving, Mrs. Ballard gave her no rest until she gave her the most positive assurance that she would part with the maid on her next visit to Natchez. And thus she is found pressing her suit at the residence of the Mississippi planter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 007.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 3 The Fate of Maggie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After dinner Colonel Franks again pressed the inquiry concerning the disposition of his lady. At this time the maid was in the culinary department taking her dinner. The children having been served, she preferred the company of her old mother whom she loved, the children hanging around, and upon her lap. There was no servant save the boy Tony present in the parlor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't, I won't let her go! she's a dear good girl!” replied Mrs. Franks. “The children are attached to her, and so am I; let Minny or any other of them go — but do not, for Heaven's sake, tear Maggie from me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maria, my dear, you've certainly lost your balance of mind! Do try and compose yourself,” admonished the Colonel. “There's certainly no disposition to do contrary to your desires; try and be a little reasonable.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm sure, cousin, I see no cause for your importunity. No one that I know of designs to hurt the Negro girl. I'm sure it's not me!” impatiently remarked Mrs. Ballard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During this, the boy had several times gone into the hall, looking toward the kitchen, then meaningly into the parlor as if something unusual were going on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Judy becoming suspicious, went into the hall and stood close beside the parlor door, listening at the conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Cousin, if you will listen for a moment, I wish to say a word to you,” said Mrs. Ballard. “The Judge, as you know, has a countryseat in Cuba near the city of Havana, where we design making every year our winter retreat. As we cannot take with us either free Negroes or white servants, on account of the existing restrictions, I must have a slave, and of course I prefer a well-trained one, as I know all yours to be. The price will be no object; as I know it will be none to you, it shall be none to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will not consent to part with her, cousin Arabella, and it is useless to press the matter any further!” emphatically replied Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sure, cousin Maria, it was well understood between the Colonel and the Judge, that I was to have one of your best-trained maidservants!” continued Mrs. Ballard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 008.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The Colonel and the Judge! If any such understanding exist, it is without my knowledge and consent, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is true, my dear,” interposed the Colonel, “but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then,” replied she, “heaven grant that I may go too! from — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Pah, pah! cousin Maria Franks, I'm really astonished at you to take on so about a Negro girl! You really appear to have lost your reason. I would not behave so for all the Negroes in Mississippi.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear,” said Franks, “I have been watching the conduct of that girl for some time past; she is becoming both disobedient and unruly, and as I have made it a rule of my life never to keep a disobedient servant, the sooner we part with her the better. As I never whip my servants, I do not want to depart from my rule in her case.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maggie was true to her womanhood, and loyal to her mistress, having more than once communicated to her ears facts the sounds of which reflected no credit in his. For several repulses such as this, it was that she became obnoxious to her master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Cousin Maria, you certainly have forgotten; I'm sure, when last at the North, you promised in presence of the girl, that I was to have her, and I'm certain she's expecting it,” explained Mrs. Ballard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This I admit,” replied Mrs. Franks, “but you very well know, cousin Arabella, that that promise was a mere ruse, to reconcile an uneasiness which you informed me you discovered in her, after over-hearing a conversation between her and some free Negroes, at Saratoga Springs.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, cousin, you can do as you please,” concluded Mrs. Ballard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Colonel, I'm weary of this conversation. What am I to expect?” enquired Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a settled point, my dear, she must be sold!” decisively replied Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I must hereafter be disrespected by our own slaves! You know, Colonel, that I gave my word to Henry, her husband, your most worthy servant, that his wife should be here on his return. He had some misgiving that she was to be taken to Cuba before his return, when I assured him that she should be here. How can I bear to meet this poor creature, who places every confidence in what we tell him? He'll surely be frantic.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nonsense, cousin, nonsense,” sneered Mrs. Ballard. “Frantic, indeed! Why you speak of your Negro slaves as if speaking of equals. 925EAF. Page 009. Make him know that whatever you order, he must be contented with.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll soon settle the matter with him, should he dare show any feelings about it!” interposed Franks. “When do you look for him, Maria?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm sure, Colonel, you know more about the matter than I do. Immediately after you left, he took the horses to Baton Rouge, where at the last accounts he was waiting the conclusion of the races. Judge Dilbreath had entered them according to your request — one horse for each day's races. I look for him every day. Then there are more than him to reconcile. There's old Mammy Judy, who will run mad about her. You know, Colonel, she thought so much of her, that she might be treated tenderly the old creature gave up her situation in the house as nurse and foster mother to our children, going into the kitchen to do the harder work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, my dear, we'll detain your cousin till he comes. I'll telegraph the Judge that, if not yet left, to start him home immediately.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Colonel, that will be still worse, to let him witness her departure; I would much rather she'd leave before his return. Poor thing!” she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then she may go!” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And what of poor old mammy and his boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll soon settle the matter with old Judy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Franks looking him imploringly in the face, let drop her head, burying her face in the palms of her hands. Soon it was found necessary to place her under the care of a physician.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Mammy Judy had long since beckoned her daughter, where both stood in breathless silence catching every word that passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the conclusion, Maggie, clasping her hands, exclaimed in suppressed tones, “O mammy, O mammy! what shall I do? O, is there no hope for me? Can't you beg master — can't you save me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look to de Laud, my chile! Him ony able to bring yeh out mo' nah conkeh!” was the prayerful advice of the woe-stricken old mother. Both, hastening into the kitchen, falling upon their knees, invoked aloud the God of the oppressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hearing in that direction an unusual noise, Franks hastened past the kitchen door, dropping his head, and clearing his throat as he went along. This brought the slaves to an ordinary mood, who trembled at his approach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 010.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 4 Departure of Maggie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The countryseat of Franks, or the “great house” of the cotton plantation, was but a short distance from the city. Mrs. Franks, by the advice of her physician, was removed there to avoid the disturbance of the town, when at the same time Mrs. Ballard left with her slave Maggie en route for Baltimore, whither she designed leaving her until ready to sail for Cuba.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Fahwell, my chile! fahwell; may God A'mighty be wid you!” were the parting words of the poor old slave, who with streaming eyes gazed upon her parting child for the last time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O mammy! Can't you save me? O Lord, what shall I do? O my husband! O my poor child! O my! O my!” were the only words, the sounds of which died upon the breeze, as the cab hastily bore her to a steamer then lying at the wharf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor old Mammy Judy sat at the kitchen door with elbows resting upon her knee, side of the face resting in the palm of the hand, tears streaming down, with a rocking motion, noticing nothing about her, but in sorrow moaning just distinctly enough to be understood: “Po' me! Po' me! Po' me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sight was enough to move the heart of anyone, and it so affected Franks that he wished he had “never owned a Negro.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daddy Joe, the husband of Mammy Judy, was a field hand on the cotton place, visiting his wife at the town residence every Saturday night. Colonel Franks was a fine, grave, senatorial-looking man, of medium height, inclined to corpulency, black hair, slightly grey, and regarded by his slaves as a good master, and religiously as one of the best of men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On their arrival at the great house, those working nearest gathered around the carriage, among whom was Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat a mautta wid missus?” was the general inquiry of the gang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your mistress is sick, boys,” replied the master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maus, whah's Margot?” enquired the old man, on seeing his mistress carried into the house without the attendance of her favorite maidservant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She's in town, Joe,” replied Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 011.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How's Judy, seh?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Judy is well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tank'e seh!” politely concluded the old man, with a bow, turning away in the direction of his work — with a countenance expressive of anything but satisfaction — from the interview.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The slaves, from their condition, are suspicious; any evasion or seeming design at suppressing the information sought by them frequently arouses their greatest apprehension.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not unfrequently the mere countenance, a look, a word, or laugh of the master, is an unerring foreboding of misfortune to the slave. Ever on the watch for these things, they learn to read them with astonishing precision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This day was Friday, and the old slave consoled himself with the thought that on the next evening he would be able to see and know for himself the true state of things about his master's residence in town. The few hours intervening were spent with great anxiety, which was even observed by his fellow slaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last came Saturday evening and with it, immediately after sunset, Daddy Joe made his appearance at the hall door of the great house, tarrying only long enough to inquire “How's missus?” and receive the reply, “she's better,” when a few moments found him quite out of sight, striding his way down the lane toward the road to the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sudden and unexpected fate of Maggie had been noised among the slaves throughout the entire neighborhood; many who had the opportunity of doing so, repairing to the house to learn the facts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the lower part of the town, bordering on the river there is a depot or receptacle for the slave gangs brought by professional traders. This part of the town is known as “Natchez-under-the-Hill.” [1] It is customary among the slaves when any of their number are sold, to say that they are gone “under the hill,” and their common salutation through the day was that “Franks' Mag had gone under the hill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As with quickened steps Daddy Joe approached the town, his most fearful apprehensions became terribly realized when meeting a slave who informed him that “Margot had gone under the hill.” Falling upon his knees, in the fence corner, the old man raised his voice in supplication of Divine aid: “O Laud! dow has promis' in dine own wud, to be a fadah to de fadaless, an' husban to de widah! O Laud, let dy wud run an' be glorify! Sof'en de haud haut ob de presseh, an' let my po' chile cum back! an' — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 012.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop that noise there, old nigger!” ordered a patrol approaching him. “Who's boy are you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sahvant, mausta!” saluted the old slave, “I b'long to cunel Frank, seh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is this old Joe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dis is me maus Johnny.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You had better trudge along home then, as it's likely old Judy wants to see you about this time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tank'e seh,” replied the old man, with a bow, feeling grateful that he was permitted to proceed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Devilish good, religious old Negro,” he remarked to his associates, as the old man left them in the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few minutes more, and Daddy Joe entered the kitchen door at his master's residence. Mammy Judy, on seeing him, gave vent afresh to bitter wailing, when the emotion became painfully mutual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O husban'! Husban! Onah po' chile is gone!” exclaimed the old woman, clasping him around the neck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laud! dy will be done!” exclaimed he. “Ole umin, look to de Laud! as he am suffishen fah all tings”; both, falling on their knees, breathed in silence their desires to God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long! How long! O Laud how long!” was the supplicating cry of the old woman being overcome with devotion and sorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking the little grandchild in his arms, “Po' chile,” said the old man, “I wish yeh had nebeh been baun!” impressing upon it kisses whilst it slept.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a fervant and earnest prayer to God for protection to themselves, little grandson Joe, the return of his mother their only child, and blessings upon their master and the recovery of their mistress, the poor old slaves retired to rest for the evening, to forget their sorrows in the respite of sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 013.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 5 A Vacancy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This morning the sun rose with that beauty known to a Southern sky in the last month of autumn. The day was Sabbath, and with it was ushered in every reminiscence common to the customs of that day and locality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That she might spend the day at church for the diversion of her mind, Mrs. Franks was brought in to her city residence; and Natchez, which is usually gay, seemed more so on this day than on former occasions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the bells began to signal the hour of worship, the fashionable people seemed en masse to crowd the streets. The carriages ran in every direction, bearing happy hearts and cheerful faces to the various places of worship — there to lay their offerings on the altar of the Most High for the blessings they enjoyed, whilst peering over every gate, out of every alley, or every kitchen door, could be seen the faithful black servants who, staying at home to prepare them food and attend to other domestic duties, were satisfied to look smilingly upon their masters and families as they rode along, without for a moment dreaming that they had a right to worship the same God, with the same promise of life and salvation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God bless you, missus! Pray fah me,” was the honest request of many a simplehearted slave who dared not aspire to the enjoyment of praying for himself in the Temple of the living God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But amidst these scenes of gaiety and pleasure, there was one much devoted to her church who could not be happy that day, as there to her was a seeming vacancy which could not be filled — the seat of her favorite maidservant. The Colonel, as a husband and father, was affectionate and indulgent; but his slave had offended, disobeyed his commands, and consequently, had to be properly punished, or he be disrespected by his own servants. The will of the master being absolute, his commands should be enforced, let them be what they may, and the consequences what they would. If slavery be right, the master is justifiable in enforcing obedience to his will; deny him this, and you at once deprive him of the right to hold a slave — the one is a 925EAF. Page 014. necessary sequence of the other. Upon this principle Colonel Franks acted, and the premise justified the conclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the carriage drove to the door, Mrs. Franks wept out most bitterly, refusing to enter because her favorite maid could not be an incumbent. Fears being entertained of seriousness in her case, it was thought advisable to let her remain quietly at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daddy Joe and Mammy Judy were anxious spectators of all that transpired at the door of the mansion, and that night, on retiring to their humble bed, earnestly petitioned at the altar of Grace that the Lord would continue upon her his afflictions until their master, convinced of his wrongs, would order the return of their child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This the Colonel would have most willingly done without the petition of Joe or Judy, but the case had gone too far, the offense was too great, and consequently there could be no reconsideration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Poor things,” muttered Mrs. Franks in a delirium, “she served him right! And this her only offense! Yes, she was true to me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Little Joe, the son of Maggie, in consequence of her position to the white children — from whom her separation had been concealed — had been constantly with his grandmother, and called her “mammy.” Accustomed to being without her, he was well satisfied so long as permitted to be with the old woman Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So soon as her condition would permit, Mrs. Franks was returned to her countryseat to avoid the contingencies of the city.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 6 Henry's Return</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early on Monday morning, a steamer was heard puffing up the Mississippi. Many who reside near the river, by custom can tell the name of every approaching boat by the peculiar sound of the steampipe, the one in the present instance being the “Sultana.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daddy Joe had risen and just leaving for the plantation, but stopped a moment to be certian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush!” admonished Mammy Judy. “Hush! Sho chile, do'n yeh heah how she hollah? Sholy dat's de wat's name! wat dat yeh call eh? `Suckana,' wat not; sho! I ain' gwine bautha my head long so — sho! See, ole man see! Dah she come! See dat now! I tole yeh so, but yeh 925EAF. Page 015. uden bleve me!” And the old man and woman stood for some minutes in breathless silence, although the boat must have been some five miles distant, as the escape of steam can be heard on the western waters a great way off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The approach toward sunrise admonished Daddy Joe of demands for him at the cotton farm, when after bidding “good monin' ole umin,” he hurried to the daily task which lay before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Judy had learned — by the boy Tony — that Henry was expected on the “Sultana,” and at the approach of every steamer, her head had been thrust out of the door or window to catch a distinct sound. In motionless attitude after the departure of her husband this morning, the old woman stood awaiting the steamer, when presently the boat arrived. But then to be certain that it was the expected vessel — now came the suspense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman was soon relieved from this most disagreeable of all emotions, by the cry of newsboys returning from the wharf: “'Ere's the `Picayune,' `Atlas,' `Delta'! Lates' news from New Orleans by the swift steamer `Sultana'!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dah now!” exclaimed Mammy Judy in soliloquy. “Dah now! I tole yeh so! — de wat's name come!” Hurrying into the kitchen, she waited with anxiety the arrival of Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Busying about the breakfast for herself and other servants about the house — the white members of the family all being absent — Mammy Judy for a time lost sight of the expected arrival. Soon however, a hasty footstep arrested her attention, when on looking around it proved to be Henry who came smiling up the yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How'd you do, mammy! How's Mag' and the boy?” inquired he, grasping the old woman by the hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She burst into a flood of tears, throwing herself upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the matter!” exclaimed Henry. “Is Maggie dead?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No chile,” with increased sobs she replied, “much betteh she wah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My God! Has she disgraced herself?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No chile, may be betteh she dun so, den she bin heah now an' not sole. Maus Stephen sell eh case she! — I dun'o, reckon dat's da reason.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What! — Do you tell me, mammy, she had better disgraced herself than been sold! By the — — !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So, Henry! yeh ain't gwine swah! hope yeh ain' gwine lose yeh 'ligion? Do'n do so; put yeh trus' in de Laud, he is suffishen fah all!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 016.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't tell me about religion! What's religion to me? My wife is sold away from me by a man who is one of the leading members of the very church to which both she and I belong! Put my trust in the Lord! I have done so all my life nearly, and of what use is it to me? My wife is sold from me just the same as if I didn't. I'll — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, come, Henry, yeh mus'n talk so; we is po' weak an' bline cretehs, an' cah see de way uh da Laud. He move' in a mystus way, his wundahs to puhfaum.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So he may, and what is all that to me? I don't gain anything by it, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, Henry, stop! Ain' de Laud bless yo' soul? Ain' he take yeh foot out de miah an' clay, an' gib yeh hope da uddah side dis vale ub teahs?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm tired looking the other side; I want a hope this side of the vale of tears. I want something on this earth as well as a promise of things in another world. I and my wife have been both robbed of our liberty, and you want me to be satisfied with a hope of heaven. I won't do any such thing; I have waited long enough on heavenly promises; I'll wait no longer. I — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, wat de mauttah wid yeh? I neveh heah yeh talk so fo' — yeh sin in de sight ub God; yeh gone clean back, I reckon. De good Book tell us, a tousan' yeahs wid man, am but a day wid de Laud. Boy, yeh got wait de Laud own pinted time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, mammy, it is useless for me to stand here and have the same gospel preached into my ears by you, that I have all my life time heard from my enslavers. My mind is made up, my course is laid out, and if life last, I'll carry it out. I'll go out to the place today, and let them know that I have returned.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho boy! What yeh gwine do, bun house down? Bettah put yeh trus' in de Laud!” concluded the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have too much religion, mammy, for me to tell you what I intend doing,” said Henry in conclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After taking up his little son, impressing on his lips and cheeks kisses for himself and tears for his mother, the intelligent slave left the abode of the careworn old woman, for that of his master at the cotton place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry was a black — a pure Negro — handsome, manly and intelligent, in size comparing well with his master, but neither so fleshy nor heavy 925EAF. Page 017. built in person. A man of good literary attainments — unknown to Colonel Franks, though he was aware he could read and write — having been educated in the West Indies, and decoyed away when young. His affection for wife and child was not excelled by Colonel Franks's for his. He was bold, determined and courageous, but always mild, gentle and courteous, though impulsive when an occasion demanded his opposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Going immediately to the place, he presented himself before his master. Much conversation ensued concerning the business which had been entrusted to his charge, all of which was satisfactorily transacted, and full explanations concerning the horses, but not a word was uttered concerning the fate of Maggie, the Colonel barely remarking “your mistress is unwell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After conversing till a late hour, Henry was assigned a bed in the great house, but sleep was far from his eyes. He turned and changed upon his bed with restlessness and anxiety, impatiently awaiting a return of the morning.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 7 Master and Slave</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early on Tuesday morning, in obedience to his master's orders, Henry was on his way to the city to get the house in readiness for the reception of his mistress, Mrs. Franks having improved in three or four days. Mammy Judy had not yet risen when he knocked at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hi Henry! yeh heah ready! huccum yeh git up so soon; arter some mischif I reckon? Do'n reckon yeh arter any good!” saluted Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, mammy,” replied he, “no mischief, but like a good slave such as you wish me to be, come to obey my master's will, just what you like to see.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho boy! none yeh nonsens'; huccum I want yeh bey maus Stephen? Git dat nonsens' in yeh head las' night long so, I reckon! Wat dat yeh gwine do now?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have come to dust and air the mansion for their reception. They have sold my wife away from me, and who else would do her work?” This reply excited the apprehension of Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 018.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat yeh gwine do, Henry? Yeh arter no good; yeh ain' gwine 'tack maus Stephen, is yeh?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean, mammy, strike him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes! Reckon yeh ain' gwine hit 'im?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Curse — — !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, Henry, membeh wat ye 'fess! Fah de Laud sake, yeh ain' gwine take to swahin?” interupted the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I make no profession, mammy. I once did believe in religion, but now I have no confidence in it. My faith has been wrecked on the stony hearts of such pretended Christians as Stephen Franks, while passing through the stormy sea of trouble and oppression! And — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hay, boy! yeh is gittin high! Yeh call maussa `Stephen'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, and I'll never call him `master' again, except when compelled to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bettah g'long ten' t' de house fo' wite folks come, an' nebeh mine talkin' 'bout fightin' 'long wid maus Stephen. Wat yeh gwine do wid white folks? Sho!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't intend to fight him, Mammy Judy, but I'll attack him concerning my wife, if the words be my last! Yes, I'll — — !” and, pressing his lips to suppress the words, the outraged man turned away from the old slave mother with such feelings as only an intelligent slave could realize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The orders of the morning were barely executed when the carriage came to the door. The bright eyes of the footboy Tony sparkled when he saw Henry approaching the carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Henry! Ready for us?” enquired his master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir,” was the simple reply. “Mistress!” he saluted, politely bowing as he took her hand to assist her from the carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, Henry my man, get out the riding horses,” ordered Franks after a little rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A horse for the Colonel and lady each was soon in readiness at the door, but none for himself, it always having been the custom in their morning rides, for the maid and manservant to accompany the mistress and master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ready, did you say?” enquired Franks on seeing but two horses standing at the stile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 019.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where's the other horse?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What for, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What for? Yourself, to be sure!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Colonel Franks!” said Henry, looking him sternly in the face. “When I last rode that horse in company with you and lady, my wife was at my side, and I will not now go without her! Pardon me — my life for it, I won't go!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not another word, you black imp!” exclaimed Franks, with an uplifted staff in a rage, “or I'll strike you down in an instant!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Strike away if you will, sir, I don't care — I won't go without my wife!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You impudent scoundrel! I'll soon put an end to your conduct! I'll put you on the auction block, and sell you to the Negro-traders.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just as soon as you please sir, the sooner the better, as I don't want to live with you any longer!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hold your tongue, sir, or I'll cut it out of your head! You ungrateful black dog! Really, things have come to a pretty pass when I must take impudence off my own Negro! By gracious! — God forgive me for the expression — I'll sell every Negro I have first! I'll dispose of him to the hardest Negro-trader I can find!” said Franks in a rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You may do your mightiest, Colonel Franks. I'm not your slave, nor never was and you know it! And but for my wife and her people, I never would have stayed with you till now. I was decoyed away when young, and then became entangled in such domestic relations as to induce me to remain with you; but now the tie is broken! I know that the odds are against me, but never mind!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you threaten me, sir! Hold your tongue, or I'll take your life instantly, you villain!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, I don' threaten you, Colonel Franks, but I do say that I won't be treated like a dog. You sold my wife away from me, after always promising that she should be free. And more than that, you sold her because — — ! And now you talk about whipping me. Shoot me, sell me, or do anything else you please, but don't lay your hands on me, as I will not suffer you to whip me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Running up to his chamber, Colonel Franks seized a revolver, when Mrs. Franks, grasping hold of his arm, exclaimed, “Colonel! what does all this mean?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mean, my dear? It's rebellion! A plot — this is but the shadow of a 925EAF. Page 020. could that's fast gathering around us! I see it plainly, I see it!” responded the Colonel, starting for the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, Colonel!” admonished his lady. “I hope you'll not be rash. For Heaven's sake, do not stain your hands in blood!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do not mean to, my dear! I take this for protection!” Franks hastening down stairs, when Henry had gone into the back part of the premises.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dah now! Dah now!” exclaimed Mammy Judy as Henry entered the kitchen. “See wat dis gwine back done foh yeh! Bettah put yo' trus' in de Laud! Henry, yeh gone clean back t' de wuhl ghin, yeh knows it!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're mistaken, Mammy; I do trust the Lord as much as ever, but I now understand him better than I use to, that's all. I dont intend to be made a fool of any longer by false preaching.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry!” interrogated Daddy Joe — who, apprehending difficulties in the case, had managed to get back to the house. “Yeh gwine lose all yo' `ligion? Wat yeh mean, boy!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Religion!” replied Henry rebukingly. “That's always the cry with black people. Tell me nothing about religion when the very man who hands you the bread at communion has sold your daughter away from you!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den yeh 'fen' God case man 'fen' yeh! Take cah, Henry, take cah! mine wat yeh 'bout; God is lookin' at yeh, an' if yeh no' willin' trus' 'im, yeh need'n call on 'im in time o' trouble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I dont intend, unless He does more for me then than He has done before. `Time of need!' If ever man needed His assistance, I'm sure I need it now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yeh do'n know wat yeh need; de Laud knows bes'. On'y trus' in 'im, an' 'e bring yeh out mo' nah conkah. By de help o' God I's heah dis day, to gib yeh cumfut!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have trusted in Him, Daddy Joe, all my life, as I told Mammy Judy this morning, but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah boy, yeh's gwine back! Dat on't do Henry, dat on't do!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Going back from what? My oppressor's religion! If I could only get rid of his inflictions as easily as I can his religion, I would be this day a free man, when you might then talk to me about `trusting.' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dis, Henry, am one uh de ways ob de Laud; 'e fus 'flicks us an' den he bless us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 021.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then it's a way I don't like.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mine how yeh talk, boy! `God moves in a myst'us way His wundahs to pehfaum,' an — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He moves too slow for me, Daddy Joe; I'm tired waiting so — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come Henry, I hab no sich talk like dat! yeh is gittin' rale weaked; yeh gwine let de debil take full 'session on yeh! Take cah boy, mine how yeh talk!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is not wickedness, Daddy Joe; you don't understand these things at all. If a thousand years with us is but a day with God, do you think that I am required to wait all that time?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't, Henry, don't! De wud say `stan' still an' see de salbation.' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's no talk for me, Daddy Joe; I've been `standing still' long enough — I'll `stand still' no longer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den yeh no call t' bey God wud? Take cah boy, take cah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes I have, and I intend to obey it, but that part was intended for the Jews, a people long since dead. I'll obey that intended for me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How yeh gwine bey it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ `Now is the accepted time, today is the day of salvation.' So you see, Daddy Joe, this is very different to standing still.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah boy, I's feahd yeh's losen yeh 'ligion!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I tell you once for all, Daddy Joe, that I'm not only `losing' but I have altogether lost my faith in the religion of my oppressors. As they are our religious teachers, my estimate of the thing they give is no greater than it is for those who give it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With elbows upon his knees, and face resting in the palms of his hands, Daddy Joe for some time sat with his eyes steadily fixed on the floor, whilst Ailcey who for a part of the time had been an auditor to the conversation, went into the house about her domestic duties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never mind, Henry! I hope it will not always be so with you. You have been kind and faithful to me and the Colonel, and I'll do anything I can for you!” sympathetically said Mrs. Franks, who, having been a concealed spectator of the interview between Henry and the old people, had just appeared before them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wiping away the emblems of grief which stole down his face, with a deep-toned voice upgushing from the recesses of a more than iron-pierced soul, he enquired, “Madam, what can you do! Where is my wife?” To this, Mrs. Franks gave a deep sigh. “Never mind, never mind!” continued he, “yes, I will mind, and by — — !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 022.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O! Henry, I hope you've not taken to swearing! I do hope you will not give over to wickedness! Our afflictions should only make our faith the stronger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ `Wickedness.' Let the righteous correct the wicked, and the Christian condemn the sinner!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is uncharitable in you, Henry! As you know I have always treated you kindly, and God forbid that I should consider myself any less than a Christian! And I claim as much at least for the Colonel, though like frail mortals he is liable to err at times.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Madam!” said he with suppressed emotion — starting back a pace or two — “Do you think there is anything either in or out of hell so wicked, as that which Colonel Franks has done to my wife, and now about to do to me? For myself I care not — my wife!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry!” said Mrs. Franks, gently placing her hand upon his shoulder. “There is yet a hope left for you, and you will be faithful enough, I know, not to implicate any person. It is this: Mrs. Van Winter, a true friend of your race, is shortly going to Cuba on a visit, and I will arrange with her to purchase you through an agent on the day of your sale, and by that means you can get to Cuba, where probably you may be fortunate enough to get the master of your wife to become your purchaser.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I have two chances!” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Ailcey, thrusting her head in the door, requested the presence of her mistress in the parlor.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 8 The Sale</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dah now, dah now!” exclaimed Mammy Judy. “Jis wat ole man been tellin' on yeh! Yeh go out yandah, yeh kick up yeh heel, git yeh head clean full proclamation an' sich like dat, an' let debil fool yeh, den go fool long wid wite folks long so, sho! Bettah go 'bout yeh bisness; been sahvin' God right, yeh no call t'do so eh reckon!” “I don't care what comes! my course is laid out and my determination fixed, and nothing they can do can alter it. So you and Daddy 925EAF. Page 023. Joe, mammy, had just as well quit your preaching to me the religion you have got from your oppressors.” “Soul-driveh git yeh, yeh cah git way fom dem eh doh recken! Sho chile, yeh ain' dat mighty!” admonished Mammy Judy. “Henry, my chile, look to de Laud! Look to de Laud! Case 'e 'lone am able t' bah us up in ouah trouble! An — — ” “Go directly sir, to Captain John Harris' office and ask him to call immediately to see me at my house!” ordered Franks. Politely bowing, Henry immediately left the premises on his errand. “Laud a' messy maus Stephen!” exclaimed Mammy Judy, on hearing the name of John Harris the Negro-trader. “Hope yeh arteh no haum! Gwine sell all on us to de tradehs?” “Hoot-toot, hoot-toot! Judy, give yourself no uneasiness about that till you have some cause for it. So you and Joe may rest contented, Judy,” admonished Franks. “Tank'e maus Stephen! Case ah heahn yeh tell Henry dat yeh sell de las' nig — — ” “Hush, ole umin, hush! Yeh tongue too long! Put yeh trus' in de Laud!” interrupted Daddy Joe. “I treat my black folks well,” replied Franks, “and all they have to — — ” Here the doorbell having been rung, he was interrupted with a message from Ailcey, that a gentleman awaited his presence in the parlor. At the moment which the Colonel left the kitchen, Henry stepped over the stile into the yard, which at once disclosed who the gentleman was to whom the master had been summoned. Henry passed directly around and behind the house. “See, ole man, see! Reckon 'e gwine dah now!” whispered Mammy Judy, on seeing Henry pass through the yard without going into the kitchen. “Whah?” enquired Daddy Joe. “Dun'o out yandah, whah 'e gwine way from wite folks!” she replied. The interview between Franks and the trader Harris was not over half an hour duration, the trader retiring, Franks being prompt and decisive in all of his transactions, making little ceremony. 925EAF. Page 024. So soon as the front door was closed, Ailcey smiling bore into the kitchen a half-pint glass of brandy, saying that her master had sent it to the old people. The old man received it with compliments to his master, pouring it into a black jug in which there was both tansy and garlic, highly recommending it as a “bitters” and certain antidote for worms, for which purpose he and the old woman took of it as long as it lasted, though neither had been troubled with that particular disease since the days of their childhood. “Wat de gwine do wid yeh meh son?” enquired Mammy Judy as Henry entered the kitchen. “Sell me to the soul-drivers! what else would they do?” “Yeh gwin 'tay 'bout till de git yeh?” “I shant move a step! and let them do their — — ” “Maus wants to see yeh in da front house, Henry,” interrupted Ailcey, he immediately obeying the summons. “Heah dat now!” said mammy Judy, as Henry followed the maid out of the kitchen. “Carry this note, sir, directly to Captain Jack Harris!” ordered Franks, handing to Henry a sealed note. Receiving it, he bowed politely, going out of the front door, directly to the slave prison of Harris. “Eh heh! I see,” said Harris on opening the note, “Colonel Frank's boy; walk in here,” passing through the office into a room which proved to be the first department of the slave prison. “No common Negro, I see! You're a shade higher. A pretty deep shade too! Can read, write, cipher; a good religious fellow, and has a Christian and sir name. The devil you say! Who's your father? Can you preach?” “I have never tried,” was the only reply. “Have you ever been a member of Congress?” continued Harris with ridicule. To this Henry made no reply. “Wont answer, hey! Beneath your dignity. I understand that you're of that class of gentry who dont speak to common folks! You're not quite well enough dressed for a gentleman of your cloth. Here! Mr. Henry, I'll present you with a set of ruffles: give yourself no trouble sir, as I'll dress you! I'm here for that purpose,” said Harris, fastening upon the wrists of the manly bondman a heavy pair of handcuffs. 925EAF. Page 025. “You hurt my wrist!” admonished Henry. “New clothing will be a little tight when first put on. Now sir!” continued the trader, taking him to the back door and pointing into the yard at the slave gang there confined. “As you have been respectably dressed, walk out and enjoy yourself among the ladies and gentlemen there; you'll find them quite a select company.” Shortly after this the sound of the bellringer's voice was heard — a sound which usually spread terror among the slaves: “Will be sold this afternoon at three o'clock by public outcry, at the slave prison of Captain John Harris, a likely choice Negro fellow, the best trained body servant in the state, trained to the business by the most accomplished lady and gentleman Negro-trainers in the Mississippi Valley. Sale positive without a proviso.” “Dah, dah! Did'n eh tell yeh so? Ole man, ole man! heah dat now! Come heah. Dat jis what I been tellin on im, but 'e uden bleve me!” ejaculated old Mammy Judy on hearing the bell ring and the handbill read. Falling upon their knees, the two old slaves prayed fervently to God, thanking him that it was as “well with them” as it was. “Bless de Laud! My soul is happy!” cried out Mammy Judy being overcome with devotion, clapping her hands. “Tang God, fah wat I feels in my soul!” responded Daddy Joe. Rising from their knees with tears trickling down their cheeks, the old slaves endeavored to ease their troubled souls by singing, Oh, when shall my sorrows subside, And when shall my troubles be ended; And when to the bosom of Christ be conveyed, To the mansions of joy and bliss; To the mansions of joy and bliss! “Wuhthy to be praise! Blessed be de name uh de Laud! Po' black folks, de Laud o'ny knows sats t' come ob us!” exclaimed Mammy Judy. “Look to de Laud ole umin, 'e's able t' bah us out mo' neh conkeh. Keep de monin' stah in sight!” advised Daddy Joe. “Yes, ole man, yes, dat I done dis many long day, an' ah ain' gwine lose sight uh it now! No, God bein' my helpeh, I is gwine keep my eyes right on it, dat I is!” 925EAF. Page 026. As the hour of three drew near, many there were going in the direction of the slave prison, a large number of persons having assembled at the sale. “Draw near, gentlemen, draw near!” cried Harris. “The hour of sale is arrived: a positive sale with no proviso, cash down, or no sale at all!” A general laugh succeeded the introduction of the auctioneer. “Come up here my lad!” continued the auctioneer, wielding a long red rawhide. “Mount this block, stand beside me, an' let's see which is the best looking man! We have met before, but I never had the pleasure of introducing you. Gentlemen one and all, I take pleasure in introducing to you Henry — pardon me, sir — Mr. Henry Holland, I believe — am I right, sir? — Mr. Henry Holland, a good looking fellow you will admit. “I am offered one thousand dollars; one thousand dollars for the best looking Negro in all Mississippi! If all the negro boys in the state was as good looking as him, I'd give two thousand dollars for 'em all myself!” This caused another laugh. “Who'll give me one thousand five — — ” Just then a shower of rain came on. “Gentlemen!” exclaimed the auctioneer. “Without a place can be obtained large enough to shelter the people here assembled, the sale will have to be postponed. This is a proviso we couldn't foresee, an' therefore is not responsible for it.” There was another hearty laugh. A whisper went through the crowd, when presently a gentleman came forward, saying that those concerned had kindly tendered the use of the church which stood nearby, in which to continue the sale. “Here we are again, gentlemen! Who bids five hundred more for the likely Negro fellow? I am offered fifteen hundred dollars for the finest Negro servant in the state! Come, my boy, bestir yourself an' don't stan' there like a statute; can't you give us a jig? whistle us a song! I forgot, the Negro fellow is religious; by the by, an excellent recommendation, gentlemen. Perhaps he'll give us a sermon. Say, git up there old fellow, an' hold forth. Can't you give us a sermon on Abolition? I'm only offered fifteen hundred dollars for the likely Negro boy! Fifteen, sixteen, sixteen hundred, just agoing at — eighteen, eighteen, nineteen hundred, nineteen hundred! Just agoing at nineteen hundred dollars for the best body servant in the state; just agoing at nineteen and without a better bid I'll — — Going! Going! Go — — !” Just at this point a note was passed up the aisle to the auctioneer, 925EAF. Page 027. who after reading it said, “Gentlemen! Circumstances beyond my control make it necessary that the sale be postponed until one day next week; the time of continuance will be duly announced,” when, bowing, he left the stand. “That's another proviso not in the original bill!” exclaimed a voice as the auctioneer left the stand, at which there were peals of laughter. To secure himself against contingency, Harris immediately delivered Henry over to Franks. There were present at the sale, Crow, Slider, Walker, Borbridge, Simpson, Hurst, Spangler and Williams, all noted slave traders, eager to purchase, some on their return home, and some with their gangs en route for the Southern markets. The note handed the auctioneer read thus:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter CAPT. HARRIS: — Having learned that there are private individuals at the sale, who design purchasing my Negro man, Harry, for his own personal advantage, you will peremptorily postpone the sale — making such apology as the occasion demands — and effect a private sale with Richard Crow, Esq., who offers me two thousand dollars for him. Let the boy return to me. Believe me to be, Very Respectfully, STEPHEN FRANKS Capt. John Harris Natchez, Nov. 29th, 1852.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, sir,” said Franks to Henry, who had barely reached the house from the auction block, “take this pass and go to Jackson and Woodville, or anywhere else you wish to see your friends, so that you be back against Monday afternoon. I ordered a postponement of the sale, thinking that I would try you awhile longer, as I never had cause before to part with you. Now see if you can't be a better boy!” Eagerly taking the note, thanking him with a low bow, turning away, Henry opened the paper, which read:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter Permit the bearer my boy Henry, sometimes calling himself Henry Holland — a kind of negro pride he has — to pass and repass wherever he wants to go, he behaving himself properly. STEPHEN FRANKS To all whom it may concern. Natchez, Nov. 29th, 1852.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 028. Carefully depositing the charte volante in his pocket wallet, Henry quietly entered the hut[2] of Mammy Judy and Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 9 The Runaway</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“De Laud's good — bless his name!” exclaimed Mammy Judy wringing her hands as Henry entered their hut. “ 'e heahs de prahs ob 'is chilen. Yeh hab reason t' tang God yeh is heah dis day!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes Henry, see wat de Laud's done fah yeh. Tis true's I's heah dis day! Tang God fah dat!” added Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think,” replied he, after listening with patience to the old people, “I have reason to thank our Ailcey and Van Winter's Biddy; they, it seems to me, should have some credit in the matter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho boy, g'long whah yeh gwine! Yo' backslidin' gwine git yeh in trouble ghin eh reckon?” replied Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having heard the conversation between her mistress and Henry, Ailcey, as a secret, informed Van Winter's Derba, who informed her fellow servant Biddy, who imparted it to her acquaintance Nelly, the slave of esquire Potter, Nelly informing her mistress, who told the 'Squire, who led Franks into the secret of the whole matter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mus'n blame me, Henry!” said Ailcey in an undertone. “I did'n mean de wite folks to know wat I tole Derba, nor she di'n mean it nuther, but dat devil, Pottah's Nell! us gals mean da fus time we ketch uh out, to duck uh in da rivah! She's rale wite folk's nigga, dat's jus' wat she is. Nevah mine, we'll ketch her yit!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't blame you Ailcey, nor either of Mrs. Van Winter's girls, as I know that you are my friends, neither of whom would do anything knowingly to injure me. I know Ailcey that you are a good girl, and believe you would tell me — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes Henry, I is yo' fren' an' come to tell yeh now wat da wite folks goin' to do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it Ailcey; what do you know?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 029.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wy dat ugly ole devil Dick Crow — God fah gim me! But I hate 'im so, case he nothin' but po' wite man, no how — I know 'im he come from Fagina on — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never mind his origin, Ailcey, tell me what you know concerning his visit in the house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I is goin' to, but da ugly ole devil, I hates 'im so! Maus Stephen had 'im in da pahla, an' 'e sole yeh to 'im, dat ugly ole po' wite devil, fah — God knows how much — a hole heap a money; `two' somethin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know what it was, two thousand dollars, for that was his selling price to Jack Harris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, dat was da sum, Henry.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am satisfied as to how much he can be relied on. Even was I to take the advice of the old people here, and become reconciled to drag out a miserable life of degradation and bondage under them, I would not be permitted to do so by this man, who seeks every opportunity to crush out my lingering manhood, and reduce my free spirit to the submission of a slave. He cannot do it, I will not submit to it, and I defy his power to make me submit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laus a messy, Henry, yeh free man! huccum yeh not tell me long'o? Sho boy, bettah go long whah yeh gwine, out yandah, an' not fool long wid wite folks!” said Mammy Judy with surprise, “wat bring yeh heah anyhow?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's best known to myself, mammy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat make yeh keep heah so long den, dat yeh ain' gone fo' dis?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your questions become rather pressing, mammy; I can't tell you that either.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laud, Laud, Laud! So yeh free man? Well, well, well!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Once for all, I now tell you old people what I never told you before, nor never expected to tell you under such circumstances; that I never intend to serve any white man again. I'll die first!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“De Laud a' messy on my po' soul! An' huccum yeh not gone befo'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carrying out the principles and advice of you old people `standing still, to see the salvation.' But with me, `now is the accepted time, today is the day of salvation.' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, well!” sighed Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am satisfied that I am sold, and the wretch who did it seeks to 925EAF. Page 030. conceal his perfidy by deception. Now if ever you old people did anything in your lives, you must do it now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat dat yeh want wid us?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, if you'll go, I'll take you on Saturday night, and make our escape to a free country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat place yeh call dat?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Canada!” replied Henry, with emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How fah yeh gwine take me?” earnestly enquired the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't just now tell the distance, probably some two or three thousand miles from here, the way we'd have to go.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“De Laus a messy on me! An' wat yeh gwine do wid little Joe; ain gwine leave 'im behine?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, Mammy Judy, I'd bury him in the bottom of the river first! I intend carrying him in a bundle on my back, as the Indians carry their babies.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat yeh gwine do fah money; yeh ain' gwine rob folks on de road?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No mammy, I'll starve first. Have you and Daddy Joe saved nothing from your black-eye peas and poultry selling for many years?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole man, how much in dat pot undeh de flo' dah; how long since yeh count it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don'o,” replied Daddy Joe, “las' time ah count it, da wah faughty guinea* uh sich a mauttah, an' ah put in some six-seven guinea mo' since dat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you have some two hundred and fifty dollars in money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat do yeh?” enquired Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that of itself is enough, but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den take it an' go long whah yeh gwine; we ole folks too ole fah gwine headlong out yandah an' don'o whah we gwine. Sho boy! take de money an' g'long!” decisively replied the old woman after all her inquisitiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you don't know, I do, mammy, and that will answer for all.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat ain' gwine do us. We ole folks ain' politishon an' undestan' de graumma uh dese places, an' w'en we git dah den maybe do'n like it an cahn' git back. Sho chile, so long whah yeh gwine!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 031.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you say, Daddy Joe? Whatever you have to say, must be said quick, as time with me is precious.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We is too ole dis time a day, chile, t'go way out yauah de Laud knows whah; bettah whah we is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'll not be too old to go if these whites once take a notion to sell you. What will you do then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Trus' to de Laud!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, the same old slave song — `Trust to the Lord.' Then I must go, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ain' yeh gwine take de money, Henry?” interrupted the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, mammy, since you will not go, I leave it for you and Daddy Joe, as you may yet have use for it, or those may desire to use it who better understand what use to make of it than you and Daddy Joe seem willing to be instructed in.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den yeh 'ont have de money?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thank you and Daddy most kindly, Mammy Judy, for your offer, and only refuse because I have two hundred guineas about me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho boy, yeh got all dat, no call t'want dat little we got. Whah yeh git all dat money? Do'n reckon yeh gwine tell me! Did'n steal from maus Stephen, do'n reckon?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, mammy, I'm incapable of stealing from any one, but I have, from time to time, taken by littles, some of the earnings due me for more than eighteen years' service to this man Franks, which at the low rate of two hundred dollars a year, would amount to sixteen hundred dollars more than I secured, exclusive of the interest, which would have more than supplied my clothing, to say nothing of the injury done me by degrading me as a slave. `Steal' indeed! I would that when I had an opportunity, I had taken fifty thousand instead of two. I am to understand you old people as positively declining to go, am I?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, no, chile, we cahn go! We put ouh trus' in de Laud, he bring us out mo' nah conkah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then from this time hence, I become a runaway. Take care of my poor boy while he's with you. When I leave the swamps, or where I'll go, will never be known to you. Should my boy be suddenly missed, and you find three notches cut in the bark of the big willow tree, on the side away from your hut, then give yourself no uneasiness; but if you don't find these notches in the tree, then I know nothing about 925EAF. Page 032. him. Goodbye!” And Henry strode directly for the road to Woodville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Fahwell me son, fahwell, an' may God a'mighty go wid you! May de Laud guide an' 'tect yeh on de way!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The child, contrary to his custom, commenced crying, desiring to see Mamma Maggie and Dadda Henry. Every effort to quiet him was unavailing. This brought sorrow to the old people's hearts and tears to their eyes, which they endeavored to soothe in a touching lamentation:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See wives and husbands torn apart, Their children's screams, they grieve my heart. They are torn away to Georgia! Come and go along with me — They are torn away to Georgia! Go sound the Jubilee!</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 10 Merry Making</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The day is Saturday, a part of which is given by many liberal masters to their slaves, the afternoon being spent as a holiday, or in vending such little marketable commodities as they might by chance possess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a token of gratitude, it is customary in many parts of the South for the slaves to invite their masters to their entertainments. This evening presented such an occasion on the premises of Colonel Stephen Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This day Mammy Judy was extremely busy, for in addition to the responsibility of the culinary department, there was her calico habit to be done up — she would not let Potter's Milly look any better than herself — and an old suit of the young master George's clothes had to be patched and darned a little before little Joe could favorably compare with Craig's Sooky's little Dick. And the cast-off linen given to her husband for the occasion might require a “little doing up.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat missus sen' dis shut heah wid de bres all full dis debilment an' nonsense fah?” said Mammy Judy, holding up the garment, looking at 925EAF. Page 033. the ruffles. “Sho! Missus mus' be crack, sen' dis heah! Ole man ain' gwine sen' he soul to de ole boy puttin' on dis debilment!” And she hastened away with the shirt, stating to her mistress her religious objections. Mrs. Franks smiled as she took the garment, telling her that the objections could be easily removed by taking off the ruffles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat look sumphen like!” remarked the old woman, when Ailcey handed her the shirt with the ruffles removed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sen' dat debilment an' nonsense heah! Sho!” And carrying it away smiling, she laid it upon the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The feast of the evening was such as Mammy Judy was capable of preparing when in her best humor, consisting of all the delicacies usually served up on the occasion of corn huskings in the graingrowing region.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conscious that he was not entitled to their gratitude, Colonel Franks declined to honor the entertainment, though the invitation was a ruse to deceive him, as he had attempted to deceive them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evening brought with it much of life's variety, as may be seen among the slave population of the South. There were Potter's slaves, and the people of Mrs. Van Winter, also those of Major Craig, and Dr. Denny, all dressed neatly, and seemingly very happy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ailcey was quite the pride of the evening, in an old gauze orange dress of her mistress, and felt that she deserved to be well thought of, as proving herself the friend of Henry, the son-in-law of Daddy Joe and Mammy Judy, the heads of the entertainment. Mammy Judy and Potter's Milly were both looking matronly in their calico gowns and towlinen aprons, and Daddy Joe was the honored and observed of the party, in an old black suit with an abundance of surplus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He'p yeh se'f, chilen!” said Mammy Judy, after the table had been blessed by Daddy Joe. “Henry ain' gwine be heah, 'e gone to Woodville uh some whah dah, kick'n up 'e heel. Come, chilen, eat haughty, mo' whah dis come f'om. He'p yeh se'f now do'n — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I is, Aun' Judy; I likes dis heah kine a witals!” drawled out Potter's Nelse, reaching over for the fifth or sixth time. “Dis am good shaut cake!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O mammy, look at Jilson!” exclaimed Ailcey, as a huge, rough field hand — who refused to go to the table with the company, but sat sulkily by himself in one corner — was just walking away, with two whole “cakes” of bread under his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 034.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat yeh gwine do wid dat bread, Jilson?” enquired the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I gwine eat it, dat wat I gwine do wid it! I ain' had no w'eat bread dis two hauvest!” he having come from Virginia, where such articles of food on harvest occasion were generally allowed the slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Big hog, so 'e is!” rebukingly said Ailcey, when she saw that Jilson was determined in his purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nebeh mine dat childen, plenty mo!” responded Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole umin, dat chile in de way dah; de gals haudly tu'n roun,” suggested Daddy Joe, on seeing the pallet of little Joe crowded upon as the girls were leaving the table, seating themselves around the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ailcey, my chile, jes' run up to de hut wid 'im, 'an lay 'im in de bed; ef yeh fuhd, Van Wintah' Ben go wid yeh; ah knows 'e likes to go wid de gals,” said Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking up his hat with a bland smile, Ben obeyed orders without a demur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The entertainment was held at the extreme end of a two-acre lot in the old slave quarters, while the hut of Mammy Judy was near the great house. Ailcey thought she espied a person retreat into the shrubbery and, startled, she went to the back door of the hut, but Ben hooted at the idea of any person out and about on such an occasion, except indeed it was Jilson with his bread. The child being carefully placed in bed, Ailcey and her protector were soon mingled with the merry slaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were three persons generally quite prominent among the slaves of the neighborhood, missed on this occasion; Franks' Charles, Denny's Sam, and Potter's Andy; Sam being confined to bed by sickness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ailcey, whah's Chaules — huccum 'e not heah?” enquired Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Endeed, I dun'o mammy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Huccum Pottah's Andy ain' heah muddah?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Andy a' home tonight, Aun' Judy, an' uh dun'o whah 'e is,” replied Winny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gone headlong out yandah, arteh no good, uh doh reckon, an' Chaules 'e gone dah too,” replied the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da ain' nothin' mattah wid dis crowd, Aun' Judy,” complimented Nelse as he sat beside Derba. At this expression Mammy Judy gave a deep sigh, on the thought of her absent daughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, chilen,” suggested Mammy Judy, “yeh all eat mighty hauty, 925EAF. Page 035. an' been mighty merry, an' 'joy yehse'f much; we now sing praise to de Laud fah wat 'e done fah us,” raising a hymn in which all earnestly joined:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! Jesus, Jesus is my friend, He'll be my helper to the end,...</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Young folk, yeh all bettah git ready now an' go, fo' de patrollas come out. Yeh all 'joy yeh se'f much, now time yeh gone. Hope yeh all sauv God Sunday. Ole man fo' de all gone, hab wud uh prah,” advised the old woman; the following being sung in conclusion:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Lord is here, and the Lord is all around us; Canaan, Canaan's a very happy home — O, glory! O, glory! O, glory! God is here, when the gathering dispersed, the slaves going cheerfully to their homes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come ole man, yeh got mautch? light sum dem shavens dah, quick. Ah cah fine de chile heah on dis bed!” said Mammy Judy, on entering the hut and feeling about in the dark for little Joe. “Ailcey, wat yeh done wid de chile?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“E's dah, Mammy Judy, I lain 'im on de bed, ah spose 'e roll off.” The shavings being lit, here was no child to be found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My Laud, ole man! whah's de chile? Wat dis mean! O, whah's my po' chile gone; my po' baby!” exclaimed Mammy Judy, wringing her hands in distress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stay, ole 'umin! De tree! De tree!” When, going out in the dark, feeling the trunk of the willow, three notches in the bark were distinct to the touch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole 'umin!” exclaimed Daddy Joe in a suppressed voice, hastening into the hut. “It am he, it am Henry got 'im!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tang God, den my po' baby safe!” responded Mammy Judy, when they raised their voices in praise of thankfulness:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`O, who's like Jesus! Hallelujah! praise ye the Lord; O, who's like Jesus! Hallelujah! love and serve the Lord!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 036.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Falling upon their knees, the old man offered an earnest, heartful prayer to God, asking his guardianship through the night, and protection through the day, especially upon their heartbroken daughter, their runaway son-in-law, and the little grandson, when the two old people retired to rest with spirits mingled with joy, sorrow, hope, and fear; Ailcey going into the great house.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 11 A Shadow</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, boys! Here you are, true to your promise,” said Henry, as he entered a covert in the thicket adjacent the cotton place, late on Sunday evening, “have you been waiting long?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not very,” replied Andy, “not mo' dan two-three ouahs.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was fearful you would not come, or if you did before me, that you would grow weary, and leave.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yeh no call to doubt us Henry, case yeh fine us true as ole steel!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know it,” answered he, “but you know, Andy, that when a slave is once sold at auction, all respect for him — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O pshaw! we ain' goin' to heah nothin' like dat a tall! case — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No!” interrupted Charles, “all you got to do Henry, is to tell we boys what you want, an' we're your men.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the talk for me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, what you doin' here?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“W'at brought yeh back from Jackson so soon?” further enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you get word to meet me here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By Ailcey; she give me the stone, an' I give it to Andy, an' we both sent one apiece back. Didn't you git 'em?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that's the way I knew you intended to meet me,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So we thought,” said Charles, “but tell us, Henry, what you want us to do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you know all about the sale, that they had me on the auction block, but ordered a postponement, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the very pint we can't understand, although I'm in the same family with you,” interrupted Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 037.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But tell us Henry, what yeh doin' here?” impatiently enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” added Charles, “we want to know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I'm a runaway, and from this time forth, I swear — I do it religiously — that I'll never again serve any white man living!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the pint I wanted to git at before,” explained Charles, “as I can't understan' why you run away, after your release from Jack Harris, an' — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nah, I nuthah!” interrupted Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It seems to me,” continued Charles, “that I'd 'ave went before they 'tempted to sell me, an' that you're safer now than before they had you on the block.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's da way I look at it,” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The stopping of the sale was to deceive his wife, mammy, and Daddy Joe, as he had privately disposed of me to a regular soul-driver by the name of Crow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I knows Dick Crow,” said Andy, “'e come f'om Faginy, whah I did, da same town.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So Ailcey said of him. Then you know him without any description from me,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes 'n deed! an' I knows 'im to be a inhuman, mean, dead-po' white man, dat's wat I does.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I was privately sold to him for two thousand dollars, then ordered back to Franks, as though I was still his slave, and by him given a pass, and requested to go to Woodville where there were arrangements to seize me and hold me, till Crow ordered me, which was to have been on Tuesday evening. Crow is not aware of me having been given a pass; Franks gave it to deceive his wife, in case of my not returning, to make the impression that I had run away, when in reality I was sold to the trader.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then our people had their merrymaking all for nothin',” said Charles, “an' Franks got what 'e didn't deserve — their praise.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, the merrymaking was only to deceive Franks, that I might have time to get away. Daddy Joe, Mammy Judy, and Ailcey knew all about it, and proposed the feast to deceive him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's good! Sarve 'im right, da 'sarned ole scamp!” rejoined Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It couldn't be better!” responded Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry uh wish we was in yo' place an' you none da wus by it,” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 038.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never mind, boys, give yourselves no uneasiness, as it wont be long before we'll all be together.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You think so, Henry?” asked Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well uh hope so, but den body can haudly 'spect it,” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Boys,” said Henry, with great caution and much emotion, “I am now about to approach an important subject and as I have always found you true to me — and you can only be true to me by being true to yourselves — I shall not hesitate to impart it! But for Heaven's sake! — perhaps I had better not!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Keep nothin' back, Henry,” said Charles, “as you know that we boys 'll die by our principles, that's settled!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I wants to die right now by mine; right heah, now!” sanctioned Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well it is this — close, boys! close!” when they gathered in a huddle, beneath an underbush, upon their knees, “you both go with me, but not now. I — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not now?” anxiously enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's wat I like to know!” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, boys, till I explain. The plans are mine and you must allow me to know more about them than you. Just here, for once, the slave-holding preacher's advice to the black man is appropriate, `Stand still and see the salvation.”'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then let us hear it, Henry,” asked Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Fah God sake!” said Andy, “let us heah w'at it is, anyhow, Henry; yeh keep a body in 'spence so long, till I's mose crazy to heah it. Dat's no way!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You shall have it, but I approach it with caution! Nay, with fear and trembling, at the thought of what has been the fate of all previous matters of this kind. I approach it with religious fear, and hardly think us fit for the task; at least, I know I am not. But as no one has ever originated, or given us anything of the kind, I suppose I may venture.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell it! tell it!” urged both in a whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Andy,” said Henry, “let us have a word of prayer first!” when they bowed low, with their heads to the ground, Andy, who was a preacher of the Baptist pursuasion among his slave brethren, offering a solemn and affecting prayer, in whispers to the Most High, to give them knowledge and courage in the undertaking, and success in the effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 039.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rising from their knees, Andy commenced an anthem, by which he appeared to be much affected, in the following words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About our future destiny, There need be none debate — Whilst we ride on the tide, With our Captain and his mate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clasping each other by the hand, standing in a band together, as a plight of their union and fidelity to each other, Henry said, “I now impart to you the secret, it is this: I have laid a scheme, and matured a plan for a general insurrection of the slaves in every state, and the successful overthrow of slavery!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen!” exclaimed Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God grant it!” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell us, Henry, how's dis to be carried out?” enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the thing which most concerns me, as it seems that it would be hard to do in the present ignorant state of our people in the slave States,” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's jis wat I feah!” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This difficulty is obviated. It is so simple that the most stupid among the slaves will understand it as well as if he had been instructed for a year.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What!” exclaimed Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let's heah dat again!” asked Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is so just as I told you! So simple is it that the trees of the forest or an orchard illustrate it; flocks of birds or domestic cattle, fields of corn, hemp, or sugar cane; tobacco, rice, or cotton, the whistling of the wind, rustling of the leaves, flashing of lightning, roaring of thunder, and running of streams all keep it constantly before their eyes and in their memory, so that they can't forget it if they would.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are we to know it now?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm boun' to know it dis night befo' I goes home, 'case I been longin' fah ole Pottah dis many day, an' uh mos' think uh got 'im now!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes boys, you've to know it before we part, but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the talk!” said Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good nuff talk fah me!” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 040.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“As I was about to say, such is the character of this organization, that punishment and misery are made the instruments for its propagation, so — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't understan' that part — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know nothing at all about it Charles, and you must — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stan' still an' see da salvation!” interrupted Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen!” responded Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God help you so to do, brethren!” admonished Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go on Henry tell us! give it to us!” they urged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Every blow you receive from the oppressor impresses the organization upon your mind, making it so clear that even Whitehead's Jack could understand it as well as his master.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We are satisfied! The secret, the secret!” they importuned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well then, first to prayer, and then to the organization. Andy!” said Henry, nodding to him, when they again bowed low with their heads to the ground, whilst each breathed a silent prayer, which was ended with “Amen” by Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whilst yet upon their knees, Henry imparted to them the secrets of his organization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, dat's da thing!” exclaimed Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Capital, capital!” responded Charles. “What fools we was that we didn't know it long ago!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I is mad wid myse'f now!” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, well! Surely God must be in the work,” continued Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“'E's heah; Heaven's nigh! Ah feels it! It's right heah!” responded Andy, placing his hand upon his chest, the tears trickling down his cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Brethren,” asked Henry, “do you understand it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Understand it? Why, a child could understand, it's so easy!” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” added Andy, “ah not only undestan' myse'f, but wid da knowledge I has uv it, ah could make Whitehead's Jack a Moses!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stand still, then, and see!” said he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's good Bible talk!” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, what is we to do?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must now go on and organize continually. It makes no difference when, nor where you are, so that the slaves are true and 925EAF. Page 041. trustworthy, as the scheme is adapted to all times and places.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How we gwine do Henry, 'bout gittin' da things 'mong da boys?” enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All you have to do, is to find one good man or woman — I don't care which, so that they prove to be the right person — on a single plantation, and hold a seclusion and impart the secret to them, and make them the organizers for their own plantation, and they in like manner impart it to some other next to them, and so on. In this way it will spread like smallpox among them.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, you is fit fah leadah ah see,” complimentingly said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I greatly mistrust myself, brethren, but if I can't command, I can at least plan.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is they anything else for us to do Henry?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, a very important part of your duties has yet to be stated. I now go as a runaway, and will be suspected of lurking about in the thickets, swamps and caves; then to make the ruse complete, just as often as you think it necessary, to make a good impression, you must kill a shoat, take a lamb, pig, turkey, goose, chickens, ham of bacon from the smoke house, a loaf of bread or crock of butter from the spring house, and throw them down into the old waste well at the back of the old quarters, always leaving the heads of the fowls lying about and the blood of the larger animals. Everything that is missed dont hesitate to lay it upon me, as a runaway, it will only cause them to have the less suspicion of your having such a design.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's it — the very thing!” said Charles. “An it so happens that they's an ole waste well on both Franks' and Potter's places, one for both of us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope Andy, you have no religious objections to this?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a paut ah my 'ligion Henry, to do whateveh I bleve right, an' shall sholy do dis, God being my helpah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now he's talkin!” said Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must make your religion subserve your interests, as your oppressors do theirs!” advised Henry. “They use the Scriptures to make you submit, by preaching to you the texts of `obedience to your masters' and `standing still to see the salavation,' and we must now begin to understand the Bible so as to make it of interest to us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's gospel talk,” sanctioned Andy. “Is da anything else yeh want tell us boss — I calls 'im boss, 'case 'e aint nothing else but `boss' — so we 925EAF. Page 042. can make 'ase an' git to wuck? 'case I feels like goin' at 'em now, me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Having accomplished our object, I think I have done, and must leave you tomorrow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When shall we hear from you, Henry?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not until you shall see me again; when that will be, I don't know. You may see me in six months, and might not not in eighteen. I am determined, now that I am driven to it, to complete an organization in every slave state before I return, and have fixed two years as my utmost limit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, tell me before we part, do you know anything about little Joe?” enquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wha's da chile?” enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He's safe enough, on his way to Canada!” at which Charles and Andy laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Little Joe is on 'is way to Canada?” said Andy. “Mighty young travelah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” replied Henry with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're a-joking Henry?” said Charles, enquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am serious, brethren,” replied he. “I do not joke in matters of this kind. I smiled because of Andy's surprise.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did 'e go?” further enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In company with his `mother' who was waiting on her `mistress!' ” replied he quaintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Eh heh!” exclaimed Andy. “I knows all 'bout it now; but whah'd da `mammy' come from?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I found one!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Aint 'e high!” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, brethren, my time is drawing to a close,” said Henry, rising to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O!” exclaimed Andy. “Ah like to forgot, has yeh any money Henry?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have either of you any?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We has.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I got two-three hundred dollahs!” replied Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An' so has I, Henry!” added Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then keep it, as I have two thousand dollars now around my waist, and you'll find use for all you've got, and more, as you will before 925EAF. Page 043. long have an opportunity of testing. Keep this studiously in mind and impress it as an important part of the scheme of organization, that they must have money, if they want to get free. Money will obtain them everything necessary by which to obtain their liberty. The money is within all of their reach if they only knew it was right to take it. God told the Egyptian slaves to `borrow from their neighbors' — meaning their oppressors — `all their jewels;' meaning to take their money and wealth wherever they could lay hands upon it, and depart from Egypt. So you must teach them to take all the money they can get from their masters, to enable them to make the strike without a failure.[3] I'll show you when we leave for the North, what money will do for you, right here in Mississippi. Bear this in mind; it is your certain passport through the white gap, as I term it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I means to take all ah can git; I bin doin' dat dis some time. Ev'ry time ole Pottah leave 'is money pus, I borrys some, an' e' all'as lays it on Miss Mary, but 'e think so much uh huh, dat anything she do is right wid 'im. Ef 'e 'spected me, an' Miss Mary say 'twant me, dat would be 'nough fah 'im.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's right!” said Henry. “I see you have been putting your own interpretation on the Scriptures, Andy, and as Charles will now have to take my place, he'll have still a much better opportunity than you, to “borrow from his master.' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You needn't fear, I'll make good use of my time!” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The slaves now fell upon their knees in silent communion, all being affected to the shedding of tears, a period being put to their devotion by a sorrowful trembling of Henry's voice singing to the following touching words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Farewell, farewell, farewell! My loving friends farewell! Farewell old comrades in the cause, I leave you here, and journey on; And if I never more return, Farewell, I'm bound to meet you there![4]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One word before we part,” said Charles. “If we never should see you again, I suppose you intend to push on this scheme?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 044.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Insurrection shall be my theme! My watchword `Freedom or the grave!' Until from Rappahannock's stream, To where the Cuato* waters lave, One simultaneous war cry Shall burst upon the midnight air! And rouse the tyrant but to sigh — Mid sadness, wailing, and despair!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Grasping each eagerly by the hand, the tears gushing from his eyes, with an humble bow, he bid them finally “farewell!” and the runaway was off through the forest.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“It can't be; I won't believe it!” said Franks at the breakfast table on Sunday morning, after hearing that little Joe was missed. “He certainly must be lost in the shrubbery.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After breakfast a thorough search was made, none being more industrious than Ailcey in hunting the little fugitive, but without success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When was he last seen?” enquired Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He wah put to bed las' night while we wuh at de suppeh seh!” replied Ailcey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's something wrong about this thing, Mrs. Franks, and I'll be hanged if I don't ferret out the whole before I'm done with it!” said the Colonel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you don't suspect me as — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nonsense! my dear, not at all — nothing of the sort, but I do suspect respectable parties in another direction.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gracious, Colonel! Whom have you reference to? I'm sure I can't imagine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, we shall see! Ailcey, call Judy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 045.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maus Stephen, yeh sen' fah me?” enquired the old woman, puffing and blowing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Judy. Do you know anything about little Joe? I want you to tell me the truth!” sternly enquired Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maus Stephen! I cah lie! so long as yeh had me, yu nah missus neveh knows me tell lie. No, bless de Laud! Ah sen' my soul to de ole boy dat way? No maus Stephen, ah uhdn give wat I feels in my soul — — ”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Tell us about the boy, Judy, and we'll hear about your religion another time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you give her a little time, Colonel, I think she'll be able to tell about him!” suggested Mrs. Franks on seeing the old woman weeping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho, mammy!” said Ailcey in a whisper with a nudge, standing behind her, “wat yeh stan' heah cryin' befo' dese ole wite folks fah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, come, Judy! what are you crying about! let us hear quickly what you've got to say. Don't be frightened!”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“The old thing's crazy! We'll not be able to get anything out of her, Mrs. Franks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No maus Stephen, blessed be God a'mighty! I's not crazy, but sobeh as a judge! An — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then let us hear about little Joe, as you can understand so well what is said around you, and let us have no more of your whooping and nonsense, distracting the neighborhood!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Blessed God! Blessed God! Laud sen' a nudah gale! O, fah a nudah showeh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I really believe she's crazy! We've now been here over an hour, and no nearer the information than before.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think she's better now!” said Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Judy, can you compose yourself long enough to answer my questions?” enquired Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 046.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O yes, mausta! ah knows wat I's 'bout, but w'en mausta Jesus calls, ebry body mus' stan' back, case 'e's 'bove all!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's all right, Judy, all right; but let us hear about little Joe — do you know anything about him, where he is, or how he was taken away?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ 'E wah dah Sattiday night, maus Stephen.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Who put him to bed — you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, seh, Ailcey.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ailcey — who went with her, any one?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes seh, Van Wintah Ben went wid uh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Van Winter's Ben! I thought we'd get at the thieves presently; I knew I'd ferret it out! Well now, Judy, I ask you as a Christian, and expect you to act with me as one Christian with another — has not Mrs. Van Winter been talking to you about this boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No seh, nebeh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nor to Henry?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No seh!”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“No, seh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you not hear Ailcey tell some one, or talking in her sleep, say that Mrs. Van Winter had something to do with the abduction of that boy?”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Judy, you can go now. She's an honest old creature, I believe!” said Franks, as the old fat cook turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, poor old black fat thing! She's religious to a fault,” replied Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Ailcey, what do you know about it?” enquired the master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 047.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothin' seh, o'ny Mammy Judy ask me toat 'im up to da hut an' put 'im in bed.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Did he not go back again, or did he remain in the house?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ 'E stay in.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Negroes, I mean! You didn't let me finish the sentence, my dear!” explained he, correcting his error.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah dun'o, seh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now tell me candidly, my girl, who and what you thought it was at the time?”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Tell, Ailcey! Who do you think it was, and what they were after?” enquired Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah do'n waun tell, missus!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell, you goose you! did you see any one?” continued Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah jis glance 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was the person close to you?” further enquired Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, um, da toched me on da shouldeh an' run.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, why don't you tell then, Ailcey, who you thought it was, and what they were after, you stubborn jade you, speak!” stormed Franks, stamping his foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't get out of temper, Colonel! make some allowance for her 925EAF. Page 048. under the circumstances. Now tell, Ailcey, what you thought at the time?” mildly asked Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah tho't t'wah maus Stephen afteh me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, if you know nothing about it, you may go now!” gruffly replied her master. “These Negroes are not to be trusted. They will endeavor to screen each other if they have the least chance to do so. I'll sell that girl!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Colonel, don't be hasty in this matter, I beg of you!” said Mrs. Franks earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I mean to let her go to the man she most hates, that's Crow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why do you think she hates Crow so badly?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the side looks she gives him when he comes into the house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I pray you then, Colonel, to attempt no more auction sales, and you may avoid unpleasant association in that direction.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, by the by, speaking of the auction, I really believe Mrs. Van Winter had something to do with the abduction of that little Negro.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think you do her wrong, Colonel Franks; she's our friend, and aside from this, I don't think her capable of such a thing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Such friendship is worse than open enmity, my dear, and should be studiously shunned.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I must acquit her, Colonel, of all agency in this matter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, mark what I tell you, Mrs. Franks, you'll yet hear more of it, and that too at no distant day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well it may be, but I can't think so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May be!” I'm sure so. And more: I believe that boy has been induced to take advantage of my clemency, and run away. I'll make an example of him, because what one Negro succeeds in doing, another will attempt. I'll have him at any cost. Let him go on this way and there won't be a Negro in the neighborhood presently.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whom do you mean, Colonel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I mean that ingrate Henry, that's who.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry gone!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no doubt of it at all, as he had a pass to Woodville and Jackson; and now that the boy is stolen by someone, I've no doubt himself. I might have had some leniency towards him had he not committed a theft, a crime of all others the most detestable in my estimation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And Henry is really gone?” with surprise again enquired Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 049.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is, my dear, and you appear to be quite inquisitive about it!” remarked Franks as he thought he observed a concealed smile upon her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am inquisitive, Colonel, because whatever interests you should interest me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By Monday evening, hanged if I don't know all about this thing. Ailcey, call Charles to get my saddle horse!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Charles ain' heah, maus Stephen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where's old Joe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At de hut, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell him to saddle Oscar immediately, and bring him to the door.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, seh!” replied the girl, lightly tripping away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horse was soon at the door, and with his rider cantering away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tony, what is Mammy Judy about?” enquired Mrs. Franks as evening approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She's sif'en meal, missus, to make mush fah ouah suppah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must tell mammy not to forget me, Tony, in the distribution of her mush and milk.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, missus, ah tell uh right now!” when away ran Tony bearing the message, eager as are all children to be the agents of an act of kindness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Judy, smiling, received the message with the assurance of “Yes, dat she shall hab much as she want!” when, turning about, she gave strict orders that Ailcey neglect not to have a china bowl in readiness to receive the first installment of the hasty pudding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hut of Mammy Judy served as a sort of headquarters on Saturday and Sunday evenings for the slaves from the plantation, and those in town belonging to the “estate,” who this evening enjoyed a hearty laugh at the expense of Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slaves are not generally supplied with light in their huts; consequently, except from the fat of their meat and that gathered about the kitchen with which they make a “lamp,” and the use of pinewood tapers, they eat and do everything about their dwellings in the dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hasty pudding for the evening being the bill of fare, all sat patiently awaiting the summon of Mammy Judy, some on blocks, some on logs of wood, some on slab benches, some on inverted buckets and half-barrel wash tubs, and whatever was convenient, while many of the girls and other young people were seated on the floor around against the wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 050.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush, chilen!” admonished Mammy Judy, after carefully seeing that each one down to Tony had been served with a quota from the kettle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laud, make us truly tankful fah wat we 'bout to 'ceive!” petitioned Daddy Joe with uplifted hands. “Top dah wid yo' nause an' nonsense ole people cah heah deh yeahs to eat!” admonished the old man as he took the pewter dish between his knees and commenced an earnest discussion of its contents. “Do'n yeh heah me say hush dah? Do'n yeh heah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Joe!” was the authoritative voice from without.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take my horse to the stable!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sah!” responded the old man, sitting down his bowl of mush and milk on the hearth in the corner of the jam. “Do'n any on yeh toch dat, yeh heah?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We ain gwine to, Daddy Joe,” replied the young people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Huccum de young folks, gwine eat yo' mush and milk? Sho, ole man, g'long whah yeh gwine, ad' let young folk 'lone!” retorted Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On returning from the stable, in his hurry the old man took up the bowl of a young man who sat it on his stool for the moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yoheh, Daddy Joe, dat my mush!” said the young man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Huccum dis yone?” replied the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wy, ah put it dah; yeh put yone in de chimbly connoh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah! Dat eh did!” exclaimed he, taking up the bowl eating heartily. “Wat dat yeh all been doin' heah? Some on yeh young folks been prankin' long wid dis mush an' milk!” continued the old man, champing and chewing in a manner which indicated something more solid than mush and milk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Deed we did'n, Daddy Joe; did'n do nothin' to yo' mush an' milk, so we did'n!” replied Ailcey, whose word was always sufficient with the old people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hi, what dis in heah! Sumpen mighty crisp!” said Daddy Joe, still eating heartily and now and again blowing something from his mouth like coarse meal husks. “Sumpen heah mighty crisp, ah tells yeh! Ole umin, light dat pine knot dah; so dahk yeh cah'n see to talk. Git light dah quick ole umin! Sumpen heah mighty crisp in dis mush an' milk! — Mighty crisp!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 051.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good Laud! see dah now! Ah tole yeh so!” exclaimed Mammy Judy when, on producing a light, the bowl was found to be partially filled with large black house roaches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Reckon Daddy Joe do'n tank'im fah dat!” said little Tony, referring to the blessing of the old man; amidst an outburst of tittering and snickering among the young people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daddy Joe lost his supper, when the slaves retired for the evening.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 13 Perplexity</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early on Monday morning Colonel Franks arose to start for Woodville and Jackson in search of the fugitive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear, is Ailcey up? Please call Tony,” said Mrs. Franks, the boy soon appearing before his mistress. “Tony, call Ailcey,” continued she, “your master is up and going to the country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Missus Ailcey ain' dah!” replied the boy, returning in haste from the nursery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly she is; did you go into the nursery?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, um!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are the children there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, um, boph on 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then she can't be far — she'll be in presently.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Missus, she ain' come yit,” repeated the boy after a short absence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you look in the nursery again?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, um!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are the children still in bed?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, um, boph sleep, only maus George awake.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You mean one asleep and the other awake!” said Mrs. Franks, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes um boph wake!” replied the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn't you tell me, Tony, that your master George only was awake?” asked the mistress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Miss Matha sleep fus, den she wake up and talk to maus George,” explained the boy, his master laughing, declared that a Negro's skull was too thick to comprehend anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 052.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't mistake yourself, Colonel!” replied Mrs. Franks. “That boy is anything but a blockhead, mind that!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear, can't you see something about that girl?” said the Colonel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Run quickly, Tony, and see if Ailcey is in the hut,” bade Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear me,” continued she, “since the missing of little Joe, she's all gossip, and we needn't expect much of her until the thing has died away.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She'll not gossip after today, my dear!” replied the Colonel decisively, “as I'm determined to put her in my pocket in time, before she is decoyed away by that ungrateful wretch, who is doubtless ready for anything, however vile, for revenge.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ailcey was a handsome black girl, graceful and intelligent, but having been raised on the place, had not the opportunity of a house maid for refinement. The Colonel, having had a favorable opinion of her as a servant, frequently requested that she be taken from the field, long before it had been done. This had not the most favorable impression upon the mind of his lady, who since the morning of the interview, the day before, had completely turned against the girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Franks was an amiable lady and lenient mistress, but did a slave offend, she might be expected to act as a mistress; and still more, she was a woman; but concerning Ailcey she was mistaken, as a better and more pure-hearted female slave there was not to be found; and as true to her mistress and her honor, as was Maggie herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Missus, she ain't dare nudder! aun' Judy ain seed 'er from las' night!” said the boy who came running up the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then call Charles immediately!” ordered she; when away went he and shortly came Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Servant, mist'ess!” saluted Charles, as he entered her presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Charles, do you know anything of Ailcey?” enquired she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No mist'ess I don't.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When did you see her last?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Last night, ma'm.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was she in company with anyone?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes ma'm, Potter's Rachel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What time in the evening was it, Charles?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“After seven o'clock, ma'm.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 053.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, she was home after that and went to bed in the nursery, where she has been sleeping for several nights.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear, this thing must be probed to the bottom at once! things are taking such a strange course, that we don't know whom to trust. I'll be hanged if I understand it!” The carriage being ordered, they went directly down to 'squire Potter's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good morning Mrs. Potter! — you will pardon us for the intrusion at so early an hour, but as the errand may concern us all, I'll not stop to be ceremonious — do I find the 'squire in?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The answer being in the affirmative, a servant being in attendance, the old gentleman soon made his appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good morning, Colonel and Madam Franks!” saluted he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good morning, 'squire! I shan't be ceremonious, and to give you a history of my errand, and to make a short story of a long one, we'll `make a lump job of it,' to use a homely phrase.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know the 'squire will be interested!” added Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No doubt of it at all, ma'm!” replied Mrs. Potter, who seemed to anticipate them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is this,” resumed the Colonel. “On Friday I gave my boy Henry verbal permission to go to the country, when he pretended to leave. On Saturday evening during the Negro-gathering at the old quarters, my little Negro boy Joe was stolen away, and on last evening, our Negro girl Ailcey the nurse, cleared out, and it seems was last seen in company with your Negro girl Rachel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Titus, call Rachel there! No doubt but white men are at the bottom of it,” said Potter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Missus, heah I is!” drawled the girl awkwardly, with a curtsy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Speak to your master there; he wants you,” ordered Mrs. Potter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mausta!” saluted the girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Rachel, my girl, I want you to tell me, were you with Colonel Franks' black girl Ailcey on last evening?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes seh, I wah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where, Rachel?” continued the master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Heah seh, at ouah house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you go to?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We go down to docteh Denny.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What for — what took you down to Dr. Denny's, Rachel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Went 'long wid Ailcey.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 054.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did Ailcey go there for — do you know?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Went dah to see Craig' Polly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Craig's Polly, which of Mr. Craig's Negro girls is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat un w'ot mos' white.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, was Polly there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She waun dah w'en we go, but she soon come.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why did you go to Dr. Denny's to meet Polly?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ailcey say Polly go'n to meet uh dah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, did they leave there when you did?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you go to then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I come home, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did they go?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da say da go'n down undah da Hill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who else was with them besides you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No un, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was there no man with them, when they left for under the Hill?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you see no man about at all, Rachel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, seh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now don't be afraid to tell: was there no white person at all spoke to you when together last night?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None but some white gent'men come up an' want walk wid us, same like da al'as do we black girls w'en we go out.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did the girls seem to be acquainted and glad to see them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No seh, the girls run, and da gent'men cus — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never mind that, Rachel, you can go now,” concluded her master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, 'squire, hanged if this thing mus'nt be stopped! Four slaves in less than that many days gone from under our very eyes, and we unable to detect them! It's insufferable, and I believe whites to be at the head of it! I have my suspicions on a party who stands high in the community, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now Colonel, if you please!” interrupted Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I suppose we'll have for the present to pass that by,” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed, something really should be done!” said the 'squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, and that quickly, if we would keep our Negroes to prevent us from starving.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 055.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think the thing should at once be seen into; what say you, Colonel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“As I have several miles to ride this morning,” said Franks, looking at his watch, it now being past nine o'clock, “I must leave so as to be back in the evening. Any steps that may be taken before my return, you have the free use of my name. Good morning!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few minutes and the Colonel was at his own door, astride of a horse, and on his way to Woodville.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 14 Gad and Gossip</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This day the hut of Mammy Judy seemed to be the licensed resort for all the slaves of the town; and even many whites were seen occasionally to drop in and out, as they passed along. Everyone knew the residence of Colonel Franks, and many of the dusky inhabitants of the place were solely indebted to the purse-proud occupants of the “great house” for their introduction to that part of Mississippi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For years he and Major Armsted were the only reliable traders upon whom could be depended for a choice gang of field Negroes and other marketable people. And not only this section, but the whole Mississippi Valley to some extent was to them indebted. First as young men the agents of Woolford, in maturer age their names became as household words and known as the great proprietary Mississippi or Georgia Negro-traders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Domestic service seemed for the time suspended, and little required at home to do, as the day was spent as a kind of gala-day, in going about from place to place talking of everything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the foremost of these was Mammy Judy, for although she partially did, and was expected to stay and be at home today, and act as an oracle, yet she merely stole a little time to run over to Mrs. Van Winter's, step in at 'squire Potter's to speak a word to Milly, drop by Dr. Denny's, and just poke in her head at Craig's a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah been tellin' on 'em so! All along ah been tellin' on 'em, but da uden bleve me!” soliloquized Mammy Judy, when the first dash of news through the boy Tony reached her, that Ailcey had gone and 925EAF. Page 056. taken with her some of 'squire Potter's people, several of Dr. Denny's, a gang of Craig's, and half of Van Winter's. “Dat jis wat ah been tellin' on 'em all along, but da uden bleve me!” concluded she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yeah heah de news!” exclaimed Potter's Minney to Van Winter's Biddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I heah dat Ailcey gone!” replied Biddy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat all; no mo?” enquired the girl with a high turban of Madras on her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I heahn little Joe go too!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn yeh heah dot Denny' Sookey, an' Craig' Polly, took a whole heap uh Potteh' people an' clah'd out wid two po' white mens, an' dat da all seen comin' out Van Winteh de old ablish'neh, soon in de monin' fo' day?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No!” replied the good-natured, simple-hearted Biddy, “I did'n!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sho's yeh baun dat true, case uhly dis monin' cunel Frank' an' lady come see mausta — and yeh know 'e squiah an' make de law — an' mauster ghin 'em papehs, an' da go arter de Judge to put heh in jail!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take who to jail?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wy, dat ole ablish'neh, Miss Van Winteh! Ah wish da all dead, dese ole ablish'nehs, case da steal us an' sell us down souph to haud maustas, w'en we got good places. Any how she go'n to jail, an' I's glad!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking seriously at her, Biddy gave a long sigh, saying nothing to commit herself, but going home, communicated directly to her mistress that which she heard, as Mrs. Van Winter was by all regarded as a friend to the Negro race, and at that time the subject of strong suspicion among the slaveholders of the neighborhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eager to gad and gossip, from place to place the girl Minney passed about relating the same to each and all with whom she chanced to converse, they imparting to others the same strange story, until reaching the ears of intelligent whites who had heard no other version, it spread through the city as a statement of fact.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Learning as many did by sending to the house, that the Colonel that day had gone in search of his slaves, the statement was confirmed as having come from Mrs. Franks, who was known to be a firm friend of Mrs. Van Winter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Upon my word!” said Captain Grason on meeting Sheriff Hughes. “Sheriff, things are coming to a pretty pass!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 057.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's that, Captain?” enquired the Sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you not heard the news yet, concerning the Negroes?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, no! I've been away to Vicksburg the last ten days, and just getting back.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, Heavens! we're no longer safe in our own houses. Why, sir, we're about being overwhelmed by an infamous class of persons who live in our midst, and eat at our tables!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You surprise me, Captain! what's the matter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sir, it would take a week to relate the particulars, but our slaves are running off by wholesale. On Sunday night a parcel of Colonel Franks' Negroes left, a lot of Dr. Denny's, some of 'squire Potter's, and a gang of Craig's, aided by white men, whom together with the Negroes were seen before day in the morning coming out of the widow Van Winters, who was afterwards arrested, and since taken before the judge on a writ of habeas corpus, but the circumstances against her being so strong she was remanded for trial, which so far strengthens the accusation. I know not where this thing will end!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Surprising indeed, sir!” replied Hughes. “I had not heard of it before, but shall immediately repair to her house, and learn all the facts in the case. I am well acquainted with Mrs. Van Winter — in fact she is a relation of my wife — and must hasten. Good day, sir!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On ringing the bell, a quick step brought a person to the door, when on being opened, the Sheriff found himself in the warm embraces of the kind-hearted and affectionate Mrs. Van Winter herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the usual civilities, she was the first to introduce the subject, informing him of their loss by their mutual friends Colonel Franks and lady, with others, and no surprise was greater than that on hearing the story current concerning herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Judy was as busy as she well could be, in hearing and telling news among the slaves who continually came and went through the day. So overwhelmed with excitement was she, that she had little else to say in making a period, then “All a long ah been tellin' on yeh so, but yeh uden bleve me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the many who thronged the hut was Potter's Milly. She in person is black, stout and fat, bearing a striking resemblance to the matronly old occupant Mammy Judy. For two hours or more letting a number come in, gossip, and pass out, only to be immediately succeeded by another; who like the old country woman who for the 925EAF. Page 058. first time in visiting London all day stood upon the sidewalk of the principal thoroughfare waiting till the crowd of people and cavalcade of vehicles passed, before she made the attempt to cross the street; she sat waiting till a moment would occur by which in private to impart a secret to her friend alone. That moment did at last arrive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Judy!” said the old woman in a whisper. “Ah been waitin' all day long to see yeh fah sumpen' ticlar!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“W'at dat, Milly?” whispered Mammy Judy scarcely above her breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I's gwine too!” and she hurried away to prepare supper for the white folks, before they missed her, though she had been absent full two hours and a half, another thirty minutes being required for the fat old woman to reach the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Heah dat now!” whispered Mammy Judy. “Ah tole yeh so!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, my dear, not a word of that graceless dog, the little Negro, nor that girl,” said Franks who had just returned from the country, “but I am fully compensated for the disappointment, on learning of the arrest and imprisonment of that — — !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who, Colonel?” interrupted his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope after this you'll be willing to set some estimation on my judgment — I mean your friend Mrs. Van Winter the abolitionist!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I beg your pardon, Colonel, as nothing is farther from the truth! From whom did you receive that intelligence?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I met Captain Grason on his way to Woodville, who informed me that it was current in town, and you had corroborated the statement. Did you see him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothing of the kind, sir, and it has not been more than half an hour since Mrs. Van Winter left here, who heartily sympathizes with us, though she has her strange notions that black people have as much right to freedom as white.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, my dear, we'll drop the subject!” concluded the Colonel with much apparent disappointment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The leading gentlemen of the town and neighborhood assembled inaugurating the strictest vigilant police regulations, when after free and frequent potations of brandy and water, of which there was no scarcity about the Colonel's mansion, the company separated, being much higher spirited, if not better satisfied, than when they met in council.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">This evening Charles and Andy met each other in the street, but in consequence of the strict injunction on the slaves by the patrol law recently instituted, they only made signs as they passed, intending to meet at a designated point. But the patrol reconnoitred so closely in their track, they were driven entirely from their purpose, retiring to their homes for the night.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 15 Interchange of Opinion</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The landing of a steamer on her downward trip brought Judge Ballard and Major Armsted to Natchez. The Judge had come to examine the country, purchase a cotton farm, and complete the arrangements of an interest in the “Merchantman.” Already the proprietor of a large estate in Cuba, he was desirous of possessing a Mississippi cotton place. Disappointed by the absence of his wife abroad, he was satisfied to know that her object was accomplished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Major Armsted was a man of ripe intelligence, acquired by years of rigid experience and close observation, rather than literary culture, though his educational attainments as a business man were quite respectable. He for years had been the partner in business with Colonel Stephen Franks. In Baltimore, Washington City, Annapolis, Richmond, Norfolk, Charlestown, and Winchester, Virginia, a prison or receptacle for coffle-gangs of slaves purchased and sold in the market, comprised their principal places of business in the slaverow-ing states of the Union.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Major was a great jester, full of humor, and fond of a good joke, ever ready to give and take such even from a slave. A great common sense man, by strict attention to men and things, and general observation, had become a philosopher among his fellows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Quite happy to meet you, Judge, in these parts!” greeted Franks. “Wonder you could find your way so far south, especially at such a period, these being election times!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't matter a bit, as he's not up for anything I believe just now, except for Negro-trading! And in that he is quite a proselyte, and heretic to the teachings of his Northern faith!” jocosely remarked Armsted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 060.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't mistake me, gentlemen, because it was the incident of my life to be born in a nonslaveholding state. I'm certain that I am not at all understood as I should be on this question!” earnestly replied the Judge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The North has given you a bad name, Judge, and it's difficult to separate yourself now from it, holding the position that you do, as one of her ablest jurists,” said Armsted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, gentlemen!” seriously replied the Judge. “As regards my opinion of Negro slavery, the circumstances which brought me here, my large interest and responsibility in the slave-labor products of Cuba, should be, I think, sufficient evidence of my fidelity to Southern principles, to say nothing of my official records, which modesty should forbid my reference to.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, certainly, Judge! The Colonel is at fault. He has lost sight of the fact that you it was who seized the first runaway Negro by the throat and held him by the compromise grasp until we Southern gentlemen sent for him and had him brought back!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good, good, by hookie!” replied the Colonel, rubbing his hands together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope I'm understood, gentlemen!” seriously remarked the Judge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think so, Judge, I think so!” replied Armsted, evidently designing a full commitment on the part of the Judge. “And if not, a little explanation will set us right.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is true that I have not before been engaged in the slave trade, because until recently I had conscientious scruples about the thing — and I suppose I'm allowed the right of conscience as well as other folks,” smilingly said the Judge, “never having purchased but for peopling my own plantation. But a little sober reflection set me right on that point. It is plain that the right to buy implies the right to hold, also to sell; and if there be right in the one, there is in the other; the premise being right, the conclusion follows as a matter of course. I have therefore determined, not only to buy and hold, but buy and sell also. As I have heretofore been interested for the trade I will become interested in it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Capital, capital, by George! That's conclusive. Charles! A pitcher of cool water here; Judge, take another glass of brandy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good, very good!” said Armsted. “So far, but there is such a thing as feeding out of two cribs — present company, you know, and so — 925EAF. Page 061. ahem! — therefore we should like to hear the Judge's opinion of equality, what it means anyhow. I'm anxious to learn some of the doctrines of human rights, not knowing how soon I may be called upon to practice them, as I may yet marry some little Yankee girl, full of her Puritan notions. And I'm told an old bachelor `can't come it' up that way, except he has a `pocket full of rocks,' and can talk philanthropy like old Wilberforce.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here, gentlemen, I beg to make an episode, before replying to Major Armsted,” suggested the Judge. “His jest concerning the Yankee girl reminds me — and I hope it may not be amiss in saying so — that my lady is the daughter of a clergyman, brought up amidst the sand of New England, and I think I'll not have to go from the present company to prove her a good slaveholder. So the Major may see that we northerners are not all alike.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How about the Compromise measures, Judge? Stand up to the thing all through, and no flinching.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My opinion, sir, is a matter of record, being the first judge before whom a case was tested, which resulted in favor of the South. And I go further than this; I hold as a just construction of the law, that not only has the slaveholder a right to reclaim his slave when and wherever found, but by its provision every free black in the country, North and South, are liable to enslavement by any white person. They are freemen by sufferance or slaves-at-large, whom any white person may claim at discretion. It was a just decision of the Supreme Court — though I was in advance of it by action — that persons of African descent have no rights that white men are bound to respect!” [5]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Judge Ballard, with this explanation, I am satisfied; indeed as a Southern man I would say, that you've conceded all that I could ask, and more than we expected. But this is a legal disquisition; what is your private opinion respecting the justice of the measures?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think them right, sir, according to our system of government.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But how will you get away from your representative system, Judge? In this your blacks are either voters, or reckoned among the inhabitants.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, sir, they stand in the same relation as your Negroes. In some of the states they are permitted to vote, but can't be voted for, and this leaves them without any political rights at all. Suffrage, sir, is one thing, franchisement another; the one a mere privilege — a thing 925EAF. Page 062. permitted — the other a right inherent, that which is inviolable — cannot be interfered with. And my good sir, enumeration is a national measure, for which we are not sectionally responsible.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Judge, I'm compelled to admit that you are a very good Southerner; upon the whole, you are severe upon the Negroes; you seem to allow them no chance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I like Negroes well enough in their place!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can you reconcile yourself to the state of things in Cuba, where the blacks enter largely into the social system?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't like it at all, and never could become reconciled to the state of things there. I consider that colony as it now stands, a moral pestilence, a blighting curse, and it is useless to endeavor to disguise the fact; Cuba must cease to be a Spanish colony, and become American territory. Those mongrel Creoles are incapable of self-government , and should be compelled to submit to the United States.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Judge, admit the latter part of that, as I rather guess we are all of the same way of thinking — how do you manage to get on with society when you are there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I cannot for a moment tolerate it! One of the hateful customs of the place is that you must exchange civilities with whomsoever solicits it, consequently, the most stupid and ugly Negro you meet in the street may ask for a `light' from your cigar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know it, and I invariably comply with the request. How do you act in such cases?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I invariably comply, but as invariably throw away my cigar! If this were all, it would not be so bad, then the idea of meeting Negroes and mulattoes at the levees of the Captain General is intolerable! It will never do to permit this state of things so near our own shores.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why throw away the cigar, Judge? What objection could there be to it because a negro took a light from it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because they are certain to take hold of it with their black fingers!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just as I've always heard, Judge Ballard. You Northerners are a great deal more fastidious about Negroes than we of the South, and you'll pardon me if I add, `more nice than wise,' to use a homily. Did ever it occur to you that black fingers made that cigar, before it entered your white lips! — all tobacco preparations being worked by 925EAF. Page 063. Negro hands in Cuba — and very frequently in closing up the wrapper, they draw it through their lips to give it tenacity.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The deuce! Is that a fact, Major!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does that surprise you, Judge? I'm sure the victuals you eat is cooked by black hands, the bread kneaded and made by black hands, and the sugar and molasses you use, all pass through black hands, or rather the hands of Negroes pass through them; at least you could not refrain from thinking so, had you seen them as I have frequently, with arms full length immersed in molasses.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Major, truly there are some things we are obliged to swallow, and I suppose these are among them.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Though a Judge, Your Honor, you perceive that there are some things you have not learned.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True, Major, true; and I like the Negro well enough in his place, but there is a disposition peculiar to the race, to shove themselves into the notice of the whites.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not peculiar to them, Judge, but common to mankind. The black man desires association with the white, because the latter is regarded his superior. In the South it is the poor white man with the wealthy, and in Europe the common with the gentlefolks. In the North you have not made these distinctions among the whites, which prevents you from noticing this trait among yourselves.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me, Major, as you seem so well to understand them, why a Negro swells so soon into importance?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Simply because he's just like you, Judge, and I! It is simply a manifestation of human nature in an humble position, the same as that developed in the breast of a conqueror. Our strictures are not just on this unfortunate race, as we condemn in them that which we approve in ourselves. Southerner as I am, I can joke with a slave just because he is a man; some of them indeed, fine warmhearted fellows, and intelligent, as was the Colonel's Henry.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't swallow that, Major! Joking with a Negro is rather too large a dose for me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me give you an idea of my feeling about these things: I have on my place two good-natured black fellows, full of pranks and jokes — Bob and Jef. Passing along one morning Jef was approaching me, when just as we met and I was about to give him the time of day, he made a sudden halt, placing himself in the attitude of a pugilist, 925EAF. Page 064. grasping the muscle of his left arm, looking me full in the eyes exclaimed, `Maus Army, my arm aches for you!' when stepping aside he gave the path for me to pass by.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you not rebuke him for the impudence?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I laid my hand upon his shoulders as we passed, and gave him a laugh instead. At another time, passing along in company, Bob was righting up a section of fence, when Jef came along. `How is yeh, Jef?' saluted Bob, without a response. Supposing he had not seen me, I halloed out: `How are you Jef!' but to this, he made no reply. A gentleman in company with me who enjoyed the joke, said: `Why Jef, you appear to be above speaking to your old friends!' Throwing his head slightly down with a rocking motion in his walk, elongating his mouth after the manner of a sausage — which by the way needed no improvement in that direction — in a tone of importance still looking down he exclaimed, `I totes a meat!' He had indeed, a fine gammon on his shoulder from which that evening, he doubtless intended a good supper with his wife, which made him feel important, just as Judge Ballard feels, when he receives the news that `sugar is up,' and contemplates large profits from his crop of that season.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll be plagued, Major, if your love of the ludicrous don't induce you to give the freest possible license to your Negroes! I wonder they respect you!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One thing, Judge, I have learned by my intercourse with men, that pleasantry is the life and soul of the social system; and good treatment begets more labor from the slave than bad. A smile from the master is better than cross looks, and one crack of a joke with him is worth a hundred cracks of the whip. Only confide in him, and let him be satisfied that you respect him as a man, he'll work himself to death to prove his worthiness.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“After all, Major, you still hold them as slaves, though you claim for them the common rights of other people!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly! And I would just as readily hold a white as a black in slavery, were it the custom and policy of the country to do so. It is all a matter of self-interest with me; and though I am morally opposed to slavery, yet while the thing exists, I may as well profit by it, as others.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Major,” concluded the Judge, “let us drop the subject, and I 925EAF. Page 065. hope that the free interchange of opinion will prove no detriment to our future prospects and continued friendship.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not at all, sir, not at all!” concluded the Major with a smile.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 16 Solicitude and Amusement</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Franks sought the earliest opportunity for an interview with the Major concerning her favorite, Maggie. The children now missed her, little George[6] continued fretful, and her own troubled soul was pressed with anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On conversing with the Major, to her great surprise she learned that the maid had been sold to a stranger, which intelligence he received from Mrs. Ballard herself, whom he met on the quay as he left Havana. The purchaser was a planter formerly of Louisiana, a bachelor by the name of Peter Labonier. This person resided twelve miles from Havana, the proprietor of a sugar estate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The apprehension of Mrs. Franks, on learning these facts, were aroused to a point of fearful anxiety. These fears were mitigated by the probable chance, in her favor by a change of owners, as his first day's possession of her, turned him entirely against her. He would thus most probably part with her, which favored the desires of Mrs. Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She urged upon the Major as a favor to herself, to procure the release of Maggie, by his purchase and enfranchisement with free papers of unconditional emancipation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this Major Armsted gave the fullest assurance, at the earliest possible opportunity. The company were to meet at no distant day, when he hoped to execute the orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you leave cousin Arabella, Judge?” enquired Mrs. Franks, as he and the Colonel entered the parlor directly from the back porch, where they had been engaged for the last two hours in close conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, Maria, when last heard from; a letter reaching me just before I left by the kindness of our mutual friend the Major. By the way, your girl and she did not get on so well, I be — — !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 066.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An admonitory look from Franks arrested the subject before the sentence was completed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every reference to the subject was carefully avoided, though the Colonel ventured to declare that henceforth towards his servants, instead of leniency, he intended severity. They were becoming every day more and more troublesome, and less reliable. He intended, in the language of his friend the Judge, to “lay upon them a heavy hand” in future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know your sentiments on this point,” he said in reply to an admonition from Armsted, “and I used to entertain the same views, but experience has taught me better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall not argue the point Colonel, but let you have your own way!” replied Armsted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Judge, as you wish to become a Southerner; you must first `see the sights,' as children say, and learn to get used to them. I wish you to ride out with me to Captain Grason's, and you'll see some rare sport; the most amusing thing I ever witnessed,” suggested Franks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it?” enquired the Major.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The effect is lost by previous knowledge of the thing,” replied he. “This will suit you, Armsted, as you're fond of Negro jokes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, Colonel, let's be off,” urged the Major.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Off it is!” replied Franks, as he invited the gentlemen to take a seat in the carriage already at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Halloo, halloo, here you are, Colonel! Why Major Armsted, old fellow, 'pon my word!” saluted Grason, grasping Armsted by the hand as they entered the porch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Judge Ballard, sir,” said Armsted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just in time for dinner, gentlemen! Be seated,” invited he, holding the Judge by the hand. “Welcome to Mississippi, Sir! What's up, gentlemen?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We've come out to witness some rare sport the Colonel has been telling us about,” replied the Major.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Blamed if I don't think the Colonel will have me advertised as a showman presently! I've got a queer animal here; I'll show him to you after dinner,” rejoined Grason. “Gentlemen, help yourself to brandy and water.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dinner over, the gentlemen walked into the pleasure grounds, in the rear of the mansion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 067.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nelse, where is Rube? Call him!” said Grason to a slave lad, brother to the boy he sent for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shortly there came forward, a small black boy about eleven years of age, thin visage, projecting upper teeth, rather ghastly consumptive look, and emaciated condition. The child trembled with fear as he approached the group.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now gentlemen,” said Grason, “I'm going to show you a sight!” having in his hand a long whip, the cracking of which he commenced, as a ringmaster in the circus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The child gave him a look never to be forgotten; a look beseeching mercy and compassion. But the decree was made, and though humanity quailed in dejected supplication before him, the command was imperative, with no living hand to stay the pending consequences. He must submit to his fate, and pass through the ordeal of training.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat maus gwine do wid me now? I know wat maus gwine do,” said this miserable child, “he gwine make me see sights!” when going down on his hands and feet, he commenced trotting around like an animal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now gentlemen, look!” said Grason. “He'll whistle, sing songs, hymns, pray, swear like a trooper, laugh, and cry, all under the same state of feelings.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a peculiar swing of the whip, bringing the lash down upon a certain spot on the exposed skin, the whole person being prepared for the purpose, the boy commenced to whistle almost like a thrush; another cut changed it to a song, another to a hymn, then a pitiful prayer, when he gave utterance to oaths which would make a Christian shudder, after which he laughed outright; then from the fullness of his soul he cried:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O maussa, I's sick! Please stop little!” casting up gobs of hemorrhage.*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Franks stood looking on with unmoved muscles. Armsted stood aside whittling a stick; but when Ballard saw, at every cut the flesh turn open in gashes streaming down with gore, till at last in agony he appealed for mercy, he involuntarily found his hand with a grasp on the whip, arresting its further application.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not quite a Southerner yet Judge, if you can't stand that!” said Franks on seeing him wiping away the tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 068.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gentlemen, help yourself to brandy and water. The little Negro don't stand it nigh so well as formerly. He used to be a trump!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Colonel,” said the Judge, “as I have to leave for Jackson this evening, I suggest that we return to the city.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The company now left Grason's, Franks for the enjoyment of home, Ballard and Armsted for Jackson, and the poor boy Reuben, from hemorrhage of the lungs, that evening left time for eternity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* This is a true Mississippi scene.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 17 Henry at Large</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On leaving the plantation carrying them hanging upon his arm, thrown across his shoulders, and in his hands Henry had a bridle, halter, blanket, girt, and horsewhip, the emblems of a faithful servant in discharge of his master's business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By shrewdness and discretion — such was his management as he passed along — that he could tell the name of each place and proprietor long before he reached them. Being a scholar, he carefully kept a record of the plantations he had passed, that when accosted by a white, as an overseer or patrol, he invariably pretended to belong to a back estate, in search of his master's racehorse. If crossing a field, he was taking a near cut; but if met in a wood, the animal was in the forest, as being a great leaper no fence could debar him, though the forest was fenced and posted. The blanket, a substitute for a saddle, was in reality carried for a bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With speed unfaltering and spirits unflinching, his first great strive was to reach the Red River, to escape from his own state as quickly as possible. Proceeding on in the direction of the Red River country, he met with no obstruction except in one instance, when he left his assailant quietly upon the earth. A few days after an inquest was held upon the body of a deceased overseer — verdict of the Jury, “By hands unknown.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On approaching the river, after crossing a number of streams, as the Yazoo, Ouchita, and such, he was brought to sad reflections. A dread came over him, difficulties lay before him, dangers stood staring him in the face at every step he took. Here for the first time since his 925EAF. Page 069. maturity of manhood responsibilities rose up in a shape of which he had no conception. A mighty undertaking, such as had never before been ventured upon, and the duty devolving upon him, was too much for a slave with no other aid than the aspirations of his soul panting for liberty. Reflecting upon the peaceful hours he once enjoyed as a professing Christian, and the distance which slavery had driven him from its peaceful portals, here in the wilderness, determining to renew his faith and dependence upon Divine aid, when falling upon his knees he opened his heart to God, as a tenement of the Holy Spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Arm of the Lord, awake! Renew my faith, confirm my hope, perfect me in love. Give strength, give courage, guide and protect my pathway, and direct me in my course!” Springing to his feet as if a weight had fallen from him, he stood up a new man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The river is narrow, the water red as if colored by iron rust, the channel winding. Beyond this river lie his hopes, the broad plains of Louisiana with a hundred thousand bondsmen seeming anxiously to await him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Standing upon a high bank of the stream, contemplating his mission, a feeling of humbleness and a sensibility of unworthiness impressed him, and that religious sentiment which once gave comfort to his soul now inspiring anew his breast, Henry raised in solemn tones amidst the lonely wilderness:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Could I but climb where Moses stood, And view the landscape o'er; Not Jordan's streams, nor death's cold flood, Could drive me from the shore!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the right of where he stood was a cove, formed by the washing of the stream at high water, which ran quite into the thicket, into which the sun shone through a space among the high trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While thus standing and contemplating his position, the water being too deep to wade, and on account of numerous sharks and alligators, too dangerous to swim, his attention was attracted by the sound of a steamer coming up the channel. Running into the cove to shield himself, a singular noise disturbed him, when to his terror he found himself amidst a squad of huge alligators, which sought the advantages of the sunshine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 070.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His first impulse was to surrender himself to his fate and be devoured, as in the rear and either side the bank was perpendicular, escape being impossible except by the way he entered, to do which would have exposed him to the view of the boat, which could not have been avoided. Meantime the frightful animals were crawling over and among each other, at a fearful rate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seizing the fragment of a limb which lay in the cove, beating upon the ground and yelling like a madman, giving them all possible space, the beasts were frightened at such a rate, that they reached the water in less time than Henry reached the bank. Receding into the forest, he thus escaped the observation of the passing steamer, his escape serving to strengthen his fate in a renewed determination of spiritual dependence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While gazing upon the stream in solemn reflection for Divine aid to direct him, logs came floating down, which suggested a proximity to the raft with which sections of that stream is filled, when going but a short distance up, he crossed in safety to the Louisiana side. His faith was now fully established, and thenceforth, Henry was full of hope and confident of success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reaching Alexandria with no obstruction, his first secret meeting was held in the hut of aunt Dilly. Here he found them all ready for an issue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An dis you, chile?” said the old woman, stooping with age, sitting on a low stool in the chimney corner. “Dis many day, I heahn on yeh!” though Henry had just entered on his mission. From Alexandria he passed rapidly on to Latuer's, making no immediate stops, prefering to organize at the more prominent places.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is a mulatto planter, said to have come from the isle of Guadaloupe. Riding down the road upon a pony at a quick gallop was a mulatto youth, a son of the planter, an old black man on foot keeping close to the horse's heels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whose boy are you?” enquired the young mulatto, who had just dismounted, the old servant holding his pony.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm in search of master's race horse.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is your name?” further enquired the young mulatto.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gilbert, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you want?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am hungry, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 071.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dolly,” said he to an old black woman at the woodpile, “show this man into the Negro quarter, and give him something to eat; give him a cup of milk. Do you like milk, my man?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, I have no choice when hungry; anything will do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da is none heah but claubah, maus Eugene,” replied the old cook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Give him that,” said the young master. “You people like that kind of stuff I believe; our Negroes like it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir,” replied Henry when the lad left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God knows 'e needn' talk 'bout wat we po' black folks eat, case da don' ghin us nothin' else but dat an' caun bread,” muttered the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't they treat you well, aunty?” enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God on'y knows, my chile, wat we suffeh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who was that old man who ran behind your master's horse?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat Nathan, my husban'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do they treat him well, aunty?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, chile, wus an' any dog, da beat 'im foh little an nothin'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is uncle Nathan religious?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile, ole man an' I's been sahvin' God dis many day, fo yeh baun! Wen any one on 'em in de house git sick, den da sen foh `uncle Nathan' come pray foh dem; `uncle Nathan' mighty good den!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know that the Latuers are colored people?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile; God bless yeh soul yes! Case huh mammy ony dead two-three yehs, an' she black as me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did they treat her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not berry well; she nus da childen; an eat in a house arter all done.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did Latuer's children call her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da call huh `mammy' same like wite folks childen call de nus.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you tell me, aunty, why they treat you people so badly, knowing themselves to be colored, and some of the slaves related to them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God bless yeh, hunny, de wite folks, dese plantehs make 'em so; da run heah, an' tell 'em da mus'n treat deh niggers well, case da spile 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do the white planters frequently visit here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, hunny, yes, da heah some on 'em all de time eatin' an' drinkin' long wid de old man; da on'y tryin' git wat little 'e got, dat 925EAF. Page 072. all! Da 'tend to be great frien' de ole man; but laws a massy, hunny, I doh mine dese wite folks no how!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does your master ever go to their houses and eat with them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile, some time 'e go, but den half on 'em got nothin' fit to eat; da hab fat poke an' bean, caun cake an' sich like, dat all da got, some on 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does Mr. Latuer give them better at his table?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laws, hunny, yes; yes'n deed, chile! 'E got mutton — some time whole sheep mos' — fowl, pig, an' ebery tum ting a nuddeh, 'e got so much ting dah, I haudly know wat cook fus.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do the white planters associate with the family of Latuer?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One on 'em, ten 'e coatin de dahta; I don't recon 'e gwine hab heh. Da cah fool long wid 'Toyeh's gals dat way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whose girls, Metoyers?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you mean the wealthy planters of that name?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat same, chile.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I want to understand you; you don't mean to say that they are colored people?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, hunny, yes; da good culed folks anybody. Some five-six boys' an five-six gals on 'em; da all rich.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do they treat their slaves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da boys all mighty haud maustas, de gals all mighty good; sahvants all like 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You seem to understand these people very well, aunty. Now please tell me what kind of masters there are generally in the Red River country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Haud 'nough, chile, haud 'nough, God on'y knows!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do the colored masters treat theirs generally worse than the whites?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, hunny, 'bout da same.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's just what I want to know. What are the usual allowances for slaves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da 'low de fiel' han' two suit a yeah; foh umin one long linen coat,* make suit; an' foh man, pantaloon an' jacket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How about eating?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Half-peck meal ah day foh family uh fo!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 073.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What about weekly privileges? Do you have Saturday to yourselves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laud, honny, no! No, chile, no! Da do'n 'low us no time, 'tall. Da 'low us ebery uddeh Sunday wash ouh close; dat all de time we git.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you don't get to sell anything for yourselves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, hunny, no. Da don' 'low pig, chicken, tucky, goose, bean, pea, tateh, nothin' else.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, aunty. I'm glad to meet you, and as evening's drawing nigh, I must see your husband a little, then go.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God bless yeh, chile, whah ebeh yeh go! Yeh ain' arteh no racehos, dat yeh ain't.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You got something to eat, my man, did you?” enquired the lad Eugene, at the conclusion of his interview with uncle Nathan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I did, sir, and feasted well!” replied Henry in conclusion. “Good bye!” and he left for the next plantation suited to his objects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God bless de baby!” said old aunt Dolly as uncle Nathan entered the hut, referring to Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, chile!” replied the old man with tears in his eyes; “my yeahs has heahn dis day!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* Coat — a term used by slaves for frock.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 18 Fleeting Shadows</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In high spirits Henry left the plantation of Latuer, after sowing seeds from which in due season, he anticipated an abundant harvest. He found the old man Nathan all that could be desired, and equal to the task of propagating the scheme. His soul swelled with exultation on receiving the tidings, declaring that though nearly eighty years of age, he never felt before an implied meaning, in the promise of the Lord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now Laud!” with uplifted hand exclaimed he at the conclusion of the interview. “My eyes has seen, and meh yeahs heahn, an' now Laud! I's willin' to stan' still an' see dy salvation!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On went Henry to Metoyers, visiting the places of four brothers, having taken those of the white planters intervening, all without detection or suspicion of being a stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stopping among the people of Colonel Hopkins at Grantico summit, here as at Latuer's and all intermediate places, he found the people 925EAF. Page 074. patiently looking for a promised redemption. Here a pet female slave, Silva, espied him and gave the alarm that a strange black was lurking among the Negro quarters, which compelled him to retirement sooner than intended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the people of Dickson at Pine Bluff, he found the best of spirits. There was Newman, a young slave man born without arms, who was ready any moment for a strike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How could you fight?” said Henry. “You have no arms!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am compelled to pick with my toes, a hundred pound of cotton a day,* and I can sit on a stool and touch off a cannon!” said this promising young man whose heart panted with an unsuppressed throb for liberty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Heeley's, Harrison's, and Hickman's slaves were fearfully and pitiably dejected. Much effort was required to effect a seclusion, and more to stimulate them to action. The continual dread “that maus wont let us!” seemed as immovably fixed as the words were constantly repeated; and it was not until an occasion for another subject of inquest, in the person of a pest of an old black slave man, that an organization was effected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Approaching Crane's on Little River, the slaves were returning from the field to the gin. Many — being females, some of whom were very handsome — had just emptied their baskets. So little clothing had they, and so loosely hung the tattered fragments about them, that they covered themselves behind the large empty baskets tilted over on the side, to shield their person from exposure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The overseer engaged in another direction, the master absent, and the family at the great house, a good opportunity presented for an inspection of affairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you do, young woman?” saluted Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How de do, sir!” replied a sprightly, comely young mulatto girl, who stood behind her basket with not three yards of cloth in the tattered relic of the only garment she had on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who owns this place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Crane, sir,” she politely replied with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How many slaves has he?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don'o, some say five 'a six hunded.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do they all work on this place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 075.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, he got two-three places.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How many on this place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oveh a hundred an' fifty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What allowances have you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What! no Saturday to yourselves?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They allow you Sundays, I suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, we work all day ev'ry Sunday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How late do you work?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Till we can' see to pick no mo' cotton; but w'en its moon light we pick till ten o'clock at night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What time do you get to wash your clothes?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None, sir; da on'y 'low us one suit ev'ry New Yehs day,* an' us gals take it off every Satady night aftah de men all gone to bed and wash it fah Sunday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why do you want clean clothes on Sunday, if you have to work on that day?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's de Laud's day, an' we wa to be clean, and we feel betteh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do the men do for clean clothes?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We wash de men's clothes afteh da go to bed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And you say you are only allowed one suit a year? Now, young woman, I don't know your name but — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nancy, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Nancy, speak plainly, and dont be backward; what does your one suit consist of?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A frock, sir, made out er coarse tow linen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Only one piece, and no underclothes at all?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's all, sir!” replied she modestly looking down and drawing the basket, which sufficiently screened her, still closer to her person.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is that which you have on a sample of the goods your clothes are made of?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, dis is da kine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would like to see some other of your girls.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, sir, I go call Susan!” when, gathering up and drawing around and before her a surplus of the back section, the only remaining sound remnant of the narrow tattered garment that she wore, off she ran 925EAF. Page 076. behind the gin, where lay in the sun, a number of girls to rest themselves during their hour of “spell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Susan!” she exclaimed rather loudly. “I do'n want you gals!” she pleasantly admonished, as the whole twelve or fifteen rose from their resting place, and came hurriedly around the building, Nancy and Susan in the lead. They instinctively as did Nancy, drew their garments around and about them, on coming in sight of the stranger. Standing on the outside of the fence, Henry politely bowed as they approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dis is Susan, sir!” said Nancy, introducing her friend with bland simplicity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How de do, sir!” saluted she, a modest and intelligent, very pretty young black girl, of good address.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Susan!” replied Henry. “I don't want anything but to see you girls; but I will ask you this question: how many suits of clothes do they give you a year?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How many pieces make a suit?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jus' one frock,” and they simultaneously commenced drawing still closer before, the remnant of coarse garment, which hung in tatters about them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't you have shoes and stockings in winter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We no call foh shoes, case 'taint cole much; on'y some time little fros'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How late in the evening do you work?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da fiel' han's dah,” pointing to those returning to the field, “da work till bedtime, but we gals heah, we work in de gin, and spell each other ev'ey twelve ouahs.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're at leisure now; who fills your places?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nutha set a' han's go to work, fo' you come.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much cotton do they pick for a task?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Each one mus' pick big basket full, an' fetch it in f'om da fiel' to de gin, else da git thirty lashes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much must the women pick as a task?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“De same as de men.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That can't be possible!” said Henry, looking over the fence down upon their baskets. “How much do they hold?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I dis membeh sir, but good 'eal.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 077.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see on each basket marked 225 pounds; is that the quantity they hold?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, dat's it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All mus' be in gin certain ouah else da git whipped; sometime de men help 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can they do this when they have their own to carry?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da put derse on de head, an' ketch holt one side de women basket. Sometimes they leave part in de fiel', an' go back afteh it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you get plenty to eat?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, da feeds us po'ly; sometime, we do'n have mo'n half nough!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you girls ever work in the field?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O yes, sir! all uv us, on'y we wan't strong nough to fetch in ouh cotton, den da put us in de gin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where would you rather; in the gin or in the field?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If 'twant foh carryin' cotton, we'a rather work in de fiel'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why so, girls?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Case den da would'n be so many ole wite plantehs come an' look at us, like we was show!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who sees that the tasks are all done in the field?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da Driveh.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he a white man?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No sir, black.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he a free man?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, slave.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you no white overseer?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, Mr. Dorman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where is Dorman when you are at work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He out at de fiel too.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is he doing there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He watch Jesse, da drivah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is Jesse a pretty good fellow?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, he treat black folks like dog, he all de time beat 'em, when da no call to do it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did he treat you girls when you worked in the field?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He beat us if we jist git little behind de rest in pickin'! Da wite folks make 'im bad.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Point him out to me and after tonight, he'll never whip another.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 078.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, girls, I see that you are smart intelligent young women, and I want you to tell me why it is, that your master keeps you all here at work in the gin, when he could get high prices for you, and supply your places with common cheap hands at half the money?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Case we gals won' go! Da been mo'n a dozen plantehs heah lookin' at us, an' want to buy us foh house keepehs, an' we wont go; we die fus!” said Susan with a shudder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” repeated Nancy, with equal emotion, “we die fus!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can you prevent it, girls; won't your master sell you against your will?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, he would, but da plantehs da don't want us widout we willin' to go.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see! Well girls, I believe I'm done with you; but before leaving let me ask you, is there among your men, a real clever good trusty man? I don't care either old or young, though I prefer an old or middle-aged man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O yes, sir,” replied Nancy, “da is some mong 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Give me the name of one,” said Henry, at which request Nancy and Susan looked hesitatingly at each other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't be backward,” admonished he, “as I shan't make a bad use of it.” But still they hesitated, when after another admonition Nancy said, “Dare's uncle Joe — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, uncle Moses, uncle Moses!” in a suppressed tone interrupted the other girls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who is uncle Moses?” enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He' my fatha,” replied Susan, “an — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My uncle!” interrupted Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you two are cousins?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, huh fatha an my motha is brotha an sisteh,” replied Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he a religious man, girls?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, he used to preach but'e do'n preach now,” explained Susan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Case da 'ligions people wo'n heah im now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who, colored people?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 079.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When did they stop hearing him preach?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good while ago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where at?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Down in da bush meetin', at da Baptism.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He's a Baptist then — what did he do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again became Susan and Nancy more perplexed than before, the other girls in this instance failing to come to their relief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did he do girls? Let me know it quick, as I must be off!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da say — da say — I do'n want tell you!” replied Susan hesitating, with much feeling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it girls, can't some of you tell me?” earnestly enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da say befo' 'e come heah way down in Fagina, he kill a man, ole po' wite ovehseeah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is that it, girls?” enquired he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir!” they simultaneously replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then he's the very man I want to see!” said Henry. “Now don't forget what I say to you; tell him that a man will meet him tonight below here on the river side, just where the carcass of an ox lies in the verge of the thicket. Tell him to listen and when I'm ready, I'll give the signal of a runaway — the screech of the panther* — when he must immediately obey the summons. One word more, and I'll leave you. Every one of you as you have so praiseworthily concluded, die before surrendering to such base purposes as that for which this man who holds you wishes to dispose of you. Girls, you will see me no more. Fare — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yo' name sir, yo' name!” they all exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My name is — Farewell, girls, farewell!” — — when Henry darted in the thickest of the forest, leaving the squad of young maiden slaves in a state of bewildering inquiry concerning the singular black man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Jesse the driver was missed, and never after heard of. On inquiry being made of the old man Moses concerning the stranger, all that could be elicited was, “Stan' still child'en, and see da salvation uv da Laud!”</field>

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 19 Come What Will</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving the plantation of Crane with high hopes and great confidence in the integrity of uncle Moses and the maiden gang of cotton girls, Henry turned his course in a retrograde direction so as again to take the stream of Red River, Little River, where he then was, being but a branch of that water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just below its confluence with the larger stream, at the moment when he reached the junction, a steam cotton trader hove in view. There was no alternative but to stand like a freeman, or suddenly escape into the forest, thus creating suspicions and fears, as but a few days previous a French planter of the neighborhood lost a desperate slave, who became a terror to the country around. The master was compelled to go continually armed, as also other white neighbors, and all were afraid after nightfall to pass out the threshold of their own doors. Permission was given to every white man to shoot him if ever seen within rifle shot, which facts having learned the evening before, Henry was armed with this precaution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His dress being that of a racegroom — small leather cap with long front piece, neat fitting roundabout, high boots drawn over the pantaloon legs, with blanket, girth, halter, whip and bridle — Henry stood upon the shore awaiting the vessel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well boy!” hailed the captain as the line was thrown out, which he caught, making fast at the root of a tree. “Do you wish to come aboard?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good man!” approvingly cried the mate, at the expert manner which he caught the line and tied the sailor knot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you ever steamboated, my man?” continued the captain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On the Upper and Lower Mississippi, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whom do you know as masters of steamers on the Upper Mississippi?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Captains Thogmorton, Price, Swan, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, stop! That'll do,” interrupted the captain, “you know the master of every steamer in the trade, I believe. Now who in the Lower trade?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 081.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Captains Scott, Hart, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's Captain Hart's Christian name?” interrupted the captain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jesse, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That'll do, by George you know everybody! Do you want to ship?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are you doing here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm hunting master's stray racehorse.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your master's race horse! Are you a slave boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you come to be on the Mississippi River?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hired my time, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, yes, boy, I see!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who is your master?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Colonel Sheldon; I used to belong to Major Gilmore.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you the boy Nepp, the great horse trainer the Major used to own?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, I'm his son.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you as good at training horses as the old chap?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They call me better, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you're worth your weight in gold. Will your master sell you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did your horse come to get away?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He was bought from the Major by Colonel Sheldon to run at the great Green Wood Races, Texas, and while training he managed to get away, leaping the fences, and taking to the forest.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you're Major Tom's race rider Gilbert! You're a valuable boy; I wonder the Major parted with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bell having rung for dinner, the captain left, Henry going to the deck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among those on deck was a bright mulatto young man, who immediately recognized Henry as having seen him on the Upper Mississippi, he being a free man. On going up to him, Henry observed that he was laden with heavy manacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have I not seen you somewhere before?” enquired he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; my name is Lewis Grimes, you saw me on the Upper Mississippi,” replied the young man. “Your name is Henry Holland!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 082.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What have you been doing?” enquired Henry, on seeing the handcuffs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothing at all!” replied he with eyes flashing resentment and suffused with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What does this mean?” continued he, pointing at the handcuffs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am stolen and now being taken to Texas, where I am to be enslaved for life!” replied Lewis sobbing aloud.[7]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who did this vile deed?” continued Henry in a low tone of voice, pressing his lips to suppress his feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One Dr. Johns of Texas, now a passenger on this boat!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was that the person who placed a glass to your lips which you refused, just as I came aboard?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that's the man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why don't you leave him instantly?” said Henry, his breast heaving with emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because he always handcuffs me before the boat lands, keeping me so during the time she lies ashore.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why don't you jump overboard when the boat is under way?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because he guards me with a heavy loaded rifle, and I can't get a chance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He `guards' you! `You can't get a chance!' Are there no nights, and does he never sleep?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, but he makes me sleep in the stateroom with him, keeping his rifle at his bedside.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you never awake when he's asleep?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Often, but I'm afraid to stir lest he wakens.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well don't you submit, die first if thereby you must take another into eternity with you! Were it my case and he ever went to sleep where I was, he'd never waken in this world!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I never thought of that before, I shall take your advice the first opportunity. Good-bye sir!” hastily said the young man, as the bell tapped a signal to start, and Henry stepped on shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let go that line!” sternly commanded the captain, Henry obeying orders on the shore, when the boat glided steadily up the stream, seemingly in unison with the lively though rude and sorrowful song of the black firemen — I'm a-goin' to Texas — O! O-O-O! I'm a-goin' to Texas — O! O-O-O!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 083.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having in consequence of the scarcity of spring houses and larders along his way in so level and thinly settled country, Henry took in his pouch from the cook of the boat an ample supply of provisions for the suceeding four or five days. Thus provided for, standing upon the bank for a few minutes, with steady gaze listening to the sad song of his oppressed brethren as they left the spot, and reflecting still more on the miserable fate of the young mulatto freeman Lewis Grimes held by the slave-holder Dr. Johns of Texas, he, with renewed energy, determined that nothing short of an interference by Divine Providence should stop his plans and progress. In soliloquy said Henry, “Yes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If every foe stood martialed in the van, I'd fight them single combat, man to man!” and again he started with a manly will, as fixed and determined in his purpose as though no obstructions lay in his pathway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From plantation to plantation did he go, sowing the seeds of future devastation and ruin to the master and redemption to the slave, an antecedent more terrible in its anticipation than the warning voice of the destroying Angel in commanding the slaughter of the firstborn of Egypt. Himself careworn, distressed and hungry, who just being supplied with nourishment for the system, Henry went forth a welcome messenger, casting his bread upon the turbid waters of oppression, in hopes of finding it after many days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holding but one seclusion on each plantation, his progress was consequently very rapid, in whatever direction he went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a bold stride from Louisiana, he went into Texas. Here he soon met with the man of his wishes. This presented in the person of Sampson, on the cotton place of proprietor Richardson. The master here, though represented wealthy, with an accomplished and handsome young daughter, was a silly, stupid old dolt, an inordinate blabber and wine bibber. The number of his slaves was said to be great and he the owner of three plantations, one in Alabama, and the others in Texas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sampson was a black, tall, stoutly built, and manly, possessing much general intelligence, and a good-looking person. His wife a neat, intelligent, handsome little woman, the complexion of himself, was the mother of a most interesting family of five pretty children, three boys 925EAF. Page 084. and two girls. This family entered at once into the soul of his mission, seeming to have anticipated it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With an amply supply of means,* buried in a convenient well-marked spot, he only awaited a favorable opportunity to effect his escape from slavery. With what anxiety did that wife gaze smilingly in his face, and a boy and girl cling tightly each to a knee, as this husband and father in whispers recounted his plans and determination of carrying them out. The scheme of Henry was at once committed to his confidence, and he requested to impart them wherever he went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richardson was a sportsman and Sampson his body servant, they traveled through every part of the country, thus affording the greatest opportunity for propagating the measures of the secret organization. From Portland in Maine to Galveston in Texas, Sampson was as familiar as a civil engineer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sampson, Sampson, stand by me! Stand by me, my man; stand at your master's back!” was the language of this sottish old imbecile he kept continually reveling at a gambling table, and who from excessive fatigue would sometimes squat or sit down upon the floor behind him. “Sampson, Sampson! are you there? Stand by your master, Sampson!” again would he exclaim, so soon as the tall commanding form of his black protector was missed from his sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sampson and his wife were both pious people, believing much in the Providence of God, he, as he said having recently had it “shown to” him — meaning a presentiment — that a messenger would come to him and reveal the plan of deliverance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad to see that you have money,” said Henry, “you are thereby well qualified for your mission. With money you may effect your escape almost at any time. Your most difficult point is an elevated obstruction, a mighty hill, a mountain; but through that hill there is a gap, and money is your passport through that White Gap to freedom. Mark that! It is the great range of White mountains and White river which are before you, and the White Gap that you must pass through to reach the haven of safety. Money alone will carry you through the White mountains or across the White river to liberty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Brother, my eyes is open, and my way clear!” responded Sampson to this advice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 085.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then,” said Henry, “you are ready to `rise and shine' for — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My light has come! — ” interrupted Sampson. “But — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The glory of God is not yet shed abroad!”* concluded Henry, who fell upon Sampson's neck with tears of joy in meeting unexpectedly one of his race so intelligent in that region of country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sampson and wife Dursie, taking Henry by the hand wept aloud, looking upon him as the messenger of deliverance foreshown to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Kneeling down a fervent prayer was offered by Sampson for Henry's protection by the way, and final success in his “mighty plans,” with many Amens and “God grants,” by Dursie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Partaking of a sumptuous fare on 'ash cake and sweet milk — a dainty diet with many slaves — and bidding with a trembling voice and tearful eye a final “Farewell!” in six hours he had left the state of Texas to the consequences of a deep-laid scheme for a terrible insurrection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* This person had really $2,000 in gold, securely hid away unknown to any person but his wife, until showing it to the writer. A real incident which took place between a slave and a free black adviser.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 20 Advent Among the Indians</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Texas Henry went into the Indian Nation near Fort Towson, Arkansas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Make yourself at home, sir,” invited Mr. Culver, the intelligent old Chief of the United Nation, “and Josephus will attend to you,” referring to his nephew Josephus Braser, an educated young chief and counselor among his people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are slaveholders, I see, Mr. Culver!” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We are, sir, but not like the white men,” he replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How many do you hold?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“About two hundred on my two plantations.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't well understand how a man like you can reconcile your principles with the holding of slaves and — — ”[8]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We have had enough of that!” exclaimed Dr. Donald, with a tone of threatening authority.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hold your breath, sir, else I'll stop it!” in a rage replied the young chief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sir,” responded the Doctor, “I was not speaking to you, but only speaking to that Negro!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 086.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're a fool!” roared Braser, springing to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, come, gentlemen!” admonished the old Chief. “I think you are both going mad! I hope you'll behave something better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, uncle, I can't endure him! he assumes so much authority!” replied he. “He'll make the Indians slaves just now, then Negroes will have no friends.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Donald was a white man, married among the Indians a sister of the old Chief and aunt to the young, for the sake of her wealth and a home. A physician without talents, he was unable to make a business and unwilling to work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Bras — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I want nothing more of you,” interrupted Braser, “and don't — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Josephus, Josephus!” interrupted the old chief. “You will surely let the Doctor speak!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Donald stood pale and trembling before the young Choctaw born to command, when receiving no favor he left the company muttering “nigger!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now you see,” said Mr. Culver as the Doctor left the room, “the difference between a white man and Indian holding slaves. Indian work side by side with black man, eat with him, drink with him, rest with him and both lay down in shade together; white man even won't let you talk! In our Nation Indian and black all marry together. Indian like black man very much, ony he don't fight 'nough. Black man in Florida fight much, and Indian like 'im heap!”[9]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You make, sir, a slight mistake about my people. They would fight if in their own country they were united as the Indians here, and not scattered thousands of miles apart as they are. You should also remember that the Africans have never permitted a subjugation of their country by foreigners as the Indians have theirs, and Africa today is still peopled by Africans, whilst America, the home of the Indian — who is fast passing away — is now possessed and ruled by foreigners.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True, true!” said the old Chief, looking down reflectingly. “Too true! I had not thought that way before. Do you think the white man couldn't take Africa if he wanted?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He might by a combination, and I still am doubtful whether then he could if the Africans were determined as formerly to keep him out. You will also remember, that the whites came in small numbers to 925EAF. Page 087. America, and then drove the Indians from their own soil, whilst the blacks got in Africa as slaves, are taken by their own native conquerors, and sold to white men as prisoners of war.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is true, sir, true!” sighed the old Chief. “The Indian, like game before the bow, is passing away before the gun of the white man!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What I now most wish to learn is, whether in case that the blacks should rise, they may have hope or fear from the Indian?” asked Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm an old mouthpiece, been puffing out smoke and talk many seasons for the entertainment of the young and benefit of all who come among us. The squaws of the great men among the Indians in Florida were black women, and the squaws of the black men were Indian women. You see the vine that winds around and holds us together. Don't cut it, but let it grow till bimeby, it git so stout and strong, with many, very many little branches attached, that you can't separate them. I now reach to you the pipe of peace and hold out the olive-branch of hope! Go on young man, go on. If you want white man to love you, you must fight im!” concluded the intelligent old Choctaw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, sir, I shall rest contented, and impart to you the object of my mission,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah hah!” exclaimed the old chief after an hour's seclusion with him. “Ah hah! Indian have something like that long-go. I wonder your people ain't got it before! That what make Indian strong; that what make Indian and black man in Florida hold together. Go on young man, go on! may the Great Spirit make you brave!” exhorted Mr. Culver, when the parties retired for the evening, Henry rooming with the young warrior Braser.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the aid of the young Chief and kindness of his uncle the venerable old brave, Henry was conducted quite through the nation on a pony placed at his service, affording to him an ample opportunity of examining into the condition of things. He left the settlement with the regrets of the people, being the only instance in which his seclusions were held with the master instead of the slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 088.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 21 What Not</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving the United Nation of Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians, Henry continued his travel in this the roughest, apparently, of all the states. Armed with bowie knives and revolvers openly carried belted around the person, he who displays the greatest number of deadly weapons seems to be considered the greatest man. The most fearful incivility and absence of refinement was apparent throughout this region. Neither the robes of state nor gown of authority is sufficient to check the vengeance of awakened wrath in Arkansas. Law is but a fable, its ministration a farce, and the pillars of justice but as stubble before the approach of these legal invaders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hurriedly passing on in the darkness of the night, Henry suddenly came upon a procession in the wilderness, slowly and silently marching on, the cortege consisting principally of horsemen, there being but one vehicle, advanced by four men on horseback. Their conversation seemed at intervals of low, muttering, awestricken voices. The vehicle was closely covered, and of a sad, heavy sound by the rattling of the wheels upon the unfinished path of the great Arkansas road. Here he sat in silence listening, waiting for the passage of the solemn procession, but a short distance from whence in the thicket stood the hut of the slave to whom he was sent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole umin! done yeh heah some 'un trampin' round de house? Hush! evedroppehs 'bout!” admonished Uncle Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who dat?” enquired Aunt Rachel, as Henry softly rapped at the back window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A friend!” was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What saut frien' dat go sneak roun' people back windah stid comin' to de doh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush, ole umin, yeh too fas'! how yeh know who 'tis? Frien', come roun' to de doh,” said the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Passing quickly around, the door was opened, a blazing hot fire shining full in his face, the old man holding in his hand a heavy iron poker in the attitude of defence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is dis you, my frien'?” enquired Uncle Jerry, to whom Henry was an entire stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, uncle, this is me,” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 089.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God bless yeh, honey! come in; we didn know 'twos you, chile! God bless de baby!” added Aunt Rachel. “Ole man, heah yeh comin' an' we been lookin' all day long. Dis evenin' I git some suppeh, an' I don'o if yeh come uh no.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you know I was coming, aunty?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O! honey, da tell us,” replied she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who told you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“De folks up dah.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Up where?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Up dah, 'mong de Injins, chile.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indians told you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, honey; some de black folks, da all'as gwine back and for'ard, and da lahn heap from dem up dah; an' da make 'ase an' tell us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you get word from each other so far apart, that easy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes 'ndeed, honey! some on 'em all de time gwine; wite folks know nothin' 'bout it. Some time some on 'em gone two-three day, an' ain miss; white folks tink da in the woods choppin'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, that's the very thing! you're ahead of all the other states. You folks in Arkansas must be pretty well organized already.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat dat yeh mean, chile, dat `organ' so?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I mean by that, aunty, a good general secret understanding among yourselves.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, chile! dat da is. Da comin' all de time, ole man hardly time to eat mou'full wen 'e come in de hut night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me, aunty, why people like you and uncle here, who seem to be at the head of these secrets, are not more cautious with me, a stranger?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole umin, I lisenin at yeh!” said Uncle Jerry, after enough had been told to betray them; but the old people well understood each other, Aunt Rachel by mutual consent being the mouthpiece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How we knows you!” rejoined the old woman. “Wy, chile, yeh got mahk dat so soon as we put eye on yeh, we knows yeh. Huccum yeh tink we gwine tell yeh so much wen we don'o who yeh is? Sho, chile, we ain't dat big fool!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you know my errand among you, aunty?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, meh son, dat we does, an' we long been waitin' foh some sich like you to come 'mong us. We thang God dis night in ouh soul! We long been lookin' foh ye, chile!” replied Uncle Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are closely watched in this state, I should think, uncle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 090.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile, de patrolas da all de time out an' gwine in de quahtehs an' huntin' up black folks wid der `nigga-dogs' as da call 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you people scarcely ever get a chance to go anywhere, then?”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">“Yeh no call foh dat, meh son; it ain' nothin' mo' nah onh — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush! ole man; ain' dat dem?” admonished Aunt Rachel, in a whisper, as she went to the door, thrusting out her head in the dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who? Patrols?” with anxiety enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, chile, de man da kill down yondah; all day long da been lookin' foh 'em to come.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A procession passed just before I came to your door, which I took for a funeral.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile, dat's it, da kill im down dah.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On enquiry, it appeared that in the senate a misunderstanding on the rules of order and parliamentary usage occurred, when the Speaker, conceiving himself insulted by the senator who had the floor, deliberately arose from his chair, when approaching the senator, drove a bowie knife through his body from the chest, which laid him a corpse upon the senate floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There he is! There he is!” stormed the assassin, pointing with 925EAF. Page 091. defiance at the lifeless body, his hand still reeking with blood. “I did it!” slapping his hand upon his own breast in triumph of his victory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had just returned with the body of the assassinated statesman to the wretched home of his distracted family, some ten miles beyond the hut of Uncle Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is this the way they treat each other, aunty?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, chile, wus den dat! da kill one-notha in cole blood, sometime at de table eatin'. Da all'as choppin' up some on 'em.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you black people must have a poor chance among them, if this is the way they do each other!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mighty po', honey; mighty po' indeed!” replied Uncle Jerry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, uncle, it's now time I was doing something; I've been here some time resting. Aunty, see to your windows and door; are there any cracks in the walls!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, honey, da dob good!” whispered the old woman as a wellpatched, covering quilt to shield the door was hung, covering nearly one side of the hut, and a thickly-patched linsey gown fully shielded the only window of four eight-by-ten lights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These precautions taken, they drew together in a corner between the head of the bed and well-daubed wall to hold their seclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Laud!” exclaimed Uncle Jerry, after the secrets were fully imparted to them. “Make beah dine all-conquering ahm! strike off de chains dat dy people may go free! Come, Laud, a little nigh, eh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Honah to 'is name!” concorded Aunt Rachel. “Wuthy all praise! Tang God fah wat I seen an' heahn dis night! dis night long to be membed! Meh soul feels it! It is heah!” pressing her hand upon her breast, exclaimed she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen! Laud heah de cry uh dy children! Anseh prah!” responded the old man, in tears; when Aunt Rachel in a grain of sorrowful pathos, sung to the expressive words in the slaves' lament:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In eighteen hundred and twenty-three They said their people should be free! It is wrote in Jeremiah, Come and go along with me! It is wrote in Jeremiah, Go sound the Jubilee!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 092.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the conclusion of the last line, a sudden sharp rap at the door startled them, when the old woman, hastening, took down the quilt, enquiring, “Who dat?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Open the door, Rachel!” was the reply, in an authoritative tone from a posse of patrols, who on going their evening rounds were attracted to the place by the old people's devotion, and stood sometime listening around the hut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You seem to be happy here, Jerry,” said Ralph Jordon, the head of the party. “What boy is this you have here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Major Morgan's sir,” replied Henry, referring to the proprietor of the next plantation above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't remember seeing you before, boy,” continued Jordon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; lately got me,” explained Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Aye, aye, boy; a preacher, I suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, Maus Rafe, dis brotheh no preacheh; but 'e is 'logious, and come to gib us little comfit, an' bless God I feels it now; dat I does, blessed be God!” said the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Rachel, that's all right enough; but, my boy, its high time that you were getting towards home. You've not yet learned our rules here; where are you from?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Louisiana, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, yes, that explains it. Louisiana Negroes are permitted to go out at a much later hour than our Negroes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maus Rafe, ah hope yah let de brotheh eat a mouph'l wid us fo' go?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O yes, Rachel! give the boy something to eat before he goes; I suppose the `laborer is worthy of his hire,' ” looking with a smile at his comrades.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes 'ndeed, seh, dat he is!” replied the old woman with emphasis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Rachel, I smell something good! What have you here, spare rib?” enquired Ralph Jordon, walking to the table and lifting up a clean check apron which the old woman had hurriedly thrown over it to screen her homely food from the view of the gentlemen patrols. “Good! spare rib and ash cake, gentlemen! What's better? Rachel, give us some seats here!” continued Ralph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hurrying about, the old woman made out to seat the uninvited 925EAF. Page 093. guests with a half barrel tub, an old split bottom chair, and a short slab bench, which accommodated two.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By gum! This is fine,” said Ralph Jordon, smacking his mouth, and tearing at a rib. “Gentlemen, help yourselves to some spirits,” setting on the table a large flask of Jamaica rum, just taken from his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothing better,” replied Tom Hammond; “give me at any time the cooking in the Negro quarters before your great-house dainties.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So say I,” sanctioned Zack Hite, champing like a hungry man. “The Negroes live a great deal better than we do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Much better, sir, much better,” replied Ralph. “Rachel, don't you nor Jerry ever take any spirits?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, Maus Rafe, not any,” replied the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May be your friend there will take a little.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't drink, sir,” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rising from the homely meal at the humble board of Aunt Rachel and Uncle Jerry, they emptied their pockets of crackers, cold biscuits and cheese, giving the old man a plug of honey-cured tobacco, to be divided between himself and wife, in lieu of what they had, without invitation, taken the liberty of eating. The patrol this evening were composed of the better class of persons, principally business men, two of whom, being lawyers who went out that evening for a mere “frolic among the Negroes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Receiving the parting hand, accompanied with a “good bye, honey!” and “God bless yeh, meh son!” from the old people, Henry left the hut to continue his course through the forest. Hearing persons approaching, he stepped aside from the road to conceal himself, when two parties at the junction of two roads met each other, coming to a stand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's up tonight, Colonel?” enquired one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothing but the raffle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you going?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, the whole party here; won't you go?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I dun'o; what's the chances?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Five dollars only.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Five dollars a chance! What the deuce is the prize!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, there's several for the same money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are they?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 094.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That fine horse and buggy of Colonel Sprout, a mare and colt, a little Negro girl ten years of age, and a trail of four of the finest Negro-dogs in the state.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hallo! all them; why, how many chances, in the name of gracious, are there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Only a hundred and fifty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Seven hundred and fifty dollars for the whole; that's cheap. But, then, all can't win, and it must be a loss to somebody.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you go, Cap'n?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I don't care — go it is!” when the parties started in the direction of the sport, Henry following to reconnoiter them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On approaching the tavern, the rafflers, who waited the rest of the company to gather, could be seen and heard through the uncurtained windows and the door, which was frequently opened, standing around a blazing hot fire, and in groups over the barroom floor, amusing themselves with jests and laughter. Henry stood in the verge of the forest in a position to view the whole of their proceedings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently there was a rush out of doors with glee and merriment. Old Colonel Sprout was bringing out his dogs, to test their quality previous to the raffle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, gentlemen!” exclaimed he, “them is the best trained dogs in this part of the state. Be dad, they's the bes' dogs in the country. When you say `nigger,' you needn't fear they'll ever go after anything but a nigger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, Colonel, give them a trial; we must have something going on to kill time,” suggested one of the party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But what will he try 'em on?” said another; “there's no niggers to hunt.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Send them out, and let them find one, be George; what else would you have them do?” replied a third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where the deuce will they get one?” rejoined a fourth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just as a hunting dog finds any other game,” answered a fifth; “where else?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, by golly, gentlemen, you need's give yourselves no uneasiness about the game. They'll find a nigger, once started if they have to break into some Negro quarter and drag 'm out o' bed. No mistake 'bout them, I tell you, gentlemen,” boasted Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 095.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But won't a nigger hurt 'em when he knows he's not a runaway?” enquired Richard Rester Rutherford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What, a nigger hurt a bloodhound! By, gracious, they're fearder of a bloodhound than they is of the devil himself! Them dogs is dogs, gentlemen, an' no mistake; they is by gracious!” declared Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, let them loose, Colonel, and let's have a little sport, at any rate!” said Ralph Jordon, the patrol, who had just arrived; “we're in for a spree tonight, anyhow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here, Caesar, Major, Jowler, here Pup! Niggers about! Seek out!” hissed the Colonel, with a snap of the finger, pointing toward the thicket, in the direction of which was Henry. With a yelp which sent a shudder through the crowd, the dogs started in full chase for the forest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By George, Colonel, that's too bad! Call them back!” said Ralph Jordon, as the savage brutes bounded in search of a victim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By thunder, gentlemen, it's too late! they'll have a nigger before they stop. They'll taste the blood of some poor black devil before they git back!” declared Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having heard every word that passed between them, in breathless silence Henry waited the approach of the animals. The yelping now became more anxious and eager, until at last it was heard as a short, impatient, fretful whining, indicating a near approach to their prey, when growing less and less, they ceased entirely to be heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What the Harry does it mean! the dogs has ceased to bay!” remarked Colonel Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maybe they caught a nigger,” replied John Spangler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It might be a Tartar!” rejoined Ralph Jordon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Maybe a nigger caught them!” said the Sheriff of the county, who was present to superintend the raffle, and receive the proceeds of the hazard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What!” exclaimed the old gentleman, to enhance the value of the prizes. “What! My Caesar, Major, Jowler, and Pup, the best dogs in all Arkansas! — A nigger kill them! No, gentlemen, once let loose an' on their trail, an' they's not a gang o' niggers to be found out at night they couldn't devour! Them dogs! Hanged if they didn't eat a nigger quicker as they'd swaller a piece o' meat!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then they're the dogs for me!” replied the Sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 096.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And me,” added Spangle, a noted agent for catching runaway slaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The raffle, the raffle!” exclaimed several voices eager for a chance, estimating at once the value of the dogs above the aggregate amount of the stakes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But the dogs, the dogs, gentlemen! They're not here! Give us the dogs first,” suggested an eager candidate for competition in the prizes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No matter, gentlemen; be sartin,” said the Colonel, “when they's done they'll come back agin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But how will they be managed in attacking strange Negroes?” enquired Ralph Jordon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, the command of any white man is sufficient to call 'em off, an' they's plenty o' them all'as wherever you find niggers.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, Colonel, we're to understand you to mean, that white men can't live without niggers.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll be hanged, gentlemen, if it don't seem so, for wherever you find one you'll all'as find tother, they's so fully mixed up with us in all our relations!” peals of laughter following the explanation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, Colonel, I'll be hanged if we stand that, except you stand treat!” said Ralph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stand what? Let us understand you; what'd I say?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did you say? why, by George, you tell us flatly that we are related to niggers!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, gentlemen, I'll stand treat; for on that question I'll be consarned if some of us don't have to knock under!” at which there were deafening roars of laughter, the crowd rushing into the barroom, crying, “Treat! Treat!! That's too good to be lost!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next day after the raffle, the winners having presented the prizes back to their former owner, it was whispered about that the dogs had been found dead in the woods, the mare and colt were astray, the little slave girl was in a pulmonary decline, the buggy had been upset and badly worsted the day before the raffle, and the horse had the distemper; upon which information the whole party met at a convenient place on a fixed day, going out to his house in a body, who ate, drank, and caroused at his expense during the day and evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sprout,” said Ralph Jordon, “with your uniform benevolence, generosity and candor, how did you ever manage to depart so far from your old principles and rule of doing things? I can't understand it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 097.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How so? Explain yourself,” replied Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why you always give rather than take advantage, your house and means always being open to the needy, even those with whom you are unacquainted.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm sure I ain't departed one whit from my old rule,” said Sprout; “I saw you was all strangers to the thing, an' I took you in; I'm blamed if I didn't!” the crowd shouting with laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One word, Sprout,” said Jordon. “When the dogs ceased baying, didn't you suspect something wrong?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know'd at once when they stopped that they was defeated; but I thought they'd pitched headlong into a old wellhole some sixty foot deep, where the walls has tumbled in, an' made it some twenty foot wide at the top. I lis'ened every minute 'spectin' to hear a devil of a whinin' 'mong 'em' but I was disapinted.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, its a blamed pity, anyhow, that such fine animals were killed; and no clue as yet, I believe, to the perpetration of the deed,” said the Sheriff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They was, indeed,” replied Sprout, “as good a breed o' dogs as ever was, an' if they'd a been trained right, nothin' could a come up with them; but consarn their picters, it serves 'em right, as they wos the cussedest cowards I ever seed! 'Sarn them, if a nigger ony done so — jis' made a pass at 'em, an' I'll be hanged if they didn't yelp like wild cats, an almost kill 'emselves runin' away!” at which explanation the peals of laughter were deafening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let's stay a week, stay a week, gentlemen!” exclaimed Ralph Jordon, in a convulsion of laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Be gracious, gentlemen!” concluded Sprout. “If you stay till eternity it won't alter the case one whit; case, the mare an' colt's lost, the black gal's no use to anybody, the buggy's all smashed up, the hos' is got the distemper, and the dogs is dead as thunder!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a boisterous roar, the party, already nearly exhausted with laughter, commenced gathering their hats and cloaks, and left the premises declaring never again to be caught at a raffling wherein was interested Colonel Joel Sprout.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dogs were the best animals of the kind, and quickly trailed out their game; but Henry, with a well-aimed weapon, slew each ferocious beast as it approached him, leaving them weltering in their own blood instead of feasting on his, as would have been the case had he not 925EAF. Page 098. overpowered them. The rest of the prizes were also valuable and in good order, and the story which found currency depreciating them, had its origin in the brain and interest of Colonel Sprout, which resulted, as designed, entirely in his favor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hastening on to the Fulton landing Henry reached it at half-past two o'clock in the morning, just in time to board a steamer on the downward trip, which barely touched the shore to pick up a package. Knowing him by reputation as a great horse master, the captain received him cheerfully, believing him to have been, from what he had learned, to the Texas races with horses for his master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Being now at ease, and faring upon the best the vessel could afford, after a little delay along the cotton trading coast, Henry was safely landed in the portentous city of New Orleans.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 22 New Orleans</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The season is the holidays, it is evening, and the night is beautiful. The moon, which in Louisiana is always an object of impressive interest, even to the slave as well as those of enlightened and scientific intelligence, the influence of whose soft and mellow light seems ever like the enchanting effect of some invisible being, to impart inspiration — now being shed from the crescent of the first day of the last quarter, appeared more interesting and charming than ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though the cannon at the old fort in the Lower Faubourg had fired the significant warning, admonishing the slaves as well as free blacks to limit their movement, still there were passing to and fro with seeming indifference Negroes, both free and slaves, as well as the whites and Creole quadroons, fearlessly along the public highways, in seeming defiance of the established usage of Negro limitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the evening of the day of Mardi Gras, and from long-established and time-honored custom, the celebration which commenced in the morning was now being consummated by games, shows, exhibitions, theatrical performances, festivals, masquerade balls, and numerous entertainments and gatherings in the evening. It 925EAF. Page 099. was on this account that the Negroes had been allowed such unlimited privileges this evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor were they remiss to the utmost extent of its advantages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The city which always at this season of the year is lively, and Chartier street [10] gay and fashionable, at this time appeared more lively, gay and fashionable than usual. This fashionable thoroughfare, the pride of the city, was thronged with people, presenting complexions of every shade and color. Now could be seen and realized the expressive description in the popular song of the vocalist Cargill:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I suppose you've heard how New Orleans Is famed for wealth and beauty; There's girls of every hue, it seems, From snowy white to sooty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The extensive shops and fancy stores presented the presence behind their counters as saleswomen in attendance of numerous females, black, white, mulatto and quadroon, politely bowing, curtsying, and rubbing their hands, in accents of broken English inviting to purchase all who enter the threshold, or even look in at the door:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat fa you want something? Walk in, sire, I vill sell you one nice present fa one young lady.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so with many who stood or sat along the streets and at the store doors, curtsying and smiling they give the civil banter:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, sire, I sell you one pretty ting.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fancy stores and toy shops on this occasion were crowded seemingly to their greatest capacity. Here might be seen the fashionable young white lady of French or American extraction, and there the handsome, and frequently beautiful maiden of African origin, mulatto, quadroon, or sterling black, all fondly interchanging civilities, and receiving some memento or keepsake from the hand of an acquaintance. Many lively jests and impressive flings of delicate civility noted the greetings of the passersby. Freedom seemed as though for once enshielded by her sacred robes and crowned with cap and wand in hand, to go forth untrammeled through the highways of the town. [11] Along the private streets, sitting under the verandas, in the doors with half-closed jalousies, or promenading unconcernedly the public ways, mournfully humming in solace or chanting in lively 925EAF. Page 100. glee, could be seen and heard many a Creole, male or female, black, white or mixed race, sometimes in reverential praise of</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Father, Son and Holy Ghost — Madonna, and the Heavenly Host! in sentimental reflection on some pleasant social relations, or the sad reminiscence of ill-treatment or loss by death of some loved one, or worse than death, the relentless and insatiable demands of slavery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the distance, on the levee or in the harbor among the steamers, the songs of the boatmen were incessant. Every few hours landing, loading and unloading, the glee of these men of sorrow was touchingly appropriate and impressive. Men of sorrow they are in reality; for if there be a class of men anywhere to be found, whose sentiments of song and words of lament are made to reach the sympathies of others, the black slave-boatmen of the Mississippi river is that class. Placed in positions the most favorable to witness the pleasures enjoyed by others, the tendency is only to augment their own wretchedness.[12]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fastened by the unyielding links of the iron cable of despotism, reconciling themselves to a lifelong misery, they are seemingly contented by soothing their sorrows with songs and sentiments of apparently cheerful but in reality wailing lamentations. The most attracting lament of the evening was sung to words, a stanza of which is presented in pathos of delicate tenderness, which is but a spray from the stream which gushed out in insuppressible jets from the agitated fountains of their souls, as if in unison with the restless current of the great river upon which they were compelled to toil, their troubled waters could not be quieted. In the capacity of leader, as is their custom, one poor fellow in pitiful tones led off the song of the evening:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Way down upon the Mobile river, Close to Mobile bay; There's where my thoughts is running ever, All through the livelong day: There I've a good and fond old mother, Though she is a slave;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 101.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There I've a sister and a brother, Lying in their peaceful graves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then in chorus joined the whole company —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O, could I somehow a'nother, Drive these tears way; When I think about my poor old mother, Down upon the Mobile bay.[13]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Standing in the midst of and contemplating such scenes as these, it was that Henry determined to finish his mission in the city and leave it by the earliest conveyance over Pontchartrain for Alabama — Mobile being the point at which he aimed. Swiftly as the current of the fleeting Mississippi was time passing by, and many states lay in expanse before him, all of which, by the admonishing impulses of the dearest relations, he was compelled to pass over as a messenger of light and destruction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Light, of necessity, had to be imparted to the darkened region of the obscure intellects of the slaves, to arouse them from their benighted condition to one of moral responsibility, to make them sensible that liberty was legitimately and essentially theirs, without which there was no distinction between them and the brute. Following as a necessary consequence would be the destruction of oppression and ignorance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alone and friendless, without a home, a fugitive from slavery, a child of misfortune and outcast upon the world, floating on the cold surface of chance, now in the midst of a great city of opulence, surrounded by the most despotic restrictions upon his race, with renewed determination Henry declared that nothing short of an unforeseen Providence should impede his progress in the spread of secret organization among the slaves. So aroused, he immediately started for a house in the Lower Faubourg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My frien', who yeh lookin' foh?” kindly enquired a cautious black man, standing concealed in the shrubbery near the door of a low, tile-covered house standing back in the yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A friend,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 102.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat's 'is name?” continued the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do not rightly know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Would yeh know it ef yeh heahed it, my fren'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I would.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is it Seth?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the very name!” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat yeh want wid 'im, my fren'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I want to see him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I spose yeh do, fren'; but dat ain' answer my questin' yet. Wat yeh want wid 'em?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would rather see him, then I'll be better able to answer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My fren',” replied the man, meaningly, “ah see da is somethin' in yeh; come in!” giving a significant cough before placing his finger on the latchstring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On entering, from the number and arrangement of the seats, there was evidence of an anticipated gathering; but the evening being that of the Mardi Gras, there was nothing remarkable in this. Out from another room came a sharp, observing, shrewd little dark brown-skin woman, called in that community a griffe. Bowing, sidling and curtsying, she smilingly came forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat brotha dis, Seth?” enquired she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah don'o,” carelessly replied he with a signal of caution, which was not required in her case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah!” exclaimed Henry. “This is Mr. Seth! I'm glad to see you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a little conversation, in which freely participated Mrs. Seth, who evidently was deservingly the leading spirit of the evening, they soon became reconciled to the character and mission of their unexpected and self-invited guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Phebe, go tell 'em,” said Seth; when lightly tripping away she entered the door of the other room, which after a few moments' delay was partially opened, and by a singular and peculiar signal, Seth and the stranger were invited in. Here sat in one of the most secret and romantic-looking rooms, a party of fifteen, the representatives of the heads of that many plantations, who that night had gathered for the portentious purpose of a final decision on the hour to strike the first blow. On entering, Henry stood a little in check.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Trus' 'em!” said Seth. “Yeh fine 'em da right saut uh boys — true to deh own color! Da come fom fifteen diffent plantation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 103.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They're the men for me!” replied Henry, looking around the room. “Is the house all safe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes brotha, all safe an' soun', an' a big dog in da yahd, so dat no one can come neah widout ouah knowin' it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“First, then, to prayer, and next to seclusion,” said Henry, looking at Seth to lead in prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Brotha, gib us wud a' prah,” said Seth to Henry, as the party on their knees bowed low their heads to the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not fit, brother, for a spiritual leader; my warfare is not Heavenly, but earthly; I have not to do with angels, but with men; not with righteousness, but wickedness. Call upon some brother who has more of the grace of God than I. If I ever were a Christian, slavery has made me a sinner; if I had been an angel, it would have made me a devil! I feel more like cursing than praying — may God forgive me! Pray for me, brethren!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Brotha Kits, gib us wud a prah, my brotha!” said Seth to an athletic, powerful black man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Its not fah ouah many wuds, noah long prah — ouah 'pinion uh ouah self, nah sich like, dat Dou anseh us; but de 'cerity ob ouah hahts an ouah 'tentions. Bless de young man dat come 'mong us; make 'im fit fah 'is day, time, an' genration! Dou knows, Laud, dat fah wat we 'semble; anseh dis ouah 'tition, an' gib us token ob Dine 'probation!” petitioned Kits, slapping his hand at the conclusion down upon and splitting open a pine table before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen,” responded the gathering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let da wud run an' be glorify!” exclaimed Nathan Seth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The splitting of the table was regarded as ominous, but of doubtful signification, the major part considering it as rather unfavorable. Making no delay, lest a despondency ensue through fear and superstition, Henry at once entered into seclusion, completing an organization.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God sen' yeh had come along dis way befo'!” exclaimed Phebe Seth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God grant 'e had!” responded Nathan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My Laud! I feels like a Sampson! ah feels like gwine up to take de city mehself!” cried out Kits, standing erect in the floor with fists clenched, muscles braced, eyes shut, and head thrown back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, yes!” exclaimed Phebe. “Blessed be God, brotha Kits, da King is in da camp!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 104.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Powah, powah!” responded Seth. “Da King is heah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Praise 'is name!” shouted Phebe clapping and rubbing her hands. “Fah wat I feels an' da knowledge I has receive dis night! I been all my days in darkness till now! I feels we shall be a people yit! Thang' God, thang God!” when she skidded over the floor from side to side, keeping time with a tune sung to the words — “We'll honor our Lord and Master; We'll honor our Lord and King; We'll honor our Lord and Master, And bow at His command! O! brothers, did you hear the news? Lovely Jesus is coming! If ever I get to the house of the Lord, I'll never come back any more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's good to be heah!” shouted Seth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah! dat it is, brotha Seth!” responded Kits. “Da Laud is nigh, dat 'e is! 'e promise whahsomeveh two-three 'semble, to be in da mids' and dat to bless 'em, an' 'is promise not in vain, case 'e heah tonight!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the moment which Phebe took her seat, nearly exhausted with exercise, a loud rap at the door, preceded by the signal for the evening, alarmed the party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come in, brotha Tib — come quick, if yeh comin!” bade Seth, in a low voice hastily, as he partially opened the door, peeping out into the other room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, pshaw!” exclaimed Phebe, as she and her husband yet whispered; “I wish he stay away. I sho nobody want 'em! he all'as half drunk anyhow. Good ev'nin', brotha Tib. How yeh been sense we see yeh early paut da night?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Reasable, sistah — reasable, thang God. Well, what yeh all 'cided on? I say dis night now au neveh!” said Tib, evidently bent on mischief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Foolishness, foolishness!” replied Phebe. “It make me mad see people make fool uh demself! I wish 'e stay home an' not bothen heah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, 'spose I got right to speak as well as da rest on yeh! Yeh all ain' dat high yit to keep body fom talkin', ah 'spose. Betta wait tell yeh git free fo' ye 'temp' scrow oveh people dat way! I kin go out yeh 925EAF. Page 105. house!” retorted the mischievous man, determined on distracting their plans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nobody odeh yeh out, but I like see people have sense, specially befo' strangehs! an' know how behave demself!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I is gwine out yeh house,” gruffly replied the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My friend,” said Henry, “listen a moment to me. You are not yet ready for a strike; you are not yet ready to do anything effective. You have barely taken the first step in the matter, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Strangeh!” interrupted the distracter. “Ah don'o yeh name, yeh strangeh to me — I see yeh talk 'bout `step'; how many step man got take fo' 'e kin walk? I likes to know dat! Tell me that fus, den yeh may ax me what yeh choose!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must have all the necessary means, my brother,” persuasively resumed Henry, “for the accomplishment of your ends. Intelligence among yourself on everything pertaining to your designs and project. You must know what, how, and when to do. Have all the instrumentalities necessary for an effective effort, before making the attempt. Without this, you will fail, utterly fail!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den ef we got wait all dat time, we neveh be free!” gruffly replied he. “I goes in foh dis night! I say dis night! Who goes — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Shet yo' big mouth! Sit down! Now make a fool o' yo'self!” exclaimed several voices with impatience, which evidently only tended to increase the mischief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dis night, dis night au neveh!” boisterously yelled the now infuriated man at the top of his voice. “Now's da time!” when he commenced shuffling about over the floor, stamping and singing at the top of his voice — Come all my brethren, let us take a rest, While the moon shines bright and clear; Old master died and left us all at last, And has gone at the bar to appear! Old master's dead and lying in his grave; And our blood will now cease to flow; He will no more tramp on the neck of the slave, For he's gone where slaveholders go! Hang up the shovel and the hoe — o — o — o! I don't care whether I work or no!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 106.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old master's gone to the slaveholders rest — He's gone where they all ought to go!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">pointing down and concluding with an expression which indicated anything but a religious feeling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Shame so it is dat he's lowed to do so! I wish I was man foh 'im, I'd make 'im fly!” said Phebe much alarmed, as she heard the great dog in the yard, which had been so trained as to know the family visitors, whining and manifesting an uneasiness unusual with him. On going to the back door, a person suddenly retreated into the shrubbery, jumping the fence, and disappearing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon, however, there was an angry low heavy growling of the dog, with suppressed efforts to bark, apparently prevented by fear on the part of the animal. This was succeeded by cracking in the bushes, dull heavy footsteps, cautious whispering, and stillness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush! Listen!” admonished Phebe. “What is dat? Wy don't Tyger bark? I don't understan' it! Seth, go out and see, will you? Wy don't some you men make dat fool stop? I wish I was man, I'd break 'is neck, so I would!” during which the betrayer was shuffling, dancing, and singing at such a pitch as to attract attention from without.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seth seizing him from behind by a firm grasp of the collar with both hands, Tib sprang forward, slipping easily out of it, leaving the overcoat suspended in his assailant's hands, displaying studded around his waist a formidable array of deathly weapons, when rushing out of the front door, he in terrible accents exclaimed —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Insurrection! Insurrection! Death to every white!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sudden spring of their rattles, the gendarmes, who in cloisters had surrounded the house, and by constant menacing gestures with their maces kept the great dog, which stood back in a corner, in a snarling position in fear, arrested the miscreant, taking him directly to the old fort calaboose. In the midst of the confusion which necessarily ensued, Henry, Seth, and Phebe, Kits and fellow-leaders from the fifteen plantations, immediately fled, all having passes for the day and evening, which fully protected them in any part of the city away from the scene of disturbance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Intelligence soon reached all parts of the city, that an extensive plot for rebellion of the slaves had been timely detected. The place was at once thrown into a state of intense excitement, the military called 925EAF. Page 107. into requisition, dragoons flying in every direction, cannon from the old fort sending forth hourly through the night, thundering peals to give assurance of their sufficiency, and the infantry on duty traversing the streets, stimulating with martial air with voluntary vocalists, who readily joined in chorus to the memorable citing words in the Southern States of — Go tell Jack Coleman, The Negroes are arising!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alarm and consternation succeeded pleasure and repose, sleep for the time seemed to have departed from the eyes of the inhabitants, men, women and children ran every direction through the streets, seeming determined if they were to be massacred, that it should be done in the open highways rather than secretly in their own houses. The commotion thus continued till the morning; meanwhile editors, journalists, reporters, and correspondents, all were busily on the alert, digesting such information as would form an item of news for the press, or a standing reminiscence for historical reference in the future.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 23 The Rebel Blacks</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For the remainder of the night secreting themselves in Conti and Burgundi streets, the rebel proprietors of the house in which was laid the plot for the destruction of the city were safe until the morning, their insurrectionary companions having effected a safe retreat to the respective plantations to which they belonged that evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jason and Phebe Seth were the hired slaves of their own time from a widower master, a wealthy retired attorney at Baton Rouge, whose only concern about them was to call every ninety days at the counter of the Canal Bank of New Orleans, and receive the price of their hire, which was there safely deposited to his credit by the industrious and faithful servants. The house in which the rebels met had been hired for the occasion, being furnished rooms kept for transient accommodation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 108.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the earliest conveyance destined for the City of Mobile, Henry left, who, before he fled, admonished as his parting counsel, to “stand still and see the salvation”; the next day being noted by General Ransom, as an incident in his history, to receive a formal visit of a fortnight's sojourn, in the person of his slaves Jason and Phebe Seth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The inquisition held in the case of the betrayer Tib developed fearful antecedents of extensive arrangements for the destruction of the city by fire and water, thereby compelling the white inhabitants to take refuge in the swamps, whilst the blacks marched up the coast, sweeping the plantations as they went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suspicions were fixed upon many, among whom was an unfortunate English schoolteacher, who was arrested and imprisoned, when he died, to the last protesting his innocence. Mr. Farland was a good and bravehearted man, disdaining to appeal for redress to his country, lest it might be regarded as the result of cowardice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking fresh alarm at this incident, the municipal regulations have been most rigid in a system of restriction and espionage toward Negroes and mulattoes, almost destroying their self-respect and manhood, and certainly impairing their usefulness.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 24 A Flying Cloud</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Safely in Mobile Henry landed without a question, having on the way purchased of a passenger who was deficient of means to bear expenses, a horse by which he made a daring entry into the place. Mounting the animal which was fully caparisoned, he boldly rode to the principal livery establishment, ordering for it the greatest care until his master's arrival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hastening into the country he readily found a friend and seclusion in the hut of Uncle Cesar, on the plantation of Gen. Audly. Making no delay, early next morning he returned to the city to effect a special object. Passing by the stable where the horse had been left, a voice loudly cried out:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's that Negro boy, now! Hallo, there, boy! didn't you leave a horse here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Heeding not the interrogation, but speedily turning the first corner, Henry hastened away and was soon lost among the inhabitants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 109.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How yeh do, me frien'?” saluted a black man whom he met in a by-street. “Ar' yeh strangeh?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why?” enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O, nothin'! On'y I hearn some wite men talkin'j's now, an' da say some strange nigga lef' a hoss dar, an' da blev 'e stole 'em, an' da gwine ketch an' put 'em in de jail.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If that's all, I live here. Good morning!” rejoined he who soon was making rapid strides in the direction of Georgia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every evening found him among the quarters of some plantations, safely secreted in the hut of some faithful, trustworthy slave, with attentive, anxious listeners, ready for an issue. So, on he went with flying haste, from plantation to plantation, till Alabama was left behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Georgia, though the laws were strict, the Negroes were equally hopeful. Like the old stock of Maryland and Virginia blacks from whom they were descended, they manifested a high degree of intelligence for slaves. Receiving their messenger with open arms, the aim of his advent among them spread like fire in a stubble. Everywhere seclusions were held and organizations completed, till Georgia stands like a city at the base of a burning mountain, threatened with destruction by an overflow of the first outburst of lava from above. Clearing the state without an obstruction, he entered that which of all he most dreaded, the haughty South Carolina.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the most relentless hatred appears to exist against the Negro, who seems to be regarded but as an animated thing of convenience or a domesticated animal, reared for the service of his master. The studied policy of the whites evidently is to keep the blacks in subjection and their spirits below a sentiment of self-respect. To impress the Negro with a sense of his own inferiority is a leading precept of their social system; to be white is the only evidence necessary to establish a claim to superiority. To be a “master” in South Carolina is to hold a position of rank and title, and he who approaches this the nearest is heightened at least in his own estimation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These feelings engendered by the whites have been extensively incorporated with the elements of society among the colored people, giving rise to the “Brown Society” an organized association of mulattos, created by the influence of the whites, for the purpose of preventing pure-blooded Negroes from entering the social circle, or holding intercourse with them.[14]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 110.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here intelligence and virtue are discarded and ignored, when not in conformity with these regulations. A man with the prowess of Memnon, or a woman with the purity of the “black doves” of Ethiopia and charms of the “black virgin” of Solomon, avails them nothing, if the blood of the oppressor, engendered by wrong, predominates not in their veins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oppression is the author of all this, and upon the heads of the white masters let the terrible responsibility of this miserable stupidity and ignorance of their mulatto children rest; since to them was left the plan of their social salvation, let upon their consciences rest the penalties of their social damnation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The transit of the runaway through this state was exceedingly difficult, as no fabrication of which he was capable could save him from the penalties of arrest. To assume freedom would be at once to consign himself to endless bondage, and to acknowledge himself a slave was at once to advertise for a master. His only course of safety was to sleep through the day and travel by night, always keeping to the woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At a time just at the peep of day when making rapid strides the baying of hounds and soundings of horns were heard at a distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Understanding it to be the sport of the chase, Henry made a hasty retreat to the nearest hiding place which presented, in the hollow of a log. On attempting to creep in a snarl startled him, when out leaped the fox, having counterrun his track several times, and sheltered in a fallen sycamore. Using his remedy for distracting dogs, he succeeded the fox in the sycamore, resting in safety during the day without molestation, though the dogs bayed within thirty yards of him, taking a contrary course by the distraction of their scent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For every night of sojourn in the state he had a gathering, not one of which was within a hut, so closely were the slaves watched by patrol, and sometimes by mulatto and black overseers. These gatherings were always held in the forest. Many of the confidants of the seclusions were the much-dreaded runaways of the woods, a class of outlawed slaves, who continually seek the lives of their masters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day having again sought retreat in a hollow log where he lay sound asleep, the day being chilly, he was awakened by a cold application to his face and neck, which proved to have been made by a rattlesnake of the largest size, having sought the warmth of his bosom. 925EAF. Page 111. Henry made a hasty retreat, ever after declining the hollow of a tree. With rapid movements and hasty action, he like a wind cloud flew through the State of South Carolina, who like “a thief in the night” came when least expected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry now entered Charleston, the metropolis, and head of the “Brown Society,” the bane and dread of the blacks in the state, an organization formed through the instrumentality of the whites to keep the blacks and mulattos at variance. To such an extent is the error carried, that the members of the association, rather than their freedom would prefer to see the blacks remain in bondage. But many most excellent mulattos and quadroons condemn with execration this auxiliary of oppression. The eye of the intelligent world is on this “Brown Society”; and its members when and wherever seen are scanned with suspicion and distrust. May they not be forgiven for their ignorance when proving by repentance their conviction of wrong?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lying by till late next morning, he entered the city in daylight, having determined boldly to pass through the street, as he might not be known from any common Negro. Coming to an extensive wood-yard he learned by an old black man who sat at the gate that the proprietors were two colored men, one of whom he pointed out, saying:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat is my mausta.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Approaching a respectable-looking mulatto gentleman standing in conversation with a white, his foot resting on a log:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you wish to hire help, sir?” enquired Henry respectfully touching his cap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take off your hat, boy!” ordered the mulatto gentleman. Obeying the order, he repeated the question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who do you belong to?” enquired the gentleman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am free, sir!” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are a free, boy? Are you not a stranger here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you lie, sir,” replied the mulatto gentleman, “as you know that no free Negro is permitted to enter this state. You are a runaway, and I'll have you taken up!” at the same time walking through his office looking out at the front door as if for an officer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Making a hasty retreat, in less than an hour he had left the city, 925EAF. Page 112. having but a few minutes tarried in the hut of an old black family on the suburb, one of the remaining confidentials and adherents of the memorable South Carolina insurrection, when and to whom he imparted his fearful scheme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah!” said the old man, throwing his head in the lap of his old wife, with his hands around her neck, both of whom sat near the chimney with the tears coursing down their furrowed cheeks. “Dis many a day I been prayin' dat de Laud sen' a nudder Denmark 'mong us! De Laud now anseh my prar in dis young man! Go on, my son — go on — an' may God A'mighty bress yeh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">North Carolina was traversed mainly in the night. When approaching the region of the Dismal Swamp, a number of the old confederates of the noted Nat Turner were met with, who hailed the daring young runaway as the harbinger of better days.[15] Many of these are still long-suffering, hard-laboring slaves on the plantations; and some bold, courageous, and fearless adventurers, denizens of the mystical, antiquated, and almost fabulous Dismal Swamp, where for many years they have defied the approach of their pursuers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Henry found himself surrounded by a different atmosphere, an entirely new element. Finding ample scope for undisturbed action through the entire region of the Swamp, he continued to go scattering to the winds and sowing the seeds of a future crop, only to take root in the thick black waters which cover it, to be grown in devastation and reaped in a whirlwind of ruin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I been lookin' fah yeh dis many years,” said old Gamby Gholar, a noted high conjurer and compeer of Nat Turner, who for more than thirty years has been secluded in the Swamp, “an' been tellin' on 'em dat yeh 'ood come long, but da 'ooden' heah dat I tole 'em! Now da see! Dis many years I been seein' on yeh! Yes, 'ndeed, chile, dat I has!” and he took from a gourd of antiquated appearance which hung against the wall in his hut, many articles of a mysterious character, some resembling bits of woollen yarn, onionskins, oystershells, finger and toenails, eggshells, and scales which he declared to be from very dangerous serpents, but which closely resembled, and were believed to be those of innocent and harmless fish, with broken iron nails.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These he turned over and over again in his hands, closely inspecting them through a fragment of green bottle glass, which he claimed to be a mysterious and precious “blue stone” got at a peculiar and unknown 925EAF. Page 113. spot in the Swamp, whither by a special faith he was led — and ever after unable to find the same spot — putting them again into the gourd, the end of the neck being cut off so as to form a bottle, he rattled the “goombah,” as he termed it, as if endeavoring to frighten his guest. This process ended, he whispered, then sighted into the neck, first with one eye, then with the other, then shook, and so alternately whispering, sighting and shaking, until apparently getting tired, again pouring them out, fumbling among them until finding a forked breast-bone of a small bird, which, muttering to himself, he called the “charm bone of a treefrog.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah,” exclaimed Gamby as he selected out the mystic symbol handing it to Henry, “got yeh at las'. Take dis, meh son, an' so long as yeh keep it, da can' haum yeh, dat da can't. Dis woth money, meh son; da ain't many sich like dat in de Swamp! Yeh never want for nothin' so long as yeh keep dat!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this fearful abode for years of some of Virginia and North Carolina's boldest black rebels, the names of Nat Turner, Denmark Veezie, and General Gabriel were held by them in sacred reverence; that of Gabriel as a talisman. With delight they recounted the many exploits of whom they conceived to be the greatest men who ever lived, the pretended deeds of whom were fabulous, some of the narrators claiming to have been patriots in the American Revolution.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yeh offen hearn on Maudy Ghamus,” said an old man stooped with age, having the appearance of a centenarian. “Dat am me — me heah!” continued he, touching himself on the breast. “I's de frien' on Gamby Gholar; an' I an' Gennel Gabel fit in de Malution wah, an' da want no sich fightin' dare as dat in Gabel wah!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You were then a soldier in the Revolutionary War for American independence, father?” enquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gau bress yeh, hunny. Yes, 'ndeed, chile, long 'for yeh baun; dat I did many long day go! Yes, chile, yes!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And General Gabriel, too, a soldier of the American Revolution?” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, chile, dat 'e did fit in de Molution wah, Gabel so, an' 'e fit like mad dog! Wen 'e sturt, chile, da can't stop 'im; da may as well let 'im go long, da can't do nuffin' wid 'im.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry subscribed to his eminent qualifications as a warrior, assuring him that those were the kind of fighting men they then needed among 925EAF. Page 114. the blacks. Maudy Ghamus to this assented, stating that the Swamp contained them in sufficient number to take the whole United States; the only difficulty in the way being that the slaves in the different states could not be convinced of their strength. He had himself for years been an emissary; also, Gamby Gholar, who had gone out among them with sufficient charms to accomplish all they desired, but could not induce the slaves to a general rising.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take plenty goomba an' fongosa 'long wid us, an' plant mocasa all along, an' da got nuffin' fah do but come, an' da 'ooden come!” despairingly declared Maudy Ghamus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gamby Gholar, Maudy Ghamus, and others were High Conjurors, who as ambassadors from the Swamp, were regularly sent out to create new conjurers, lay charms, take off “spells” that could not be reached by Low Conjurors, and renew the art of all conjurors of seven years existence, at the expiration of which period the virtue was supposed to run out; holding their official position by fourteen years appointments. Through this means the revenue is obtained for keeping up an organized existence in this much-dreaded morass — the Dismal Swamp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before Henry left they insisted upon, and anointed him a priest of the order of High Conjurors, and amusing enough it was to him who consented to satisfy the aged devotees of a time-honored superstition among them. Their supreme executive body called the “Head” consists in number of seven aged men, noted for their superior experience and wisdom. Their place of official meeting must be entirely secluded, either in the forest, a gully, secluded hut, an underground room, or a cave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The seven old men who, with heightened spirits, hailed his advent among them, led Henry to the door of an ample cave — their hollow — at the door of which they were met by a large sluggish, lazily-moving serpent, but so entirely tame and petted that it wagged its tail with fondness toward Maudy as he led the party. The old men, suddenly stopping at the approach of the reptile, stepping back a pace, looked at each other mysteriously shaking their heads:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go back!” exclaimed Maudy waving his hand. “Go back, my chile! 'e in terrible rage! 'e got seben long toof, any on 'em kill yeh like flash!” tapping it slightly on the head with a twig of grapevine which he carried in his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 115.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking at the ugly beast, Henry had determined did it approach to harm, to slay it; but instead, it quietly coiled up and lay at the door as if asleep, which reminded him of queer and unmeaning sounds as they approached, uttered by Gholar, which explained that the animal had been trained to approach when called as any other pet. The “Head” once in session, they created him conjuror of the highest degree known to their art.* With this qualification he was licensed with unlimited power — a power before given no one — to go forth and do wonders. The “Head” seemed, by the unlimited power given him, to place greater reliance in the efforts of Henry for their deliverance than in their own seven heads together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go, my son,” said they, “an' may God A'mighty hole up yo' han's an' grant us speedy 'liverence!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Being now well refreshed — having rested without the fear of detection — and in the estimation of Gholar, Ghamus and the rest of the “Heads”, well qualified to prosecute his project amidst the prayers, blessings, wishes, hopes, fears, pow-wows and promises of a never failing conjuration, and tears of the cloudy inhabitants of this great seclusion, among whom were the frosty-headed, bowed-down old men of the Cave, Henry left that region by his usual stealthy process, reaching Richmond, Virginia, in safety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* The highest degree known to the art of conjuration in the Dismal Swamp, is Seven-finger High-glister.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 25 Like Father, Like Son</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With his usual adroitness, early in the morning, Henry entered Richmond boldly walking through the streets. This place in its municipal regulations, the customs and usages of society, the tastes and assumptious pride of the inhabitants, much resembles Charleston, South Carolina, the latter being a modified model of the former.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The restrictions here concerning Negroes and mulattos are less rigid, as they may be permitted to continue in social or religious gatherings after nine o'clock at night provided a white person be present to 925EAF. Page 116. inspect their conduct; and may ride in a carriage, smoke a cigar in daylight, or walk with a staff at night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">According to an old-existing custom said to have originated by law, a mulatto or quadroon who proved a white mother were themselves regarded as white: and many availing themselves of the fact, took advantage of it by leaving their connections with the blacks and turning entirely over to the whites. Their children take further advantage of this by intermarrying with the whites, by which their identity becomes extinct, and they enter every position in society both social and political. Some of the proudest American statesmen in either House of the Capital, receive their poetic vigor of imagination from the current of Negro blood flowing in their veins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like those of Charleston, some of the light mixed bloods of Richmond hold against the blacks and pure-blooded Negroes the strongest prejudice and hatred, all engendered by the teachings of their Negro-fearing master-fathers. All of the terms and epithets of disparagement commonly used by the whites toward the blacks are as readily applied to them by this class of the mixed bloods. Shy of the blacks and fearful of the whites, they go sneaking about with the countenance of a criminal, of one conscious of having done wrong to his fellows. Spurned by the one and despised by the other, they are the least happy of all the classes. Of this class was Mrs. Pierce, whose daughter stood in the hall door, quite early enjoying the cool air this morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Miss,” enquired Henry of the young quadroon lady, “can you inform me where I'll find the house of Mr. Norton, a colored family in this city?” politely raising his cap as he approached her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a screech she retreated into the house, exclaiming, that a black Negro at the door had given her impudence. Startled at this alarm so unexpected to him — though somewhat prepared for such from his recent experience in Charleston — Henry made good a most hasty retreat before the father, with a long red “hide” in his hand, could reach the door. The man grimaced, declaring, could he have his way, every black in the country would be sold away to labor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Finding the house of his friend, he was safely secluded until evening, when developing his scheme, the old material extinguished and left to mould and rot after the demonstration at Southampton, was immediately rekindled, never again to be suppressed until the slaves stood up the equal of the masters. Southampton — the name of Southampton to them was like an electric shock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 117.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, Laud!” replied Uncle Medly, an old man of ninety-four years, when asked whether or not he would help his brethren in a critical time of need. “Dat I would. Ef I do noffin' else, I pick up dirt an' tro' in der eye!” meaning in that of their masters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Glory to God!” exclaimed his wife, an old woman of ninety years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hallelujah!” responded her daughter, the wife of Norton, the man of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Blessed be God's eternal name!” concluded the man himself. “I've long been praying and looking, but God has answered me at last.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None could answer it, but a prayer-hearing God!” replied the wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None would answer it, but a prayer-hearing God!” responded the husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None did answer it, but a prayer-hearing God!” exclaimed the woman. “Glory to God! Glory to God! 'Tis none but He can deliver!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They fell on their knees to pray, when fervent was their devotion; after which Henry left, but on account of a strict existing patrol regulation, was obliged for three days to be in the wood, so closely watched was he. The fourth evening he effected most adroitly an escape from his hiding place, passing through a strong guard of patrol all around him, entering the District of Columbia at early dawn, soon entering the City of Washington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The slave prison of Williams and Brien conspicuously stood among the edifices; high in the breeze from the flagstaff floated defiantly the National Colors, stars as the pride of the white man, and stripes as the emblem of power over the blacks. At this the fugitive gave a passing glance, but with hurried steps continued his course, not knowing whither he would tarry. He could only breathe in soliloquy, “How long, O Lord of the oppressed, how long shall this thing continue?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Passing quietly along, gazing in at every door, he came to a stop on the corner of Pennsylvania avenue and Sixth Street. On entering, looking into the establishment, his eye unexpectedly caught that of a person who proved to be a mulatto gentleman, slowly advancing toward the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His first impulse was to make a retreat, but fearing the effort would be fatal, bracing his nerves, he stood looking the person full in the face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you want anything, young man?” enquired the mulatto gentleman, who proved to be the proprietor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am hungry, sir!” Henry quickly replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 118.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're a stranger, then, in the city?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never here before?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never before, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you no acquaintance in the place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None at all, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, sir, if you'll come in, I'll see if I can find as much as you can eat.” replied the goodhearted man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Setting him down to a comfortable breakfast, the wife and niece of the proprietor kindly attended upon him, filling his pouch afterwards with sufficient for the day's travel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Giving him a parting hand, Henry left with, “God Almighty bless the family!” clearing the city in a short time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I understand it all,” replied the gentleman in response, “and may the same God guide and protect you by the way!” justly regarding him as a fugitive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kindness received at the hands of this family* brought tears of gratitude to the eyes of the recipient, especially when remembering his treatment from the same class in Charleston and Richmond. About the same time that Henry left the city, the slave of a distinguished Southern statesman also left Washington and the comforts of home and kindness of his master forever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Washington taking a retrograde course purposely to avoid Maryland, where he learned they were already well advised and holding gatherings, the margin of Virginia was cut in this hasty passage, so as to reach more important points for communication. Stealing through the neighborhood and swimming the river, a place was reached called Mud Fort, some four miles distant from Harper's Ferry, situated on the Potomac.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seeing a white man in a field near by, he passed on as if unconscious of his presence, when the person hailing him in broken English questioned his right to pass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am going to Charleston, sir.” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Vat fahr?” inquired the Dutchman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On business.” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 119.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You nagher, you! dat ish not anzer mine question! I does ax you vat fahr you go to Charleston, and you anzer me dat!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I told you, sir, that I am going on business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You ish von zaucy nagher, andt I bleve you one runaway! Py ching, I vill take you pack!” said the man instantly climbing the fence to get into the road where the runaway stood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That will do,” exclaimed Henry, “you are near enough — I can bring you down there,” at the same time presenting a well-charged six-barrel weapon of death; when the affrighted Dutchman fell on the opposite side of the fence unharmed, and Henry put down his weapon without a fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having lurked till evening in a thicket near by, Charleston was entered near the depot, just at the time when the last train was leaving for Washington. Though small, this place was one of the most difficult in which to promote his object, as the slaves were but comparatively few, difficult to be seen, and those about the depot and house servants, trained to be suspicious and mistrustful of strange blacks, and true and faithful to their masters.[16] Still, he was not remiss in finding a friend and a place for the seclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This place was most admirably adapted for the gathering, being held up a run or little stream, in a bramble thicket on a marshy meadow of the old Brackenridge estate, but a few minutes walk from the town. This evening was that of a strict patrol watch, their headquarters for the night being in Worthington's old mills, from which ran the race, passing near which was the most convenient way to reach the place of gathering for the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While stealthily moving along in the dark, hearing a cracking in the weeds and a soft tramping of feet, Henry secreted himself in a thick high growth of Jamestown weeds along the fence, when he slightly discerned a small body of men as if reconnoitering the neighborhood. Sensible of the precariousness of his condition, the fugitive lie as still as death, lest by dint he might be discovered, as much fear and apprehension then prevaded the community.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charleston, at best, was a hard place for a Negro, and under the circumstances, had he been discovered, no plea would have saved him. Breathlessly crouched beneath the foliage and thorns of the fetid weed, he was startled by a voice suddenly exclaiming —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hallo there! who's that?” which provided to be that of one of the patrol, the posse having just come down the bank of the race from the mill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 120.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sahvant, mausta!” was the humble reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who are you?” further enquired the voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Zack Parker, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is that you, old Zack?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, mausta — honner bright.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, Zack, you must go with us! Don't you know that Negroes are not allowed to be out at night alone, these times? Come along!” said Davy Hunter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Honner bright, maus Davy — honner bright!” continued the old black slave of Colonel Davenport, quietly walking beside them along the mill race, the water of which being both swift and deep. “Maus Davy, I got some mighty good rum here in dis flas' — you gentmen hab some? Mighty good! Mine I tells you, maus Davy — mighty good!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Zack, we don't care to take a little,” replied Bob Flagg. “Have you had your black mouth to this flask?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Honner bright, maus Bobby — honner bright!” replied the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hunter raised the flask to his mouth, the others gathering around, each to take a draught in turn, when instantly a plunge in the water was heard, and the next moment old Zack Parker was swinging his hat in triumph on the opposite bank of the channel, exclaiming, “Honner bright, gentmen! Honner bright! Happy Jack an' no trouble!” — the last part of the sentence being a cant phrase commonly in use in that part of the country, to indicate a feeling free from all cares.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a rage the flask was thrown in the dark, and alighted near his feet upright in the tufts of grass, when the old man in turn seizing the vessel, exclaiming aloud, “Yo' heath, gentmen! Yo' good heath!” Then turning it up to his mouth, the sound heard across the stream gave evidence of his enjoyment of the remainder of the contents. “Thank'e, gentmen — good night!” when away went Zack to the disappointment and even amusement of the party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking advantage of this incident, Henry, under a guide, found a place of seclusion, and a small number of good willing spirits ready for the counsel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mine, my chile!” admonished old Aunt Lucy. “Mine hunny, how yeh go long case da all'as lookin' arter black folks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking the nearest course through Worthington's woods, he reached in good time that night the slave quarters of Captain Jack Briscoe and 925EAF. Page 121. Major Brack Rutherford. The blacks here were united by the confidential leaders of Moore's people, and altogether they were rather a superior gathering of slaves to any yet met with in Virginia. His mission here soon being accomplished, he moved rapidly on to Slaughter's, Crane's and Washington's old plantations, where he caused a glimmer of light, which until then had never been thought of, much less seen, by them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The night rounds of the patrol of the immediate neighborhood, caused a hurried retreat from Washington's — the last place at which he stopped — and daybreak the next morning found him in near proximity to Winchester, when he sought and obtained a hiding place in the woods of General Bell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The people here he found ripe and ready for anything that favored their redemption. Taylor's, Logan's, Whiting's and Tidball's plantations all had crops ready for the harvest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An' is dis de young man,” asked Uncle Talton, stooped with the age of eighty-nine years, “dat we hearn so much ob, dat's gwine all tru de country 'mong de black folks? Tang God a'mighty for wat I lib to see!” and the old man straightened himself up to his greatest height, resting on his staff, and swinging himself around as if whirling on the heel as children sometimes do, exclaimed in the gladness of his heart and the bouyancy of his spirits at the prospect of freedom before him: “I dont disagard none on 'em,” referring to the whites.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We have only `regarded' them too long, father,” replied Henry with a sigh of sorrow, when he looked upon the poor old time and care-worn slave, whose only hope for freedom rested in his efforts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I neber 'spected to see dis! God bless yeh, my son! May God 'long yeh life!” continued the old man, the tears streaming down his cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen!” sanctioned Uncle Ek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God grant it!” replied Uncle Duk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May God go wid yeh, my son, wheresomeber yeh go!” exclaimed the old slaves present; when Henry, rising from the block of wood upon which he sat, being moved to tears, reaching out his hand, said, “Well, brethren, mothers, and fathers! My time with you is up, and I must leave you — farewell!” when this faithful messenger of his oppressed brethren, was soon in the woods, making rapid strides towards Western Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 122.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wheeling, in the extreme Western part of Virginia, was reached by the fugitive, where the slaves, already restless and but few in number in consequence of their close proximity to a free state — Ohio being on the opposite side of the river, on the bank of which the town is situated — could never thereafter become contented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The “Buckeye State” steamer here passed along on a downward trip, when boarding her as a black passenger, Cincinnati in due season was reached, when the passengers were transferred to the “Telegraph No. 2,” destined for Louisville, Kentucky. Here crowding in with the passengers, he went directly to Shippenport, a small place but two miles below — the rapids or falls preventing the large class of steamers from going thence except at the time of high water — the “Crystal Palace,” a beautiful packet, was boarded, which swiftly took him to Smithland, at the confluence of the Cumberland and Ohio rivers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From this point access up the Cumberland was a comparatively easy task, and his advent into Nashville, Tennessee, was as unexpected at this time to the slaves, as it was portentous and ominous to the masters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no difficulty here in finding a seclusion, and the introduction of his subject was like the application of fire to a drought-seasoned stubble field. The harvest was ripe and ready for the scythe, long before the reaper and time for gathering came. In both town and country the disappointment was sad, when told by Henry that the time to strike had not yet come; that they for the present must “Stand still and see the salvation!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long, me son, how long we got wait dis way?” asked Daddy Luu, a good old man and member of a Christian church for upwards of forty years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't tell exactly, father, but I suppose in this, as in all other good works, the Lord's own annointed time!” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An' how long dat gwine be, honey? case I's mighty ti'ed waitin' dis way!” earnestly responded the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't tell you how long, father; God knows best.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An' how we gwine know w'en 'E is ready?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When we are ready, He is ready, and not till then is His time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“God sen we was ready, now den!” concluded the old man, blinded with tears, and who, from the reverence they had for his age and former good counsel among them, this night was placed at the head of the Gathering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 123.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carrying with him the prayers and blessings of his people here, Henry made rapid strides throughout this state, sowing in every direction seeds of the crop of a future harvest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Tennessee Henry boldly strode into Kentucky, and though there seemed to be a universal desire for freedom, there were few who were willing to strike. To run away, with them, seemed to be the highest conceived idea of their right to liberty. This they were doing, and would continue to do on every favorable opportunity, but their right to freedom by self-resistance, to them was forbidden by the Word of God. Their hopes were based on the long-talked-of promised emancipation in the state. [17]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What was your dependence,” inquired he of an old man verging on the icy surface of ninety winters' slippery pathways, “before you had this promise of emancipation?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wy, dar war Guvneh Metcalf, I sho 'e good to black folks,” replied Uncle Winson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, uncle, tell me, supposing he had not been so, what would you have then done?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wy, chile, I sho 'e raise up dat time 'sides dem maus Henry and maus John.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But what good have they ever done you? I don't see that you are any better off than had they never lived.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, chile! Da good to we black folks,” continued the old man, with a fixed belief that they were emancipationists and the day of freedom, to the slaves drew near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Satisfied that self-reliance was the furthest from their thoughts, but impressing them with new ideas concerning their rights, the great-hearted runaway bid them “Good bye, and may God open your eyes to see your own condition!” when in a few minutes Lexington was relieved of an enemy, more potent than the hostile bands of red men who once defied the military powers of Kentucky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few days this astonishing slave was again on the smooth waters of the beautiful Ohio, making speed as fast as the steamer “Queen of the West” could carry him down stream towards Grand Gulf on the great river of the Southwest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* This gentleman died on the 15th of June, 1857, in a distant territory, whither he had removed, where his excellent widow, niece and children all reside, well provided for. 925EAF. Page 124.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 26 Return to Mississippi</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The evening, for the season, was very fine; the sky beautiful; the stars shining unusually bright; while Henry, alone on the hurricane deck of the “Queen of the West,” stood in silence abaft the wheel-house, gazing intently at the golden orbs of Heaven. Now shoots a meteor, then seemingly shot a comet, again glistened a brilliant planet which almost startled the gazer; and while he yet stood motionless in wonder looking into the heavens, a blazing star whose scintillations dazzled the sight, and for the moment bewildered the mind, was seen apparently to vibrate in a manner never before observed by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At these things Henry was filled with amazement, and disposed to attach more than ordinary importance to them, as having an especial bearing in his case; but the mystery finds interpretation in the fact that the emotions were located in his own brain, and not exhibited by the orbs of Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the water plowed the steamer, the passengers lively and mirthful, sometimes amusingly noisy, whilst the adventurous and heart-stricken fugitive, without a companion or friend with whom to share his grief and sorrows, and aid in untangling his then deranged mind, threw himself in tribulation upon the humble pallet assigned him, there to pour out his spirit in communion with the Comforter of souls on high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The early rising of the passengers aroused him from apparently an abridged night of intermitting sleep, when creeping away into a by-place, he spent the remainder of the day. Thus by sleeping through the day, and watching in the night — induced by the proximity to his old home — did the runaway spend the time during the first two days of his homeward journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Falling into a deep sleep early on the evening of the third day, he was suddenly aroused about eleven o'clock by the harsh singing of the black firemen on the steamer:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Natchez under the Hill! Natchez under the Hill!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">sung to an air with which they ever on the approach of a steamer, 925EAF. Page 125. greet the place, as seemingly a sorrowful reminiscence of their ill-fated brethren continually sold there; when springing to his feet and hurrying upon deck, he found the vessel full upon the wharf boat stationed at the Natchez landing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking advantage of the moment — passing from the wheelhouse down the ladder to the lower deck — thought by many to have gone forever from the place, Henry effected without detection an easy transit to the wharf, and from thence up the Hill, where again he found himself amid the scenes of his saddest experience, and the origination and organization of the measures upon which were based his brightest hopes and expectations for the redemption of his race in the South.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 27 A Night of Anxiety</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Saturday evening, about half past seven, was it that Henry dared again to approach the residence of Colonel Franks. The family had not yet retired, as the lights still burned brilliantly in the great house, when, secreted in the shrubbery contiguous to the hut of Mammy Judy and Daddy Joe, he lay patiently awaiting the withdrawal in the mansion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's no use in talkin,' Andy, he's gittin' suspicious of us all,” said Charles, “as he threatens us all with the traders; an' if Henry don't come soon, I'll have to leave anyhow! But the old people, Andy, I can't think of leavin' them!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think da would go if da had a chance, Charles?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go? yes 'ndeed, Andy, they'd go this night if they could git off. Since the sellin' of Maggie, and Henry's talkin' to 'em, and his goin' an' takin' little Joe, and Ailcey, an' Cloe, an' Polly an' all clearin' out, they altered their notion about stayin' with ole Franks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wish we could know when Henry's comin' back. Wonder what 'e is,” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here!” was the reply in a voice so cautiously suppressed, and so familiarly distinct that they at once recognized it to be that of their long-absent and most anxiously looked-for friend. Rushing upon him, they mutually embraced, with tears of joy and anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 126.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How have you been anyhow, Henry?” exclaimed Charles in a suppressed tone. “I's so glad to see yeh, dat I ain't agwine to speak to yeh, so I ain't!” added Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, brethren, to the woods!” said Henry; when the three went directly to the forest, two and half miles from the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well now, Henry, tell us all about yourself. What you been doin'?” inquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know of nothing about myself worth telling,” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, pshaw! wot saut a way is dat, Henry; yeh wont tell a body nothin'. Pshaw, dats no way,” grumbled Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Andy, I've much to tell you; but not of myself; 'tis about our poor oppressed people everywhere I've been! But we have not now time for that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, can't you tell us nothin'?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Andy, since you must have something, I'll tell you this much: I've been in the Dismal Swamp among the High Conjurors, and saw the heads, old Maudy Ghamus and Gamby Gholar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hoop! now 'e's a talkin'! Ef 'e wasn't I wouldn't tell yeh so! An' wat da sa to yeh, Henry?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They welcomed me as the messenger of their deliverance; and as a test of their gratitude, made me a High Conjuror after their own order.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O pshaw, Henry! Da done what? Wy, ole feller, yeh is high sho 'nough!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What good does it do, Henry, to be a conjuror?” inquired Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It makes the more ignorant slaves have greater confidence in, and more respect for, their headmen and leaders.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh yes, I see now!” Because I couldn't see why you would submit to become a conjuror if it done no good.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's it, Charles! As you know, I'll do anything not morally wrong, to gain our freedom; and to effect this, we must take the slaves, not as we wish them to be, but as we really find them to be.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You say it gives power, Henry; is there any reality in the art of conjunction?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It only makes the slaves afraid of you if you are called a conjuror, that's all!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, I understand it well enough now!” concluded Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I undehstood well 'nough fuss, but I want to know all I could, dat's all!” added Andy. “Ole Maudy's a high feller, aint 'e, Henry?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 127.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh yes! he's the Head,” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” explained Henry, “he's not now Head, but Gamby Gholar, who has for several years held that important position among them. Their Council consists of Seven, called the `Heads,' and their Chief is called `the Head.' Everything among them, in religion, medicine, laws, or politics, of a public character, is carried before the Head in Council to be settled and disposed of.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now we understan',” said Andy, “but tell us, Henry, how yeh get 'long 'mong de folks whar yeh bin all dis time?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well; everywhere except Kentucky, and there you can't move them toward a strike!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Kentucky!” rejoined Andy. “I all'as thought dat de slaves in dat state was de bes' treated uv any, an' dat da bin all 'long spectin' to be free.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the very mischief of it, Andy! 'Tis this confounded `good treatment' and expectation of getting freed by their oppressors, that has been the curse of the slave. All shrewd masters, to keep their slaves in check, promise them their freedom at their, the master's death, as though they were certain to die first. This contents the slave, and makes him obedient and willing to serve and toil on, looking forward to the promised redemption. This is just the case precisely now in Kentucky. It was my case. While Franks treated me well, and made promises of freedom to my wife” — and he gave a deep sigh — “I would doubtless have been with him yet; but his bad treatment — his inhuman treatment of my wife — my poor, poor wife! — poor Maggie! was that which gave me courage, and made me determined to throw off the yoke, let it cost me what it would. Talk to me of a good master! A `good master' is the very worst of masters. Were they all cruel and inhuman, or could the slaves be made to see their treatment aright, they would not endure their oppression for a single hour!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I sees it, I sees it!” replied Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An' so do I,” added Charles, “who couldn't see that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I tells yeh, Henry, it was mighty haud for me to make up my mine to leave ole Potteh; but even sence you an' Chaules an' me made de vow togedder, I got mo' an' mo' to hate 'im. I could chop 'is head off sometime, I get so mad. I bleve I could chop off Miss Mary' head; an' I likes hur; she mighty good to we black folks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Pshaw! yes 'ndeed' ole Frank's head would be nothin' for me to 925EAF. Page 128. chop off; I could chop off mistess head, an' you know she's a good woman; but I mus' be mighty mad fus'!” said Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's it, you see. There is no danger that a `good' master or mistress will ever be harmed by the slaves. There's neither of you, Andy, could muster up courage enough to injure a `good master' or mistress. And even I now could not have the heart to injure Mrs. Franks,” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now me,” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, 'ndeed, dats a fac', case I knows I couldn' hurt Miss Mary Potteh. I bleve I'd almos' chop off anybody's head if I see 'em 'tempt to hurt 'e!” added Andy; when they heartily laughed at each other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just so!” said Henry. “A slave has no just conception of his own wrongs. Had I dealt with Franks as he deserved, for doing that for which he would have taken the life of any man had it been his case — tearing my wife from my bosom! — the most I could take courage directly to do, was to leave him, and take as many from him as I could induce to go. But maturer reflection drove me to the expedient of avenging the general wrongs of our people, by inducing the slave, in his might, to scatter red ruin throughout the region of the South. But still, I cannot find it in my heart to injure an individual, except in personal conflict.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An has yeh done it, Henry?” earnestly inquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Andy; yes, I have done it! and I thank God for it! I have taught the slave that mighty lesson: to strike for Liberty. `Rather to die as freemen, than live as slaves!' ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thang God!” exclaimed Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen!” responded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, boys, to the most important event of your lives!” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat's dat?” asked Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, get ready immediately to leave your oppressors tonight!” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Glory to God!” cried Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hallelujah!” responded Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Quietly! Softly! Easy, boys, easy!” admonished Henry, when the party in breathless silence, on tiptoe moved off from the thicket in which they were then seated, toward the city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was now one o'clock in the night, and Natchez shrouded in 925EAF. Page 129. darkness and quiet, when the daring and fearless runaway with his companions, entered the enclosure of the great house grounds, and approaced the door of the hut of Daddy Joe and Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who dat! Who dat, I say? Ole man, don' yeh hear some un knockin' at de doh?” with fright said Mammy Judy in a smothered tone, hustling and nudging the old man, who was in a deep sleep, when Henry rapped softly at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat a mautta, ole umin?” after a while inquired the old man, rubbing his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Some un at de doh!” she replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who dar?” inquired Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A friend!” replied Henry with suppressed voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole man, open de doh quick! I bleve in me soul dat Henry! Open de doh!” said mammy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the door being opened, the surprise and joy of the old woman was only equalled by the emotion of her utterance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dar! dar now, ole man! I tole 'em so, but da 'uden bleve me! I tole 'em 'e comin', but da 'uden lis'en to me! Did yeh git 'er, me son? Little Joe cum too? O Laud! whar's my po' chile! What's Margot?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To evade further inquiry, Henry replied that they were all safe, and hoping to see her and the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How yeh bin, my chile? I'se glad to see yeh, but mighty sorry eh cum back; case de wite folks say, da once git der hands on yeh da neber let yeh go 'g'in! Potteh, Craig, Denny, and all on 'em, da tryin' to fine whar yeh is, hunny!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am well, mammy, and come now to see what is to be done with you old people,” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We 'ont to be hear long, chile; de gwine sell us all to de traders!” replied mammy with a deep sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes chile,” added Daddy Joe, “we all gwine to de soul-driveh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'll go to no soul-drivers!” replied Henry, the flash of whose eyes startled Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How yeh gwine help it, chile?” kindly asked Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll show you. Come, come, mammy! You and daddy get ready, as I've come to take you away, and must be at the river before two o'clock,” said Henry, who with a single jerk of a board in the floor of the hut, had reached the hidden treasure of the old people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who gwine wid us, chile?” inquired Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 130.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Charles, Andy, and his female friend, besides some we shall pick up by the way!” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now he's a-talkin'!” jocosely said Charles, looking at Andy with a smile, at the mention of his female friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“'E ain' doin' nothin' else!” replied Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat become o' po' little Tony! 'E sleep here tonight case he not berry well. Po' chile!” sighed the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We'll take him too, of course; and I would that I could take every slave in Natchez!” replied Henry. “It is now half-past one,” said he, looking at his watch, “and against two we must be at the river. Go Andy, and get your friend, and meet us at the old burnt sycamore stump above the ferry. Come mammy and daddy, not a word for your lives!” admonished Henry, when taking their package on his back, and little Tony by the hand, they left forever the great house premises of Colonel Stephen Franks in Natchez.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On approaching the river a group was seen, which proved to consist of Andy, Clara (to whom his integrity was plighted), and the faithful old stump, their guidepost for the evening. Greeting each other with tears of joy and fearful hearts, they passed down to the water's edge, but a few hundred feet below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ferry boat in this instance was a lightly built yawl, commanded by a white man; the ferry one of many such selected along the shore, expressly for such occasions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you a pass?” demanded the boatman as a ruse, lest he might be watched by a concealed party. “Let me see it!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here, sir,” said Henry, presenting to him by the light of a match which he held in his hand for the purpose, the face of a half eagle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here is seven of you, an' I can't do it for that!” in an humble undertone supplicating manner, said the man. “I axes that for one!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weight of seven half eagles dropped into his hand, caused him eagerly to seize the oars, making the quickest possible time to the opposite side of the river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 131.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 28 Studying Head Work</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now Henry,” said Andy, after finding themselves in a safe place some distance from the landing, “you promise' w'en we stauted to show us de Noth Star — which is it?” On looking up the sky was too much obscured with clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't show it to you now, but when we stop to refresh, I'll then explain it to you,” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It high time now, chil'en, we had a mou'full to eat ef we got travel dis way!” suggested Mammy Judy, breaking silence for the first time since they left the great house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” replied Andy, “Clara and little Tony mus' wan' to eat, an' I knows wat dis chile wants!” touching himself on the breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The runaways stopped in the midst of an almost impenetrable thicket, kindled a fire to give them light, where to take their fare of cold meat, bread and butter, and cheese, of which the cellar and pantry of Franks, to which Mammy Judy and Charles had access, afforded an ample supply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whilst the others were engaged in refreshing, Henry, aside of a stump, was busily engaged with pencil and paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whar's Henry, dat 'e ain't hear eatin?” inquired Mammy Judy, looking about among the group.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I sho, ole umin, 'e's oveh dar by de stump,” replied Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat dat boy doin' dar? Henry, wat yeh doin'? Mus' be studyin' headwuck, I reckon! Sho boy! betteh come 'long an' git a mou'full to eat. Yeh ain' hungry I reckon,” said the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, we dun eatin' now. You mos' ready to tell us 'bout de Noth Star?” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I will show you,” said Henry, walking forward and setting himself in the center of the group. “You see these seven stars which I've drawn on this piece of paper — numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? From the peculiarity of the shape of their relative position to each other, the group is called the `Dipper,' because to look at them they look like a dipper or a vessel with a long handle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see it; don't you see dat, Chaules?” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, anybody could see that,” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 132.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole umin,” said Daddy Joe, “don' yeh see it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho', ole man! Ain't I lookin!” replied the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You all see it then, do you?” inquired Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, yes!” was the response.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now then,” continued Henry; “for an explanation by which you can tell the North Star, when or from whatever place you may see it. The two stars of the Dipper, numbered 6 and 7, are called the pointers, because they point directly to the North Star, a very small, bright star, far off from the pointers, generally seeming by itself, especially when the other stars are not very bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The star numbered 8, above the pointer, a little to the left, is a dim, small star, which at first sight would seem to be in a direct line with it; but by drawing a line through 7 to 8, leaves a space as you see between the star 6 and lower part of the line; or forms an angle (as the `book men' call it, Andy) of ten degrees. The star number 9 in the distance, and a little to the right, would also seem to be directly opposite the pointers; but by drawing a line through 7 to 9, there is still a space left between the lower end of the line and 6. Now trace the dotted line from 6 through the center of 7, and it leads directly to 10. This is the North Star, the slave's great Guide to Freedom! Do you all now understand it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“See it!” replied Andy. “Anybody can't see dat, ain' got sense' 'nuff to run away, an' no call to be free, dat's all! I knows all about it. I reckon I a'mos' know it betteh dan you, Henry!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dar, dar, I tole yeh so! I tole yeh dat boy studyin' head wuck, an yeh 'uden bleve me! 'E run about yendeh so much an' kick up 'e heel dat'e talk so much gramma an' wot not, dat body haudly undehstan'! I knows dat 'e bin 'splainin do. Ole man, yeh understan' im?” said Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, ole umin, dat I does! An' I' been gone forty years 'ago, I' know'd dis much 'bout it!” replied Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Above number 2 the second star of the handle of the Dipper, close to it, you will see by steadily looking, a very small star, which I call the knob or thumb-holt of the handle. You may always tell the Dipper by the knob of the handle; and the North star by the Dipper. The Dipper, during the night you will remember, continues to change its position in relation to the earth, so that it sometimes seems quite upside down.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 133.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“See here, Henry, does you know all — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stop, Andy, I've not done yet!” interrupted he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Uh, heh!” said Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When the North star cannot be seen,” continued Henry, “you must depend alone upon nature for your guide. Feel, in the dark, around the trunks or bodies of trees, especially oak, and whenever you feel moss on the bark, that side on which the moss grows is always to the north. One more explanation and then we'll go. Do you see this little round metallic box? This is called a — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat dat you call 'talic, Henry? Sho, boy! yeh head so full ob gramma an' sich like dat yeh don' know how to talk!” interrupted Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That only means iron or brass, or some hard thing like that, mammy,” explained he. “The little box of which I was speaking has in it what is called a compass. It has a face almost like a clock or watch, with one straight hand which reaches entirely across the face, and turns or shakes whenever you move the box. This hand or finger is a piece of metal called `loadstone' or `magnet,' and termed the needle of the compass; and this end with the little cross on it, always points in one direction, and that is to the north. See; it makes no difference which way it is moved, this point of the needle turns back and points that way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An mus' ye al'as go de way it pints, Henry?” inquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; not except you are running away from the South to Canada, or the free States; because both of these places are in the north. But when you know which way the north is, you can easily find any other direction you wish. Notice this, all of you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When your face is to the north, your back is to the south; your right hand to the east, and your left to the west. Can you remember this?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O yes, easy!” replied Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you will always know which way to go, by the compass showing you which is north,” explained Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What does dese letters roun' hear mean, Henry?” further inquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Only what I have already explained; meaning north, east, west, and south, with their intermediate — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dar!” interrupted Mammy Judy. “'E gone into big talk g'in! Sho!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 134.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Intermediate means between, mammy,” explained Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Den ef dat's it, I lis'en at yeh; case I want gwine bautheh my head wid you' jography an' big talk like dat!” replied the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What does a compass cost?” inquired Charles, who had been listening with intense interest and breathless silence at the information given by their much-loved fellow bondman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“One-half a dollar, or four bits, as we call it, so that every slave who will, may get one. Now, I've told you all that's necessary to guide you from a land of slavery and long suffering, to a land of liberty and future happiness. Are you now all satisfied with what you have learned?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Chauls, aint 'e high! See here, Henry, does yeh know all dat yeh tell us? Wy, ole feller, you is way up in de hoobanahs! Wy, you is conjure sho'nuff. Ef I only know'd dis befo', ole Potteh neven keep me a day. O, pshaw! I bin gone long 'go!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He'll do!” replied Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, well!” apostrophized Mammy Judy. “Dat beats all! Sence I was baun, I nebber hear de like. All along I been tellen on yeh, dat 'e got 'is head chuck cleanfull ob cumbustable, an' all dat, but yeh 'ud'n bleve me! Now yeh see!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole umin, I 'fess dat's all head wuck! Dat beats Punton! dat boy's nigh up to Maudy Ghamus! Dat boy's gwine to be mighty!” with a deep sigh replied Daddy Joe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, now, let's go!” said Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On rising from where they had all been sitting with fixed attention upon their leader and his instruction, the sky was observed through the only break in the thicket above their heads, when suddenly they simultaneously exclaimed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's the Dipper! there's the North Star!” all pointing directly to the Godlike beacon of liberty to the American slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leaving Mammy Judy and Daddy Joe, Clara and little Tony, who had quite recovered from his indisposition the early part of the night, in charge of a friend who designedly met them on the Louisiana side of the river, with heightened spirits and a new impulse, Henry, Charles and Andy, started on their journey in the direction of their newly described guide, the North Star.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 135.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Star of the North thou art not bigger, Than the diamond in my ring; Yet every black star-gazing nigger, Looks up to thee as some great thing![18] was the apostrophe of an American writer to the sacred orb of Heaven, which in this case was fully verified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the remainder of the night and next day, being Sabbath, they continued their travel, only resting when overcome wth fatigue. Continuing in Louisiana by night, and resting by day, Wednesday morning, before daybreak, brought them to the Arkansas river. At first they intended to ford, but like the rivers generally of the South, its depth and other contingencies made it necessary to seek some other means. After consultation in a canebreak, day beginning to dawn, walking boldly up to a man just loosening a skiff from its fastenings, they demanded a passage across the river. This the skiffman refused peremptorily on any pretext, rejecting the sight of a written pass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I want none of yer nigger passes!” angrily said he. “They ain't none uv 'em good 'or nothin', no how! It's no use to show it to me, ye's can't git over!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First looking meaningly and determinedly at Charles and Andy — biting his lips — then addressing himself to the man, Henry said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I have one that will pass us!” presenting the unmistaking evidence of a shining gold eagle, at the sight of which emblem of his country's liberty, the skiffman's patriotism was at once awakened, and their right to pass as American freemen indisputable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few energetic muscular exertions with the oars, and the sturdy boatman promptly landed his passengers on the other side of the river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, gentlm'n, I done the clean thing, didn't I, by jingo! Show me but half a chance an' I'll ack the man clean out. I dont go in for this slaveholding o' people in these Newnited States uv the South, nohow, so I don't. Dog gone it, let every feller have a fair shake!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dropping into his hand the ten-dollar gold piece, the man bowed earnestly, uttering —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope ye's good luck, gent'men! Ye'll al'as fine me ready when ye's come 'long this way!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 136.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 29 The Fugitives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With much apprehension, Henry and comrades passed hastily through the State of Arkansas, he having previously traversed it partly, had learned sufficient to put him on his guard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Traveling in the night, to avoid the day, the progress was not equal to the emergency. Though Henry carried a pocket compass, they kept in sight of the Mississippi river, to take their chance of the first steamer passing by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The third night out, being Monday, at daybreak in the morning, their rest for the day was made at a convenient point within the verge of a forest. Suddenly Charles gave vent to hearty laughter, at a time when all were supposed to be serious, having the evening past, been beset by a train of three Negro-dogs, which, having first been charmed, they slew at the instant; the dogs probably not having been sent on trail of them, but, after the custom of the state, baying on a general round to intimidate the slaves from clandestinely venturing out, and to attack such runaways as might by chance be found in their track.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wat's da mauttah, Chauls?” enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was just thinking,” replied he, “of the sight of three High Conjurers, who if Ghamus and Gholar be true, can do anything they please, having to escape by night, and travel in the wild woods, to evade the pursuit of white men, who do not pretend to know anything about such things.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat's a fack,” added Andy, “an' little, scronny triflin' weak, white men at dat — any one uv us heah, ought to whip two or three uv 'em at once. Dares Hugh's a little bit a feller, I could take 'im in one han' an' throw 'im oveh my head, an' ole Pottah, for his pant, he so ole an' good foh nothin, I could whip wid one hand half a dozen like 'im.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now you see, boys,” said Henry, “how much conjuration and such foolishness and stupidity is worth to the slaves in the South. All that it does, is to put money into the pockets of the pretended conjurer, give him power over others by making them afraid of him; and even old Gamby Gholar and Maudy Ghamus and the rest of the Seven Heads, with all of the High Conjurors in the Dismal Swamp, are 925EAF. Page 137. depending more upon me to deliver them from their confinement as prisoners in the Swamp and runaway slaves, than all their combined efforts together. I made it a special part of my mission, wherever I went, to enlighten them on this subject.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wandah you didn't fend 'em,” replied Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No danger of that, since having so long, to no purpose, depended upon such persons and nonsense, they are sick at heart of them, and waiting willing and ready, for anything which may present for their aid, even to the destruction of their long cherished, silly nonsense of conjuration.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thang God foh dat!” concluded Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles having fallen asleep, Andy became the sentinel of the party, as it was the arrangement for each one alternately, every two hours during rest, to watch while the other two slept. Henry having next fallen into a doze, Andy heard a cracking among the bushes, when on looking around, two men approached them. Being fatigued, drowsy, and giddy, he became much alarmed, arousing his comrades, all springing to their feet. The men advanced, who, to their gratification proved to be Eli and Ambrose, two Arkansas slaves, who having promised to meet Henry on his return, had effected their escape immediately after first meeting him, lurking in the forest in the direction which he had laid out to take.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eli was so fair as to be taken, when first seen, to be a white man. Throwing their arms about Henry, they bestowed upon him their blessing and thanks, for his advent into the state as the means of their escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While thus exchanging congratulations, the approach upstream of a steamer was heard, and at once Henry devised the expedient, and determined boldly to hail her and demand a passage. Putting Eli forward as the master, Ambrose carrying the portmanteaus which belonged to the two, and the others with bundles in their hands, all rushed to the bank of the river on the verge of the thicket; Eli held up a handkerchief as a signal. The bell tolled, and the yawl immediately lowered, made for the shore. It was agreed that Eli should be known as Major Ely, of Arkansas.[19]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seeing that blacks were of the company, when the yawl approached, the mate stood upon her forecastle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's the faction here?” cried out the sturdy mate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 138.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you bound?” enquired Eli.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“For St. Louis.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can I get a passage for myself and four Negroes?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's the name, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Major Ely, of Arkansas,” was the reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Aye, aye, sir, come aboard,” said the mate; when, pulling away, the steamer was soon reached, the slaves going to the deck, and the master to the cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On application for a stateroom, the clerk, on learning the name, desired to know his destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The State of Missouri, sir,” said Eli, “between the points of the mouth of the Ohio and St. Genevieve.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ely,” repeated the clerk, “I've heard that name before — it's a Missouri name — any relation to Dr. Ely, Major?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, a brother's son,” was the prompt reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, yes, I thought I knew the name,” replied the clerk. “But the old fellow wasn't quite of your way of thinking concerning Negroes, I believe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, he is one man, and I'm another, and he may go his way, and I'll go mine,” replied Eli.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's the right feeling, Major,” replied the clerk, “and we would have a much healthier state of politics in the country, if men generally would only agree to act on that principle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It has ever been my course,” said Eli.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Peopling a new farm I reckon, Major?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The master, keeping a close watch upon the slaves, was frequently upon deck among them, and requested that they might be supplied with more than common fare for slaves, he sparing no expense to make them comfortable. The slaves, on their part, appeared to be particularly attached to him, always smiling when he approached, apparently regretting when he left for the cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, the steamer gracefully plowing up the current, making great headway, reached the point desired, when the master and slaves were safely transferred from the steamer to the shore of Missouri.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 139.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 30 The Pursuit</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The absence of Mammy Judy, Daddy Joe, Charles, and little Tony, on the return early Monday morning of Colonel Franks and lady from the country, unmistakably proved the escape of their slaves, and the further proof of the exit of 'squire Potter's Andy and Beckwith's Clara, with the remembrance of the stampede a few months previously, required no further confirmation of the fact, when the neighborhood again was excited to ferment. The advisory committee was called into immediate council, and ways and means devised for the arrest of the recreant slaves recently left, and to prevent among them the recurrence of such things; a pursuit was at once commenced, which for the three succeeding days was carried in the wrong direction — towards Jackson, whither, it was supposed in the neighborhood, Henry had been lurking previous to the last sally upon their premises, as he had certainly been seen on Saturday evening, coming from the landing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No traces being found in that direction, the course was changed, the swiftest steamer boarded in pursuit for the Ohio river. This point being reached but a few hours subsequent to that of the fugitives, when learning of their course, the pursuers proceeded toward the place of their destination, on the Mississippi river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This point being the southern part of Missouri but a short distance above the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi, the last named river had, of necessity, to be passed, being to the fugitives only practicable by means of a ferry. The ferryman in this instance commanded a horse-boat, he residing on the opposite side of the river. Stepping up to him — a tall, raw-boned athletic, rough looking, bearded fellow — Eli saluted:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We want to cross the river, sir!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Am yers free?” enquired the ferryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Am I free! Are you free?” rejoined Eli.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I be's a white man!” replied the boatman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And so am I!” retorted Eli. “And you dare not tell me I'm not.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll swong, stranger, yer mus' 'scuse me, as I did n' take notice on yez! But I like to know if them air black folks ye got wey yer am free, cause if they arn't, I be 'sponsible for 'em 'cording to the new law, 925EAF. Page 140. called, I 'bleve the Nebrasky Complimize Fugintive Slave Act, made down at Californy, last year,” apologized and explained the somewhat confused ferryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” replied Henry, “we are free, and if we were not, I do'nt think it any part of your business to know. I thought you were here to carry people across the river.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But frien',” rejoined the man, “yer don't understan' it. This are a law made by the Newnited States of Ameriky, an' I be 'bliged to fulfill it by ketchin' every fugintive that goes to cross this way, or I mus' pay a thousand dollars, and go to jail till the black folks is got, if that be's never. Yer see yez can't blame me, as I mus' 'bey the laws of Congress I'll swong it be's hardly a fair shake nuther, but I be 'bliged to 'bey the laws, yer know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well sir,” replied Henry, “we want to cross the river.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me see yez papers frien'?” asked the ferryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My friend,” said Henry, “are you willing to make yourself a watch dog for slaveholders, and do for them that which they would not do for themselves, catch runaway slaves? Don't you know that this is the work which they boast on having the poor white men at the North do for them? Have you not yet learned to attend to your own interests instead of theirs? Here are our free papers,” holding out his open hand, in which lay five half eagle pieces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jump aboard!” cried the ferryman. “Quick, quick!” shouted he, as the swift feet of four hourses were heard dashing up the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scarcely had the boat moved from her fastenings, till they had arrived; the riders dismounted, who presenting revolvers, declared upon the boatman's life, instantly, if he did not change the direction of his boat and come back to the Missouri shore. Henry seized a well-charged rifle belonging to the boatman, his comrades each with a well-aimed six-barreled weapon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Shoot if you dare!” exclaimed Henry, the slaveholders declining their arms — when, turning to the awestricken ferryman, handing him the twenty-five dollars, said, “your cause is a just one, and your reward is sure; take this money, proceed and you are safe — refuse, and you instantly die!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I be to do right,” declared the boatman, “if I die by it,” when applying the whip to the horses, in a few moments landed them on the Illinois shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 141.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This being the only ferry in the neighborhood, and fearing a bribe or coercion by the people on the Illinois side, or the temptation of a high reward from the slave-catchers, Henry determined on eluding, if possible, every means of pursuit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are your horses worth?” enquired he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They can't be no use to your frien' case they is both on 'em bline, an' couldn't travel twenty miles a day, on a stretch!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you any other horses?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They be all the horses I got; I gineraly feed a spell this side. I lives over here — this are my feedin' trip,” drawled the boatman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What will you take for them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, frien', they arn't wuth much to buy, no how, but wuth good lock to me for drawin' the boat over, yer see.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did they cost you in buying them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I o'ny giv six-seven dollars apiece, or sich a maiter for 'em' when I got 'em, an' they cos me some two-three dollars, or sich a matter, more to get 'em in pullin' order, yer see.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you sell them to me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hadn't ort to part wey 'em frien', as I do good lock o' bisness hereabouts wey them air nags, bline as they be.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here are thirty dollars for your horses,” said Henry, putting into his hand the money in gold pieces, when, unhitching them from their station, leading them out to the side of the boat, he shot them, pushing them over into the river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Farewell, my friend,” saluted Henry, he and comrades leaving the astonished ferryman gazing after them, whilst the slaveholders on the other shore stood grinding their teeth, grimacing their faces, shaking their fists, with various gesticulations of threat, none of which were either heard, heeded or cared for by the fleeting party, or determined ferryman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taking a northeasterly course of Indiana, Andy being an accustomed singer, commenced, in lively glee and cheerful strains, singing to the expressive words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are like a band of pilgrims, In a strange and foreign land, With our knapsacks on our shoulders, And our cudgels in our hands, 925EAF. Page 142. We have many miles before us. But it lessens not our joys, We will sing a merry chorus, For we are the tramping boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then joined in chorus the whole party — We are all jogging, Jog, jog, jogging, And we're all jogging, We are going to the North!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Wabash river becoming the next point of obstruction, a ferry, as in the last case, had also to be crossed, the boatman residing on the Indiana side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you free?” enquired the boatman, as the party of blacks approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We are,” was the reply of Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you from?” continued he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We are from home, sir,” replied Charles, “and the sooner you take us across the river, just so much sooner will we reach it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still doubting their right to pass he asked for their papers, but having by this time become so conversant with the patriotism and fidelity of these men to their country, Charles handing the Indianan a five dollar piece, who on seeing the outstretched wings of the eagle, desired no further evidence of their right to pass, conveying them into the state, contrary to the statutes of the Commonwealth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On went the happy travelers without hinderance, or molestation, until the middle of the week next ensuing.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 31 The Attack, Resistance, Arrest</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The travel for the last ten days had been pleasant, save the necessity in the more southern part of the state, of lying-by through the day and traveling at night — the fugitives cheerful and full of hope, nothing transpiring to mar their happiness, until approaching a village in the center of northern Indiana.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 143.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Supposing their proximity to the British Provinces made them safe, with an imprudence not before committed by the discreet runaways, when nearing a blacksmith's shop a mile and a half from the village, Andy in his usual manner, with stentorian voice, commenced the following song:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I'm on my way to Canada, That cold and dreary land: The dire effects of slavery, I can no longer stand. My soul is vexed within me so, To think that I'm a slave, I've now resolved to strike the blow, For Freedom or the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All uniting in the chorus, O, righteous Father Wilt thou not pity me; And aid me on to Canada, Where fugitives are free? I heard old England plainly say, If we would all forsake, Our native land of Slavery, And come across the lake.[20]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There, Ad'line! I golly, don't you hear that?” said Dave Starkweather, the blacksmith, to his wife, both of whom on hearing the unusual noise of singing, thrust their heads out of the door of a little log hut, stood patiently listening to the song, every word of which they distinctly caught. “Them's fugertive slaves, an' I'll have 'em tuck up; they might have passed, but for their singin' praise to that darned Queen! I can't stan' that no how!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” replied Adaline, “I'm sure I don't see what they sing to her for; she's no 'Merican. We ain't under her now, as we Dave?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No we ain't, Ad'line, not sence the battle o' Waterloo, an' I golly, we wouldn't be if we was. The 'Mericans could whip her a darned sight easier now than what they done when they fit her at Waterloo.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 144.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Lah me, Dave, you could whip 'er yourself, she ai'nt bigger nor tother wimin is she?” said Mrs. Starkweather.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No she ain't, not a darn' bit!” replied he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dave, ask em in the shop to rest,” suggested the wife in a hurried whisper, elbowing her husband as the party advanced, having ceased singing so soon as they saw the faces of white persons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Travlin', I reckon?” interrogated the blacksmith. “Little tired, I spose?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes sir, a little so,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn't come far, I 'spect?” continued he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not very,” carelessly replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take seat there, and rest ye little,” pointing to a smoothly-worn log, used by the visitors of the shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you,” said Henry, “we will,” all seating themselves in a row.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take little somethin?” asked he; stepping back to a corner, taking out a caddy in the wall, a rather corpulent green bottle, turning it up to his mouth, drenching himself almost to strangulation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We don't drink, sir,” replied the fugitives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Temperance, I reckon?” enquired the smith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Rather so,” replied Henry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Kind o' think we'll have a spell o' weather?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” said Andy, “dat's certain; we'll have a spell a weatheh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On entering the shop, the person at the bellows, a tall, able-bodied young man, was observed to pass out at the back door, a number of persons of both sexes to come frequently look in, and depart, succeeded by others; no import being attached to this, supposing themselves to be an attraction, partly from their singing, and mainly from their color being a novelty in the neighborhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During conversation with the blacksmith, he after eyeing very closely the five strangers, was observed to walk behind the door, stand for some minutes looking as if reading, when resuming his place at the anvil, after which he went out the back door. Curiosity now, with some anxiety induced Henry to look for the cause of it, when with no little alarm, he discovered a handbill fully descriptive of himself and comrades, having been issued in the town of St. Genevieve, offering a heavy reward, particularizing the scene at the Mississippi ferry, the killing of the horses as an aggravated offense, because depriving a poor man of his only means of livelihood, being designed to strengthen inducements to apprehend them, the bill being signed “John Harris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 145.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evening now ensuing, Henry and comrades, the more easily to pass through the village without attraction, had remained until this hour, resting in the blacksmith shop. Enquiring for some black family in the neighborhood, they were cited to one consisting of an old man and woman, Devan by name, residing on the other side, a short distance from the village.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ye'll fine ole Bill of the right stripe,” said the blacksmith knowingly. “Ye needn' be feard o' him. Ye'll fine him and ole Sally just what they say they is; I'll go bail for that. The first log hut ye come to after ye leave the village is thern; jist knock at the door, an' ye'll fine ole Bill an' Sally all right blame if ye don't. Jis name me; tell 'em Dave Starkweather sent ye there, an' blamed if ye don't fine things at high water mark; I'm tellin' ye so, blamed if I ain't!” was the recommendatior of the blacksmith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you for your kindness,” replied Henry, politely bowing as they rose from the log. “Goodbye, sir!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Devilish decent lookin' black fellers,” said the man of the anvil, complimenting, designedly for them to hear. “Blamed if they ain't as free as we is — I golly they is!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without, as they thought, attracting attention, passing through the village a half mile or more, they came to a log hut on the right side of the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How yeh do fren? How yeh come on?” saluted a short, rather corpulent, wheezing old black man. “Come in. Hi! Dahs good many on yeh; ole 'omin come, heah's some frens!” calling his wife Sally, an old woman, shorter in stature, but not less corpulent than he, sitting by a comfortable dry-stump fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How is yeh, frens? How yeh do? come to da fiah, mighty cole!” said the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Quite cool,” replied Andy, rubbing his hands, spreading them out, protecting his face from the heat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yeh is travelin, I reckon, there is good many go' long heah; we no call t'ask 'em whah da gwine, we knows who da is, case we come from dah. I an, ole man once slave in Faginny; mighty good country fah black folks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sally set immediately about preparing something to give her guests a good meal. Henry admonished them against extra trouble, but they insisted on giving them a good supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Deeming it more prudent, the hut being on the highway, Henry 925EAF. Page 146. requested to retire until summoned to supper, being shown to the loft attained by a ladder and simple hatchway, the door of which was shut down, and fastened on the lower side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The floor consisting of rough, unjointed board, containing great cracks through which the light and heat from below passed up, all could be both seen and heard, which transpired below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seeing the old man so frequently open and look out at the door, and being suspicious from the movements of the blacksmith and others, Henry affecting to be sleepy, requested Billy and his wife when ready, to awaken them, when after a few minutes, all were snoring as if fast asleep, Henry lying in such a position as through a knothole in the floor, to see every movement in all parts of the room. Directly above him in the rafter within his reach, hung a mowing scythe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now's yeh time, ole man; da all fas' asleep, da snorin' good!” said old Sally, urging Billy to hasten, who immediately left the hut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hearts of the fugitives were at once “in their mouths,” and with difficulty it was by silently reaching over and heavily pressing upon each of them, Henry succeeded in admonishing each to entire quietness and submission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently entered a white man, who whispering with Sally left the room. Immediately in came old Bill, at the instant of which, Henry found his right hand above him, involuntarily grasped firmly on the snath of the scythe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Whah's da?” enquired old Bill, on entering the hut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho da whah yeh lef' em!” replied the old woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Spose I kin bring 'em in now?” continued old Bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bring in who?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Da white folks: who else I gwine fetch in yeh 'spose?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bettah let em 'tay whah da is, an' let de po' men lone, git sumpen t' eat, an' go 'long whah da gwine!” replied Sally, deceptively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Huccum yeh talk dat way? Sho yeh tole me go!” replied Billy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn' reckon yeh gwine bring 'em on da po' cretahs dis way, fo' da git moufful t' eat an' git way so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How I gwine let 'em go now de white folks all out dah? Say Sally? Dat jis what make I tell yeh so!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bettah let white folks 'lone, Willum! dat jis what I been tellin' on yeh. Keep foolin' 'long wid white folks, bym'by da show yeh! I no 925EAF. Page 147. trus' white man, no how. Sho! da no fren' o' black folks. Bus spose body 'blige keep da right side on 'em long so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ole 'omin,” said Bill, “yeh knows we make our livin' by da white folks, an' mus' do what da tell us, so whah's da use talkin' long so. 'Spose da come in now?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sho, I tole yeh de man sleep? gwine bring white folks on 'em so? give po' cretahs no chance? Go long, do what yeh gwine do; yeh fine out one dese days!” concluded Sally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having stealthily risen to their feet standing in a favorable position, Henry in whispers declared to his comrades that with that scythe he intended mowing his way into Canada.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Impatient for their entrance, throwing wide open the door of the hut, which being the signal, in rushed eleven white men, headed by Jud Shirly, constable, Dave Starkweather the blacksmith, and Tom Overton as deputies; George Grove, a respectable well-dressed villager, stood giving general orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With light and pistol in hand, Franey, mounting the stairway commanded a surrender. Eli, standing behind the hatchway, struck the candle from his hand, when with a swing of the scythe there was a screech, fall, and groan heard, then with a shout and leap, Henry in the lead, they cleared the stairs to the lower floor, the white men flying in consternation before them, making their way to the village, alarming the inhabitants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fugitives fled in great haste continuing their flight for several miles, when becoming worn down and fatigued, retired under cover of a thicket a mile from a stage tavern kept by old Isaac Slusher of German descent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The villagers following in quick pursuit, every horse which could be readily obtained being put on the chase, the slaves were overtaken, fired upon — a ball lodging in Charles' thigh — overpowered, and arrested. Deeming it, from the number of idlers about the place, and the condition of the stables, much the safest imprisonment, the captives were taken to the tavern of Slusher, to quarter for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On arriving at this place, a shout of triumph rent the air, and a general cry “take them into the barroom for inspection! Hang them! Burn them!” and much more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the captives were derided, scoffed at and ridiculed, turned around, limbs examined, shoved about from side to side, then ordered 925EAF. Page 148. to sit down on the floor, a noncompliance with which, having arranged themselves for the purpose, at a given signal, a single trip by an equal number of whites, brought the four poor prisoners suddenly to the floor on the broad of their back, their heads striking with great force. At this abuse of helpless men, the shouts of laughter became deafening. It caused them to shun the risk of standing, and keep seated on the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles having been wounded, affected inability to stand, but the injury being a flesh wound, was not serious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We'll show ye yer places, ye black devils!” said Ned Bradly, a rowdy, drawing back his foot to kick Henry in the face, as he sat upon the floor against the wall, giving him a slight kick in the side as he passed by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't do that again, sir!” sternly said Henry, with an expression full of meaning, looking him in the face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several feet in an instant were drawn back to kick, when Slusher interfering, said, “Shendlemans! tem black mans ish prishners! You tuz pring tem into mine housh, ant you shandt puse tem dare!” when the rowdies ceased abusing them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, gentlemen,” said Tom Overton, a burly, bullying barroom person, “we'd best git these blacks out of the way, if they's any fun up tonight.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I cot plendy peds, shendlemans, I ondly vants to know who ish to bay me,” replied Slusher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I golly,” retorted Starkweather, “you needn't give yourself no uneasiness about that Slusher. I think me, and Shirly, and Grove is good for a night's lodging for five niggers, anyhow!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm in that snap, too!” hallooed out Overton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Golly! Yes, Tom, there's you we like to forgot, blamed if we didn't!” responded Starkweather.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat ish all right nough zo far as te plack man's ish gonzern, put ten dare ish to housh vull o' peoples, vot vare must I gheep tem?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We four,” replied Grove, “will see you paid, who else? Slusher, we want it understood, that we four stand responsible for all expenses incurred this night, in the taking of these Negroes,” evidently expecting to receive as they claimed, the reward offered in the advertisement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dat vill too, ten,” replied Slusher. “Vell, I ish ready to lite tese black mans to ped.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 149.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No Slusher,” interrupted Grove, “that's not the understanding, we don't pay for beds for niggers to sleep in!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, by Molly!” replied Overton. “Dogged if that ain't going a leetle too far! Slusher, you can't choke that down, no how you can fix in. If you do as you please with your own house, these niggers is in our custody, and we'll do as we please with them. We want you to know that we are white men, as well as you are, and can't pay for niggers to sleep in the same house with ourselves.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gents,” said Ned Bradly, “do you hear that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What?” enquired several voices.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, old Slusher wants to give the niggers a room upstairs with us!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“With who?” shouted they.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“With us white men.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, blamed if he does!” replied Starkweather.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We won't stand that!” exclaimed several voices.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where's Slusher?” enquired Ben West, a discharged stage driver, who hung about the premises, and now figured prominently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here ish me, shendlemans!” answered Slusher, coming from the back part of the house. “Andt you may do as you please midt tem black mans, pud iv you dempt puse me, I vill pudt you all out mine housh!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The stable, the stable!” they all cried out. “Put the niggers in the stable, and we'll be satisfied!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tare ish mine staple — you may pud tem vare you blease,” replied the old man, “budt you shandt puse me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Securely binding them with cords, they were placed in a strongly built log stable closely weather-boarded, having but a door and window below, the latter being closely secured, and the door locked on the outside with a staple and padlock. The upper windows being well secured, the blacks thus locked in, were left to their fate, whilst their captors comfortably housed, were rioting in triumph through the night over the misfortune, and blasted prospects for liberty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 150.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 32 The Escape</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This night the inmates of the tavern revelled with intoxication; all within the building, save the exemplary family of the stern old German, Slusher, who peremptorily refused from first to last, to take any part whatever with them, doubtless, being for the evening the victims of excessive indulgence in the beverage of ardent spirits. Now and again one and another of the numerous crowd gathered from the surrounding neighborhood, increasing as the intelligence spread, went alone to the stable to examine the door, reconnoiter the premises, and ascertain that the prisoners were secure. The company getting in such high glee that, fearing a neglect of duty, it became advisable to appoint for the evening a corps of sentinels whose special duty, according to their own arrangements, should be to watch and guard the captives. This special commission being one of pecuniary consideration, Jim Franey, the township constable, the rowdy Ned Bradly, and Ben West the discharged stage driver, who being about the premises, readily accepted the office, entering immediately on the line of duty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The guard each alternately every fifteen minutes went out to examine the premises, when one and a half of the clock again brought around the period of Ben West's duty. Familiar with the premises and the arrangement of the stables, taking a lantern, West designed closely to inspect their pinions, that no lack of duty on his part might forfeit his claim to the promised compensation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When placing them in the stable, lights then being in requisition, Henry discovered in a crevice between the wall an the end of the feed-trough a common butcher knife used for the purpose of repairing harness. So soon as the parties left the stable, the captives lying with their heads resting on their bundles, Henry arising, took the knife, cutting loose himself and companions, but leaving the pinions still about their limbs as though fastened, resumed his position upon the bundle of straw. The scythe had been carelessly hung on a section of the worm fence adjoining the barn, near the door of the prison department, their weapons having been taken from them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, boys,” enquired West, holding up the lantern, “you're all 925EAF. Page 151. here, I see: do you want anything? Take some whiskey!” holding in his hand a quart bottle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The rope's too tight around my ankle!” complained Charles. “Its took all the feeling out of my leg.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dropping upon his knees to loosen the cord, at this moment, Henry standing erect brandishing the keen glistening blade of the knife before him — his companions having sprung to their feet — “Don't you breathe,” exclaimed the intrepid unfettered slave, “or I'll bury the blade deep in your bosom! One hour I'll give you for silence, a breach of which will cost your life.” Taking a tin cup which West brought into the stable, pouring it full to the brim, “Drink this!” said Henry, compelling the man who was already partially intoxicated, to drink as much as possible, which soon rendered him entirely insensible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, boys!” exclaimed he, locking the stable, putting the key into his pocket, leaving the intoxicated sentinel prostrated upon the bed of straw intended for them, and leaving the tavern house of the old German Slusher forever behind them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next period of watch, West being missed, Ned Bradly, on going to the stable, finding the door locked, reported favorably, supposing it to be still secure. Overton in turn did the same. When drawing near daylight — West still being missed — Franey advised that a search be made for him. The bedrooms, and such places into which he might most probably have retired, were repeatedly searched in vain, as calling at the stable elicited no answer, either from him nor the captives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun was now more than two hours high, and word was received from the village to hasten the criminals in for examination before the magistrate. Determining to break open the door, which being done, Ben West was found outstretched upon the bed of straw, who, with difficulty, was aroused from his stupor. The surprise of the searchers on discovering his condition, was heightened on finding the escape of the fugitives. Disappointment and chagrin now succeeded high hopes and merriment, when a general reaction ran throughout the neighborhood; for the sensation at the escape even became greater than on the instance of the deed of resistance and success of the capture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all the disappointments connected with this affair, there was none to be regretted save that of the old German tavern keeper, Isaac Slusher, who, being the only pecuniary sufferer, the entire crowd revelling at his expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 152.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gonvound dish bishnesh!” exclaimed Slusher with vexation. “Id alwaysh cosht more dan de ding ish wordt. Mine Got! afder dish I'll mindt mine own bishnesh. Iv tem Soudt Amerigans vill gheep niggersh de musht gedch dem demzelve. Mine ligger ish ghon, I losht mine resht, te niggersh rhun avay, an' I nod magk von zent!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Immediate pursuit was sent out in search of the runaways but without success; for, dashing on, scythe in hand, with daring though peaceable strides through the remainder of the state and that of Michigan, the fugitives reached Detroit without further molestation or question from any source on the right of transit, the inhabitants mistaking them for resident blacks out from their homes in search of employment.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 33 Happy Greeting</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After their fortunate escape from the stables of Isaac Slusher in Indiana, Henry and comrades safely landed across the river in Windsor, Essex County, Canada West, being accompanied by a mulatto gentleman resident of Detroit, who from the abundance of his generous heart, with others there, ever stands ready and has proven himself an uncompromising, true and tried friend of his race, and every weary traveler-on a fugitive slave pilgrimage, passing that way.[21]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is dis Canada? Is dis de good ole British soil we hear so much 'bout way down in Missierppi?” exclaimed Andy. “Is dis free groun'? De lan' whar black folks is free! Thang God a'mighty for dis privilege!” When he fell upon his hands and knees and kissed the earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor fellow! he little knew the unnatural feelings and course pursued toward his race by many Canadians, those too pretending to be Englishmen by birth, with some of whom the blacks had fought side by side in the memorable crusade made upon that fairest portion of Her Majesty's Colonial Possessions, by Americans in disguise, calling themselves “Patriots.” He little knew that while according to fundamental British Law and constitutional rights, all persons are equal in the realm, yet by a systematic course of policy and artifice, his race with few exceptions in some parts, excepting the Eastern 925EAF. Page 153. Province, is excluded from the enjoyment and practical exercise of every right, except mere suffrage-voting — even to those of sitting on a jury as its own peer, and the exercise of military duty. He little knew the facts, and as little expected to find such a state of things in the long-talked of and much-loved Canada by the slaves. He knew not that some of high intelligence and educational attainments of his race residing in many parts of the Provinces, were really excluded from and practically denied their rights, and that there was no authority known to the colony to give redress and make restitution on the petition or application of these representative men of his race, which had frequently been done with the reply from the Canadian functionaries that they had no power to reach their case. It had never entered the mind of poor Andy, that in going to Canada in search of freedom, he was then in a country where privileges were denied him which are common to the slave in every Southern state — the right of going into the gallery of a public building — that a few of the most respectable colored ladies of a town in Kent County, desirous through reverence and respect, to see a British Lord Chief Justice on the Bench of Queen's Court, taking seats in the gallery of the court house assigned to females and other visitors, were ruthlessly taken hold of and shown down the stairway by a man and “officer” of the Court of Queen's Bench for that place. Sad would be to him the fact when he heard that the construction given by authority to these grievances, when requested to remedy or remove them, was, that they were “local contingencies to be reached alone by those who inflicted the injuries.” An emotion of unutterable indignation would swell the heart of the determined slave, and almost compel him to curse the country of his adoption. But Andy was free — being on British soil — from the bribes of slaveholding influences; where the unhallowed foot of the slavecatcher dare not tread; where no decrees of an American Congress sanctioned by a president born and bred in a free state and himself once a poor apprentice boy in a village, could reach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus far, Andy was happy; happy in the success of their escape, the enlarged hopes of future prospects in the industrial pursuits of life; and happy in the contemplation of meeting and seeing Clara.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were other joys than those of Andy, and other hopes and anticipations to be realised. Charles, Ambrose, and Eli, who, though with hearts overflowing with gratitude, were silent in holy praise to 925EAF. Page 154. heaven, claiming to have emotions equal to his, and conjugal expectations quite as sacred if not yet as binding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The first thing now to be done is to find our people!” said Henry with emotion, after the excess of Andy had ceased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are they?” inquired the mulatto gentleman. “And what are their names?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Their names at home were Frank's Ailcey, Craig's Polly, and Little Joe, who left several months ago; and an old man and woman called Daddy Joe and Mammy Judy; a young woman called Clara Beckwith, and a little boy named Tony, who came on but a few days before us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come with me, and I'll lead you directly to him!” replied the mulatto gentlemen; when taking a vehicle, he drove them to the country a few miles from Windsor, where the parties under feelings such as never had been experienced by them before, fell into the embrace of each other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dar now, dar! wat I tell you? Bless de laud, ef dar ain' Chaules an' Henry!” exclaimed Mammy Judy, clapping her hands, giving vent to tears which stole in drops from the eyes of all. “My po' chile! My po' Margot!” continued she in piteous tones as the bold and manly leader pressed closely to his bosom his boy, who now was the image of his mother. “My son, did'n yeh hear nothing bout er? did'n yeh not bring my po' Margot?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, mammy, no! I have not seen and did not bring her! No, mammy, no! But — — !” When Henry became choked with grief which found an audible response from the heart of every child of sorrow present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clara commenced, seconded by Andy and followed by all except him the pierce to whose manly heart had caused it, in tones the most affecting:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O, when shall my sorrow subside! And when shall my troubles be ended; And when to the bosom of Christ be conveyed, To the mansions of joy and bliss! To the mansions of joy and bliss!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Falling upon their knees, Andy uttered a most fervent prayer, invoking Heaven's blessing and aid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 155.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Amen!” responded Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hallelujah!” cried Clara, clapping her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Glory, glory, glory!” shouted Ailcey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O laud! W'en shall I get home!” mourned Mammy Judy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tis good to be here, chilen! 'Tis good to be here!” said Daddy Joe, rubbing his hands quite wet with tears — when all rising to their feet met each other in the mutual embraces of Christian affection, with heaving hearts of sadness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We have reason, sir,” said Henry addressing himself to the mulatto gentleman who stood a tearful eye witness to the scenes, “we have reason to thank God from the recesses of our hearts for the providential escape we've made from slavery!” which expression was answered only by trickles down the gentleman's cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first care of Henry was to invest a portion of the old people's money by the purchase of fifty acres of land with improvements suitable, and provide for the schooling of the children until he should otherwise order. Charles by appointment in which Henry took part, was chosen leader of the runaway party, Andy being the second, Ambrose and Eli respectively the keepers of their money and accounts, Eli being a good penman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now,” said Henry, after two days rest, “the time has come and I must leave you! Polly, as you came as the mistress, you must now become the mother and nurse of my poor boy! Take good care of him — mammy will attend to you. Charles, as you have all secured land close to, I want you to stand by the old people; Andy, you, Ambrose, and Eli, stand by Charles and the girls, and you must succeed, as nothing can separate you; your strength depending upon your remaining together.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Henry, is yeh guine sho' nuff?” earnestly enquired Andy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I must go!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wait little!” replied Andy, when after speaking aside with Eli and Ambrose, calling the girls they all whispered for sometime together; occasional evidence of seriousness, anxiety, and joy marking their expressions of countenance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Provincial regulations requiring a license, or three weeks report to a public congregation, and that many sabbaths from the altar of a place of worship to legalise a marriage, and there being now no time for either of these, the mulatto gentleman who was still with them 925EAF. Page 156. being a clergyman, declared, that in this case no such restrictions were binding; being originally intended for the whites and the free, and not for the panting runaway slave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank God for that! That's good talk!” said Charles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ef it aint dat, 'taint nothin! Dat's wat I calls good black talk!” replied Andy, causing the clergyman and all to look at each other with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The party gathered standing in a semicircle, the clergyman in the center, a hymn being sung and prayer offered — rising to their feet, and an exhortation of comfort and encouragement being given, with the fatherly advice and instructions of their domestic guidance in after life by the aged man of God; the sacred and impressively novel words: “I join you together in the bonds of matrimony!” gave Henry the pleasure before leaving of seeing upon the floor together, Charles and Polly, Andy and Clara, Eli and Ailcey, “as man and wife forever.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Praise God!” exclaimed poor old mammy, whose heart was most tenderly touched by the scene before her, contrasting it by reflection with the sad reminiscence of her own sorrowful and hopeless union with Daddy Joe, with whom she had lived fifty years as happily as was possible for slaves to do.[22]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bless de laud!” responded the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young wives all gave vent to sobs of sympathy and joy, when the parson as a solace sung in touching sentiments:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Daughters of Zion! awake from thy sadness! Awake for they foes shall oppress thee no more. Bright o'er the hills shines the day star of gladness Arise! for the night of they sorrow is o'er; Daughters of Zion, awake from thy sadness! Awake for they foes shall oppress thee no more!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“O glory!” exclaimed Mammy Judy, when the scene becoming most affecting; hugging his boy closely to his bosom, upon whose little cheek and lips he impressed kisses long and affectionate, when laying him in the old woman's cap and kissing little Tony, turning to his friends with a voice the tone of which sent through them a thrill, he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the instincts of a husband, I'll have her if living! If dead, by 925EAF. Page 157. impulses of a Heaven-inspired soul, I'll avenge her loss unto death! Farwell, farwell!” the tears streaming as he turned from his child and its grandparents; when but a few minutes found the runaway leader seated in a car at the Windsor depot, from whence he reached the Suspension Bridge at Niagara en route for the Atlantic.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER 34 A Novel Adventure</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the Suspension Bridge through the great New York Central Railway to Albany, and thence by the Hudson River, Henry reached the city on the steamer “Hendrick Hudson,” in the middle of an afternoon. First securing a boarding house — a new thing to him — he proceeded by direction to an intelligence office, which he found kept by a mulatto gentleman.[23] Here inquiring for a situation as page or valet on a voyage to Cuba, he deposited the required sum, leaving his address as “Gilbert Hopewell, 168 Church St.” — changing the name to prevent all traces of himself out of Canada, whither he was known to have gone, to the free states of America, and especially to Cuba whence he was going, the theater of his future actions. In the evening Henry took a stroll through the great thoroughfare, everything being to him so very novel, that eleven o'clock brought him directly in front of doubtless the handsomest saloon of the kind in the world, situated on the corner of Broadway and Franklin street. Gazing in at the luxurious and fashionable throng and gaieties displayed among the many in groups at the tables, there was one which more than all others attracted his attention, though unconscious at the time of its doing so. The party consisted of four; a handsome and attractive young lady, accompanied by three gentlemen, all fine looking, attractive persons, wearing the undress uniforms of United States naval officers. The elder of these was a robust, commanding person in appearance, black hair, well mixed with white, seemingly some sixty years of age. One of the young gentlemen was tall, handsome, with raven-black hair, moustache, and eyes; the other, medium height, fair complexion, hair, moustache and whiskers, with blue eyes; while the young lady ranked 925EAF. Page 158. of medium proportions in height and size, drab hair, fair complexion, plump cheeks and hazel eyes, and neatly dressed in a maroon silk habit, broadly faced in front and cuffed with orange satin, the collar being the same, neatly bound with crimson. While thus musing over the throng continually passing in and out, unconsciously Henry had his attention so fixed on this group, who were passing out and up Broadway, involuntarily leaving the window through which he had been gazing, he found himself following them in the crowd which throng the street closely, foot to foot. Detecting himself and about to turn aside, he overheard the elderly gentleman in reply to a question by the lady concerning the great metropolis, say, that in Cuba where in a few days they would be, recreation and pleasure were quite equal to that of New York. Now drawing more closely he learned that the company were destined for Havana, to sail in a few days. His heart beat with joy, when turning and making his way back, he found his boarding house without difficulty. Henry once more spent a sleepless night, noted by restless anxiety; and the approach of morning seemed to be regulated by the extent of the city. If thoughts could have done it, the great Metropolis would have been reduced to a single block of houses, reducing in like manner the night to a few fleeting moments. Early in the morning he had risen, and impatiently pacing the floor, imagined that the people of that city were behind the age in rising. Presently the summons came for breakfast, and ere he was seated a note was handed him reading thus:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Letter Intelligence Office — Leonard St., New York, March 5th, 1853 Gilbert Hopewell: There is now an opportunity offered to go to Cuba, to attend on a party of four — a lady and three gentlemen — who sail for Havana direct (see Tribune of this morning). Be at my office at half past ten o'clock, and you will learn particulars, which, by that time I will have obtained. Respectfully, B.A.P.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">925EAF. Page 159. Though the delay was but an hour, Henry was restless, and when the time came was punctually in his place. The gentleman who called to meet him at the Intelligence office Henry recognized as one of the party seen the previous evening at the great saloon in Broadway. Arrangements having been completed concerning his attendance and going with them, “Meet me in an hour at the St. Nicholas, and commence your duties immediately,” said the gentleman, when politely bowing, Henry turned away with a heart of joy, and full of hope. Promptly to the time he was at the hotel, arranging for a start; when he found that his duties consisted in attendance particularly on the young lady and one of the young gentlemen, and the other two as occasion might require. The company was composed of Captain Richard Paul, the elderly gentleman; Lieutenant Augustus Seeley, the black-haired; passed Midshipman Lawrence Spencer, the light-haired gentleman, and Miss Cornelia Woodward. Miss Woodward was modest and retiring, though affable, conversant and easy in manner. In her countenance were pictured an expression of definite anxiety and decisive purpose, which commanded for her the regard and esteem of all whom she approached. Proud without vanity, and graceful without affectation, she gained the esteem of everyone; a lady making the remark that she was one of the most perfect of American young ladies. After breakfast the next morning they embarked on the steam packet “Isabella,” to sail that day at eleven o'clock. Of the gentlemen, Augustus Seeley gave to Miss Woodward the most attention, though nothing in her manner betrayed attachment except an occasional sigh. Henry, for the time, appeared to be her main dependence; as shortly after sailing she manifested a disposition to keep in retirement as much as possible. Though a girl of tender affections, delicate sentiments, and elevated Christian graces, Cornelia was evidently inexperienced and unprepared for the deceptious impositions practiced in society. Hence, with the highest hopes and expectations, innocently unaware of the contingencies in life's dangerous pathway, hazarding her destiny on the simple promise of an irresponsible young man, but little more than passed midshipman, she reached the quay at Moro Castle in less than six days from the Port of New York.</field>
