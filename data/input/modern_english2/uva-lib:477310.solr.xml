      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was a village shop. The name over the window was "Ginger and Pickles.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a little small shop just the Illustration of text. right size for Dolls—Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits. Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket- handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything —except a few things that you want in a hurry—like bootlaces, hair-pins and mutton chops. Illustration of Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, Peter, Jeremy Fisher, Ginger and Pickles in the shop trying to buy things. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop. Ginger was a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles was a terrier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles. Black and White illustration of Ginger, the cat, salivating over mice as they leave her store. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The shop was also patronized by mice—only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I cannot bear,'' said he, "to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels.'' Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have the same feeling about rats,'' replied Pickles, "but it would never do to eat our own customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On the contrary, they would go nowhere,'' replied Ginger gloomily. Mice looking at Cream Crackers, Water Biscuits, and Oatmeal Wafers to buy from Ginger and Pickles. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village. She did not give credit.) Illustration of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle buying goods from Pickles, the dog. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now the meaning of "credit'' is this—when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it—she says she will pay another time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Pickles makes a low bow and says, "With pleasure, madam,'' and it is written down in a book. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles. Illustration of a ledger, a scale, and a till box plus text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there is no money in what is called the "till.'' Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a pennyworth of peppermints. Blank Page. Lots of animals including Peter Rabbit, chicks, Squirrel Nutkin, a goose, a rooster and mice all standing outside of Ginger and Pickles' store. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's. Ginger and Pickles eating. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They ate them by candle-light after the shop was closed. Pickles and Ginger stare at a policeman from inside their store. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog licence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police,'' said Pickles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is your own fault for being a terrier; I do not require a licence, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog.'' Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned. I have tried in vain to get a licence upon credit at the Post Office;'' said Pickles. "The place is full of policeman. I met one as I was coming home.'' Two little girls with a toy policeman cornering Pickles. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all,'' replied Ginger. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things— Where are all the cream crackers?'' "You have eaten them yourself,'' replied Ginger. Black and white illustration of a rat and a mouse standing on a box asking for goods from Ginger and Pickles. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They did accounts. They added up sums and sums, and sums.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three-quarters of snuff since October.'' Blank Page. Ginger sitting at the desk doing bills, the toy policeman stands outside the window looking in behind him. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with comp ts ' '' replied Ginger. Toy policeman writing in a notebook in the shop. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. They came out of the back parlour. There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a note-book! Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!'' spluttered Ginger behind a sugar- barrel, "he's only a German doll!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle. Policeman sticking his pencil in his mouth and Ginger looking at him behind a barrel. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pickles barked till he was hoarse. But still the policeman took no notice. He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length on his last little rush —Pickles found that the shop was empty. The policeman had disappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the envelope remained. Ginger and Pickles watch the policeman leave. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman? I am afraid it is a summons,'' said Pickles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No,'' replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, "it is the rates and taxes, £3 19 11 ¾.'' Ginger reads the policeman's letter to Pickles. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is the last straw,'' said Pickles, "let us close the shop.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They put up the shutters, and left. But they have not removed from the neighbourhood. In fact some people wish they had gone further. Ginger and Pickles trying to close-up the shop Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ginger is living in the warren. I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable. Illustration of Pickles with a yellow coat being a gamekeeper. Blank Page. Text Page. Pickles is at present a gamekeeper. Black and white illustration of all the very upset animals outside of Ginger and Pickles' closed store. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience. Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a half-penny; and she continued to refuse to give credit. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course there are the trades- men's carts—the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But a person cannot live on "seed wigs'' and sponge-cake and butter- buns—not even when the sponge- cake is as good as Timothy's! Illustration of the animals buying goods from a traveling wagon. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles. Illustration of Miss DorMouse and her children selling peppermints and candles. Mrs. DorMouse stands at her front door. Blank Page. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But they did not keep "self-fitting sixes''; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle. Mice watching their newly bought candles melt in the warm weather. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides—the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints. Illustration of the angered mice coming back to complain to Miss DorMouse who is unsympathetic. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when Mr John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but "very snug;'' which is not the way to carry on a retail business Illustration of the same angered mice complaining to Mr. John DorMouse in his bed. Mr. Dormouse hides under the covers. Animals: Peter Rabbit, Sqirrel Nutkin, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle reading Sally Henny Penny's opening sign and text page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to re-open the shop— "Henny's Opening Sale! Grand Blank Page.

      <field name="fulltext">The poster really was most 'ticing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a rush upon the opening day. The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit canisters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless. Animals: Mice, Peter Rabbit, Sqirrel Nutkin, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle, Jeremy Fisher brousing through all the wonderful bargains in Sally Henny Penny's store. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is something to please everybody.</field>
