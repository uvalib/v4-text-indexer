      <field name="fulltext">If we were to single out one book from those that have been published this season as exhibiting in the highest degree that rare creative power called literary genius, we should name The Greater Inclination , by Edith Wharton. The book has met with a fair reception in the press, but it does not seem to us that enough emphasis has been laid upon the originality of the work. And not only has Mrs. Wharton brought to these stories a remarkable power of insight and imagination, but the phase of life in America which she has chosen for treatment may be said to be altogether new in her hands. Her work is the more remarkable when we know that the processes by which her results are reached have been gained largely through intuition and sympathy. One would almost imagine in reading these stories that the author must have suffered and gone deep into life in order to bring up from its depths such knowledge of the world as is disclosed in her pages. And yet this is far from being the case. Mrs. Wharton was born little more than thirty years ago in New York. On both sides she comes of old New York stock, her mother being a Rhinelander. Most of her time has been spent between New Greyscale image of Edith Wharton with two dogs, one perched on her right shoulder, the other in her left arm. York and Newport, and she has also lived abroad, especially in Italy, of which country she is very fond. Her husband, Mr. Edward Wharton, is a member of the Philadelphia family of that name, and was married to Miss Edith Jones fully ten years ago. Both are passionately fond of animals, and have been for years the moving spirits in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Rhode Island. The photograph which we present of Mrs. Wharton with her two pet dogs is the only one that was available for reproduction here, but it is very characteristic when we bear in mind her love of animals. Her first stories began to appear in Scribner's and the Century some years ago; one of them especially, called "Mrs. Manstey's View," published in Scribner's , attracted a great deal of attention at the time of its appearance. She is also the author of a book on domestic architecture and home decoration, published by the Messrs. Scribner, which was reviewed in these pages a year ago last April. A review of The Greater Inclination appears on another page.</field>
