      <field name="heading_text">AN INTERESTING REPRESENTATIVE OF A VANISHING RACE. — BY B. O. FLOWER. —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the most interesting characters at the World's Fair at Chicago was the simple-hearted and earnest champion of his people, Simon Pokagon, chief of the now small tribe of Pottawatomie Indians. This tribe, it will be remembered, sprang from the powerful Algonquin family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a peculiar, if gloomy, interest attached to the appearance as well as the address of this chief of a vanishing tribe and race, owing to the fact that in the boyhood of this patriarch the very spot occupied by Chicago was the home of the Indian, and where to-day stand the palatial residences of such men as George H. Pullman, Marshall Field, and Philip D. Armour, was the scene of the massacre of the garrison of Fort Dearborn by the Pottawatomies. In this connection I desire to quote a graphic description of the past and present relating to this memorable place as given by Mr. W. T. Stead. *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the rim of the shore of Lake Michigan, on a spot then a desolate waste of sand hills, but now crowded with palaces, stands, leafless and twigless, the trunk of an old cottonwood tree, which marks the site of the massacre of the garrison. Four score years and more have passed since the thirsty sand drank the life-blood of the victims of that Indian war, but still the gaunt witness of the fight looks down upon the altered scene. In 1812, when the British were at war with the French in Europe, our Canadian representatives were busy fighting and diplomatizing against the French and their allies on the Great Lakes. The Americans had struck in on their own account on the side of the French, and the British had just whipped them out of Detroit and Michigan. War is war, and British and Americans fought on, each using as best it could the Indian tribes which swarmed in the unsettled country. The British made allies of Tecumseh, the great chief of the Pottawatomies, and Fort Dearborn, the American outpost at Chicago, became the immediate objective point of the allies after the Americans had been driven out of Detroit and Michigan. The officer in charge, Capt. Heald, a weak incompetent, decided to evacuate by arrangement with the Indians. Whether this decision was right or wrong, he carried it out in the worst possible way. He first summoned the Indians to a council and promised them all the goods in the fort, including the ammunition and fire-water, and then broke his word by throwing all the powder and shot down a well and emptying the liquor into the river. The Indians, furious at Simon Pokagon A man wearing a plaid coat over a grey vest and patterned shirt stitched with a large cross. this breach of faith, waited until the little party had reached the open, a good mile distant from the fort, when they attacked and massacred all but twenty-five soldiers and eleven women and children. The scene of the massacre is marked by the venerable trunk of the cottonwood tree, while close by the genius of a Dane has commemorated, at the cost of a millionnaire, the evacuation and the massacre, in a spirited group surmounting a pedestal with bas-reliefs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sculptor by a happy inspiration has selected as his motif the one incident of that bloody fray that possesses other than a gory interest. While the Pottawatomies were scalping or tomahawking the palefaces, regardless either of sex or age, Mrs. Helm, the daughter of Mr. Kinzie, the patriarchal settler of early Chicago, was rescued from imminent death by Black Partridge, an Indian chief who had long known and loved her father. The group on the summit of the pedestal represents Mrs. Helm desperately struggling to seize her assailant's scalping-knife, while the splendid chief, Black Partridge, intervenes to snatch her from her impending doom. The surgeon, who was slain, is receiving his death-blow at her feet, while a frightened child weeps, scared by the gleam of the tomahawk and the firing of the muskets. The bas-reliefs, which are not in very much relief, tell the story of the evacuation, the march, and the massacre, and enable the least imaginative observer, as he looks out over the gray expanse of the lake, to picture something of the din and alarm of that bloody August day, and to recall, too, something of the elements of heroism and of humanity which redeemed the grim tale of Indian war.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the mind full of the Pottawatomies and their tomahawks, pondering upon the possibilities of latent goodness surviving in the midst of the scalping-knife savagery of the redskin tribes, you tear yourself away from the traditions of Black Partridge, the Kinzies, and the rest, and find yourself confronted by the palaces of millionnaires. Mr. George M. Pullman's stately mansion stands in the shade of the cottonwood tree, his conservatory is erected upon the battle-field, and he lives and dines and sleeps where the luckless garrison made its last rally. Prairie Avenue, which follows the line of march, is a camping-ground of millionnaires. With an area of five blocks forty of the sixty members of the Commercial Club have established their homes. Mr. Marshall Field and Mr. Philip Armour live near together on the east side of the avenue a little further south. Probably there are as many millions of dollars to the square inch of this residential district as are to be found in any equal area on the world's surface. It is the very Mecca of Mammon, the Olympus of the great gods of Chicago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What strange instinct led these triumphant and militant chiefs of the Choctaw civilization of our time to cluster so thickly around the bloody battle-field of their Pottawatomie forbears? "Methinks the place is haunted," and a subtle spell woven of dead men's bones attracts to the scene of the massacre the present representatives of a system doomed to vanish like that of the redskins before the advancing civilization of the new social era. Four score and two years have hardly passed since the braves of Tecumseh slew the children in the Dearborn baggage wagon; but the last of the Pottawatomies have long since vanished from the land over which they roamed the undisputed lords.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Long before four score years have rolled by the millionnaire may be as scarce as the Pottawatomie, and mankind may look back upon the history of trusts and combines and competitions with the same feelings of amazement and compassion that we now look back upon the social system that produced Tecumseh and Black Partridge. How the change will come we may not be able to see any more than the Pottawatomies were able to foresee the value of the real estate on which Chicago was built. They parted with it in fee simple for three cents an acre, and did not get Indian napkin ring made of colored quills and birch bark. A napkin ring. It is decorated with white and black diamond shapes, and stitched crosses. Indian napkin reing made of sweet grass. A woven napkin ring. even that. But the Pottawatomie passed and the millionnaire will pass, and men will marvel that such things could be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Chicago Day Liberty bell was rung for the first time during the Exposition, * and Chief Pokagon was selected to ring the bell and also to deliver an address. During the course of his remarks, which were delivered in the presence of more than half a million people, he made the following touching and suggestive utterances:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the untiring efforts of a few friends of another race I greet you. If any of you, my countrymen, feel the sting of neglect because your rights have been ignored in taking part in the World's great Fair until now, I beseech you to lay aside all bitterness of spirit, and with hearts so pure and good that these noble mothers and daughters that have so labored in our behalf for this may rejoice that the kind seed they have sown has not fallen on dry and barren ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let us not crucify ourselves by going over the bloody trails we have trod in other days; but rather let us look up and rejoice in thankfulness in the present, for out of the storm-cloud of darkness that is round about us we now see helping hands stretched out to aid and strengthen us, while above the roar and crash of the cyclone of civilization are heard many voices demanding that to the red man justice must be done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my infancy I was taught to love my chief and tribe; but since then the great West has been swallowed up by the white man, and by adoption we are the children of this great Republic, hence we must teach loyalty to this nation to our children, and solemnly impress them that the war-path leads but to the grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question comes up to us again and again, "What can be done for the best good of the remnant of our race?" The answer to me is plain and clear, and it matters not how distasteful it may seem to us. We must give up the pursuits of our fathers. However dear we love the chase we must give it up. We must teach our children to give up the bow and arrow that is born in their hearts; and in place of the gun we must take the plough and live as the white men do. They are all around about our homes. The game is gone never to return; hence it is vain to talk about support from game and fish. Many of our people are now successful in raising grain and stock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fac-simile of preface of "Red Men's Greeting" printed on birch bark. Text printed on birch bark. The piece is entitled "By The Author."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My object in publishing the "Red Man's Greeting" on the bark of the white birch tree, is out of loyalty to my own people, and gratitude to the Great Spirit, who in his wisdom provided for our use for untold generations, this most remarkable tree with manifold bark used by us instead of paper, being of greater value to us as it could not be injured by sun or water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out of the bark of this wonderful tree were made hats, caps and dishes for domestic use, while our maidens tied with it the knot that sealed their marriage vow; wigwarms were made of it, as well large canoes that outrode the violent storms on lake and sea; it was also used for light and fuel at our war councils and spirit dances. Originally the shores of our northern lakes and streams were fringed with it and evergreen, and the white charmingly contrasted with the green mirrored from the water was indeed beautiful, but like the red man this tree is vanishing from our forests.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Alas for us; our day is o'er Our fires are out from shore to shore; No more for us the wild deer bouns— The plow is on our hunting grounds. The pale man's ax rings through our woods, The pale man's sail skims o'er floods; Our pleasant springs are dry. Our children—look, by power oppressed, Beyond the mountains of the west— Our children go—to die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What they have done we all can do. Our children must learn. They owe no allegiance to any clan or power on earth except the United States. They must learn and love to wear the stars and stripes, and at all times to rejoice that they are American citizens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our children must be educated and learn the different trades of the white men. Thanks to the Great Spirit, this government has already established a few schools for that purpose, and to learn of the success you have but to visit the Indians' school in these grounds, examine the work of the children, see the different articles they have made, examine their writing-books, and you will be convinced that they will be able to compete with the dominant race.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was pained to learn that some who should have been interested in our people discouraged our coming to the Fair, claiming openly that we are heartless, soulless, and godless. Now let us all as one pray the Great Spirit that he will open the eyes of their understanding and teach them to know that we are human as well as they; teach them to know that</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within the recess of the native's soul There is a secret place, which God doth hold; And though the storms of life do war around, Yet still within His image fixed is found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am getting to be an old man. I often feel one foot is uplifted to step into the world beyond. But I am thankful that the measure of my days has been lengthened out, that I am able to stand before you in this great congress of people, in this four hundredth year of the white man's advent in our fathers' land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The breadth of thought and the innate spirituality which permeate this address are no less marked than the stoical acceptance of conditions with an earnest determination to make the best of circumstances as they exist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some months prior to the opening of the Exposition Chief Pokagon published a little booklet entitled "The Red Men's Greeting," printed on the bark of the white birch tree. This "Greeting" was pitched in a minor key. The plaintive note of the representative of a warrior race who had beheld the glory of his people vanish characterizes it throughout. It is so entirely out of the ordinary in all particulars that I reproduce in this paper the author's preface enlarged and photographed from a leaf of the birch bark on which it is printed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Flower reviewed this work in THE ARENA on its appearance, which called forth an interesting letter, from which I quote the following extract:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have written especially for you a brief article on "Geese," hoping the reading of it will please you. Of course you know our race love the chase, which leads our minds to see many strange things in the brute creation that awaken our mirth. If the article does not interest you, receive it and think of it as the author wrote it and sends it to you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The enclosure referred to above is one of the most characteristic, and in some particulars unique, sketches I have read in years, simple in treatment and revealing in a marked degree the child mind, while carrying with it the keen perception of the true son of the forest, coupled with ethical deductions as relating to man's life which suggest the ancient stoic philosopher, as will be seen by the copy given below.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">AN INDIAN'S OBSERVATION ON THE MATING OF GEESE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having studied the habits and languages of beasts, birds, and insects of forest and field since early childhood, I have obtained a knowledge of them not learned in books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In this article I shall present a few interesting peculiarities of the goose family. In springtime of each year these fowls have their courtship and marriage. All the geese-men select the oldest goose-woman of the flock or society, age being admired above all other qualifications of a good wife. Hence, in view of so many suitors for the oldest goose-woman, it can only be settled in a fair field fight in single combats. Everything must be fair on both sides. Two men geese march out in front of the flock, straighten up in front of each other, firmly grasping in their bills the feathers on each other's necks, while they commence pounding each other with their wings in a most brutal manner, being cheered by the flock in wild strains of admiration. When one gives up the contest, another takes his turn, and so on until there is but one acknowledged hero, and he, amid cheers and shouts, marches off with his choice, the oldest dame goose of the flock, who congratulates him on his success, telling him how long and well he fought, and how proud she is of him; promising how she will strive to be a good wife, on account of Fac-simile of letter written by the chief of the Pottawatomie Indians. A hand-written letter from Simon Pokagon to B.O. Flowers. the great sacrifice he has made for her, while he joyfully drinks in all her flattery, smiles and laughs, and, puffing, chats, telling her how he would sooner have died in the fight than to have lost her, his first and only choice. And so the contest goes on, until each man goose in turn is the acknowledged hero of the remaining flock, and marches in turn with the oldest woman goose as his bride, all of which laugh and chat together, apparently well satisfied with the result; when all have paired off but the remaining woman goose, who may be a handsome bright-eyed maiden, the last man goose takes her as his bride with a disappointed heart, while she, poor maiden, accepts him through force of circumstances, with saddest of feelings, cheered by hopes alone that the time will come when on account of her age she will be sought for as her older sisters have been.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the last pair have reluctantly agreed to become man and wife, Indian mat made of birch bark, colored quills, and sweet grass, and presented with napkin ring to Mrs. Flower by Chief Pokagon. An oval-shaped woven mat decorated with stitched fir branches and pine cones. if there are any left of the flock of either sex unprovided for, they tag around after the last pair as mourners of the unhappy marriage. I have closely watched these husbands and wives as they have commenced housekeeping, have seen them pluck the down from their bodies and line their nests, talking over with each other the prospects of the future, and when the eggs were laid amid the softest down, have seen both man and wife guard them with equal care. In childhood, I thought this mode of securing wives would lead to disagreement and discord; yet not having known of a case of divorce among them, I watched them still closer and have not heard an unkind word or seen an unkind look. Have watched them when their gosling children were first hatched, and seen each guard them with greatest care, and with their bended necks stretched over their little brood, with chats and laughs tenderly lead them to some pond or river side, then into the water with them swim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have admired the first opening flowers of spring, and joyed to see young lambs skip and play, yet never has my admiration with joy been so moved as when I've seen these infant goslings by their parents led into the waters of some stream or lake, and gently, with their parents, float about as if moved by some power divine, the very semblance of themselves just beneath the surface of the rippling waves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And to myself oft have said, "How strange it is!" Before the marriage vow is said these geese-men select their wives without their consent and fight it out against all rivalry, but when settled down in life all "man's rights" are laid aside and "woman's rights" are never born, but "equal rights" are all in all. CHIEF POKAGON. Author of "Red Men's Greeting," Hartford, Mich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Flower had prepared notes for a sketch of the life of this venerable head of a once powerful tribe, when she was stricken with a severe illness from overwork. I communicated these facts to the chief, and received the following touching and appreciative letter, which is elsewhere reproduced in fac-simile:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HARTFORD, MICH., Sept. 12, 1895. MY DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 9th at hand. As I read what you said of your wife's illness my heart responded, "How very sad that one so young, so fair and wise, should suffer so, and perhaps it has all been brought about in laboring for others." I am fully satisfied to accept her intentions for what she intended to say of me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am getting to be an old man, passing over the threshold of my home here into the wigwam beyond where there are many rooms. I trust and believe that your wife may fully recover, and that she may be spared many years to benefit her race. If you think it will not disturb her, say to her that she has my best wishes and the prayers of my heart. Very Respectfully yours, S. POKAGON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This noble representative of the red man has been a strenuous advocate of temperance and virtue. On one occasion he wrote:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I am gone I wish no stone to rise above my last resting-place as oft is done, to tell, not what men were, but what they should have been. However, I desire to leave upon the printed page an epitaph which all may read. That shall be my most solemn protest and prayer against the introduction of alcohol in any form among my people; and to accomplish that desire of my heart I see no hope except by the complete overthrow of the rum-shop and the destruction of all that can intoxicate, together with cigarettes, the father and mother of palsy and cancer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In touching upon the subject of the Indian, even in a cursory manner, I cannot forbear expressing my strong convictions in regard to this race, which, as it appears to me, has been so ruthlessly treated by our civilization,—a civilization claiming to be based on a universal brotherhood. To me few subjects are at once so humiliating, pathetic, and essentially tragic as the history of the Indian so rapidly disappearing from our continent in the light of the treatment received by him from a civilization which claims to follow the meek and lowly Galilean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been observed that the early Spanish conquerors of the Western Hemisphere used the sword and the cross; the writer sagely remarking that after the sword had done its work the cross was raised over the lifeless form. Nor have we of the more northern climes much to boast of over the Spaniards. It is true that the treatment meted out to the Indians by such Christ-like souls as William Penn and Roger Williams stands in bright relief against the inky background of betrayal, appropriation of the Indian's land and slaughter of his people; but such instances, while revealing the potentiality of conquest on the spiritual plane, its feasibility and practicability, are merely the exceptions to the rule which mark the savagery of a civilization which claims to follow the mandates of the Sermon on the Mount. It is true that the Indian retaliated, and was in many cases the aggressor, if we can call people the aggressors who object to having their native land taken from them by aliens. This sentiment has been well put from the Indians' point of view in the following stanza:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shall not one line lament our forest race, you struck out from wild creation's face? Freedom!—the self-same freedom you adore— Bade us defend our violated shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of the savagery and brutality exhibited by the Indian in many cases, I would merely observe that it is manifestly unfair to judge them by the standards of a people who have enjoyed Christian civilization for many centuries and who have behind them the lessons and warnings, the glory and the gloom of Roman, Grecian, Syrian, Chaldean, and Egyptian civilizations. Moreover, if one calls to mind the methods which marked the terrible religious struggle of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Europe, and will remember how human ingenuity was taxed to its utmost to devise methods of horrible torture which were remorselessly meted out by those claiming to be Christians to others claiming to be Christians, he will, I think, feel it wisest to pass very lightly over the charge of excessive cruelty on the part of those he flippantly terms savages. Had the Indian submitted more tamely he would have been characterized by this same self-engrossed class, who delight in echoing the brutally false phrase that "there is no good Indian but a dead Indian," as cowardly and unworthy of the land which for unnumbered generations had been the land of his fathers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Christ Came to Chicago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The News of Plymouth, Mich., on Feb. 8, 1893, observed editorially that "the elder Pokagon was one of the chiefs to whom was ceded by treaty the ground on which Chicago now stands, and which was afterward conveyed back to the government through conniving of the swindling agents, for a consideration that amounted to about three cents per acre."</field>
