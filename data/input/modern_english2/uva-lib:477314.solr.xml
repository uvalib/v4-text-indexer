      <field name="heading_text">The Tale of Mr. Tod</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. It depicts five rabbits peering over a rock and across a meadow at Mr. Tod, a fox, standing in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I HAVE made many books about well-behaved people. Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod. Nobody could call Mr. Tod "nice." The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off. He was of a wandering habit and he had foxey whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing of a meadow scene, by Beatrix Potter. Mr Tod, a fox, sits under a tree, and several ducks swim in a pond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day he was living in a stick-house in the coppice, causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer. Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved out ; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved in ; (without asking leave).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face. He was not nice in his habits. He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.</field>

A shovel rests against the bank nearby. A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, in which Tommy Brock sits on a hill overlooking a vale. Mr. Tod is in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the day-time, he always went to bed in his boots. And the bed which he went to bed in, was generally Mr. Tod's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit-pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce. He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years. He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family. Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.

A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting Mr. Bouncer standing next to a shallow burrow in which four rabbit-babies are huddled. The little rabbit-babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick. They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole. To tell the truth—old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps. He complained bitterly about the A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Bouncer talks to Tommy Brock in the middle of the woods, near a rabbit hole. A small shovel and a trap lay at Tommy Brock's feet. He is holding his hands up, as if gesticulating. scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them. And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter—"I have not had a good square meal for a fortnight, I am living on pig-nuts. I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!" said Tommy Brock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed-cake and "a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine." Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke . . . . . . . . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Flopsy and Benjamin came back—old Mr. Bouncer woke up. Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit-babies had disappeared!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole. But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand. He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Flopsy and Benjamin have returned to the rabbit burrow, and their basket and umbrella lay in the middle of the floor. Flopsy Rabbit is wringing Mr. Bouncer's ears, and Benjamin Rabbit is leaving the burrow through the hole.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot-mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood. Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap. A little stream crossed the way. Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths—but the smell that made Benjamin stop, was not the smell of flowers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Tommy Brock is standing on a path, in the woods. In his right hand he holds a small shovel, and slung over his left shoulder is a brown sack, containing the rabbit babies. He is looking down at a mole trap he has set. A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting Mr. Tod's stick-house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod's stick house was before him and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home. There was not only a foxey flavour in proof of it—there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring; his whiskers twitched. Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something. Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way. Upon the top of the wall, there were again the marks of badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow. He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock. It was getting late in the afternoon. Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air. One of them in a blue coat by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.—"Cousin Peter! Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!" shouted Benjamin Bunny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing of Benjamin Rabbit standing in the middle of a meadow, by Beatrix Potter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin? Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no, no! He's bagged my family—Tommy Brock—in a sack —have you seen him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins! Did he come this way? Please tell me quick!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Benjamin talks to his cousin Peter Rabbit in the middle of a meadow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since . . . . he said they were caterpillars ; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had a sack with something 'live in it; I watched him set a mole trap. Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning." Benjamin did so. A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Benjamin stands on the top of a bank inlaid with a stone wall, and looks down at Peter, who stands in a small grassy area surrounded by flowers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;" said Peter reflectively, "but there are two hopeful circumstances. Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshment. He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast." "Which way?" "Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself. I know very well which way. Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick-house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks. I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be passing." (Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of a twitter. They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen. He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent What a nasty person!" said Peter.</field>

A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Benjamin and Peter talk to Cottontail Rabbit, who is sitting in a chair outside of her burrow, surrounded by her rabbit babies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures. Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half-grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance. Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.—"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They climbed up and up;—"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole." "They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbours. Come on Cousin Benjamin!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously. The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag—Mr. Tod had made one of his homes. It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it. The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter, in which Benjamin and Peter climb through a rocky, wooded area. A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. It depicts a cave-like house surrounded by woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumble-down pig-stye. There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight. It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin sighed with relief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting a dark kitchen with a stove, table, pots and pans, and other utensils and furnishings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. There was an immense empty pie-dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt-cellar, mustard and a chair—in short, preparations for one person's supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting the kitchen table set with a plate, glass, utensils and a mustard pot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits. The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house. It was damp and smelly, and over-grown with thorns and briars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rabbits shivered in their shoes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh my poor rabbit babies! What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!" sighed Benjamin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They crept up to the bedroom window. It was closed and bolted like the kitchen. But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the window-sill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room inside was so dark, that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise —a slow deep regular snoring grunt. And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.—"He has gone to bed in his boots," whispered Peter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Benjamin and Peter peer through the low window of a stone house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin, who was all of a twitter, pulled Peter off the window-sill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed. Nothing could be seen of the young family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood. There were many unpleasant things lying about, that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. It was a shocking place, and very dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window. They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, in which Benjamin and Peter sit side by side in the dark, looking into the window of a house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In half an hour the moon rose over the wood. It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window. But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace— a little iron door belonging to a brick oven, of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window— the little door opposite shook in answer. The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing of an old-fashioned brick oven with a little iron door, by Beatrix Potter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery. They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive—the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel. They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank. They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. It is morning in an empty kitchen, and Benjamin and Peter are visible through the window. A bowl and pitcher sit upon the sill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They dug and dug for hours. They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor. Benjamin was on his back, scratching upwards. Peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. He called out that it was morning—sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel, shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws. Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill. In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay-followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely. They did the most foolish thing that they could have done. They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers. First he had been upset by breaking the plate. It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod. Then the midges had been very bad. And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing of Mr. Tod walking up a hill, by Beatrix Potter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As usual, when out of humour, he determined to move house. First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it. Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger. No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. This is the same as the frontispiece illustration. Mr. Tod walks through a grassy, wooded area, holding a large walking stick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to. He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently. It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation. Once when it flew screaming over his head— Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key. He sniffed and his whiskers bristled. The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty. He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it. Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting Mr. Tod entering his kitchen, and seeing his table laid with a plate, a glass, silverware and mustard pot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious. There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar and his table-cloth that he had left folded up in the dresser—all set out for supper (or breakfast)—without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise—a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry. His whiskers bristled and his coat-collar stood on end with rage.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again. By degrees he ventured further in—right into the bedroom. When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury. But when he was inside—he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear. He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom. Twice he brought in his walking-stick, and once he brought in the coal-scuttle. But he thought better of it, and took them away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod is standing in the doorway of his bedroom, looking at Tommy Brock who is sleeping peacefully, and with his boots still on, under the covers of Mr. Tod's bed. Mr. Tod makes a motion to poke the bed with his walking stick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he came back after removing the coal-scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep. He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores. They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window. It creaked; he turned round with a jump. Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye—shut it hastily. The snores continued.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather uneasy, (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom). He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window sill. The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock snored conscientiously. Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. There was a noise outside the window. Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house. On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow. If he had had any idea who was inside it, he would have pulled them out quickly.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin, but fortunately he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window. He was puzzled.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod stands on a chair to the left of his bed, attaching a hook to the end of the clothesline and hanging it on the bedstead curtain rod, directly over the head of sleeping Tommy Brock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook—hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock. The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead. His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Mr. Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied. So was the counterpane. Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.) Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed as though nothing would waken him—not even the flapping rope across the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavoured to get up again with the pail of water. He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, in which Mr. Tod carries a pail of water into his bedroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)—he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug. The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,—except one eye.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the window sill to the tree outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort," said Mr. Tod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting Mr. Tod's tail as the fox disappears through the door leading outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise," said Mr. Tod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also—grinning immensely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Tommy Brock sits up in the bed, looking at the clothesline which runs tautly from the bedstead to the window. Over the bed hands a pail of water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod is in the woods outside his house, and is gnawing through the taut clothesline tied to one of the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod sits outside of his house, holding the gnawed end of the clothesline in his mouth, and looking dejecteldy at his bedroom window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened something —much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket and it was not snoring any longer .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop drip of water trickling from the mattress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod has dropped the clothesline, which now hangs from the window to the ground, and has moved to the sill to peer through the window into his bedroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes—there was no doubt about it—it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun," said Mr. Tod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot-water bottle."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter, depicting Mr. Tod striding toward the door of his house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen— "First I will arrange the hole— then I will drag out that person in the blanket . . ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the door. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Tod pokes his head through the door into the kitchen, where he encounters Tommy Brock sitting at the table, drinking tea from a china cup. Tommy is turned toward the door in greeting.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Everything was upset except the kitchen table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry Jam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod. A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a watercolor by Beatrix Potter. It depicts the scene of the fight between Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock in Mr. Tod's kitchen. The two animals are wrestling among pieces of broken pottery, upset furniture, overturned kettles and pots, and smashed dishes. Benjamin and Peter peer through the doorway in the background of the picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as the coast was clear Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them while I watch at the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Benjamin was frightened—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" No they are not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Yes they are!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone quarry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. It shows Flopsy Rabbit and Mr. Bouncer at home in the rabbit hole. Mr. Bouncer crouches next to a chair, out of the sight of Flopsy, who has her back to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The day passed heavily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 24-bit, 300 dpi image of a black and white drawing by Beatrix Potter. Mr. Bouncer is hiding behind a chair in the rabbit hole, watching Flopsy, who is sweeping the floor with a broom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit hole.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They soon recovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and Benjamin told their story—but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.</field>
