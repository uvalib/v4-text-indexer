      <field name="fulltext">FIRST SONGS I R OSY plum-tree, think of me When Spring comes down the world! II There's dozens full of dandelions Down in the field: Little gold plates, Little gold dishes in the grass. I cannot count them, But the fairies know every one. III Oh wrinkling star, wrinkling up so wise, When you go to sleep do you shut your eyes? IV The red moon comes out in the night. When I'm asleep, the moon comes pattering up Into the trees. Then I peep out my window To watch the moon go by. V Sparkle up, little tired flower Leaning in the grass! Did you find the rain of night Too heavy to hold? VI The garden is full of flowers All dancing round and round. John-flowers, Mary-flowers, Polly-flowers, Cauli-flowers, They dance round and round And they bow down and down To a black-eyed daisy. VII There is going to be the sound of bells And murmuring. This is the brook dance: There is going to be sound of voices, And the smallest will be the brook: It is the song of water You will hear, A little winding song To dance to . . . VIII Blossoms in the growing tree, Why don't you speak to me? I want to grow like you, Smiling . . . smiling . . . IX If I find a moon, I will sing a moon-song. If I find a flower, What song shall I sing, Rose-song or clover-song? X The blossoms will be gone in the winter: Oh apples, come for the June! Can you come, will you bloom? Will you stay till the cold? XI I will sing you a song, Sweets-of-my-heart, With love in it, (How I love you!) And a rose to swing in the wind, The wind that swings roses! XII Will you love me to-morrow after next, As if I had a bird's way of singing?</field>

      <field name="fulltext">GARDEN OF THE WORLD THE butterfly swings over the violet That stands by the water, In the garden that sings All day. The sun goes up in the dawn, The water waves softly. In the trees are little breezes, In the garden trees. Blue hills and blue waters! The big blue ocean lies around in the sun Watching his waves toss . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THEATRE-SONG EAGLES were flying over the sky And mermaids danced in the gold waters. Eagles were calling over the sky And the water was the color of blue flowers. Sunshine was 'flected in the waves Like meadows of white buds. This is what I saw On a morning long ago . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VELVETS By a Bed of Pansies THIS pansy has a thinking face Like the yellow moon. This one has a face with white blots: I call him the clown. Here goes one down the grass With a pretty look of plumpness; She is a little girl going to school With her hands in the pockets of her pinafore. Her name is Sue. I like this one, in a bonnet, Waiting, Her eyes are so deep! But these on the other side, These that wear purple and blue, They are the Velvets, The king with his cloak, The queen with her gown, The prince with his feather. These are dark and quiet And stay alone. I know you, Velvets, Color of Dark, Like the pine-tree on the hill When stars shine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TWO SONGS After Hearing the Wagner Story-book I THE birds came to tell Siegfried a story, A story of the woods out of a tree: How the ring was fairy And there were things it could do for him Day and night: How the river flowed green and wavy Under the Rainbow Bridge, And Br√ºnnhilda slept in a wreath of fire. Grane watched her, standing close beside, Grane the big white horse, Dear Grane of her heart. She dreamed she was far from her father, But Siegfried was coming, Siegfried, through the big trees, Up the hill, Through the fire! II "Siegfried, hear us! Give us back the ring!" The lady with the shell, The water-lady with the green hair, Calling, cried "Siegfried!" But he laughed to hear her, Laughed in the sun And went into the woods laughing: He was happy in his heart, And he had golden hair Till the sun loved him. "Siegfried!" I will call him! "Siegfried!" But he will not hear me. He could talk to birds and rivers, And he is gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOON SONG THERE is a star that runs very fast, That goes pulling the moon Through the tops of the poplars. It is all in silver, The tall star: The moon rolls goldenly along Out of breath. Mr. Moon, does he make you hurry?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUNSET ONCE upon a time at evening-light A little girl was sad. There was a color in the sky, A color she knew in her dreamful heart And wanted to keep. She held out her arms Long, long, And saw it flow away on the wind. When it was gone She did not love the moonlight Or care for the stars. She had seen the rose in the sky. Sometimes I am sad Because I have a thought Of this little girl .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOUSE LITTLE MOUSE in gray velvet, Have you had a cheese-breakfast? There are no crumbs on your coat, Did you use a napkin? I wonder what you had to eat, And who dresses you in gray velvet?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHORT STORY I FOUND the gold on the hill; I found the hid gold! The wicked queen Stole the gold, Hid it under a stone And never told. The selfish queen Rolling away In her white limousine, Never knew nor dreamed That I searched all day Till I found the gold, The gold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BY LAKE CHAMPLAIN I WAS bare as a leaf And I felt the wind on my shoulder. The trees laughed When I picked up the sun in my fingers. The wind was chasing the waves, Tangling their white curls. "Willow trees," I said, "O willows, Look at your lake! Stop laughing at a little girl Who runs past your feet in the sand!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPRING SONG I LOVE daffodils. I love Narcissus when he bends his head. I can hardly keep March and spring and Sunday and daffodils Out of my rhyme of song. Do you know anything about the spring When it comes again? God knows about it while winter is lasting. Flowers bring him power in the spring, And birds bring it, and children. He is sometimes sad and alone Up there in the sky trying to keep his worlds happy. I bring him songs When he is in his sadness, and weary. I tell him how I used to wander out To study stars and the moon he made, And flowers in the dark of the wood. I keep reminding him about his flowers he has forgotten, And that snowdrops are up. What can I say to make him listen? "God," I say, "Don't you care! Nobody must be sad or sorry In the spring-time of flowers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WATER THE world turns softly Not to spill its lakes and rivers. The water is held in its arms And the sky is held in the water. What is water, That pours silver, And can hold the sky?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHADY BRONN WHEN the clouds come deep against the sky I sit alone in my room to think, To remember the fairy dreams I made, Listening to the rustling out of the trees. The stories in my fairy-tale book Come new to me every day. But at my farm on the hill-top I have the wind for a fairy, And the shapes of things: Shady Bronn is the name of my little farm: It is the name of a dream I have Where leaves move, And the wind rings them like little bells.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHICKADEE THE chickadee in the appletree Talks all the time very gently. He makes me sleepy. I rock away to the sea-lights. Far off I hear him talking The way smooth bright pebbles Drop into water . . . Chick-a-dee-dee-dee . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CHAMPLAIN SANDMAN THE Sandman comes pattering across the Bay: His hair is silver, His footstep soft. The moon shines on his silver hair, On his quick feet. The Sandman comes searching across the Bay: He goes to all the houses he knows To put sand in little girls' eyes. That is why I go to my sleepy bed, And why the lake-gull leaves the moon alone. There are no wings to moonlight any more, Only the Sandman's hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROSE-MOSS LITTLE ROSE-MOSS beside the stone, Are you lonely in the garden? There are no friends of you, And the birds are gone. Shall I pick you?" "Little girl up by the hollyhock, I am not lonely. I feel the sun burning, I hold light in my cup, I have all the rain I want, I think things to myself that you don't know, And I listen to the talk of crickets. I am not lonely, But you may pick me And take me to your mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ABOUT MY DREAMS NOW the flowers are all folded And the dark is going by. The evening is arising . . . It is time to rest. When I am sleeping I find my pillow full of dreams. They are all new dreams: No one told them to me Before I came through the cloud. They remember the sky, my little dreams, They have wings, they are quick, they are sweet. Help me tell my dreams To the other children, So that their bread may taste whiter, So that the milk they drink May make them think of meadows In the sky of stars. Help me give bread to the other children So that their dreams may come back: So they will remember what they knew Before they came through the cloud. Let me hold their little hands in the dark, The lonely children, The babies that have no mothers any more. Dear God, let me hold up my silver cup For them to drink, And tell them the sweetness Of my dreams.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SIX TO SEVEN YEARS OLD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AUTUMN SONG I MADE a ring of leaves On the autumn grass: I was a fairy queen all day. Inside the ring, the wind wore sandals Not to make a noise of going. The caterpillars, like little snow men, Had wound themselves in their winter coats. The hands of the trees were bare And their fingers fluttered. I was a queen of yellow leaves and brown, And the redness of my fairy ring Kept me warm. For the wind blew near, Though he made no noise of going, And I hadn't a close-made wrap Like the caterpillars. Even a queen of fairies can be cold When summer has forgotten and gone! Keep me warm, red leaves; Don't let the frost tiptoe into my ring On the magic grass!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DREAM WHEN I slept, I thought I was upon the mountain-tops, And this is my dream. I saw the little people come out into the night, I saw their wings glittering under the stars. Crickets played all the tunes they knew. It was so comfortable with light . . . Stars, a rainbow, the moon! The fairies had shiny crowns On their bright hair. The bottoms of their little gowns were roses! It was musical in the moony light, And the fairy queen, Oh, it was all golden where she came With tiny pages on her trail. She walked slowly to her high throne, Slowly, slowly to music, And watched the dancing that went on All night long in star-glitter On the mountain-tops.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BUTTERFLY BUTTERFLY, I like the way you wear your wings. Show me their colors, For the light is going. Spread out their edges of gold, Before the Sandman puts me to sleep And evening murmurs by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EVENING NOW it is dusky, And the hermit thrush and the black and white warbler Are singing and answering together. There is sweetness in the tree, And fireflies are counting the leaves. I like this country, I like the way it has, But I cannot forget my dream I had of the sea, The gulls swinging and calling, And the foamy towers of the waves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THUNDER SHOWER THE dark cloud raged. Gone was the morning light. The big drops darted down: The storm stood tall on the rose-trees: And the bees that were getting honey Out of wet roses, The hiding bees would not come out of the flowers Into the rain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RED CROSS SONG WHEN I heard the bees humming in the hive, They were so busy about their honey, I said to my mother, What can I give, What can I give to help the Red Cross? And Mother said to me: You can give honey too! Honey of smiles! Honey of love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PURPLE ASTERS IT isn't alone the asters In my garden, It is the butterflies gleaming Like crowns of kings and queens! It isn't alone purple And blue on the edge of purple, It is what the sun does, And the air moving clearly, The petals moving and the wings, In my queer little garden!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG FOR A PLAY SOLDIER drop that golden spear! Wait till the fires arise! Wait till the sky drops down and touches the spear, Crystal and mother-of-pearl! The sunlight droops forward Like wings. The birds sing songs of sun-drops. The sky leans down where the spear stands upward. . . I hear music . . . It is the end . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PEACOCK FEATHERS ON trees of fairyland Grow peacock feathers of daylight colors Like an Austrian fan. But there is a strange thing! I have heard that night gathers these feathers For her cloak; I have heard that the stars, the moon, Are the eyes of peacock feathers From fairy trees. It is a thing that may be, But I should not be sure of it, my dear, If I were you!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RED ROOSTER RED ROOSTER in your gray coop, O stately creature with tail-feathers red and blue, Yellow and black, You have a comb gay as a parade On your head: You have pearl trinkets On your feet: The short feathers smooth along your back Are the dark color of wet rocks, Or the rippled green of ships When I look at their sides through water. I don't know how you happened to be made So proud, so foolish, Wearing your coat of many colors, Shouting all day long your crooked words, Loud . . . sharp . . . not beautiful!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TREE-TOAD TREE-TOAD is a small gray person With a silver voice. Tree-toad is a leaf-gray shadow That sings. Tree-toad is never seen Unless a star squeezes through the leaves, Or a moth looks sharply at a gray branch. How would it be, I wonder, To sing patiently all night, Never thinking that people are asleep? Raindrops and mist, starriness over the trees, The moon, the dew, the other little singers, Cricket . . . toad . . . leaf rustling . . . They would listen: It would be music like weather That gets into all the corners Of out-of-doors. Every night I see little shadows I never saw before. Every night I hear little voices I never heard before. When night comes trailing her starry cloak, I start out for slumberland, With tree-toads calling along the roadside. Good-night , I say to one, Good-by , I say to another: I hope to find you on the way We have traveled before! I hope to hear you singing on the Road of Dreams!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">SEVEN TO NINE YEARS OLD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LONESOME WAVE THERE is an island In the middle of my heart, And all day comes lapping on the shore A long silver wave. It is the lonesome wave; I cannot see the other side of it. It will never go away Until it meets the glad gold wave Of happiness! Wandering over the monstrous rocks, Looking into the caves, I see my island dark, all cold, Until the gold wave sweeps in From a sea deep blue, And flings itself on the beach. Oh, it is joy, then! No more whispers like sorrow, No more silvery lonesome lapping of the long wave . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RED-CAP MOSS HAVE you seen red-cap moss In the woods? Have you looked under the trembling caps For faces? Have you seen wonder on those faces Because you are so big?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RAMBLER ROSE RAMBLER ROSE in great clusters, Looking at me, at my mother with me Under this apple-tree, Your faces watch us from outside the shade. The wind blows on you, The rain drops on you, The sun shines on you, You are brighter than before. You turn your faces to the wind And watch my mother and me, Thinking of things I cannot mention Outside of my mind. Rambler Rose in the shining wind, You smile at me, Smile at my mother!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GIFT THIS is mint and here are three pinks I have brought you, Mother. They are wet with rain And shining with it. The pinks smell like more of them In a blue vase: The mint smells like summer In many gardens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE WHITE CLOUD THERE are many clouds But not like the one I see, For mine floats like a swan in featheriness Over the River of the Broken Pine. There are many clouds But not like the one that goes sailing Like a ship full of gold that shines, Like a ship leaning above blue water. There are many clouds But not like the one I wait for, For mine will have a strangeness Whiter than anything your eyes remember.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOON THOUGHT THE moon is thinking of the river Winding through the mountains far away, Because she has a river in her heart Full of the same silver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE OLD BRIDGE THE old bridge has a wrinkled face. He bends his back For us to go over. He moans and weeps But we do not hear. Sorrow stands in his face For the heavy weight and worry Of people passing. The trees drop their leaves into the water; The sky nods to him. The leaves float down like small ships On the blue surface Which is the sky. He is not always sad: He smiles to see the ships go down And the little children Playing on the river banks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FERNS SMALL ferns up-coming through the mossy green, Up-curling and springing, See trees circling round them, And the straight brook like a lily-stem: Hear the water laughing At the stern old pine-tree Who keeps sighing to himself all day long What's the use! What's the use!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LAND OF NOD I WANDER mountain to mountain, From sea to sea, I wander into a country Where everyone is asleep. There in the Land of Nod I never think of home, For home is there, With sleeping doves and silvery girls, Sleeping boys and drowsy roses. There I find people whose eyes are heavy, And trees with folded wings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUN FLOWERS SUN-FLOWERS, stop growing! If you touch the sky where those clouds are passing Like tufts of dandelion gone to seed, The sky will put you out! You know it is blue like the sea . . . Maybe it is wet, too! Your gold faces will be gone forever If you brush against that blue Ever so softly!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HOLLAND SONG For a Dutch picture WHEN light comes creeping through the That shine with mist, When winds blow soft, Windmills wake and whirl. In Holland, in Holland, Everything is cheerful Across the sea: White nets are beside the water Where ships sail by. The mountains begin to get blue, The Dutch girls begin to sing, The windmills begin to whirl. Then night comes The mountains turn dark gray And faint away into night. Not a bird chirps his song. All is drowsy, All is strange, With the moon and stars shining round the world: The wind stops, The windmills stop In Holland . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOUNTAIN-TALK SAID the fountain to its clear bed, "You might flow faster! I am sprinkling my best, every day, But ice is holding you fast. Can't you get out? Can't you lift yourself with sun? I am tired waiting for slow cold water To fling about the air: Can't you wake yourself up?" But the fountain-basin murmured softly "Sleep . . . sleep . . . Sleep . . . sleep . . . You with your talking and talking! Hush . . . hush . . . I hear the bird-sandman!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POPLARS THE poplars bow forward and back; They are like a fan waving very softly. They tremble, For they love the wind in their feathery branches. They love to look down at the shallows, At the mermaids On the sandy shore; They love to look into morning's face Cool in the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TOWER AND THE FALCON THERE was a tower, once, In a London street. It was the highest, widest, thickest tower, The proudest, roundest, finest tower Of all towers. English men passed it by: They could not see it all Because it went above tree-tops and clouds. It was lonely up there where the trees stopped Until one day A blue falcon came flying. He cried: "Tower! Do you know you are the highest, finest, roundest, The tallest, proudest, greatest, Of all the towers In all the world?" He went away. That night the tower made a new song About himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THOUGHTS MY thoughts keep going far away Into another country under a different sky: My thoughts are sea-foam and sand; They are apple-petals fluttering.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEM-SKETCH IN THREE PARTS ( Made for the picture on the jacket of the Norwegian book, The Great Hunger, by Johan Bojer ) I THE ROLLING IN OF THE WAVE IT was night when the sky was dark blue And the water came in with a wavy look Like a spider's web. The point of the slope came down to the water's edge; It was green with a fairy ring of forget-me-not and fern. The white foam licked the side of the slope As it came up and bent backward; It curled up like a beautiful cinder-tree Bending in the wind. II THE COMING OF THE GREAT BIRD A boy was watching the water As it came lapping the edge of fern. Little ships passed him As the moon came leaning across dark blue rays of light. The spruce trees saw the white ships sailing away, And the moon bending up the blue sky Where stars were twinkling like fairy lamps; The boy was looking toward foreign lands As the ships passed, Their white sails glittering in the moonlight. He was thinking how he wished to see Foreign lands, strange people, When suddenly a bird came flying! It swooped down upon the slope And spoke to him: "Do you want to go across the deep blue sea? Get on my back; I will take you ." "Oh ," cried the little boy, "who sent you? Who knew my thoughts of foreign lands?" III THE ISLAND They flew as the night-wind flowed, very softly, They heard sweet singing that the water sang, They came to a place where the sea was shallow And saw treasure hidden there. There was one poplar tree On the lonely island, Swaying for sadness. The clouds went over their heads Like a fleet of drifting ships. And there they sank down out of the air Into the dream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DEW-LIGHT THE Dew-man comes over the mountains wide, Over the deserts of sand, With his bag of clear drops And his brush of feathers. He scatters brightness. The white bunnies beg him for dew. He sprinkles their fur, They shake themselves. All the time he is singing The unknown world is beautiful! He polishes flowers, Humming "Oh, beautiful!" He sings in the soft light That grows out of the dew, Out of the misty dew-light that leans over him He makes his song . . . It is beautiful, the unknown world!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">YELLOW SUMMER-THROAT YELLOW summer-throat sat singing In a bending spray of willow tree. Thin fine green-y lines on his throat, The ruffled outside of his throat, Trembled when he sang. He kept saying the same thing; The willow did not mind. I knew what he said, I knew, But how can I tell you? I have to watch the willow bend in the wind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PEGASUS COME dear Pegasus, I said, Let me ride on your back; I have often seen your shadow in the glittering creek; Pegasus, beautiful Pegasus, Let me sit on your back! He was away, But I was on his back, So I went with him. We had a castle in a mountain cloud. So quickly was he away, I had no time to look or speak! That was the last I saw of father or mother. We went far from the shining creek, Farther than I know how to tell you: It was good-by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VENICE BRIDGE For a painting AWAY back in an old city I saw a bridge. That bridge belonged to Venice. It was to the rainbow clear It traveled, Over an old canal. You had to pass a cloudy gate To reach the color . . . Bridges do sometimes begin on the earth And end in the sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NIGHT GOES RUSHING BY NIGHT goes hurrying over Like sweeping clouds; The birds are nested; their song is silent. The wind says oo ‚Äî oo ‚Äî oo ‚Äî through the trees For their lullaby. The moon shines down on the sleeping birds. My cottage roof is like a sheet of silk Spun like a cobweb. My apple-trees are bare as the oaks in the forest; When the moon shines I see no leaves. I am alone and very quiet Hoping the moon may say something Before long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DANDELION O LITTLE soldier with the golden helmet, What are you guarding on my lawn? You with your green gun And your yellow beard, Why do you stand so stiff? There is only the grass to fight!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IF I COULD TELL YOU THE WAY DOWN through the forest to the river I wander. There are swans flying, Swans on the water, Duck, wild birds. Fairies live here; They know no sorrow. Birds, winds, They are the only people. If I could tell you the way to this place, You would sell your house and your land For silver or a little gold, You would sail up the river, Tie your boat to the Black Stone, Build a leaf-hut, make a twig-fire, Gather mushrooms, drink spring-water, Live alone and sing to yourself For a year and a year and a year!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROSE-PETAL PETAL with rosy cheeks, Petal with thoughts of your own, Petal of my crimson-white flower out of June, Little petal of my heart!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS SEE the fur coats go by! The morning is like the inside of a snow-apple. I will curl myself cushion-shape On the window-seat; I will read poems by snow-light. If I cannot understand them so, I will turn them upside down And read them by the red candles Of garden brambles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SEAGARDE I WILL return to you O stillest and dearest, To see the pearl of light That flashes in your golden hair; To hear you sing your songs of starlight And tell your stories of the wonderful land Of stars and fleecy sky; To say to you that Seagarde will soon be here, Seagarde the fairy With her seagulls of hope!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EASTER ON Easter morn Up the faint cloudy sky I hear the Easter bell, Ding dong . . . ding dong . . . Easter morning scatters lilies On every doorstep; Easter morning says a glad thing Over and over. Poor people, beggars, old women Are hearing the Easter bell . . . Ding dong . . . ding dong . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BLUEBIRD OH bluebird with light red breast, And your blue back like a feathered sky, You have to go down south Before biting winter comes And my flower-beds are covered with fluff out of the clouds. Before you go, Sing me one more song Of tree-tops down south, Of darkies singing their babies to sleep, Of sand and glittering stones Where rivers pass; Then . . . good-by!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEOGRAPHY I CAN tell balsam trees By their grayish bluish silverish look of smoke. Pine trees fringe out. Hemlocks look like Christmas. The spruce tree is feathered and rough Like the legs of the red chickens in our poultry yard. I can study my geography from chickens Named for Plymouth Rock and Rhode Island, And from trees out of Canada. No; I shall leave the chickens out. I shall make a new geography of my own. I shall have a hillside of spruce and hemlock Like a separate country, And I shall mark a walk of spires on my map, A secret road of balsam trees With blue buds. Trees Fat smell like a wind out of fairy-land Where little people live Who need no geography But trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARCH THOUGHT I AM waiting for the flowers To come back: I am alone, But I can wait for the birds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MORNING THERE is a brook I must hear Before I go to sleep. There is a birch tree I must visit Every night of clearness. I have to do some dreaming, I have to listen a great deal, Before light comes back By a silver arrow of cloud, And I rub my eyes and say It must be morning on this hill!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG A SCARLET bird went sailing away through the wood . . . It was only a mist of dream That floated by . Bare boughs of my apple-tree, Beautiful gray arms stretched out to me, Swaying to and fro like angels' wings . . . It was only a mist of dream That floated by .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SNOWFLAKE SONG SNOWFLAKES come in fleets Like ships over the sea. The moon shines down on the crusty snow: The stars make the sky sparkle like gold-fish In a glassy bowl. Bluebirds are gone now, But they left their song behind them. The moon seems to say: It is time for summer when the birds come back To pick up their lonesome songs .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SNOWSTORM SNOWFLAKES are dancing. They run down out of heaven. Coming home from somewhere down the long tired road They flake us sometimes The way they do the grass, And the stretch of the world. The grass-blades are crowned with snowflakes. They make me think of daisies With white frills around their necks With golden faces and green gowns; Poor little daisies, Tip-toe and shivering In the cold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POPPY OH big red poppy, You look stern and sturdy, Yet you bow to the wind And sing a lullaby . . . "Sleep, little ones under my breast In the moonshine . . ." You make this lullaby, Sweet, short, Slow, beautiful, And you thank the dew for giving you a drink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BUTTERFLY AS I walked through my garden I saw a butterfly light on a flower. His wings were pink and purple: He spoke a small word . . . It was Follow! "I cannot follow" I told him, "I have to go the opposite way ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLOUDS THE clouds were gray all day. At last they departed And the blue diamonds shone again. I watched clouds float past and flow back Like waves across the sea, Waves that are foamy and soft, When they hear clouds calling Mother Sea, send us up your song Of hushaby!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NARCISSUS NARCISSUS, I like to watch you grow When snow is shining Beyond the crystal glass. A coat of snow covers the hills far. The sun is setting; And you stretch out flowers of palest white In the pink of the sun.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LITTLE SNAIL I SAW a little snail Come down the garden walk. He wagged his head this way . . . that way . . . Like a clown in a circus. He looked from side to side As though he were from a different country. I have always said he carries his house on his back . . . To-day in the rain I saw that it was his umbrella!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHERRIES ARE RIPE THE cherry tree is red now; Cherry tree nods his red head And calls to the sun: Let down the birds out of the sky; Send home the birds to build nests in my arms, For I am ready to feed them. There is a little girl coming for cherries too . . . (I am that little girl, I who am singing . . .) She is coming with hair flying! The butterflies will be going (says the cherry) For it is getting dusk. When it is dawn, They will be up and out with the dew, And sparkle as the dew does On the tips of tall slender green grasses Around my feet, Or on the cheeks of fruit I have ripened, Red cherries for birds And children .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A THING FORGOTTEN WHITE owl is not gloomy; Black bat is not sad. It is only that each has forgotten Something he used to remember: Black bat goes searching . . . searching . . . White owl says over and over Who? What? Where?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LITTLE PAPOOSE: LITTLE papoose Swung high in the branches Hears a song of birds, stars, clouds, Small nests of birds, Small buds of flowers. But he is thinking of his mother with dark hair Like her horse's mane. Fair clouds nod to him Where he swings in the tree, But he is thinking of his father Dark and glistening and wonderful, Of his father with a voice like ice and velvet, And tones of falling water, Of his father who shouts Like a storm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAIRIES AGAIN FAIRIES dancing in the woods at night Make me think of foreign places, Of places unknown. Fairies with sparkling crowns and dewy hands, Sprinkle flowers and mosses to keep them fresh, Talk to the birds to keep them cheery. Once a bird came home And found a fairy asleep in his nest, Upon his baby eggs, To keep them warm!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OH, MY HAZEL-EYED MOTHER OH, my hazel-eyed mother, I looked behind the mulberry bush And saw you standing there. You were all in white With a star on your forehead. Oh, my hazel-eyed mother, I do not remember what you said to me, But the light floating above you Was your love for your little girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE GREEN PALM TREE I SAT under a delicate palm tree On a shore of sounding waves. I felt sure I was alone, Listening. A sea-gull flew by from France, A sea-gull flew by from Spain, A sea-gull flew by from Mexico! I laughed softly When they saw me: It was those travelers From foreign countries Changed my thoughts To laughter!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TREASURE ROBBERS carry a treasure Into a field of wheat. With a great bag of silk They go on careful feet. They dig a hole, deep, deep, They bury it under a stone, Cover it up with turf, Leave it alone. What is there in the bag? Stones that shine, gold? I cannot rob the robbers! They have not told. To-night I'd like to know If they will go Softly to find the treasure? I'd like to know How much yellow gold A bag like that can hold?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TWO PICTURES I Gorgeous Blue Mountain I SEE a great mountain Stand among clouds; You would never know Where it ended. . . . Oh, gorgeous blue mountain of my heart And of my love for you! II Sea-Gull From a yellow strip of sand I watch a gull go by. He is bright-eyed To see the world of waves. All his dream is of the sea. All his love is for his mate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TELL ME TELL me quiet things When it is shadowy: It is at morningbreak you must tell me tales Like those about Odysseus, Morning is the time for ships And strangers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SILVERHORN IT is out in the mountains I find him, My snowy deer With silver horns like dew, Horns that sparkle. I think I see him in the hollow, He is on the high hill! I think I see him on the hill, He is leaping through the air! I think I can ride upon his back, He is like moonlight I cannot hold, He is like thoughts I lose. He flows by All white . . . He makes me think of the brook Out of the hills With its little foamy points Like his twitching ears, Like his horns of silver Sparkling. The brook is his only friend When he travels . . . Silverhorn, Silverhorn!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SPARKLING DROP OF WATER THE sun shone, All was still. The sun made one sparkle in one drop Before it fell Down into the mossy green That was the grass. It lay there silent A long time. The sun went, the moon came, Again one sparkle in the grass! Day then night, sun then moon, Year in, year out, So it went on with its life For several years Until at last it was never heard of Any more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HAY-COCK THIS is another kind of sweetness Shaped like a bee-hive: This is the hive the bees have lefts It is from this clover-heap They took away the honey For the other hive!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONLY MORNING-GLORY THAT FLOWERED UNDER the vine I saw one morning-glory A tight unfolding bud Half out. He looked hard down into my lettuce-bed. He was thinking hard. He said I want a friend! I was standing there: I said, Well, I am here! Don't you see me? But he thought and thought. The next day I found him happy, Quite out, Looking about the world. The wind blew sweet airs, Carried away his perfume in the sun; And near by swung a new flower Uncurling its hands . . . He was not thoughtful Any more!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WEATHER WEATHER is the answer When I can't go out into flowery places; Weather is my wonder About the kind of morning Hidden behind the hills of sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUMMER-DAY SONG WILD birds fly over me. I am not the blue curtain overhead, I am the one who lives under the sky. I swing to the tree-tops, I pick strawberries, I sing and play, And happiness makes me like a great god On the earth. It makes me think of great things A little girl like me Could not know of.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PINK ROSE-PETALS PINK rose-petals Fluttering down in hosts, I know what you mean Sometimes, in Spring. It is love you mean. Love has a gray bird That flutters down; A dove that comes flying Saying the same thing. How happy it makes me to think of it, Rose-petals . . . the gray dove . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LONESOME GREEN APPLE THERE was a little green apple That had lasted over winter. He had one leaf . . . In spite of that he was lonesome. He wondered what he could do When the blossoms were all around him, But one day he saw something! Petals were falling, faces were looking out, Shapes like his were coming in the buds; Then he said: "If I hold on There will be a tree-full, and I shall know more than any of them!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I AM I AM willowy boughs For coolness; I am gold-finch wings For darkness; I am a little grape Thinking of September, I am a very small violet Thinking of May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MUSHROOM SONG OH little mushrooms with brown faces underneath And bare white heads, You think of summer and you think of song . . . Why don't you think of me In my little white bed In the night? You think only of your singsong and your dances, Following your leader round and round, You think only of the grass And the green apples and leaves Dropping out of the blue . . . Why don't you think of me asleep In my little white bed? The wind thinks of me, Brown-white dancers! You forget, But the wind remembers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE APPLE-JELLY-FISH-TREE DOWN in the depths of the sea Grew the Apple-Jelly-Fish-Tree. It was named by a queer old robber And his mates three. I watched it for a second, I watched it for a day. It did not change color For its colors stay. It was as red, as yellow, as white, as blue As gold and stones with the light through! I watched it long and long Till a flying sunfish Swam through its branches. He had opal wings And a sapphire tail . No wonder robbers like to stay Where fish so shining come to play!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE LOVES ANGEL-LOVE, Fairy-love, Wave-love, Which will you choose? Angel-love . . . golden-yellow and far white . . . Fairy-love . . . golden yellow and green . . . Wave-love . . . scarlet and azure blue . . . Which will you choose? I will keep them in a box Locked with a twisted key. I will give them to people who need love, I will let them choose. Fairy-love blows away like leaves. Angels I know little about. For myself I choose wave-love Because of the wind and the sea and my heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIELD OF WONDER WHAT could be more wonderful Than the place where I walk sometimes? Swaying like trees in rain . . . Swaying like trees in sunshine When breezes stir nothing but happiness . . . What could be more lovely? I walk in the Field of Wonder Where colors come to be; I stare at the sky . . . I feel myself lifting on the wind As the swallows lift and blow upward . . . I see colors fade out, they die away . . . I blow across a cloud . . . I am lifted . . . How can I change again into a little girl When wings are in my feeling of gladness? This is strange to know On a summer day at noon, This is a wild new joy When summer is over. The scarlet of three maple trees Will guide me home, Oh mother my dear! Fear nothing: I will come home Before snow falls!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOON DOVES THE moon has a dove-cote safe and small, Hid in the velvet sky: The doves are her companions sweet; She has no others. Moon doves on the wing are white As a valley of stars, When they fly, there is shining Like a golden river. I see so many whirling away and away, How can they get home again? The moon is calm and never wears an anxious look, She goes on smiling. I hear so many doves along the sky How will her dove-cote hold them? The moon says not one word to me; She lets me wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I WENT TO SEA I WENT to sea in a glass-bottomed boat And found that the loveliest shells of all Are hidden below in valleys of sand. I saw coral and sponge and weed And bubbles like jewels dangling. I saw a creature with eyes of mist Go by slowly. Star-fish fingers held the water . . . Let it go again . . . I saw little fish, the children of the sea; They were gay and busy. I wanted the sea-weed purple; I wanted the shells; I wanted a little fish to hold in my hands; I wanted the big fish to stop wandering about, And tell me all they knew . . . I have come back safe and dry And know no more secrets Than yesterday!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE THOUGHTS OF MY HEART AS I was straying by the forest brook I heard my heart speak to me: Listen ; said my heart, I have three thoughts for you . . . a thought of clouds, A thought of birds, A thought of flowers . I sat upon a cushion of moss, Listening, Where the light played, and the green shadows: What would you do . . . I asked my heart . . . If you were a floating ship of the sky . . . If you were a peering bird . . . If you were a wild geranium? And my heart made answer: That is what I wonder and wonder! After all it is life I love, After all l am a living thing, After all I am the heart of you . . . I am content!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAIN SNOW-CAPPED mountain, so white, so tall, The whole sea Must stand behind you! Snow-capped mountain, with the wind on your forehead, Do you hold the eagles' nests? Proud thing, You shine like a lily, Yet with a different whiteness; I should not dare to venture Up your slippery towers, For I am thinking you lean too far Over the Edge of the World!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BROOK AND ITS CHILDREN O BROOK, running down your mossy way, I hear only your voice And the murmuring fir-trees; Where are your children? Where are the magic stones, your children?" The brook answered me sweetly , "I left them on the Alp, In steep fields. They were trying to hold me back, To keep me from this shady path of happiness; But I went onward day by day Until they got used to seeing me pass. Now, they stand there in an enchantment On the mountain-side, While I travel fields of elm and poplar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIRD OF PARADISE I WAS walking in a meadow of Paradise When I heard a singing Far away and sweet Like a Roman harp, Sweet and murmurous Like the wind, Far and soft Like the fir trees. It will not change a song If the bird has a golden crest; No feathers of blue and rose-red Could make a song. I have known in my dreaming A gray bird that sang While all the fields listened! The Bird of Paradise is like flowers of many trees Blooming on one: I saw him in the meadow, But it was the gray bird I heard singing Beyond and far.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SHINY BROOK OH, shiny brook, I watch you on your way to the sea, And see little faces peering up Out of the water . . . Water-fairies Strange smiles and questions. They are your pebbles sweet, Golden with foam of the sun, Blue with foam of the sky. I know their way of speaking, Of talking to each other: I hear them telling secrets About green moss, about fish that get lost. And how I am sitting on a big stone Getting my feet wet in Shiny Brook To watch their surprising ways!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HILLS THE hills are going somewhere; They have been on the way a long time. They are like camels in a line But they move more slowly. Sometimes at sunset they carry silks, But most of the time silver birch trees, Heavy rocks, heavy trees, gold leaves On heavy branches till they are aching . . . Birches like silver bars they can hardly lift With grass so thick about their feet to hinder . . . They have not gone far In the time I've watched them . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADVENTURE I WENT slowly through the wood of shadows, Thinking always I should meet some one: There was no one. I found a hollow Sweet to rest in all night long: I did not stay. I came out beyond the trees To the moaning sea. Over the sea swam a cloud the outline of a ship: What if that ship held my adventure Under its sails? Come quickly to me, come quickly, I am waiting. I am here on the sand; Sail close! I want to go over the waves . . . The sand holds me back. Oh adventure, if you belong to me, Don't blow away down the sky!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAIRIES I CANNOT see fairies. I dream them. There is no fairy can hide from me; I keep on dreaming till I find him: There you are, Primrose! I see you, Black Wing!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HUMMING-BIRD WHY do you stand on the air And no sun shining? How can you hold yourself so still On raindrops sliding? They change and fall, they are not steady, But you do not know they are gone. Is there a silver wire I cannot see? Is the wind your perch? Raindrops slide down your little shoulders . . . They do not wet you: I think you are not real In your green feathers! You are not a humming-bird at all Standing on air above the garden! I dreamed you the way I dream fairies, Or the flower I lost yesterday!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BLUE GRASS BLUE grass flowering in the field, You are my heart's content. It is not only through the day I see you, But in dreams at night When you trudge up the hill Along the forest, As I do! You are small to shine so, Nobody speaks of you much, Because of daisies and such summer blooms. When you wonder why I like you It makes me wonder too! Maybe I remember when you grew high Like a tree above my head, Because I was a fairy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ENVOY IF I am happy, and you, And there are things to do, It seems to be the reason Of this world! THE END</field>
