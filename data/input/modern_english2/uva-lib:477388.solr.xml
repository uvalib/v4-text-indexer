      <field name="fulltext">"Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did float and flow (This-all this-was in the olden Time long ago)." -EDGAR ALLAN POE, The Haunted Palace</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALMOST MY EARLIEST RECOLLECTION OF RICHMOND, WHERE I grew up, is the scene of a vast concourse of people assembled in Capitol Square between the Washington Monument and the Governor's Mansion, to witness the unveiling of the statue of Stonewall Jackson, and to listen to Dr. Hoge's eloquent oration which was a chief part of the ceremony on that impressive occasion. That was in 1875 when I was four years old; yet somehow I was certainly there that day in the midst of the throng, and while I remember the spectacle almost as vividly as if I had seen it yesterday, I cannot recall whether I was with my mother and father or simply with my dear old mammy, Malvina. In those days of my early boyhood, Richmond on the James, outwardly, not yet inwardly recovered from the ugly scars of the Civil War, was an historic and picturesque old residential town that stretched or sprawled several miles from Church Hill — the site of St. John's Church where Patrick Henry a century ago had shouted "Give me liberty, or give me death! "— westward as far as Hollywood Cemetery, where ... sleep the brave who sink to rest By all their country's wishes blest. The port of Rocketts at the foot of Church Hill and just below the Falls of James River was the head of tidewater, as far up the big river as a steamer could come; so if you had a mind to go to Norfolk by the sea about a hundred miles away, you might get on board a side-wheeler, somewhat ironically called the Ariel, which used to leave the wharf at Rocketts early in the morning and was lucky if it got to Norfolk by bedtime that evening. How ever, if you were in a hurry, you had another alternative and could go by train, changing cars in Petersburg; although, even then it was doubtful whether you would reach Norfolk ahead of the Ariel, for in the days of my youth trains in Virginia were almost invariably long behind time. Time was not so precious then as it is now, and the truth is it usually did not matter much when you reached your destination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Practically all the years of my boyhood were spent in Richmond until I was old enough to go to college. During the long hot summers when nearly everybody left town, we migrated to .one of the resorts in the mountains of Virginia, perhaps occasionally to Nantucket or to some other delightful place in New England. They were sunlit days for me, winter and summer, unclouded by sorrow or any unhappiness that I can now recall; and uneventful as they undoubtedly were for the most part, to me they seemed full of novelty and adventure. A round of pleasure must be shared in order for it to be duly appreciated and enjoyed by others. The mere description of it is usually hardly worth telling and more often than not is tedious and unprofitable. If it never was your lot to go on a hayride by moonlight in a creaking old wagon loaded down with boys and girls to a rather dilapidated old country mansion in Goochland County, a dozen miles or more from Richmond, where "there was a sound of revelry by night"; and if, arriving at the festival in the gayest mood, you never knew the unspeakable bliss of being almost instantly chosen to dance "chum-turn-a-loo" with a heavenly beautiful little maiden in a blue frock tied with a pink sash, then why do I waste the time or take the trouble to tell you that all that was exactly what happened to me once upon a time? She was Bruce Williams, and though I never afterwards touched the hem of her garment or whispered a word in her car, the vision of her radiant loveliness that evening in Goochland and the glory that encompassed me then has never faded in all the years that have come and gone! Perhaps to you that episode does not seem to deserve the name of high adventure; yet I know you would have envied me had you been at that party. When tardy Crillon came riding up to King Henry of Navarre just after a great battle had been fought and won, the latter greeted him by saying, "Hang yourself, brave Crillon! We fought at Arques, and you were not there." Besides, when you get to be an old man as I am now, curiously enough it is just such an incident or accident — as a moonlight ride and a country dance when you wore your first pair of long trousers that will stand out in retrospection as the high point of a long and active life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I got to be quite a big lad, perhaps in my early teens, I used to hear much talk around my father's dinner table and among his friends concerning the huge Prussian army in Europe, all booted and spurred and ready at a moment's notice to be unleashed by the young German Kaiser and launched overpoweringly against England or any other foe that stood in its way. Already France and her vainglorious emperor had been laid prostrate under the heel of the Iron Chancellor. I listened to the animated conversation open-mouthed, yet half incredulous, little dreaming then how true and deadly in earnest these ominous forebodings were and that my whole life, almost literally from the cradle to the grave, was destined to be overshadowed, thwarted, and more or less completely deranged by ruthless and devastating wars the like of which had never yet been on earth. A frequent and honoured guest in my father's home in Richmond in my boyhood days was Major Taylor Berry, eminent and distinguished senator from Amherst County in the Virginia state legislature, a handsome and cultivated gentleman beloved by each one of our household, old and young. He seldom came to the house, it seems to me now, without bringing some little gift or other, either for my mother or for me or my little sister; and one day I remember his giving my father a slender little volume bound in green cloth called The Battle of Dorking, which long afterwards was in my own library for many years, though now I am unable to find it. It was a fictitious but plausible and highly realistic story of a sudden and irresistible German invasion of England in the 1870's or 1880's, ending tragically enough (as I recall it from memory) in another battle of Hastings and the subjugation of Queen Victoria and all her dominions. For aught I know it was in this ominous little volume (first published, I believe, in 1870 that I heard for the first time the boast of Deutschland ueber Alles and learned to know that England was Germany's archenemy that had to be crushed at all costs; but that was many years before Jewish Lissauer composed the Hymn of Hate (1914) and shouted above the din of battle for all the world to hear that "French and Russians, they matter not," for "we have one foe, and one alone, England!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The famous anecdote about old Marshal Blucher's one and only visit to London soon after the battle of Waterloo, I remember hearing at my father's table, perhaps from the lips of the Honorable John Randolph Tucker who was a member of Congress then and a very notable man. The grim, taciturn old soldier took little stock in sight-seeing; yet as he stood on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral and gazed over the great city, its size and wealth impressed him and he was heard to mutter, Was fuer Plunder, "What a city to loot!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The frightful Civil War in the United States that had laid waste the South and impoverished all its inhabitants had ended at Appomattox just six years before I was born. As boys and girls in school we used to read with tears in our eyes, sometime with vows of vengeance on our lips such mournful dirges as "I the land where we were dreaming," "Furl that banner, for 'tis weary," and other laments over "the lost cause"; nor was there one among us, I verily believe, who did not hope to live to avenge his country's wrongs one day. Yet north and south nothing was really farther from the thoughts of both old and young than the apprehension of a world-wide war which was even then in the making and could have been foreseen if it could not be forestalled. So we lived, those of us who survived, in blissful ignorance until the day, Der Tag, came at last in August, 1914, when the long-awaited signal sounded and the German legions tramped through Belgium. Behind us lies the past, stretched out in long centuries with its history all unfolded for our guidance and instruction; the present, too, is all around us and open to view in every direction, even though we ourselves are too dull to interpret the omens and cannot discern what is plainly coming to birth before our eyes; only the dark and inscrutable future is mercifully opaque and lies hidden in the womb of Time. I wonder how I have the effrontery to repeat such trite and commonplace reflections. Yet who can cease to hope that soon or late, in God's good time, a day will come at last when the poor inhabitants of the town of Mansoul, which from generation to generation has endured so many sieges and heartbreaking calamities, will learn once for all the hard lessons of experience or at least will not go on making the same mistakes until like Carthage to the ground and made desolate forevermore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The peaceful scenes of my childhood are all clustered around three notable towns of the Old Dominion: Richmond, which was the home of my father and mother from the time they were married in 1869 until about a year after I went to college; Norfolk, where my mother, as wise and witty as she was gay and beautiful, had been a reigning belle in her day, and where, as luck would have it, I was born first, in 1871, and then my dear little sister Evelyn in 1873; and Charlottesville, my father's native village surrounded by the pleasant hills of Albemarle, where I often spent a part of the long summer in the gay and hospitable home of my cousins. Both Norfolk and Charlottesville abounded in uncles, aunts, and cousins, and at least once every year during my childhood, Evelyn and I used to go with Mother to Norfolk to visit my grandmother who lived on Freemason Street with my Aunt Evelyn Sharp, An Irish woman named Kate was my grandmother's housekeeper; she was a devout Catholic and a very superior person, who ruled over the establishment with a rod of iron. Evelyn and I stood in much awe of Kate and never dared to disobey her, but her authority was tempered with so much benevolence that we were both fondly attached to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My father, older than my mother by a score of years, had many accomplishments and distinctions, and was indeed a scholar, though more renowned abroad than at home. He was a man of quiet tastes, warm compassionate affections, and much simplicity of character; yet he loved retirement and seldom went far from his own fireside. It was a pity, for without doubt he was not only one of the best talkers I ever heard, but a sympathetic listener too, and everybody, young and old, welcomed his presence and enjoyed his intercourse. In antebellum days he had been a staunch Whig in politics and a strong "Union man," and in the bitter days of Reconstruction, it came to pass that he was elected as one of the small minority of conservative delegates to the so-called Underwood Convention that met in Richmond in 1868. There he did everything in his power to thwart the radical majority bent on the humiliation and degradation of the Old Dominion. A speech he made in that assembly in defense of "white supremacy" lifted him into prominence as a leader in those anxious and turbulent days. I cannot remember ever hearing my father allude to his incursion into active politics, but years afterwards Dr. Moses D. Hoge in a tribute which he paid to my father wrote that the state of Virginia owed him a debt for coming to her aid in time of need. A realistic description of the strange composition of the Underwood Convention is given by an eyewitness in John S. Wise's book called The Lion's Skin, from' which the following extract, containing a reference to my father, is taken. A newspaper reporter named Jimmie Cowardin is represented as pointing out the celebrities of that motley assembly of whites and blacks to one of his friends standing in the gallery of the hall:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Turning to the comer where the little group of real Virginians was seated, he said, 'If you want to see a fish out of water, look at that man,' pointing to a tall, scholarly, serious .man, who sat at his desk absorbed in a pile of public documents. He seemed to pay little attention to the rising tumult about him. As if he were in a decent, orderly body, he was making notes from time to time like a man preparing for a thoughtful presentation of a serious matter to a body that would listen to him and weigh his arguments. It was James C. Southall, of Albemarle, who was very well known to Carrington as a gentleman of character and ability.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" 'He looks like a good deed in a naughty world,' said Jimmie Cowardin." [*]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As long as he lived, my father was my beau ideal, both friend and companion, whom I worshiped as well as loved. The mutual affection between father and son sometimes passeth all understanding, and certainly my father's love of me was beyond measure. Often after midday dinner, perhaps around four o'clock in the afternoon, he was wont to put on his beaver hat, take his stick in hand, and go for a long walk for exercise; and then it was my delight to join him, and hand in hand together we used to tramp literally from one end of the town to the other, sometimes as far as the new reservoir past Hollywood, maybe in the opposite direction to old St. John's Church on Church Hill, or more often than not over one of the long bridges to Manchester on the other side of the James River. In those uncivil days Manchester was a [*] (New York, 1905), p. 211. In Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, Act 5, Scene I, Portia approaching her home at night says to Nerissa: "That light we see, is burning in my hall. How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a naughty world." butt of derision and a shining mark for every minstrel show that came to town. One of the stories that went the rounds was that the Devil himself could not bear to get a carload of sinners from Manchester simply because they were invariably "too green to burn." That was the kind of sally that brought down the house at Mrs. Powell's old "Richmond Theatre" which stood at the corner of Broad and Seventh streets. Then it was the only playhouse in the city, barring "Mozart Hall" on Eighth Street which was not much more than a long wooden barn with a curved roof over it. Not only did Mrs. Powell own the theatre, but, what was a greater boast still, she was the mother of Jim Powell, a tall, handsome fellow with a moustache, captain and first baseman of the "Virginias," the most renowned baseball team in the old Eastern League. Joe Jefferson, Lily Langtry, Sol Smith Russell, Booth, Robson and Crane, Hermann the Magician, and I know not how many other celebrated actors of those days — at one time or other I saw all of them on the stage of the old Richmond Theatre, not in my father's company (for he seldom went inside the theatre, as far as I can remember), but usually with my gay mother or perhaps with Uncle William Southall whenever he came to town from his farm near Ivy in Albemarle and was bent on having a good time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Those rambles with my father in the environs of Richmond were full of entertainment for me, and when we came home late in the evening and sat down to supper, Mother and Evelyn had to listen to a long story of exciting adventure from beginning to end. I asked for nothing better on this earth than to walk by my father's side all the days of my life, and I should be thankful now if I could say that I had never ceased to follow in his footsteps. When he died in 1897, 1 was a grown man and stood forlorn, Knowing my heart's best treasure was no more; the saddest day of my life it seemed to me then, as it still seems to me now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mother and I were more nearly the same age, and the three of us, including my little sister, used to romp together upstairs and downstairs and all over the house from attic to basement. Mother's laughter was contagious, ending often in a spontaneous burst of song, for she had a wonderfully true and melodious voice and sang with as much abandon and unselfconsciousness as if she had been a lark in the sky. Every Friday evening for several years after I had got to be a fairly big lad, I used to escort her to choir practice in old St. Paul's Church by Capitol Square. There she, Jeannie Blow, Mr. Hoff, and other members of the choir, including one of Dr. Minnegerode's pretty and vivacious daughters, perhaps also Mr. Poindexter, who I believe played the organ (but here my memory may be at fault), made a hilarious party and practiced every art of merriment, it seemed to me, rather than the hymns and canticles they had to sing on Sunday. Meanwhile I sat all by myself off to one side in the dim unlighted gallery, a supernumerary if ever there was one, waiting as patiently as possible for the hour to come when choir practice would be over and it was time to go home. I liked to hear Mother sing, for her voice had an extraordinary range of uncommon sweetness and power from high soprano to something akin to bass profound — sometimes I could hardly believe it was not a man I heard singing in mother's room upstairs when she was dressing to go to a party — but her art was spontaneous and entirely uncultivated. She got older of course as the years went by; yet never a wrinkle furrowed her lovely brow, and while her hair got thinner, it never was really Grey, although I know she was sensitive about it and wore a braid when she was an old lady. To me she was like Bacchus, "ever fair and ever young," gay and sparkling to the end of her days. My father was her proudest and most outspoken admirer. He knew she was unrivaled in beauty and gracefulness, but he marveled most of all at her intellectual gifts and extraordinary power of comprehension. She had an unerring faculty for using the precise word or phrase needed to clarify an argument and clinch it beyond dispute. Often she would be the only woman present in a room full of "most potent, grave, and reverend signiors," all notable men and much older than she was, such, for instance, as Dr. William H. Ruffner, the great Superintendent of Public Instruction, Colonel W. W. Gorden, one of the most brilliant lawyers in all the land and famous for his wit and wisdom, the Honorable Frank G. Ruffin, Major Isaac Carrington, Dr. Hunter McGuire, Judge Robert Ould, the Reverend Dr. Minnegerode, and many other eminent men whom I used to see in my father's house from time to time. When it might be supposed that the subject under discussion was of absolutely no concern to my mother, suddenly and most unexpectedly she would quietly let fall from her lips some oracular speech or apt commentary that by common consent hit the nail squarely on the head, leaving nothing more to be said. My father took delight in observing how everybody, old and young alike, acknowledged Mother's supremacy in wit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In science and religion as well as in politics, my father nearly always had an uphill fight, and was well aware of being on the losing side and of having to lead a forlorn hope. Two scholarly books, the first entitled The Recent Origin of Man (Philadelphia and London, 1875) and a subsequent volume on The Epoch of the Mammoth (London, 1878), to which the author himself attached the greater importance, had spread his fame in learned circles more even in Europe than at home. My recollection is that it was under the auspices of the Victoria Institute in England, of which he was a member, and in company with other members of that society, that in 1881 he undertook — the exploration of the valley of the Somme in France in search of traces of prehistoric man. This foreign expedition involved an extended sojourn in Europe for all our little household and proved to be a rich experience in our lives. Evelyn was then eight years of age and I was just two years older, both old enough to relish novelty and adventure and gain some incidental profit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was considerably more than a year afterwards that we returned to our home in Richmond. Then it was our dear mother's pride and delight to exhibit Evelyn, and me in public, clad in the native costumes of all the foreign lands we had visited. I cannot recall distinctly all the varied and vivid frocks that were worn by Evelyn, certainly to the astonishment and possibly to the envy of her playmates, but my own wardrobe, I can solemnly testify, outshone Joseph's coat of many colours and was wondrous to behold. For one costume, I had an Eton jacket surmounted by collar and beaver and fittingly continued below by a pair of long trousers which roused all the other little boys in Richmond, with one accord, to something like frenzy. One memorable day I ventured outdoors arrayed as Little Lord Fauntleroy, and the mystery is how I ever got back home in safety; yet all I remember now is the indignant taunts and jeers hurled at me by the populace. Perhaps the worst experience of all was when I sallied forth, unwillingly enough, in Scotch kilt and tartan, lacking only dirk and claymore to be as complete a Highlander as was ever seen on land or sea, though those weapons might have stood me in good stead that day. This time, before I had proceeded more than a block from the door of the house, I was assailed by a band of urchins and young ruffians who were so plainly in dead earnest that I lost no time in beating a hasty retreat, being pelted not only with abuse but by hard missiles as well. An ugly mob gathered in front of our house where I was barricaded inside until a policeman came across the street and dispersed it much to my relief. Yet all that' day after changing into ordinary and inconspicuous attire I was exceedingly wary about showing my face on the street. With as much solemnity as Lars Porsena when he swore by the Nine Gods of Clusium he would suffer wrong no more, I told my dear mother that nothing would ever induce me to put on one of those hateful costumes again, and by that time she herself was ready to yield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I never knew what became of all those garments which Mother had purchased for me in Europe with so much pride, and the subject was never again mentioned. Yet for her sake I had to submit, ungraciously and churlishly enough, to one last compromise; for one day out of a clear sky she took Evelyn and me to Cook's photographic studio on Main Street and employed that celebrated artist to take our pictures in romantic fashion. I stood at the prow and Evelyn sat at the stern of an artificial rowboat which was one of the theatrical properties of that up-to-date establishment. The boat seemed to be moored to some foreign shore, but our attire was so elegant and faultless that it was evident the voyage had not been rough and that we were not expecting to encounter any savages in ambush. That dismal picture is still extant in an old family album, and I am always mortified when I am constrained to acknowledge that it is a true and authentic portrait of brother and sister when they were around ten and eight years old, respectively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not in my father's study only but in nearly every room of our house bookcases piled with books stood against the walls, and it would have been strange indeed if in that atmosphere I had not early in life acquired a taste for reading. The first book that came into my own possession was a little duodecimo copy of Aesop's Fables, illustrated by quaint old-fashioned woodcuts which took up the upper half of every left-hand page. The title page of the little volume is gone, but as well as I can make out, it was published in Philadelphia perhaps about 1825. It had belonged originally to my father when he was a boy, and according to a notation in his handwriting he had purchased it from old Mr. Wertenbaker, first librarian of the University of Virginia. It had been rebound by Messrs. Woodhouse and Parham in Richmond and presented to me by my father in 1875. 1 got to know this book almost by heart. At the end of each fable, there was a moral (or "application," as it was called) in smaller type and often longer than the story itself, which was all the more mysterious to me because I never could tell what the connection was with the text that preceded it. Thus, for example, concerning the adventure of "The ass in the lion's skin," the sagacious editor, evidently a "Britisher," commented as follows: "How strangely absurd it is for a timourous person to procure a military post, in order to keep himself out of danger! and to fancy a redcoat the surest protection of cowardice!" Apt and acute as this observation may appear to me now, I thought it was out of place and farfetched when I was a little boy about five years old. I knew the ass was a stupid fellow and had made a fool of himself, but how a cowardly soldier was mixed up with this business was beyond my youthful comprehension. Certainly it is true enough that not everybody is cut out to be a soldier, and I can well imagine what a ridiculous figure I myself would be in the uniform of a captain or major in the army. During the Spanish-American War in 1898, 1 remember jocularly reproaching a village blacksmith in Bedford County, Virginia, for not going to the front and joining Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's famous company. of Rough Riders; whereupon, he drew himself to his full height and retorted instantly, almost indignantly, "Sir, I would rather live for my country than die for it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another noteworthy book associated with my early years was Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. The copy I owned was a rather ornate and handsome edition that had been bestowed as a prize by my Sunday School teacher, Miss Annie Glasgow, whose dear memory is enshrined in my heart with all the admiration and love she inspired in me in those far-off days when I was an irreverent little boy not worthy to sit avher feet. She was the eldest sister of the famous novelist who at that time (1880) was herself just a little girl with a pigtail hanging down her back and whom I used to see every Sunday morning sitting demurely in her father's pew in Dr. Hoge's church. Every boy in the class adored and worshiped Miss Annie Glasgow as if she had been a goddess from on high, good and wise as she was blithe and beautiful. To a little boy the loveliness of woman is an awesome sight to see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If my adored Sunday School teacher had given me the Koran to read, I would have waded through it for her sweet sake and bowed down before Allah. Pilgrim's Progress was for me in those days a thrilling story of adventure from the very moment when Christian, abandoning his wife and children, fled in terror from the City of Destruction. He may not have invented the slogan of "Safety first! " but he certainly ought to be given the credit of the original idea. The interest of the narrative was sustained throughout by his failing into one terrible predicament after another in such quick succession that the poor man seemed. to me never to have a breathing spell from the day he started on his journey. The numerous pictures with which the book was illustrated illuminated every stage of the pilgrim's progress and brought the scenes before me as vividly as if I had followed him step by step along his rough road. One of these pictures I remember still almost as clearly as if it were now before my eyes. No wonder it made a lasting impression, for it showed the dreadful prospect from the summit of Mount Caution where Christian and Hopeful could discern far down in the valley below a woeful group of blind men groping and stumbling about in a wilderness of tombs, the luckless victims of Giant Despair of Doubting Castle. In the days of my youth that infamous scoundrel bore the palm of being the wickedest monster and tyrant that had ever lived, but now I know that evil geniuses more cruel and sinister than Giant Despair have really flourished on earth, not just during the reigns of the Twelve Caesars but in our own times also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pilgrim's Progress was the first, but not the only, prize I got at school; for the very next year, before going to Europe, when I was a pupil in Miss Julia Sully's private and select school for little boys and girls of my own age — conducted in the basement of her home on Franklin Street less than half a block from Capitol Square — my diligence. and aptitude were rewarded at the end of the session by the public presentation of Plutarch's Lives in four volumes. The inscription on the flyleaf of each volume is still to be seen in the old-fashioned and beautiful handwriting of Miss Julia Sully's mother, an elegant old lady whom I can just dimly remember seated in a big armchair by the window looking out on the street, with a lace cap on her head and a ball of worsted in her lap, the personification of antique grace and dignity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course, there was much in Plutarch's Lives that was over the head of a boy ten years old and beyond his ken, but for all that it was here that I got my first glimpse of The glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome, and learned to know at least the names of the chief actors in all that thrilling story. I suppose no book was ever written that has been more sought after and enjoyed from generation to generation, as it was certainly one of the first of ancient writings to be brought from the cloisters of the mediaeval scholars and translated in the modem languages. In the pages of these volumes the long procession of famous men passed before my eyes one by one, it seemed to me, almost as real and lifelike as if I beheld them in flesh and blood, yet never quite as ordinary mortals but more like supermen who had flourished in an heroic age long past and gone forever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The impression left on the mind by a book that has been pored over in childhood is apt to be indelible, even if the book itself is perhaps an inferior one of little or no intrinsic merit or virtue. But when the book in question is at the same time a work of genius approved and attested from generation to generation, as was the case with each of the three books that happened to fall into my hands soon-after I had learned to read, the influence continues to be felt more or less consciously as long as life lasts. When I seek to trace "those first affections" of 'early youth, a certain intrusion of sentiment enters in my recollections and leads me to question my own veracity. Yet after all it seems to me now that the book of all others that penetrated below the skin and left its deepest mark on me was, strange to say, Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar, for it was a work of genius also. Perhaps I was fourteen years old when I encountered that masterpiece for the first time and began to feel in some mysterious way that it was flesh of my flesh. The time came when I could recite whole pages of this volume literally by heart, not just the jingles and rhymes devised on purpose to aid the memory, such, for example, as Ainnis, axis, callis, crinis, Cassis, caulis, fascis, finis, etc. (containing the list of masculine nouns of the third declension ending in - is ), but long involved rules of syntax also that are absolutely unintelligible except to the initiated and those who are by nature the children of light. That singular little volume abounded in admonitions and sibylline utterances, gently, so to speak stealthily, inserted in the main text in smaller type, not one of which was ever to be passed over lightly, much less disregarded entirely, for sooner or later any such transgression was sure to fall heavily. on the head of the offender. It was in those inconspicuous notes or obiter dicta that the author, who for aught I knew dwelt on the summit of high Olympus or at any rate spoke with all the authority of Moses on Mount Sinai, was wont to let fall pearls of great price couched in the form of casual remarks, brief and pithy as epigrams. For dunces each such observation was a veritable stumbling block, but to the wise and wary it was a beacon light! "The participle is transient; the adjective permanent" — thus the truth was revealed without a word of preparation or explanation. Or again — "The Imperfect as the Tense of Evolution is a Tense of Vision"— who could gainsay it? When I came across some saying like that for the first time, it was almost as if the author himself had stooped down and whispered it in my ear and then left me to brood over it. Dutifully, but all in vain, I revolved it in my mind and sought to fathom the meaning; until at length in the midst of the darkness a light shone, the mist dissolved before my eyes, and the cryptic speech was crystal-clear and fraught with truth. Yet nowhere was the genius of the author so manifest as in the extraordinary power of putting in idiomatic English the precise meaning of a Latin sentence which he lifted by way of illustration apart from its context from the great reservoir of Roman literature which seemed to he always in reach just in order to serve his purpose at the moment. Many of Dr. Gildersleeve's inimitable translations have stuck in my memory from that day to this. Patriae quis exsul se quoque fugit? "What exile from his country ever fled himself as well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some books, Lord Bacon said, "are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested." As far .as I was concerned, Gildersleeve's Latin Grammar belonged in the last category. It was hard to assimilate, but I do not begrudge the time and labour I spent on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As well as I can recollect now, I think it must have been soon after we moved to live in our last home in Richmond, on Marshall Street, perhaps in 1882, that I began my first year as a pupil in McGuire's School for boys which was then located on Gamble's Hill not more than a block from the end of South Third Street. The schoolrooms were all on the ground floor of Mr. McGuire's residence in the fine old house which used to be Colonel Gamble's home, in the midst of a spacious yard so high above the level of the street that two long wooden stairways led up to it from the sidewalk far below, one for the front yard on the north side of the house and the other for the back yard on the side towards the river. During considerably more than half a century since my school days, the destruction of old landmarks in both Richmond and Norfolk has gone on relentlessly almost as if it were in obedience to some inexorable law like that of the degradation of energy in physics. Even prior to 18—, the old Gamble mansion had been completely demolished, and the commanding eminence on which it stood was unceremoniously carved down to the level of the street until now not a vestige remains of that once lordly site, much less of the habitation that stood upon it, where I first began to study the rudiments of Latin, Greek, and Algebra.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old folks, I know, are only too prone to boast of long experience and superior wisdom, and no doubt I merely flatter myself in thinking I have reached the age of discretion when it is easy to tell true metal from false. Be that as it may, let me pause here reverently for a brief moment in order to pay tribute, long deferred but perhaps for that very reason all the more heartfelt and generous, to the highly competent teachers who took me by the hand and guided my footsteps in the three or four years when I was under their tutelage in McGuire's School.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. McGuire (or the "boss" as we fondly called him, some times also "Molly" after the notorious brigand of those days) was the "principal" of that famous academy, for the term "head master" was not then in use in Virginia. His father before him, whose name he bore, was a clergyman who had been principal of the Episcopal High School near Alexandria until the Civil War came and put an end to his employment; and the son following in the footsteps of his father was the founder of McGuire's School in Richmond which was destined to flourish in that city with undiminished vigour not only as long as he himself lived but throughout nearly all the long life of his own son and successor down to a few years ago. The three John Peyton McGuire's are a noble lineage of great school teachers from grandsire to grandson whose pupils from one generation to the next have unceasingly loved and honoured each of them in turn. If ever a man was anointed from on high for his task on earth, it was the principal of McGuire's School in the 1880's when I was one of his most unworthy and obstreperous pupils and certainly one of the most devoted to him. In Latin and Algebra he was the best drill-master a schoolboy could possibly have, and his mild and inflexible discipline was so just and righteous, withal so full of the milk of human kindness, that not even the most unlicked cub ever dreamed of rebelling against his authority or could fail to be subdued by his benevolence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the accomplished assistants who surrounded the principal, about the middle of the 1880's, were James Morris, handsome and upright as a Roman youth, who I believe was, for quite a number of years afterwards, rector of old Monumental Church where the Reverend Dr. Armstrong created a stir when I was a lad in Richmond and used to get an inkling of the gossip that went the rounds then, Robert W. Tomlin, without doubt one of the finest disciplinarians that ever kept in leash a crowd of unruly schoolboys, a very superior man in every respect who married Nina Taylor in Norfolk and rose to high distinction as a leading lawyer in that city; Charles Edward Bishop, who on weekdays taught Latin and Greek in McGuire's School and on Sundays played the organ in Grace Street Presbyterian Church (where Dr. Drew had succeeded the venerable Dr. Read as pastor) and who was afterwards a professor in the College of William and Mary; and, last but not least, Willis H. Bocock, an erudite scholar even then when he was fresh from the University of Virginia, who now (if I am not mistaken) rests on his laurels as professor emeritus of Greek in the University of Georgia. There were others besides, for example, Mr. Puryear, Mr. Wauchope, "old man English," Professor Pettus, Professor L. N. Hasseleff (who taught French, perhaps German also), and a Mr. Little; but having less contact with them, I do not recall them nearly so vividly as the others named above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As luck would have it, my desk in school was directly behind John Chaffin's. Different as could be in tastes and pursuits, he and I were sworn friends and allies, hand and glove with each other. However, his seat in front of mine as well as his great physique put me at a certain disadvantage, chiefly when without the slightest provocation or warning he would suddenly let go with his right arm and slap me violently on the cheek behind his back. If a firecracker had exploded, the noise of the impact could not have been louder; yet I almost doubted myself what had befallen me, for John himself looked round to see what had happened with as much astonishment as everybody else in the room, and even I was forced to pretend that I knew no more than the indignant teacher who from his seat on the platform scanned every countenance. It was a blow entirely without animosity, nay rather a token of affection, certainly not to be resented. Nobody present save the perpetrator and the victim knew for certain the origin of this periodic disturbance. It was a flagrant breach of decorum, as the teacher in charge of the room at the time always gave us to understand. Where were his eyes, I used to wonder, if he never could see the print of John Chaffin's fingers as plainly marked on my face as if the imprint had been taken by a criminologist on a sheet of waxed paper?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I daresay no boy ever lived on earth who so thoroughly enjoyed going to school as my friend John Chaffin who was "kept in" regularly every day, and certainly no schoolboy ever had a more sovereign disdain for everything that was to be learned from books. Somehow he got the notion that Themistocles was one of my special heroes, and just to show his total lack of respect for that worthy, and above all to tease me, he delighted in calling him Themi-stockles as if his name rhymed with "cockles," and like a simpleton I took pains to correct his pronunciation and sought to rouse his interest in the struggles between Athens and Sparta. The inside of my desk was filled with textbooks neatly arranged in order with several compartments reserved for writing pads, pens, and pencils, etc., and a place in one corner for the "snack" I used to take to school to cat at recess. On the contrary, the interior of John Chaffin's desk was like a miniature museum and contained a rare collection of curios, odds and ends of every variety, not only inanimate junk, jackknives, fishhooks, nails, string, indeed nearly everything you could possibly think of, but living animals as well, birds, snails, lizards, and any creeping creature that John happened to find on his way to school that day, for everything that lived and breathed excited both his sympathy and curiosity. Indeed his tastes were manifold, and his genius and activities were equal to his propensities. Of his pranks and punishments I could tell many stories, having sometimes been implicated in them, bur at present one must suffice as more or less typical of all the others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the particular day when this episode occurred, a written examination was being held in our schoolroom, and for the time being all the usual recitations were suspended. An examination was a dignified and solemn occasion, and dead silence prevailed, so intent was everybody on his task. The teacher in charge of the room was Mr. Bocock, who, seated high on the platform in a comfortable chair, was whiling away the time as best he could by reading a new novel which was just off the press and in which I must say he seemed to be deeply engrossed. In the midst of the stillness John Chaffin reached in his desk and took out a Jew's harp, or maybe it was a homemade fiddle, and rising suddenly to his feet called out in clarion tones, "Act I, Scene I." Instantly all eyes were turned towards him as he proceeded forthwith to play a mournful ditty, yet without visible sign of emotion on his face. The teacher on the platform, just as imperturbable, seemed scarcely to take his eyes from the book before him, and sat perfectly still until the first stanza was concluded and John was about to announce the beginning of the next scene. Before John could utter the words, Mr. Bocock, without taking his eyes from the book, said a little wearily but perfectly distinctly, "Chaffin, step to the board! " Putting down his harp on the top of his desk, John marched obediently to the platform and took his stand in front of the blackboard. Then Mr. Bocock rose from his chair and handing John the book he had been reading, said, "Write on the board the preface of that book in Latin!" and for the first time a faint smile hovered on his lips. I found out afterwards that the book was Mr. Virginius Dabney's Don Miff which had its title from a child's pronunciation of the name John Smith. With the book in one hand and an unbroken stick of chalk in the other hand, my undismayed friend turned his broad face for an instant towards the blackboard and then gazed at me, with a curious smirk on his countenance. At that moment my admiration was unbounded, I leaped to my feet, and lifting the Greek lexicon high above my head, I let it fall to the floor, upsetting in its descent an inkstand on Henry Valentine's desk across the aisle. The impact of the huge dictionary sounded throughout the room like the Day of Judgment, and for a moment or two it looked as if Bedlam was about to be let loose. Retribution was instant, and in less than a minute afterwards I was standing in front of the blackboard on the opposite wall having been given the laconic commission to "turn Chaffin's Latin into Greek." There we stood, the two of us, all the rest of that livelong day, enduring our punishment as best we could, looking sheepish enough; and for all practical purposes idle as painted ships on a painted ocean, for John did not even attempt to make a beginning of his task, and nay performance had perforce to wait on his accomplishment. I cannot recall how we were released at last, but I know that ever afterwards John Chaffin and I agreed that Mr. Bocock was a foeman worthy of our steel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When school let out at three o'clock, Mr. McGuire took his stand on one side of the open folding doors between the two big schoolrooms where his voice could be heard by all concerned, even though he himself was not visible from one of the communicating rooms off to one side; then, with a certain solemnity, he read out the names of the boys that were to be "kept in" that afternoon, either to learn their lessons better or to "write columns" in punishment of misconduct. In that establishment "column" was a solid phalanx of figures consisting of seven horizontal rows of seven digits each which was not finished and complete until the sum total of the column was accurately computed by addition and written below it. When the number of columns imposed on the culprit amounted to as many as a hundred or more (as was often the case for severe offenses), it was no light task for the teacher to audit the account, and I doubt whether he ever really did so except in a more or less perfunctory way. John Chaffin hardly took the trouble to listen to hear his name called on Mr. McGuire's list of delinquents, for he knew beforehand it was written somewhere on that fatal sheet of paper; so, the moment Mr. McGuire rang his little bell, John set to work promptly, his face all smeared with ink but without a trace of worry on it, and began at once to do his columns. Even so, I know he is in arrears to this day, for his debt was piled so high that it would have taken a lifetime to discharge it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The schoolmate I loved best of all was Mr. McGuire's nephew and namesake, John Peyton McGuire, of Berryville in Clarke County, who lived in the principal's home as long as he was a pupil in the school. David and Jonathan were not more devoted than he and I were to each other, not only in the years when we were both in school together but afterwards when I left him and went to Richmond College. My comrade was perhaps two years older and much more mature than I was, but while he was a born leader, he never asserted his superiority, although I gladly admitted it. Handsome and manly, upright and chivalrous, gay and debonair, to me he was like Sir Galahad without a peer. He was a favourite with boys and girls alike. Often in the evening John McGuire used to walk home with me, and Father and Mother would prevail on him to spend the night, a welcome guest under our roof. However, he suffered from one infirmity which annoyed and even persecuted him all the days of his life; yet instead of detracting from his charm, I believe it really enhanced it. It was not just an impediment of speech but a most aggravated form of stuttering, absolutely beyond control. While I know it was a sore affliction and he did his best to overcome it, this handicap never cramped his style either in society or in his ordinary occupations. Nobody could laugh, more heartily than he did himself at his sheer inability to pronounce the word he tried in vain to utter;. yet now and then he used to lose his temper when he suspected somebody of having fun at his expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last year I was in Richmond College (1887-88) John McGuire and I used to sally forth together in the evening to pay visits to some young lady or other in our set who happened to take our fancy, for by this time we were two very susceptible young men and loved danger for its own sake, not knowing the risks we ran.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One particular adventure of this kind I happen to recall partly because we took so much pains to put on our best apparel for the occasion (which I am afraid was not very good at that), but chiefly on account of the disappointment we had that evening. We were planning to call for the first time on a fashionable miss who dwelt in an elegant mansion on West Franklin Street, a lady indeed who was outside the sphere of our operations and quite out of our reach. Never before had either of us ventured in such high society, and I think both of us were a little uncomfortable as we stood on the marble steps in front of her door and rang the bell. Instantly a butler in livery answered the summons, and nothing daunted, John McGuire essayed to tell him our names. Alas! try as he would, he simply could not utter a name like mine that began with the letter S. The ebon countenance of the butler could not hide a smile; whereupon, John's wrath suddenly flared up and was so ungovernable that he smote the poor fellow with his fist and metamorphosed the smile on his face completely. It was not a very hard blow, but it was enough. I was taken so much by surprise that I hardly knew what had happened until John and I descended the marble steps arm in arm, and were back on the pavement. So we never had a glimpse of the wondrous girl we set out to visit that evening in all our fine raiment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I believe that was the last expedition John McGuire and I ever made together. He was nearly a grown man then, and at the end of the session he returned to his home in Berryville and planned to go to work to earn his living, as so many talented youths were obliged to do early in life in those hard times in the South; and not long afterwards I left Richmond also and went to the University of Virginia. So we parted ne'er to meet again! We continued to write to each other from time to time, and we swore eternal friendship, but our paths diverged. Then one day — it was the middle of June, 1880 — tragic tidings came! Seeking to save the life of a companion, John Peyton McGuire was drowned in New River at a place called Hawk's Nest. No lapse of time has ever erased the memory of that first great sorrow of my life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My first home in Richmond when I was a very little boy and had Malvina for my nurse was in a small house on West Main Street, number 105, next door to the Wortharn's who lived in the big house on the corner at Foushee Street, and directly opposite the back yard of Colonel Archer Anderson's residence. I daresay I was about seven or eight years old when we moved to 616 East Franklin Street and lived in a house that was left standing there until it was torn down about 1940. It was separated by an alley from the high brick wall that enclosed the spacious grounds of the old Archer mansion which fronted on Sixth Street. As you descended the hill from that northeast corner, about the middle of the block just before you got to our house, you barely had room enough to squeeze between the Archer's brick wall and the trunk of the huge sycamore tree which rose out of the pavement and occupied nearly the whole width of the sidewalk, certainly one of the noblest trees I ever saw in my life. I know for certain that we were still living in that house when I was a pupil in Miss Sully's School and when we got back from Europe in 1881, but I cannot recall distinctly the year when we moved to 1003 East Marshall Street, where we lived ever afterwards until the family went to Norfolk to live about 1890, just before I returned to Richmond from the University of Virginia and taught for one session in McGuire's School. The Marshall Street house, which was owned by my father, is still standing amid the ruins of many old homes that were fine residences a long time ago, though even in the 1880's all that neighbourhood was on the downgrade and beginning to be deserted by the old patrician families that had flourished there for many generations from the foundation of the city. Diagonally across the street from our house was the elegant home of Major Legh R. Page at the northwest corner of Marshall and Tenth streets. One of my chief delights in those days was to get a glimpse, if possible, of his beautiful daughter Mary Legh Page, who was then in the flower of her youth and a truly heavenly sight to see. Once, but once only, I had the good fortune to behold her and May Handy together in our house at the same time; it was like the conjunction of two stars of the first magnitude so evenly matched in pure loveliness that mortal eye could not discern wherein either excelled the other. Then I was just a lad not more than about fifteen years old, yet old enough to have read Edgar Allan Poe's lines To Helen and even to have learned some of them by heart, for I know that when I gazed at Mary Legh Page, who never knew me from Adam, I used to murmur ecstatically, . . . Thy beauty is to me Like those Nicéan barks of yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, way-worn wanderer bore To his own native shore! although I was not sure exactly what the poet had in mind and had sonic doubt as to whether the verse fitted my particular case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My last year in McGuire's School was the session of 1885-86, when I won the orator's medal and had also the honour of being awarded a diploma with a purple ribbon. My friend Walter Fauntleroy Taylor, destined to become a famous Wall Street lawyer in New York, received the "purple ribbon" at the same time, nor did anybody more richly deserve it, for he was a gentleman and a scholar all the days of his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next two years (1886-88) I was enrolled as a day scholar in Richmond College where I devoted myself exclusively to the study of Latin, Greek, and Mathematics. That institution was located then at the extreme end of Grace Street, about four or five blocks west of Monroe Park, and, I suppose, was just inside the city limits. It was a walk of considerably more than a mile from my house to the gate of the college grounds which I took thither and back every day in good and bad weather alike. Not long ago I happened to meet a dear old lady in New York who giggled when she heard my name and said, "Is it possible you are the boy I used to see going past my old home in Richmond when I was a little girl? You were on your way to school and always wore tight breeches and oh, such a high collar!" I could not help wincing a little at the picture she recalled; yet I had to acknowledge that her identification was beyond dispute. Who can ever really wish to see himself as others see him?.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The teachers I had at Richmond College were undoubtedly three very highly qualified and unusual men each in his own way, and each of them has left an indelible impression on me. Herbert H. Harris, professor of Greek and Chairman of the Faculty, inspired me with a profound respect for his learning and character both. From Edmund Harrison, who had the chair of Latin, I obtained a clear and just insight into the great literature of ancient Rome which has proved invaluable to me ever since. I can never be too grateful to him for all he did for me in those days. Professor Harrison's nickname on the campus was "Cum," which I believe was a contraction from cum occasionale, a construction for which he was supposed to have a certain partiality and fondness but which I cannot now identify unless it was another name for Dr. Gildersleeve's circumstantial cum . To me, Edward Smith, professor of Mathematics, who was a younger brother of Professor Francis H. Smith of the University of Virginia, seemed to be a veritable wizard and genius whose intellectual processes were as strange and unaccountable as they were quick and infallible. Certainly his mind was one of the keenest and most active I ever happened to encounter. Puryear in Chemistry, Winston in Physics, Thomas in Philosophy, and Pollard in English were some of the other teachers in Richmond College in my day, but I knew them only by sight and was not a pupil of any one of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps I can boast that in Latin and Greek I shone with a little lustre, but in Analytic Geometry I certainly trailed near the foot of the class. At the end of my first session in Richmond College, I learned with a rude shock, yet not wholly unexpected, that I had failed to "pass" in Mathematics. Ashamed and crestfallen, I knew that I had only myself to blame. Edward Smith was a just man who never showed favour where it was not deserved, nor was he one to suffer fools gladly. I think he never had a very good opinion of my talents or ability, and I do not remember his ever taking any particular interest in me one way or the other; yet it was Edward Smith who first inspired in me a genuine love of Mathematics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Professor Edmund Harrison was warmhearted and generous, and he went out of his way to be kind to me. Under his guidance I suppose I must have read during those two years upwards of a thousands pages of the best Latin authors in both prose and poetry. That great philosophical poem of Lucretius, De rerum natura, was certainly over my head, as hard to comprehend as it was difficult to translate; yet I tried that hurdle also and even fancied I got an inkling of what it was all about. While I did not know then that Lucretius was greater as a poet than he was as a philosopher, I was sometimes carried off my feet by the lofty flights of his imagination, and the long time I spent on this didactic poem was certainly not wasted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the same time, under the expert guidance of Professor Harris, I was reading Xenophon, Herodotus, and Thucydides in Greek and perhaps also the orations of Lysias and Demosthenes. Professor Harris was precise and methodical in his way of teaching, and if we went at a slower pace in Greek than we were wont to go in Latin, it was perhaps with all the firmer tread for not being so swift.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the way of sound and useful education, no discipline, it seems to me, was better calculated to yield fruitful results for such pupils as were susceptible to its influence. Ignorant and inexperienced as I certainly was in many ways, by the time I finished my course in Richmond College, I had already acquired the art of learning and the habit of study which are the two keys of knowledge, that is, of the knowledge that is to be gained from books. Per aspera ad astra, that was my motto, even if I did not take it quite seriously. My own experience is personal, of course, and perhaps of little worth for others who are differently constituted, but never once since then, much as I have heard to the contrary, has my faith faltered in the abiding value of literature as the corner stone and foundation of a useful and sensible education. I still believe, now perhaps more firmly than ever, and in spite of all the winds of doctrine that blow from all sides, that a serious course of six or seven years in school and at college spent chiefly in the study of Greek and Roman Classics, under the guidance of sympathetic and enlightened teachers, is likely to impart to an impressionable mind susceptible of receiving it, a poise and reasonableness and an enjoyment and tranquility that are quite unattainable by any other process of training. I pronounce this judgment with more confidence because I know that others far better qualified than I am have been led to substantially the same conclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During all the years that I went to school in Richmond, my father had laid out a systematic programme and supervised himself my instruction in history and English literature. Accordingly, by the time I got to be seventeen years of age, I had had an extensive course of reading in these subjects. For example, besides Gillies Greece (which was a very formidable volume printed in two columns on a page) I had had a complete course in the history of England from the time of Alfred the Great to the end of the reign of King George III and had read all of Hume, Maculae, and Lord Macon and other works that were germane to the task. Nor was it enough for me simply to read these books, for my father examined me 'afterwards and from time to time required me to write compositions on subjects which I myself selected for the purpose. This part of the task was hardest of all, for I knew in advance that my father would be unsparing in his criticism, yet perfectly just withal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My father had graduated from the University of Virginia with the degree of Master of Arts when he was eighteen years of age. After I had attended Richmond College for two years, he deemed that the time had come for me to go to the University of Virginia also.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">II MATRICULATION 1888</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Alma Mater! Alma Mater! New-fashioned folks, with their large theories of education, may find fault with thee. But a true Spartan mother thou art — hard and stern as the old matron who bricked up her son Pausanias, bringing the first stone to immure him; hard and stern, I say, to the worthless, but full of majestic tenderness to the worthy." SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON in The Caxtons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was in the consulship of William M. Thornton (1851-1935), who succeeded Colonel Charles S. Venable as Chairman of the Faculty, that I both began and ended my career as student and instructor in the University of Virginia. Then he himself was just a young professor of Applied Mathematics, but had he been Agamemnon, he could not have seemed to me more born to be feared and obeyed. In those simple days when Romans were like brothers, the modest office of the ruler of the campus was naught but an ordinary student's room adjoining the residence of Professor John R. Page in the pavilion at the north end of West Lawn. The session used to begin regularly on the first day of October, and I suppose it was on that very day in the year 1888 — to me it seems no longer ago than if it had been yesterday — that, accompanied by my father, I stood before the Chairman's door and found myself a moment later in Mr. Thornton's presence. He rose from his chair behind the table as we entered and coming forward greeted my fattier cordially. He extended his hand to me also and was affable and polite; yet I was sensitive enough to notice that the nod he bestowed on me was not much more than just a heedless gaze As o'er some stranger glancing, and thereafter I had little to say while he and my father carried on an animated conversation. Youthful and insignificant as I know I appeared to him that day, I take pride in adding that my first introduction to, Mr. Thornton was the beginning of a lifelong attachment and friendship that never faltered to the day of his lamented death in 1935. Thornton was indeed a man of great native ability and rare intellectual power, and the better I knew him, the greater he grew in stature. Such testimony is proof of a man's real worth, for often enough it is the other way round; the exalted personage who loomed so large in the eyes of the raw cadet is perhaps only too apt to shrink to quite ordinary proportions in the riper and more callous judgment of the same observer later on in life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It took only a short time to transact the business in the Chairman's office. Mr. Thornton agreed with my father that for the present I had already gone far enough in Latin, but that another year could be devoted with advantage to concentrated study of Greek and Mathematics. Accordingly, it was decided without a dissenting voice that I was to take concurrently the intermediate and senior classes in each of these subjects, with a view to completing the requirements for graduation in both schools by the end of my first session, as indeed seemed reasonable enough in view of my previous preparation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next step was to see the Proctor and conclude the business of matriculation by paying the required fees and making arrangements for my board and lodging. The Proctor was Major Green Peyton whose home and office were in the pavilion in the middle of East Range, and after our interview with the Chairman, we repaired thither immediately. Major Peyton and my father were friends of long standing, his wife being indeed my father's first cousin, and in his office I was not only at ease but, so to speak, at home. Much to my satisfaction, I soon learned from him that the Thompson Brown Scholarship, founded by my aunt Mrs. Charles S. Venable in memory of her first husband, was to be bestowed on me by her request as long as I continued to be a student in the University. This gift, which amounted to $90 a year in cash, was a windfall, and the first thought that passed through my mind on being told about it was that here was a possible means of defraying such little debts as livery-stable bills and various other obligations that are often quite annoying to an impecunious, young gentleman in college. During the two or three years previous to my matriculation, I had been wont to spend part of every summer in the gay and fashionable home of my cousins on Park Street in Charlottesville, and, consequently, among the boys and girls of that delightful community I had already many friends and boon companions and was a participant in their joys and sorrows and all their ways of life. For instance, I knew by experience that it cost exactly one dollar and a half at Payne's Livery Stable to hire a two-wheel dogcart with a nag hitched to it, and that the single afternoon on which I was the proud possessor of this outfit was just about long enough to take a pretty girl for my companion and go round the "nine-mile circuit," which was then a favourite drive, in time to bring her safe home again before it got dark, otherwise it would be scandalous. If on arriving at her door she invited me to stay and have supper (as could usually be expected), that was a two-fold joy directed towards heart and stomach alike, and my dollar and a half would certainly have been well spent! If such were the visions that were going through my head while Major Peyton and my father were engaged in making out my account, neither of them was aware of the vital concern I had in those figures; so the itemized budget of expenditures as finally adopted contained no provision whatever for Payne's Livery Stable bill. In consequence of this serious omission, it turned out afterwards that, being hard put to it, on more than one occasion I was reduced to the necessity of selling a bureau or some other more or less indispensable article of furniture in order to hire a horse and buggy and keep an important engagement with the damsel who at that particular moment happened to be all the world to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By nightfall of that first eventful day, I had received my father's last injunctions, and when he bade me farewell and took the train back to Richmond, I was already installed in my new lodgings at No. 14 Monroe Hill, doubtless not a little elated by a strange feeling of self-reliance, that "glorious privilege" every youth longs for "of being independent." The rent of the unfurnished room was only $30 for the entire session of nine months. How I got the furniture I have now only the dimmest recollection, except that, such as it was, it was all bought second-hand, plain enough when it was new and bruised subsequently by rough usage. The bed, somewhat wider than single, occupied one corner of the room and a pine bureau another corner, the two being separated by the intervening back window and an old trunk whose curved top ascended at its highest point not very far above the level of the window sill and which held inside nearly all my lares et penates and other earthly possessions. Later on I acquired in some way a low steamer trunk also, as it used to be called, which was conveniently, perhaps a little contemptuously, shoved out of sight under the bed. It generally contained apples and other raw materials collected for consumption between meals, especially late at night just before descending into the peaceful arms of Morpheus. The door of the room was directly opposite the window, and on the right-hand side next to the door was the closet closed in front by a calico curtain that had to be pulled to one side in order to see inside. Built into the room in a shallow recess on the side of the mantelpiece opposite the bureau, the closet served the double purpose of wardrobe and washstand. There were several hooks on one side for hanging towels and the suit of clothes which was not in use for the time being, and on the other side was a set of several shelves for holding a motley collection of odds and ends including toilet articles, medicine, and perhaps also a bottle of wine or liquor if I was fortunate enough to have it. The washstand itself was simply a horizontal board extending from one side of the closet to the other about waist-high from the floor, with a round hole cut in the middle for gripping the washbasin and holding it tight in place. A pitcher of water usually rested inside the basin when the latter was not in actual use for any other purpose, and a pail stood on the floor underneath into which the water in the basin could be emptied. The outside top of the closet supported a pile of kindling wood stacked all the way up to the ceiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the fourth corner of the room, on the other side of the door opposite the closet, a bookshelf was fastened tight against the north wall. The two upper shelves held all my textbooks and a few miscellaneous books of one kind and another, including the Oxford Bible my mother gave me when I left home, the Works of Shakespeare all in a single cheap volume, Lord Byron's Poems, Pope's translation of Homer's Iliad , a duodecimo edition of Don Quixote in two volumes, Dr. Smith's History of Greece, Hume's History of England (5 volumes), Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy , Smollett's Humphrey Clinker, Fielding's Tom Jones , Dickens's David Copperfield, Mrs. Humphrey Ward's Robert Elsmere, besides some other more or less standard works that I cannot positively recall. The truth is, during the whole time I was a student in the University of Virginia, I affected to be a young gentleman of catholic literary tastes, and I tried and contrived to produce that impression to a certain extent. As a matter of fact, the collection of authors above mentioned was, I suppose, largely accidental and happened to consist mainly of such volumes as I had been able to purloin from my father's library in Richmond before leaving home. The two lower shelves of the bookcase were reserved for such flotsam and jetsam as could find no other convenient place of repose — loose articles, a hat, an extra pair of shoes, a tennis racquet, etc. One of the two or three chairs in the room was an old-fashioned wooden armchair with a writing board attached on one side that could be let down when not in use. Useful as this contrivance was for some purposes, on the whole it was not as convenient as a lapboard that could be held on the arms of a rocking chair, chiefly because the latter could accommodate several books at the same time and above all my big Greek lexicon. Lastly, a small round table in the centre of the room held my student's lamp in the days before we changed from kerosene oil to electricity for illumination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two indispensable articles of furniture had to be kept outdoors. One was a large wooden coal chest that held perhaps as much as half a ton of soft coal. This oblong box rested on the ground with one of the two narrow sides close against the outside wall below the window, the lid of the box, which could be lifted on a pair of hinges when the padlock was removed, being nearly flush with the window sill. The little grate beneath the mantelpiece was hardly big enough to hold more than two or three ordinary lumps of coal; yet small as the fire was in it, it sufficed to keep the room snug and comfortable even in the coldest weather. The initials and other insignia of all the previous denizens of my abode had been piously carved — more often than not burned by a red-hot poker — in the old woodwork around the fireplace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other utensil that had to be kept outdoors also for lack of space inside was my tin bath tub or "hat tub," as it was called from its shape being like that of a girl's large hat 'turned upside down. Somewhat precariously, perhaps a little ostentatiously also, this outward and visible symbol was suspended under the arcade against the brick wall on one side of my front door, and when the wind howled, it rocked back and forth on the rusty old nail and banged against the wall with a noise like stage thunder. Sometimes indeed the nail pulled loose from the mortar, and then there was a loud crash on the pavement below that roused all the inhabitants of Monroe Hill. On such occasions everybody rushed out and lent a helping hand to rescue the battered tub and then to hang it back again if possible with a firmer hold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One drawback about my new domicile, as I was soon to find out, was that it was not only in plain view of Mr. Thornton's imposing residence on the crest of Monroe Hill but within hailing distance also, for it is never quite safe for a subaltern to be under his master's watchful eye by day as well as exposed to his wakeful ear by night. As a matter of fact, the shorter arm of the L-shaped row of dormitories on Monroe Hill was joined to Mr. Thornton's house by a pair of communicating rooms that were used for his library and study. Archer Anderson and his younger brother Joe, old schoolmates of mine in Richmond who had both come to college two or three years before me, occupied the two rooms in the angle of the L; then on the long side towards Dawson's Row came first Billy Magill, then Joe Dunn, both from Petersburg and both from McCabe's School in that town; and, third, Julian Wells, of Charleston, South Carolina, whose room was adjacent to mine. On the other side Randolph Hicks, of The Plains in Fauquier County, was my next-door neighbour. Jim Stevens and his roommate Boyle, Boyle and Stevens as they were usually known because they were almost as inseparable as Siamese twins, lived in the last room at the end of the row. I believe they were both from Mississippi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among them all my best and dearest friend was Joe Dunn (the Reverend Dr. Joseph B. Dunn, '90, of Richmond, Virginia), who afterwards married my beautiful cousin Martha Southall, a famous belle in Charlottesville in those days. He and I had many congenial tastes and bonds of union. Yet even then his aims were higher than mine, and though now living in retirement in his home in Richmond, he was for many years a very distinguished clergyman in the Episcopal Church, widely known and much beloved in Virginia. Few persons that I have ever encountered had a greater flair for literature than Joe Dunn, and even in his boyhood he showed great talent for writing. He was much addicted to poetry, both gay and sentimental, in his college days, and occasionally he used to venture to compose verses himself. One of his fighter pieces, if I remember correctly, began with the lines, When Peggy's arms her dog impris'n, I oft could wish my neck were his'n, but exactly what the sequel was, either I never knew or it never was decided. It was Joe Dunn too who taught me that in Limericks and perhaps even in narrative verse on the order of Byron's Don Juan, it was perfectly permissible in a tight place to force two words to rhyme with each other even in a case where they did not have exactly the same number of syllables, for example" "goat" and "poet" simply by transposing the latter into "pote." However, as my own muse was never very sprightly at best, Joe Dunn's instruction, useful as it might have been to a more gifted disciple, I am sorry to say was never turned to advantage by me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My next-door neighbour, Julian Wells, was a perfect gentleman if one ever lived in this world, not exactly unsociable, yet somewhat shy and solitary. His aloofness might have passed unnoticed except for a curious way he had of reminding us of his presence in our midst. Without rhyme or reason and invariably without the slightest warning, suddenly in broad daylight Julian Wells would throw the door of his room wide-open and, standing there on the threshold with a loaded revolver in his hand, would discharge a volley of bullets in the plaster ceiling of the arcade just above his head, much to the consternation of all the peaceful and law-abiding inhabitants of Monroe Hill and Dawson's Row. At first we conjectured that our friend was perhaps celebrating the anniversary of some glorious and patriotic deed that had been done once upon a time in his native state, but the theory broke down unless there was a legal holiday in South Carolina nearly every month of the year. Wells's fusillade was of short duration, but it reverberated far and wide while it lasted. I never ceased from wondering why Mr. Thornton and his family endured this periodic disturbance without ever seeming to notice it, or why Julian Wells, so far as I know, was never called to account for all the plastering that was blasted from the arcade ceiling and had to be swept off the pavement next day by the patient janitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boyle and Stevens were two amateur musicians as wedded to their art as they were devoted to each other, Banjo or guitar, mandolin or zither, never for a moment day or night, so at least it seemed to me, were not both of them plucking one instrument or the other as if they were alone together in the wide, wide world and it mattered not how long the performance lasted. I myself am not a judge of music in all its varieties, and all I can say with certainty is that in this particular instance It was wild— it was fitful — as wild as the breeze, It wandered about into several keys; but for good or evil anybody who lived on Monroe Hill in the session of 1888-89 simply had to get used to it, for there was no escape short of murder or suicide. Boyle and Stevens flourished before the radio was invented and long before Bing Crosby and all his tribe began to "croon" in every Christian home in the land. Perhaps if I could hear their simple melody once more, it might seem virile and even grateful by comparison with certain modern music to which I am more or less forced to listen. Bill Nye once said sagely enough that Wagner was better than it sounds!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Randolph Flicks, who got to be an eminent lawyer in New York, was a fellow of infinite jest besides being a great lady's' man and society leader. He was handsome withal and immaculately dressed always. If he lacked a new shirt or was at a loss for the proper necktie to wear on some particular occasion, he had no scruples about invading the room of his next-door neighbour and selecting the most suitable article of apparel he could find in his wardrobe. If afterwards I happened to meet Randolph Hicks that same evening in one of the fashionable drawing rooms downtown in Charlottesville where we were both frequent visitors,. little by little it would begin to dawn on me that my elegant friend was almost ostentatiously or at any rate barefacedly arrayed in one or more of my own precious garments. My astonishment at this discovery afforded him the greatest possible amusement and put him in rare good humour all the rest of the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Late one Sunday morning I woke up and remembered with joy that I had an engagement to go to church with lovely Maggie Mason. To sit by her side in the family pew in old Christ Church in Charlottesville, then to escort her home (which was quite a long stroll), and almost certainly to be invited to stay to dinner surely that was as blissful a prospect as any youth on earth could have that heavenly day in early autumn! I opened my eyes and yawned. There in front of me a cheerful fire glowed on the hearth, and a jet of steam issued from the spout of the iron kettle on the bracket of the grate. Andrew Jackson, the coloured janitor who waited on me had his faults, but he had his virtues also. Evidently, a little while before, he had tiptoed in my room as usual, and lighted the fire without disturbing me; evidently too he had remembered that it was Sunday and it was my bounden duty to take a bath before breakfast. Now all was in readiness for that hebdomadal act of ablution. The tub had been brought indoors and placed in front of the fire. A pail of cold water was on the rug beside it, to be used to temper the hot water in the kettle. A towel and a cake of soap were laid on the seat of the hat tub, and another towel was spread on the floor for me to step on when I got out of the bath. I glanced at the watch under my pillow — Goodness gracious! it was already after half-past nine o'clock, and I had to bathe, dress, get breakfast, and be downtown at the church door, more than a mile away, by eleven o'clock sharp. Mrs. Burthe's boardinghouse where I took my meals was at the end of West Range not much farther than a hundred yards from my door. The breakfast-hour on Sunday was always later than usual, but the door of the dining room was locked punctually at 9:45 A. M. I was aware there was not a moment to spare, and quick as a flash I leaped out of bed and began to pull on my trousers, intending to get a bite of breakfast first and then return and take the bath afterwards. The first part of the plan succeeded reasonably well; I got a piece of toast and a cup of lukewarm coffee, but when I reached my room again all out of breath and entered the door, the sight that met my eyes, doubtless more lewd than ludicrous, was the naked form of Randolph Hicks placidly ensconced in my tub, his body smeared over down to the waist in a thick lather of soapsuds. The floor all round was splashed with water as if a live porpoise had been let loose in the room. Hicks was certainly in as high spirits at that moment as any animal could be, and he called out to me to come in without minding him. My indignation was no match for his glee, and I had to make the best of it. Of course, I missed my bath that day, but I kept my tryst with Maggie Mason. If seeing me in my best attire, she ever suspected I was not immaculate through and through, she was far too innocent and well-bred to intimate that I was naught but a whited sepulchre, pure without and foul within. Nevertheless, the story got all over town of how Randolph Hicks stole my bath, for he told it himself with great gusto everywhere he went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I first came to the University, the two great rival fraternities were the DKE's and the ATO's, and so far as college politics was concerned, nor much love was lost between these powerful cliques. The high quality of the personnel of the ATO's was measured by such typical representatives as Archer Anderson and Reid Hobson, but in order to match them it was enough for the DKE's to point to their own Hampden Bagby and Raleigh Minor, who certainly ranked as high in those days as any pair of students in college. A few months previously, namely, in June, 1888, the hard-earned and much-coveted degree of Master of Arts had been conferred on each of perhaps as notable a group of candidates as had ever been presented for graduation up to that time, and three members of that small group had been Archer Anderson, Hampden Bagby, and Raleigh Minor. In the session of 1888-89 Anderson and Minor were both back in college as first-year Law students; but Bagby went to Nashville, Tennessee, where he taught two years (1888-90) in Mr. Clarence Wallace's celebrated academy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two large round tables were reserved in Mrs. Burthe's dining room on West Range, one for the ATO's and the other for the DKE's, and that was about. the closest those two organizations ever got together. At 'least a year before I came to college, I had been pledged to join the DKE's, and now at last that boyhood ambition had been realized; I myself was one of the élite as I fondly imagined. The other members of Eta Chapter of DKE in 1888-89, as well as I can recall, were: Charles Baskerville, William Cameron, W. Robertson Gordon, Robert Tate Irvine, E. 0. McCabe, Joseph McElroy, Robert French Mason, F. A. Meacham, Raleigh Colston Minor, Sidney M. Neely, Jefferson Davis Norris, Allen Potts, Francis P. Salas, Muir Weissinger, Joseph P. Winston, Thomas Longstreet Wood, and Elisha E. Wright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the most popular and conspicuous Eli Banana's in college before my time was Beverly Randolph Harrison, eldest son of Mrs. Julian Harrison and at least four or five years older than his half-brother Peyton Harrison, who was, about my own age. He used to return to the University fairly regularly two or three times every session for several years after he graduated, if indeed "Bev," as everybody called him, ever did graduate; the main if not the only object of his periodic visits being to attend the Eli initiations, which were celebrated with much revelry. Being also an ardent DKE, "Bev" kept in touch with the affairs of the local chapter and was a kind of patron of the new members from year to year. So it came to pass that one day early in the autumn of 18 88, without appointment or previous advertisement and much to my bewilderment, "Bev" Harrison appeared at my door on Monroe Hill attended by two coloured porters each bearing a big wooden tub on top of his head, which "Bev" directed them to deposit inside my room. One tub contained bottles of liquor, beer, wine, etc., together with a pile of glasses and mugs, and the other was simply filled with large lumps of ice. The ceremony was short and simple. "Bev" greeted me cordially, even affectionately, and then announced that he had come to spend several days and was planning to entertain a number of friends and boon companions who might be expected to arrive almost any minute. He regretted that he had not had time to notify me in advance, and he certainly hoped he was not inconveniencing me. I was really too flattered and too flabbergasted to make remonstrance. One thing was plain, and that was that I myself was de trop; so I hastily gathered together an armful of garments and certain books such as I supposed I should be likely to need during my absence, and leaving "Bev" Harrison and the porters in charge of the premises, I repaired to House E and got Joe Winston to let me share his lodgings and bed for the next two or three days. Not long afterwards, pandemonium broke loose on Monroe Hill and a din that exceeded "the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick" such as, according to the Book of Daniel, used to be heard in Babylon. The riotous celebration continued day and night for more than forty-eight hours; then suddenly one evening "Bev" Harrison and all his tribe vanished as completely as if they had been hauled to jail in a police wagon, and the two tubs full of empty bottles and glasses were all that was left in my room. It took Andrew Jackson the good part of a day to clear away the débise and make the place habitable and respectable once more, but it took him a whole week to cease grumbling over all the extra work he had been obliged to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The orgy did not escape official notice. That same evening when quiet was restored, a note was delivered to me from the Chairman of the Faculty, and I opened it with trepidation. It was couched in polite terms; yet there was an ominous tone in it. It asked me to report to the Chairman's office at nine o'clock the next morning. I was there punctually at the appointed hour, but Mr. Thornton was occupied and kept me waiting at least thirty minutes, on purpose, it seemed to me, to aggravate the suspense. There was a note of sarcasm in his voice when at last he turned to me and asked if I supposed he was ignorant of the flagrant disorder that had occurred in my room. In vain I protested my innocence without implicating anybody else. Mr. Thornton dismissed me coldly, merely saying that I was on probation for the rest of the "session and warning me to go and sin no more. I left his office smarting under a sense of injustice, yet a little proud to think that I had borne myself with becoming dignity. Years afterwards when I sought to remind Mr. Thornton of this episode, he always professed not to have the faintest recollection of it. Yet as long as I remained in the University was conscious of having incurred his displeasure and fancied that I was under a perpetual cloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Simplicity is the handmaid of sincerity. Now as I look backward over an interval of more than half a century, simplicity and sincerity seem to me to have been the cardinal and distinguishing characteristics of the University of Virginia in my student days. It set great store on its high standards of honour and scholarship; above all its aim was. not so much size and quantity is it was strength and quality. Whether in any single year of my residence the number of students ever got as high as five hundred, I cannot say, but I believe it is safe to say that in 1888 the entire faculty did not much exceed a score of professors, without counting three or four assistants who were called instructors. What counted most was the personnel of teachers and pupils alike. The former were as a rule men of high character and refinement, while the latter came almost exclusively from the upper classes in the South between Maryland and Texas, with just enough matriculates from north of Mason and Dixon's line to leaven the lump and add to its flavour. In this congenial community mutual reserve and mutual respect ripened easily and naturally into strong and enduring friendships not only are among the students themselves but often also between pupil and teacher. There was never any lack of hospitality, and there was little in the way of ceremony or social restraint. A student had as a rule free access to the home of nearly every professor and was cordially received and entertained there by all the members of the household, both old and young</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1888 a remnant was still left of the illustrious faculty that had tided the University through the difficult and anxious years of the Civil War. John B. Minor (1813-1895), great expounder of the Common Law, and Francis Henry Smith (1829-1928), worthy successor of William B. Rogers ( 1804-1882) in the chair of Natural Philosophy, were indeed active and vigourous yet as in (lays of yore; but the venerable and beloved Dr. James Lawrence Cabell (1813-1889), professor of Physiology and Surgery, who as Chairman of the Faculty in the far-off days before the War with Mexico had conferred the degree of Master of Arts on my father, ended his useful and honourable life during my first session in the University. Dr. Maximilian Schele de Vere (d. 1898), professor of Modern Languages, who I believe was a native of Sweden, and Dr. George Frederick Holmes (1820-1897), professor of History, who was born in British Guiana, certainly two of the most erudite and renowned scholars in all the land, were both on the verge of retirement. Indeed ere my college days were over, William Howard Perkinson (1861-1898) had succeeded "Mr. Schele," and, similarly, Richard Heath Dabney, now the sole survivor of the faculty as it was in 1889, was even then all but nominally head of the School of History.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At least three members of that old faculty were outstanding not simply on account of their learning and technical fitness but above all because each of them had been a gallant and distinguished officer in the Civil War. Colonel Charles Scott Venable (1827-1900), professor of Mathematics, of whom, according to Mr. Thornton, it was not too much to say that he was the second founder of the University of Virginia, had been General Lee's trusted aide-de-camp on the battle-field and in the bivouac. Colonel William Elisha Peters (1829-1906), professor of Latin, whom many of us found it hard to forgive for his printed Syllabus and mimeographed Case Notes, certainly two of the queerest, if also two of the most learned,. volumes on Latin syntax that were ever penned, had been colonel of a cavalry regiment in General Early's brigade. Lastly, John William Mallet (1832-1912),professor of Chemistry, a native of Dublin, Ireland, and a Fellow of the Royal Society, had not only seen active service in the field as a young artillery officer but had been a tower of strength to the Confederate Government as a scientific expert in the manufacture of gunpowder. We could never see these great teachers or speak of them without whole-hearted admiration and affection; yet many of us used to wonder what joy "old Ven" could possibly find, after all his adventures on the field of Mars, in the dark mazes of the calculus or in the curious convolutions of a hyperbolic paraboloid; what extraordinary virtue there was in the ablative absolute to kindle "old Pete's" enthusiasm afresh every time it turned up in Livy; or how on earth "Jack Mallet" could remain so cold and imperturbable when every experiment he demonstrated to his class infallibly took place just as he had predicted. Such perplexities were not for us to fathom, and their only effect was to exalt these beloved teachers in our eyes and, if possible; cement more firmly our allegiance to them. It was during Colonel Venable's term as Chairman of the Faculty and largely due to his efforts that the big Leander McCormick Telescope was constructed and erected on Observatory Mountain under the supervision and direction of Ormond Stone, first professor of Astronomy in the University of Virginia. Unless I am mistaken, it was Colonel Venable too who was quick to discern Mr. Thornton's extraordinary ability and brought him to the University as the first professor of Applied Mathematics, thereby paving the way for the foundation of the School of Engineering which afterwards under Dean Thornton was an important and flourishing new province of the enlarged university.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another notable figure in those days. and for many years to come was Noah Knowles Davis (1830-1910), professor of Moral Philosophy, whose residence on West Lawn was directly opposite Colonel Venable's in the pavilion which is now the home of the Colonnade Club, the oldest structure in the University. "Noah K.," as he was familiarly known far and wide, was always bowed in thought and certainly looked the part of a philosopher, as he paced to and fro under the arcade in front of his door with his hands clasped behind his back and his body bent nearly double. Seeing him thus, I used to wonder whether he had failed to win that Content surpassing wealth The sage in meditation found, for if so, it certainly was not from lack of cogitation; yet it was plain to see that the even tenour of his contemplations was beset and disturbed by an inward torment. What was the nature of his affliction I never knew, but the violent grunts and groans to which Mr. Davis gave loud vent ever and anon were like the mutterings of a lost soul or of an unhappy mortal contending with a stubborn and irreconcilable foe lurking deep down possibly in the vicinity of the stomach. The first time I ever passed "Noah K." on the lawn and heard the strange growl he emitted, I was afraid some frenzy distemper had got in his head, but afterwards I got used to it and suspected that his plight was just such as would happen to any man who was addicted to metaphysics. Yet Plato himself could not have been held in higher esteem by his colleagues and disciples.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The humorous and satirical poem called "Modern Olympus," written by my friend Herbert Barry of New York, was published originally in the University Magazine in 1887. There, if anywhere, is to be found a contemporary, not altogether flattering picture of the faculty as it was when the author was a student. Certainly this Homeric narrative is one of the gems of Tom Wood's anthology published in 1890 under the title of Arcade Echoes. "Bright Phoebus with the fiery hair" was none other than Francis Perry Dunnington (1851-1944), professor of Applied Chemistry. In those days his countenance was as ruddy as his hair; yet it was in the laboratory that Mr. Dunnington shone to best advantage. It was he who taught me how to bend a glass tube without deforming its bore, only, I never could learn to blow a perfect bubble on the end of the tube, as "Dunny" himself could do with as much case as "the man on the flying trapeze."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Other "immortals" who were celebrated in the classic poem above mentioned were "majestic Jove" himself, who of course represented Colonel Venable in his rôle of Chairman of the Faculty; "Mercury who rides upon the wind," obviously meant for James Mercer Garnett (1840-1916), professor of English; "Pallas who reigns over abstruse thought" alias "Noah K."; "Venus more than mortal fair," rather a mean fling at "old Daddy Holmes"; "the amorous Bacchus," a double entendre intended for Mr. Minor, who, 'tis true, was somewhat addicted to matrimony, yet held Bacchus in abhorrence; and "the graceful god from down below," meaning William Morris Fontaine (1835-1913), professor of Geology. The poem relates that Jove had summoned the gods to "the dread tribunal of the Olympic Hall" (in other words, Colonel Venable had called a faculty meeting) in order to ask their advice about a question as solemn as it was momentous, too hard for Jove to answer by himself. When the deities are all assembled, they are told that the disciples who "before our altars burn the midnight oil" (namely, Herbert Barry et id omne genus) had suddenly got out of hand and were restive, eager indeed for excitement or what might be called recreation. In a word, they craved leave to ...trip it as you go On the light fantastic toe, and to have a dance, a ball, "a German," or whatever it was called, with honest-to-goodness girls as waltz partners. Now many good folks in those days believed that round dancing was, or should have been, in the category of the Seven Deadly Sins. No wonder the Olympic tribunal was stunned, and no wonder one deity after another rose to protest against the audacious proposal! I am sorry to say that, according to the veracious bard, it was decided, after much debate and due deliberation, not to grant the prayer of the humble disciples; for in those days the New Deal had not been heard of, and the wretched proletariat of the 1880's were lucky to be given a hearing at all and almost incredibly lucky if their petition got a favourable answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We used to call Mr. Garnett "dismal Jimmy" in allusion to his lugubrious countenance, though it really belied him, for he was a kind and affable gentleman and undoubtedly a foremost authority on "Beowulf" and Anglo-Saxon literature in general.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Fontaine likewise was far-renowned as a geologist. A confirmed old bachelor and very much of a recluse, he held forth somewhere in the bowels of the Lewis Brooks Museum. I cannot recall ever having laid eyes on him; nor can I call to mind the name of any student who had a class under him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">James H. Gilmore, who succeeded Stephen Osborne Southall (1816-1884) as professor of Constitutional and International Law, was Mr. Minor's colleague. I have only a dim recollection of him; yet I know he lived downtown in my grandfather's old home, where General Lee's monument now stands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In 1888, Milton Wylie Humphreys (1844-1928), a native Virginian who had risen to distinction in the University of Texas, took Professor Wheeler's place in the chair of Greek. He was reputed to be a man of omnivourous learning, who like Lord Bacon had taken all knowledge for his realm; indeed, his greatest admirers boasted, not without exaggeration, that he would have been just as much at home in the chair of Mathematics as he was in that of Greek. Be that as it may, I can vouch for the fact that every week for many years in succession his name (or rather his initials "M.W.H.") led all the rest in the published list of solvers of the current chess problem that was wont to appear regularly in every issue of Funk &amp; Wagnalls's old Literary Digest. Yet, strange to say, although Mr. Humphreys would stand on his feet sometimes for an hour on a stretch watching the progress of a game of chess that was being played in the back of Olivier's bookshop, when he himself took the place of one of the contestants, he was as likely as not to suffer defeat. He seldom sat down as an actual player, for I suppose he must have known that Jim Cannon could lick him in short order, and indeed Jim Cannon was a formidable antagonist and used to checkmate me in about a score of moves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the elder Dr. John Staige Davis (1824-1885) died in 1885, his place as professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica had been taken by Dr. William B. Towles (1847-1893), a man of imposing stature and so striking in appearance that he had only to be seen to be admired and respected. Other eminent teachers in the Medical School were William Cecil Dabney (1849-1894), professor of Obstetrics and the Practice of Medicine; Albert Henry Tuttle (b. 1844), professor of Biology; and Paul Brandon Barringer (1857-1941), destined to be the last Chairman of the Faculty in succession to Mr. Thornton before the advent of Dr. Alderman as the first President of the University of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Tuttle quickly won a high place for himself not only among his colleagues but in the whole community. Years afterwards he and I got to know each other by virtue of our having a common interest in the theory and construction of the compound microscope, for Tuttle was exceedingly expert and ingenious in the manifold uses of that beautiful instrument.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The care of the health of the student body was confided to Dr,. Dabney and Dr. Barringer. It must have been an onerous task in addition to their other duties and responsibilities, and was discharged by either the one or the other in regular alternation over a period of several months at a time. Many doses of calomel or some other drastic concoction that was in vogue in those days were prescribed for me from time to time by whichever of the two happened to be the physician in charge when I applied to him for a quick. and sovereign remedy for a minor ailment. Dr. Barringer lived at the south end of East Range next to the old gymnasium, and one day I went there to his office complaining of annoying headache that attacked me every time I opened a book. Dr. Barringer looked me over for a minute or two, and then asked if I had ever suffered from eyestrain. Such an idea had never crossed my mind, but nevertheless he insisted on putting me through a sight-test. He rummaged through a pile of papers and pamphlets on a table in the middle of the room and unearthed a faded old Snellen test-chart, which he pinned on the wall with a thumbtack. It took only a few minutes longer for him to make up his mind positively that the headache of which I complained was undoubtedly due to a mild form of astigmatism in both eyes. Thereupon he wrote a prescription for cylindrical lenses, which I took downtown that day to be filled by Keller and George. Those were the first spectacles I ever had in my life, and to this hour I am still using practically that same prescription for astigmatism, and can truthfully say that I have not had another headache from the day that I went to Dr. Barringer's office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My recollection is that William Holding Echols (1859-1934) ,and Dr. Barringer both came to the University as members of the faculty during the session of 1889-90, and that Dr. William G. Christian was appointed Demonstrator of Anatomy to help Dr. Towles in 1890. "Reddy" Echols, as he was called from the colour of his hair, was as distinguished in appearance as he was superior in intellect, certainly one of the handsomest men I ever beheld. He was made adjunct-professor of Applied Mathematics doubtless in order to relieve Mr. Thornton to some extent, whose duties as Chairman of the Faculty were certainly not light. About a decade later when Colonel Venable retired, Echols stepped into his shoes as professor of pure Mathematics and held that post thereafter as long as he lived. "Reddy" Echols was a man of wonderful charm and powerful personality, who spoke his mind freely and never hesitated to take his stand openly for what he believed to be right. His friends, colleagues and pupils alike, all loved him, and if he had any enemies, as such a forceful character is bound to have, I venture to say they both feared and respected him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colonel Venable had for his assistant James Shannon Miller (d. 1944), instructor in Mathematics, whom we called "Math. Miller." He bad the everlasting credit of explaining to me the real nature of a differential coefficient and putting me on really friendly terms with that chief agent in the mysterious realm of the calculus. Afterwards for more than half a century Dr. Miller was an eminent professor of Mathematics in Emory and Henry College.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colonel Peters had an assistant also, Robert Somerville Radford (1869-1936), young and erudite instructor in Latin, sometimes known as "the Radford," as if he were the one and only specimen of that rara avis . Certainly Bob Radford was one of the queerest of mortals, awkward, shy, and lonely, who mumbled his words and spoke a jargon that was utterly unintelligible to me; yet withal he was an undoubted prodigy and star of the first magnitude in his own peculiar sphere. His territory was in the field of the dead languages, and there he could cross swords with his official superiors, Colonel Peters and Mr. Humphreys themselves, and even come off victorious. Dr. Radford, a bachelor to the day of his death, was for many years professor of Latin in the University of Tennessee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has often been pointed out that puris omnia pura is not to be interpreted as meaning that to boys everything is pure and sacred, for nothing could be more contrary to the truth. Much as we admired our honoured teachers in the 1880's, we were not above poking fun at them whenever we got a chance. Herbert Barry's epic poem to which I have alluded is an instance of how irreverent and satirical we could be on occasion, especially when we had a feeling of resentment and a score to pay. In Jack Mosby's delightful operetta called "The Flirt," described as being "a tragedy in imitation of Aeschylus," which likewise appeared originally in the University Magazine (1889), the "chorus of professors" is represented as formed in two concentric circles revolving slowly in opposite directions while the sages chant in unison the following song: Strophe For years collectively we've sought To see if we could find A single great or little thought Unknowen to our mind. Yet not one instance can we "spot" Or find the smallest grain Of knowledge that we haven't got, We've sought for more in vain. Anti-strophe We know it all, we know it all, We've sought for more in vain. And so the chorus continues through still another strophe and anti-strophe, the words whereof are extant to this day in Arcade Echoes. The "flirt" herself, who was the heroine or else the villain of this "tragedy," was said to be Alice Robertson who married Allen Hanckel and thereby put an end to Jack Mosby's aspirations. However, these stirring events happened before my time, in fact before I had ever suspected that there was such a dangerous animal as a "flirt" on earth, and I must confess that I am merely retailing the gossip I heard afterwards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the 1880's, the prestige of the University of Virginia throughout the South, as I have implied already, was still very high, as it had been in ante-bellum days during the first quarter of a century of its existence. I daresay it would be safe to say that a large majority of the leading instructors in the principal schools in that section of the country were themselves graduates of the University of Virginia, trained in her ideals, imbued with her traditions, and loyal to her allegiance. Thus steadily, year by year, more and more firmly the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson acquired a kind of educational hegemony in the South, as undisputed as it was unavowed, in some respects not unlike the domination and powerful influence wielded by Oxford and Cambridge over the public schools in England. It was so complete and extended so far that even the textbooks in use in most of the southern schools and colleges of that day, more likely than not English in origin, were more or less identical with those sanctioned by adoption and custom in the University of Virginia. This supremacy gave the University a unique position and a certain distinction in comparison with all the other colleges in the United States. Of course, Harvard, Yale, and Princeton were older, larger, richer, and more famous in the country at large; nevertheless, the University of Virginia, different in origin and development, had its own peculiar excellence and its own cherished aims. Moreover, however provincial we may have been in those days, it was certainly true that teachers and pupils alike had faith in our own ideals and standards. We believed they were high and trustworthy, and so far from having what is called an "inferiority complex," it was told of Mr. Minor, for example, that the old gentleman never doubted for an instant that the sun rose in the morning for the express purpose of revolving around the University of Virginia!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A half century ago the total number of students, as has been noted already, was comparatively small, more than half of them coming from Virginia alone, and perhaps more than a third from all other parts of the South including Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. Nowadays the total enrollment has mounted from the hundreds into the thousands, and whereas less than a sixth of the matriculates used to come from regions outside the southern states, it was reported in the Alumni News for July, 1943, that of more than two thousand students who were in attendance in the previous session, only a hundred and sixty-five hailed from all the southern states put together outside of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There have been profound changes all over the globe since 1890,nor is it surprising that the University of Virginia has had its vicissitudes also, no doubt with notable improvements in some respects. However, the point I wish to make here is that there was a time when the student body comprised the é lite of the youth not of Virginia only but of the entire South, young men who were distinguished intellectually as well as socially and who Might fairly be considered as representing a cross-section of the highest type of southern civilization and aristocracy in the literal sense of the latter word. Many of these lads who came from Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans and other less populous towns or from the big plantations in the South had been to school in Virginia before they arrived at the University and were old pupils of Hanover Academy, the Episcopal High School, Bellevue or some other famous school that flourished then in the Old Dominion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In that admirable essay on the Honour System written by Mr. Thornton in 1906, the writer begins by reminding us of Mr. Jefferson's original plan for creating at the University of Virginia what he himself called an "academic village" in which "the unit was a professor's residence (including his schoolroom) and an adjoining group of single-storey dormitories for students", and then towards the end of the essay Mr. Thornton, alluding .again to this peculiar type of architectural construction, writes as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jefferson's academic village lent itself most admirably to the creation of such an academic life. The professors lived amidst their students and the physical nearness of dormitory and pavilion translated itself into social courtesies and moral contacts. The students themselves were brought into natural and unconstrained intercourse with each other and learned to know and to trust each other and to live a common life with common aims and common ideals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Virginia was happy also in the qualities of her professors. They were men of high social standards, of sound scholarship, of noble aspiration. Many of them had acquired wide experience of life and deep knowledge of men, More than one possessed rare executive powers. But with it all and above all they were gentlemen and added the gracious courtesy of their caste to the force of robust intelligence and the energy of virile natures. Only today [Mr. Thornton continues] I stood with Colonel Mosby before a pavilion on West Lawn. 'Here,' said he, 'lived a man whom I reverenced and still reverence above all men. Not even before General Lee on the battlefield did I stand with such awe .and admiration as before Professor Courtenay.' * It was the daily intercourse with these men that transformed student-life in Virginia and brought the Honour System to its birth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now here is another point which cannot be stressed too much</field>
      <field name="fulltext">or too often, especially nowadays when all over the earth men and women seem to be cast adrift from ancient moorings and are only too prone to follow strange gods and bow down before false idols. Trite as it may sound, it is worth repeating: The foundation of a great university rests above all on the character and quality of the teachers. Qualified men are not easy to find, but the search for them should be unceasing. Laboratories and libraries are good and even indispensable, but the one thing needful, the sine qua non, is the man who knows how to use them or in some cases can make shift to do without them. If he be lacking, your library or your laboratory, well appointed as it may be, is a delusion and a snare, amounting to little more than absolute zero. The professor is the life-giving spirit, the motive power, the man behind the gun. Nay, in innumerable instances the teacher himself is all in all, and his apparatus, if he has any at all, counts for very little. The whole equipment of a chair of Mathematics is little more than a blackboard and a stick of chalk; yet how it may flourish in the hands of a Gauss or a Poincaré! Willingly enough I grant that a Faraday must have his laboratory; yet behold what Faraday accomplished in the comparatively [*] Edward R. Courtenay (1803-1853), a native of Baltimore, graduated in 1821 at the head of his class in the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. He came to the University of Virginia in 1842 as professor of Mathematics. Colonel Mosby's testimony is supported by everybody who ever came in contact with that great gentleman and scholar. empty laboratory that was vouchsafed him in his lifetime, and see also how much less has been achieved in other laboratories with. a thousand times the material equipment! Perhaps I myself am as familiar with great and imposing laboratories and workshops as anybody can be, for I have lived amid luxuries of that kind and am no longer deceived by them, important and essential as such things may be and sometimes really are. Yet they are not the measure, much less the criterion, of real worth or real accomplishment, far from it indeed. The crowning ornament and the unique glory of a great university may be a single individual, a Courtenay or a Gildersleeve, a William B. Rogers or a John B. Minor.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">generation to generation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The so-called Honour System in the University of Virginia originated, I believe, more than a century ago. It was certainly nothing new to me when I first came to college, for I had grown up in that atmosphere in McGuire's School in Richmond where the Honour System was just as simple and efficient, it seems to me, as it was in the University itself. Every boy who attended one of those old private academics in Virginia knew instinctively that he was bound by it. Noblesse oblige - that was all there was to it, and we simply took it for granted. It was above all an unwritten code, elemental, natural, not to be called in question, not even a subject of discussion, much less a source of pride or boasting. It had seldom to be enforced because it was seldom violated, and that in my opinion was the real secret of its successful operation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several years ago I was annoyed by a structural fault in the foundation of my dwelling house, in consequence of which, usually after a hard rain, a considerable quantity of water would seep in through the walls of the cellar and be deposited in a pool on the concrete floor. My nephew Charles Henderson, a professor of Engineering in the University of Virginia, advised me to get an electric pump for discharging the water and offered to install it for me. I took his advice and was fortunate indeed to have his help, and from that day to this I ceased to have any further trouble from water collecting in my cellar. The pump was automatic and required little or no attention except the application of a drop or two of oil about once a year. Indeed I had almost forgotten its existence until the other day I happened to hear it in operation down below for a space of time that certainly did not exceed a couple of minutes, and then all was silent again. I descended into the cellar to have a look at it, and there, sure enough, were the traces of moisture on the floor, yet not a .drop of water left to be seen. The pump had risen to the occasion apparently without effort and had punctually and faithfully performed its duty. It seemed to me a wonderful piece of mechanism, and so simple withal; I gazed at it with -admiration. Involuntarily, I said to myself, That pump is like the Honour System, -and works the same way when it works at all-no fuss, absolutely unobtrusive, as little machinery as possible, and perfect efficiency.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A code of honour does not have to be codified and expounded. It has no legal sanction, and indeed as to its standards and penalties both, it may be open to question; only, it cannot be violated with impunity. As far as my experience. goes, that was how the Honour System operated in the University of Virginia. How adequate and salutary it was is shown by the fact that during the five years from 1888 to 1893 which covered my period of personal participation and observation, I myself was not cognisant of but one single instance in which the Honour System was invoked. The affair was not noised abroad, and here and now is the first public mention of it. Snowden Marshall and I were the only witnesses of the offense, and as in duty bound we went together to the culprit's dormitory on East Range and advised him to pack his belongings and leave college without a moment's delay. I have forgotten the fellow's name, but I know that he disappeared that same evening or perhaps the next morning, never to return. Unless he himself divulged it, his disgrace was never known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One reason I had for quoting at length that striking passage from Mr. Thornton's essay was in order to stress the point that the faculty is as much a party to the Honour System as the student body, for in this code there is no longer any distinction between pupils and teachers, both parties being absolutely on the same footing with respect to integrity and good faith. In order for the pump in my cellar to do its appointed task, unbidden and unthwarted, the installation must have the proper setting and capacity, else the machinery will inevitably break down. So likewise the Honour System can flourish only in congenial surroundings; that is, in my judgment, in a comparatively small community composed of homogeneous parts that fit naturally in one another and are not apt to fall asunder. In the course of my life I have had some opportunity of experimenting with the Honour System in three or four colleges north and south, and I believe I have a pretty good idea of how feasible or unfeasible it is, depending on the strain to which it is subjected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let the teacher, to begin with, be a man with the character and qualifications of Professor Courtenay or Colonel Venable, a type, it must be admitted, not easy to reproduce, and let his class, not too large and unwieldy, be composed of average American students, sons of honest and respectable parents; then, under such favourable conditions I am disposed to believe that an Honour System is almost certain to be developed of its own accord. When the pattern of honour is held before the eyes of ingenuous youth, verily I believe, there be none so quick as they to wish in their hearts to live by it.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Dic cur hic? WHAT IS THY ERRAND HERE?-IS THE QUESTION that is asked a student who seeks to enter a German university. Had it been put to me the first time I stood on the threshold of the University of Virginia, perhaps I might have answered, a little grandiloquently yet not quite untruth fully, that I came in quest of knowledge and wisdom. Certainly I should never have confessed that what attracted me most and supplied the strongest motive was the romance and glamour of college life of which I had heard so many tales beforehand painted in glowing colours. Never before or since was my zeal for learning at such a low ebb as it was during the whole of that first year in college when I lived on Monroe Hill and tasted the pleasures of academic life as they were enjoyed in that carefree community. Not that I neglected my studies entirely or failed to burn a reasonable portion of "midnight oil," sometimes indeed with a great show of industry particularly on a night before a hard examination; but luckily enough I was pretty well fortified in Greek and Mathematics before I got to the University, and it did not take much effort to keep abreast of my classes without being conspicuous one way or the other either as "curler" or "corker," that is, in the current vernacular, either as a bright particular star in the firmament or as a sacrificial lamb led to the slaughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a novel and sensational experience to be my own master, free from control. Day by day the circle of my acquaintance was enlarged, and I was never at a loss for agreeable and congenial companions. Some of my comrades, mostly among the older students, were distinctly superior in both culture and talents or in some other way that commanded my homage and admiration, and by association with them I reaped advantages that were not to be reckoned lightly in the scale of useful education. In more than one instance a staunch and enduring friendship was cemented then that not all the vicissitudes of life have ever sundered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With all the zest of a new recruit I sought to take part in the exciting game of college politics as it was played then for all it was worth; and while at first I was no better than an insignificant pawn among the other pieces in the contest, I was eager to win my spurs with the hope of becoming a knight one day, though of course I never dreamed of running for any such high office as that of Final President of the Jefferson Literary Society, considered to be the greatest prize that was conferred by the student body on one of its members. In that year 1888-89, the rival candidates were George Gordon Battle of North Carolina and J. R. A. Hobson of Richmond, both "Eli Banana's" and unquestionably the two most prominent and popular leaders in college. Gordon Battle was a brilliant fellow who got the degree of Master of Arts that session, magna cum laude, and "Reid Hobson," as he was known all over the campus, was facile princeps in every vocation of college life except scholarship, for which alone he manifested no marked predilection. My recollection is that Reid tried three years, and tried in vain, to get a diploma in the School of Latin; yet, to do him justice, I for one never believed the story that it was he who translated Canis vigilavit noctem per totam, "The dog watched the night through a hole." Reid and I had been schoolmates together in McGuire's School in Richmond, but he was two or three years my senior, and now he was a high priest in the proud ATO fraternity, while I was naught but a newly baptized DKE, lowly in rank as compared with him who led all the Germans and was indeed The glass of fashion, and the mould of form, The observ'd of all observers. In those days no old friendship could overcome the political antagonism of "Deke's" and ATO's, and so as a matter of course I was enlisted under the banner of Gordon Battle in that campaign, if for no other reason than simply because he was the champion of the side that was opposed to the ascendency of the ATO's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gordon Battle was elected, and shortly before the end of the session the victor gave a famous beer party in House E on Dawson's Row in celebration of his triumph, to which friend and foe alike were invited. It was a jovial affair not confined to Dawson's Row and Monroe Hill, for the sound of revelry by night could be heard on Carr's Hill also and indeed wherever two or three were gathered together. In an upstairs room in House E, Tom Gordon presided over a huge punch bowl on a table in front of him, surrounded by a mob that cheered every word that he uttered. His only garment was a loose-fitting dressing gown which fluttered in the breeze that came through the open window behind him, and Bacchus himself could not have worn it with more abandon. As Tom harangued his audience, gesticulating vehemently with a big ladle in one hand and a pound-bag of Lone Jack tobacco in the other hand, suddenly in the midst of a great flourish he launched backwards and vanished through the window into outer darkness! (The lower sill of the window was just a few inches above the level of the floor.) Consternation and dismay were written on every face, for Tom's neck could easily have been broken by that fall. I tried to elbow my way through the crowd and reach the door in order to go to his aid, but ere I could do so, Tom himself was heard ascending the stairs, and a moment later there he stood in our midst again still waving the ladle and the bag of tobacco above his head and still talking at the top of his lungs as if his oration had never been interrupted. The only visible change in his appearance was a long rent in the dressing gown, but fortunately it was a warm evening in May when exposure to the weather can be borne with impunity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">College politics was diverting enough while it lasted, but the excitement died down as soon as the votes were all counted and victory perched on one banner or the other. It was mild and transient as compared with the hot and incessant pursuit of "Calico," which was the name of another game to which many of us were addicted. "Calico" was the endearing, if somewhat disrespectful, term we used to employ in speaking of that considerable portion of humanity that to our fathers was known as "the fair sex, as it is in one sense if not in the other. The origin of the name was traced to the days soon after the end of the Civil War when for some years (so it is said) young ladies in Virginia had to be content to wear calico frocks be cause their sires could not afford to buy silks and satins for them; but whether this explanation is true or false, it is certain that calico never "cramped their style" or detracted from their irresistible charm. When the site of the University of Virginia was chosen, it may be supposed that the idea of "Calico" as a useful adjunct and ancillary equipment of the new institution did not enter the mind of the illustrious founder; yet it is an historical fact that from that day to this perhaps no place in the world has been more famous for beautiful women than the county of Albemarle and particularly the little town of Charlottesville on the Rivanna in full view of Monticello. Certainly in my day and generation a student was a hopeless bookworm and an odd fellow indeed who did not have a sweetheart in a bower close enough for him to get a glimpse of her nearly every day, and to take her to church on Sunday unless perchance she gave him the slip and got another beau for that ostentatious occasion.</field>

Well, there were girls of both kinds in Charlottesville and the adjacent country, and a fellow had to be mighty fastidious and hard to please who could not find one among them who for the time being was without doubt the most delightful creature in the wide, wide world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No Chinese mandarin was more dignified and stately in both manner and appearance than old Henry Martin, the head janitor, who tolled the big bell in the rotunda that summoned us to our lectures. It was a signal which we heeded and generally obeyed; yet if by chance, and without meaning any harm on earth, a demure little college belle with bright blue eyes and maybe a dimple in her cheek came strolling down the arcade at that very moment when Simple Simon was on his way to lecture, just as likely as not she would detain him for a minute, unintentionally of course, never dreaming, of leading him into temptation. Under such circumstances I have known him to turn aside from the path of duty and go arm in arm with her in the opposite direction; yet who can say that that eager lad did not learn more that day about electricity and magnetism than if he had sat conscientiously through Professor Smith's learned lecture in Senior Natural Philosophy, as perhaps I myself might have been doing all that blessed hour?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In "the academic village," as it was originally designed by Mr. Jefferson, no building was set apart as a "recreation centre" for the students, nor as far as I know was there any provision for a playground or even a rude gymnasium such as was afterwards constructed at one end of East Range. When I was in college, not a single fraternity house was then in existence, the nearest thing to it being the little one-storey cottage on Carr's Hill where the Dekes used to hold their Saturday night meetings and munch cheese and crackers washed down their gullets by potations of beer or claret taken more or less indiscriminately. The only places where the students could assemble to have a mass meeting were in the not very spacious halls of the two literary societies or possibly in a comparatively small chamber over the post office opposite Olivier's Bookshop and Chancellor's Drugstore, which was the headquarters of Mrs. Cochran's old Temperance Union. Downtown there were no theatres or bowling alleys, only a couple of disreputable saloons where a few students of the baser sort sometimes congregated to play billiards and ran imminent risk of being expelled from College.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were no public vehicles for hire, not even a one-horse streetcar that would have saved us from having to walk a mile or more to Dr. Norris's dental office on Market Street whenever a tooth had to be pulled or a swollen jaw was in need of a poultice. Then the telephone had not been invented, and it was impossible to communicate with the dentist soon after breakfast and make an appointment with him for that afternoon. I remember well trudging to his office early one cold winter morning after having been kept awake all night long by a painful abscess and much to my annoyance finding two other patients ahead of me already waiting to see the executioner. Colonel Venable and Major Peyton were seated opposite each other in the reception room, each with his arms folded tightly across his breast, both so glum and taciturn that neither bestowed on me more than a civil nod of recognition when I entered and took a chair in a corner of the room. It was a dismal place at best, made more so by the oppressive silence and solemnity of the company that were assembled there that morning. Presently Dr. Norris flung open the door of the torture chamber, and bowing impartially to each of the two elderly gentleman in turn, intimated that it was for the in to decide whose tooth should be pulled first. Those redoubtable heroes had seen many blood-stained battlefields; yet it seemed to me that Dr. Norris and his forceps-sapped their courage until it was really not much better than mine. The Colonel bowed stiffly towards the Major, the Major glared angrily at the Colonel, and then one of them, I forget which, rose from his chair and stalked into the other room with as firm -a tread as he could muster for the occasion. The door closed gently behind him, and again all was silence, broken presently by what sounded like a groan from purgatory on the other side of the intervening wall. Then about a minute later the door opened again and a muffled figure brushed past me and vanished through the other door into the street without a word of adieu. I continued to wait patiently while the other gentleman went through the same ordeal, and when my time came, as come it did at last, I believe I met my fate with no less fortitude, only by that time nobody was left to witness it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, it is He also who teaches us to be content with our lot. The truth is that in the days of my youth it never entered my head to think that my lot was hard or dull. If the appliances and modern facilities for alleviating it were lacking, I was blissfully ignorant of them and certainly never missed them. I will not say that the Kingdom of Heaven was within us, for we were just as troublesome and unregenerate as any boys that ever lived on earth before or since, but the word ennui was not in the lexicon of my youth. My chief difficulty was to steal enough time from frivolous occupations in order to read a page of Thucydides before going to bed at night or maybe to explore a mysterious problem in Williamson's Differential Calculus in the vain hope of solving it and "curling" in class next day. Certainly my conscience, little as I heeded it, reproached me for leaving undone those things that above all ought to have been done. However, the only point I am emphasizing now is that even if Mr. Corcoran or some other bountiful benefactor of those ancient days, in anticipation of modern requirements in education, had built and equipped a "recreation centre" for us equal to the finest in the land today, it is doubtful whether either I or Snowden Marshall or any other of my boon companions would have had a leisure interval day or night in which to patronize and enjoy it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colonel Venable's classroom in Mathematics, which he shared with Colonel Peters in Latin, was on the west side of the main floor of the rotunda. The teacher sat on a platform opposite the door, and the benches for the students were arranged in front of him in concentric semi-circular tiers ascending higher and higher towards the back of the room. The principal textbooks in Mathematics were Snowball's Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (a scholarly and awfully solemn book); Puckle's Conic Sections (in its way a work of genius that has never been surpassed); Todhunter's Differential and Integral Calculus and Williamson's ditto, each in two volumes; a posthumous treatise on Calculus in general (published in 1874) by Edward H. Courtenay, LL.D., who had been professor of Mathematics in the University of Virginia in ante bellum days; and, finally, a very indigestible little volume on Solid Analytic Geometry which had leaped from Colonel Venable's own head. Even now I cannot recall that last book without an involuntary shudder. It is in my library still; yet when I happened to glance through it the other day, in the light of riper knowledge, far from inspiring hatred and all uncharitableness as it used to do in that first year in college, it met me as if it were a long-lost friend and with such in air of sweet reasonableness that it was hard to believe it had once been my inveterate enemy. Most of the textbooks in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, etc., were solid English fare brewed and concocted in Oxford and Cambridge Universities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My recollection is that not more than a score of students were in the class of Senior Mathematics in the session 1888-89; among whom I recall distinctly C. R. Beattie, W. Harrison Blair, Mallory K. Cannon, Joseph B. Dunn, H. Snowden Marshall, Harrison Randolph (of Charlottesville), Thomas J. Randolph (of Edgehill), E. Randolph Williams, and Robert F. Whitehead. Our love and admiration of Colonel Venable, sincere and generous as it was, could not hide the truth that then he was no longer an inspiring teacher, as I believe he certainly was in his prime. We were late comers to sit at his feet, and, it must be confessed, with the conspicuous exceptions of Harrison Randolph and Bob Whitehead, a group of not very apt or enthusiastic disciples. I got the impression that nobody was more bored than Colonel Venable himself; yet occasionally when a famous mathematical problem came up for discussion such, for example, as that of finding the path of quickest descent from the higher to the lower of two given points at different levels, subject to the action of gravity only and the constraint of the curve, a sudden burst of enthusiasm would arouse Colonel Venable and the contagion might even spread to the benches in front of him. It was almost a dramatic scene that day when he leaped from his chair and scrawled the equation of the "brachistochrone" on the blackboard in a handwriting that no mortal man could decipher. Being an inquisitive chap, I went to his desk after class and humbly besought him to unravel those hieroglyphics, but by that time the Colonel's ardour had subsided, and he himself could not interpret his own writing. It was something of an anticlimax for me to find afterwards, by patient study, that the much vaunted curve with its Greek name was after all no more than an ordinary cycloid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vague and unreliable as my memory is now of my studies under Colonel Venable, I know how constantly we stood in dread of being "sent to the board" where each of us in turn was usually exposed in all his mathematical ignorance. One trivial incident, scarcely connected at all with the mysterious operations of Calculus only it happened to occur in Colonel Venable's classroom, comes to mind after all the intervening years. One morning just before the hour for the lecture, I had been in Olivier's Bookshop where I learned that Grover Cleveland had been defeated for re-election as president of the United States and that an obscure gentleman from Indiana by the name of Benjamin Harrison had been chosen in his stead. In those days we were all ardent Cleveland supporters, and I heard the bad news with a heavy heart, Thus it happened I was two or three minutes late in getting to the lecture-room that day where the class was all assembled when I took my seat. Harrison Blair sat on the front row as usual with his notebook spread open before him and was conscientiously employed in taking down Colonel Venable's Ipsissima Verba - for such was the title inscribed in large letters on the outside cover of that precious record. Harrison was a faithful scribe, and all of us depended on him more or less for an accurate report of the transactions. I wrote on a scrap of paper, "All is over with poor old Grover," and addressing the message to Harrison, handed the folded paper to somebody in the next row to be duly transmitted from one student to another until it reached the proper destination. Now my friend Harrison Blair was what I suppose Mr. W. S. Gilbert might have called "a matter-of-fact young man," little given to frivolity, much less addicted to ars poetica ; yet he had an ear for rhythm, could scan a verse, and tell at once when the metre was false. He pored over my note quite a long interval, and I could see from my seat far off to one side that his brow was puckered and that he was in deep thought. Presently a faint smile lighted his countenance, he picked up his pencil and, adding just a single word to my note, sent it back to me along the same circuitous route. When I unfolded the paper, I read the corrected version, as follows: "All is now over with poor old Grover!" Naturally there was nothing more to be said, and that ended the brief correspondence. It is strange that this episode lingers clear in my memory now when so much that might be interesting to recall is blotted out entirely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even more distinct is the memory of -that awfully hot day in early July when I was almost the sole inhabitant left on Monroe Hill, bound fast by the hard labour of preparing for the final examination in Intermediate Mathematics, for graduation in that school depended on this class also. It was Friday, and the examination was due to be field next day, the last day of the session before the baccalaureate sermon on Sunday, which was the "opening gun" of The Finals, as our commencement was called. The class was an unusually large one, and on that account the examination had been deliberately postponed to the latest possible minute, simply in order to prevent an exodus from college of a considerable number of students who were tempted to go home as soon as they had completed their required tasks without staying for The Finals. The usual gaiety of the season was already in full swing all over the campus and in town and county also. Naught but a slender picket fence separated me from Mr. Thornton's front yard which was a scene of festivity and mirth right before my eyes. Two of Richmond's renowned belles and debutantes had their headquarters in his hospitable home during The Finals that year and were on the lawn in gala attire; and just as the vagrant bee is transfixed by the darling buds of May, so every knight errant that strolled past the gate that day almost infallibly came under the spell of enchantment, paused there a moment, and then, having adjusted his cravat and glanced down at the crease in his trousers, sauntered up the long, brick walk leading to the house, prepared in his turn to swear fealty and devotion to either or both of those captivating girls. Meanwhile, there was I toiling and sweating in my solitary state with Puckle's Conic Sections lying open before me, it is true, but even so, far from my thoughts and farther still from my desires. The only other human being in all that cloister of dormitories whose foot step might have been heard under the arcade that day was Charley Hopkins, the porter, who came there occasionally with his mule-cart to get a couple of trunks that had to be taken to the railway station before the office of the baggage agent was closed. As I have said, it was a hot day, and although the door of my room was wide open, I was clad as scantily as the law allowed in those days. From time to time I could see and hear that philanderer, Randolph Hicks, for he was much in evidence in Mr. Thornton's front yard. When I rose from my chair and poked my head through the doorway, I perceived that he was holding a parasol over a young lady whom I took to be the beautiful Annie Leigh Camm herself. Was the white flannel jacket he wore the identical garment I myself had been saving for just such an occasion, were it ever vouchsafed me? Nobody knew better than he did that I was debarred from joining his party and was for the time being the slave of duty; yet as soon as he spied me, he waved his hand triumphantly and shouted derisively, "Trunnion, Trunnion, get up and be spliced, or lie still and be damned!" Then everybody turned to look at me, and there was a loud peal of laughter at my expense. The challenge was more than I could resist. I flung Puckle's Conic Sections down on the floor, and "by the Nine Gods" I swore the "house of Tarquin should stiffer wrong no more!" Farewell, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, for I must leave you now -is what I exclaimed in effect, if I did not utter those words, and almost in the twinkling of an eye I was dressed and on the other side of the fence where all the fun was going on. The first thing I did was to satisfy myself that Randolph Hicks's white flannel coat was not mine, thank goodness! no matter who was its rightful owner, and then I set to work to inveigle the young lady from him and hold her parasol myself. That stratagem, I regret to say, was unsuccessful. Randolph Hicks did indeed relinquish the parasol, but it was to a third party who asserted a prior claim, and he and her highness strolled off together arm in arm leaving us to console each other as best we could. They say none but the brave deserves the fair, but a fellow who can make a pretty speech will win her every time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Retribution should have overtaken me next day when the examination on conic sections was field, but retribution sometimes misses the mark. Colonel Venable and his instructor, "Math" Miller, were pushed for time to read all those papers, and I suspect they passed over mine lightly and gave me the benefit of the doubt; for Monday morning the list of graduates in the School of Mathematics was posted on the bulletin board by the door of the rotunda, and I heaved a sigh of relief and shouted for joy when I found my name upon it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not in Colonel Venable's classroom but in his hospitable home on East Lawn that I really got to know that eminent man, no less distinguished as a scholar and educator than he had been in his younger days as a soldier and chieftain in the Army of Northern Virginia. His second wife, a widow herself at the time of her marriage, was one of my father's sisters, my beloved Aunt Mary; and Colonel Venable's three daughters Mary, Cantey, and Natalie were charming young ladies as nearly related to me as if they had been my own cousins. More as a member of the family than just as a frequent and welcome visitor I had free access to this unusual and delightful household, a high privilege and constant pleasure which I am thankful to say I enjoyed all the time I was in college, and there also I came in contact with many of the leading students in the University.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of Miss Natalie's ardent admirers was my club-mate Sherrard Tabb, who had a room in Dr. Holmes's pavilion next to Colonel Venable's and boarded at Mrs. Perkinson's in the same house, but I dare say whenever he was not attending one of the lectures in the School of Medicine he was more often to be found in the young lady's residence than out of harm's way in his own quarters. Colonel Venable himself, and indeed all the members of his family, were warmly attached to him, as well they might be, for Sherrard Tabb, talented, handsome, and agreeable, was no ordinary young man, and nobody could help liking him at first sight, and more and more the better one got to know him. Nearly every evening, weekdays and Sundays, the drawing room of the Venable mansion was filled with visitors and beaux, and then sometimes, abandoning the field to our competitors, Sherrard and I would find our way together along the passage leading to Colonel Venable's study, which was in the dormitory room No. 36 attached to the pavilion. We could always count on a cordial welcome, even if it took much coaxing to get the Colonel to tell us about his adventures and experiences in the army. Sherrard had a way of drawing him out, and when we once got him started, we never tired of listening. It is a pity neither of us kept a diary of the reminiscences we heard from Colonel Venable's own lips, for he had an almost inexhaustible fund of good stories, either grave or gay, just as the mood took him, many of them of real historical importance. I am sure the narrator must have enjoyed those evenings and was moved and flattered by the unfeigned admiration and affection plainly visible on the eager faces of the two boys who sat and listened by the hour as long as the Colonel would endure it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherrard Tabb, we believed, was destined to be a renowned and beloved physician, for he had every endowment of heart and brain for that noble profession, and was skillful and dexterous in the art of healing. Alas, the life of that "sweet prince" was cut short ere it had time to blossom and fulfil its golden promise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The class in Senior Greek was held early in the morning three times a week, as I recall, in the basement lecture-room on the east side of the rotunda. Strange to say, I have more or less forgotten all my other classmates except Breckinridge Robertson and Tom Randolph of Edgehill; yet I believe Harrison Randolph of Charlottesville was one of that group also. Nor must I omit to mention Bob Radford, Colonel Peters' right bower in Latin, only, he was a prodigy and in a class by himself, for Greek was to him almost like his mother tongue, whereas to all the rest of us it was simply Greek and nothing more. I suppose there were not more than a dozen students in all, occupying the two front rows of benches, but Radford, instructor in Latin, had a seat somewhere in the rear, aloof like Catiline in the Roman senate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My recollection is also that my first year as a student was Mr. Humphreys's second year as professor of Greek in the University of Virginia. I know we started out that session by reading The Clouds of Aristophanes in a new edition of the text that had just recently been edited by Mr. Humphreys himself, and while I have every reason to believe that it was a volume of exceptional merit, it seemed to me that the deeper I got in the play, the denser the clouds gathered around me. The truth is that. first Greek comedy we read turned out to be rather a dull performance to most of us, chiefly because nearly the whole hour we spent in class was consumed in an intermittent dialogue between Mr. Humphreys on his raised platform in front and Bob Radford in his solitary seat by the window in the rear of the room. It was hard to tell what the discussion was all about, for it was over our heads to begin with, and besides I never could really hear what was said. Mr. Humphreys's voice was low and monotonous, more weary than animated, while Radford's speech was like the bleat of a sheep lost in a snowdrift. Yet now and then when I did distinguish a word here and a word there, the voice of the latter floated into my car as if it came from a disembodied spirit in purgatory. Mr. Humphreys somehow contrived to get the gist of his adversary's disjointed outpourings, and little as we could follow the argument, it was plain that they were at loggerheads about some word or other that had cropped up in the text of that day's lesson. As nearly as I could make out, Radford stubbornly and persistently maintained that this particular noun or verb or whatever it was was what is called a "hapax legomenon," a word that had never been uttered before or since by any respectable Athenian; and Mr. Humphreys as stoutly maintained the contrary, yet did not have the proof on the tip of his tongue, but would produce it after class. For two such evenly matched Grecians here was a bone of contention that might be gnawed on until Henry Martin rang the bell for the next class. Mr. Humphreys employed sarcasm, as much as to ask if his learned opponent meant to imply that he did not recognise a rara avis when he saw one and would not have called attention to it in a footnote of his text, had it indeed been such. To this argument Radford had no reply ready and for the moment seemed to subside, although the comers of his mouth twitched as if he were still struggling for utterance; and then Breckinridge Robertson placidly resumed his recitation at the place where he had left off when the fracas started. Yet hardly had he got through the translation of the next two or three lines of the play when Radford was heard in the throes of another spasm, and much to the vexation and impatience of everybody present, the endless dispute would begin all over again. The irrepressible Radford was not unlike the village schoolmaster, For e'en though vanquished, he could argue still. At the end of the hour when class was dismissed and we were all filing out through the open door, just as likely as not this singular genius would linger behind at Mr. Humphreys's desk, and persist in going on with the controversy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nevertheless, that year spent in the study of the ancient culture of the Greeks, above all in reading some portions of their incomparable literature, both prose and poetry, made a lasting impression on me and was an epoch in my education. For that I can never be grateful enough to the scholarly teaching of Mr. Humphreys who guided me without much show of enthusiasm but with a sure hand. I became acquainted with, in some instances conversant with, the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, the splendid tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the orations of Lysias and Demosthenes, and the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. Day by day I was conscious of an enlargement of the mind and an enrichment of the spirit which I have treasured ever since.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been truly said that the greatest of all human phenomena was the Attic genius that burst forth more than two thousand years ago in all its variety and in all its glory. According to Sir Henry Maine, in the civilization that we call Christendom, "there is nothing that moves that is not Greek," I remember reading when I was a lad, perhaps in one of the anecdotes in Plutarch's Lives , that "the Athenians know virtue, the Spartans practise it;" yet to this day no detraction nor disparagement can ever shake my fidelity to Athens as the motherland to be held in everlasting honour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There they sought the feet of Wisdom, pilgrims on a holy quest, Ray by ray the sun of knowledge dawned upon the wakening West. Every thought of all their thinking swayed the world for good or ill, Every pulse of all their life-blood beats across the ages still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the preface of his instructive and delightful book on Ancient Greek Literature published more than forty years ago, Professor, now Sir, Gilbert Murray warned us against "the error of conceiving 'the Greeks' as all much alike -a gallery of homogeneous figures, with the same ideals, the same standards, the same limitations. In reality it is their variety that makes them so living to us -the vast range of their interests, the suggestiveness and diversity of their achievements, together with the vivid personal energy that made the achievements possible.... They had some difficulties to contend with which are now almost out of our path. They had practically no experience, but were doing everything for the first time.... Yet they produced the Athens of Pericles and of Plato."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The same competent authority expresses the opinion that Plato "is the greatest master of Greek prose style, perhaps of prose style altogether, that ever lived." I doubt whether anybody who has read Dr. Jowett's English translation of The Dialogues of Plato ever failed to come under the spell of the incomparable literary art of the great master; yet I am bound to confess that much of the argument and most of the philosophy were lost on me. Thomas Jefferson flung Plato's Republic aside in disgust as being of no practical guidance to him in his labours. Not long ago a learned professor of Greek in Yale University spoke of Plato as an "arrogant snob," who, if he were alive today, would advocate the "use of Nazi means to achieve noble ends," etc. Yet nobody can rob Plato of his genius, and to me at least the loftiness of his purpose and the nobility of his soul are beyond dispute.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the beginning of the session Breckinridge Robertson and I, and perhaps as many as three or four other first year students also who were candidates for graduation in the School of Greek, had been excused from regular attendance in the intermediate class, with the clear understanding and express stipulation that on a day to be appointed later we should be required to stand "a comprehensive examination on the Homeric poems." This examination, which was given every year, was a movable feast usually held around Easter, but the precise date was uncertain, and all we were told in advance was to be in readiness whenever the summons came. Aunt Mary used to tell me that procrastination was my besetting sin, and while I might lightly reply that Holy Writ bid us take no thought for the morrow, my own conscience sometimes troubled me. Week after week went by without my making the slightest preparation in advance for the day of reckoning that I knew was coming as surely as death and taxes. To be sure, early in the session I had taken the precaution to pin a notice on the wall just over the mantelpiece where I was bound to see it every morning when I shaved in front of the little piece of looking-glass propped on the shelf beside it. "Remember Homer!" was written in large letters, and then underneath, out of pure conceit I suppose, I had copied those sonorous lines of Coleridge's referring to . . . that blind bard who on the Chian strand, By those deep sounds possessed with inward light, Beheld the Iliad and the Odyssey Rise to the swelling of the voiceful sea. I got to know the words by heart and used to declaim them aloud to myself as if Homer was the best friend I had in the world, but for all that my acquaintance with him did not go much beyond that inspired verse. It rings in my cars today with all the haunting melody it had for me in the impressionable days of my youth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As long as I live I shall never cease to remember "Clermont," for that was the name of Major Mason's hospitable home just beyond the precincts of the town of Charlottesville. Simple and unpretentious, yet spacious and comfortable withal, the house itself -alas! long since a heap of ashes -with the yard around it and the circular driveway leading to it on either side, occupied a plateau on the other side of the railway from the hill that now is crowned by the McIntyre High School; yet for all its modest appearance, "Clermont," as well as I could judge, was as patrician an abode as "Burleigh-house by Stamford-town" or any other country seat in all the land. I knew it in its heyday, when Major Mason and his wife and children were all alive, for then I was a frequent and welcome visitor there, and some of the happiest days of my youth were spent beneath its roof. Bob Mason, eldest of three brothers, was my boyhood chum and afterwards my club-mate in college, and many a time and oft I had accompanied him home in the evening and shared his bed that night, indeed sometimes lingering all next day and perhaps another night too, for it was hard to tear myself away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I believe I would not be far wrong, were I to say that then the two most beautiful young ladies in all Albemarle were Hebe Harrison, who married Upton Muir of Kentucky soon after I came to college, and Major Mason's elder daughter, Virginia Mason, who some years afterwards married Mr. Benjamin Minor of Washington, D.C. However, I was just a boy in my teens when those lovely girls were at the height of their fame, and I was content to gaze at them from afar. It was just as well, for Virginia's younger sister, Maggie Mason, was nearly my own age, and without doubt she had, what seemed to me as well as I could tell without actual contact, the softest hair in the world, of a shade that varied from brown to auburn according as the light fell on it. The truth is, Maggie Mason was just as pretty and enchanting as a girl could be, and, as might be expected, I fell heels-over-head in love with her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So when Bob Mason came by my room on Monroe Hill one Friday evening and proposed that I should walk to "Clermont" with him and spend the week-end, it did not take me a moment to accept the invitation, and if Miss Maggie herself did not receive me with open arms, at any rate she as well as all the other members of the household plainly showed me that I was a welcome and honoured guest from the instant I crossed the threshold. The hospitality of "Clermont" was not an art; it was as natural and abundant as the shade under the great oak trees on the lawn in front of the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday morning was Saint Patrick's Day; yet it was not Christmas Day and therefore not a holiday in the University of Virginia. So I left "Clermont" soon after breakfast in ample time to be present at the lecture in "Senior Math" at eleven o'clock, trusting to luck that I would not be "sent to the board" all unprepared as I was. As I was ascending the steps of the rotunda, my friend Breckinridge Robertson, standing idly on the edge of the portico, called down to me in his usual casual voice, "Hello, old fellow, I can tell by your knitted brow that already you are chock-full of Homer!" Those ominous words, uttered in a tone of levity, fell on my ears like a death knell. I was taken so much by surprise that Williamson's Integral Calculus dropped from my hand and fell at my feet. Mechanically I stooped down and picked it up. Nobody could look at Breckinridge Robertson without seeing the intelligence that showed in every line of his face, but on this occasion there was a twinkle in his eye and a curl of his lip that made me nervous and boded mischief. Was he just trying to frighten me and raise a laugh at my expense? I knew he was a fellow of infinite jest, and I thoroughly resented it. "A difference of taste in jokes is a strain on the affections," was the only retort I could think of at the moment, and that was a line I had read in one of George Eliot's novels. He pointed his finger at the bulletin board by the side of the front door of the rotunda, and thither I went without another word. There, sure enough, in indelible ink was the notice is official as if it had been written on parchment. The date told me it had been posted Friday afternoon when I was on my way to "Clermont" with Bob Mason. "Comprehensive examination on Homer for all candidates for graduation in Greek," etc., to be held, rain or shine, bright and early Tuesday morning! and signed "M. W. Humphreys." The dismay on my countenance must have been plainly visible, and it may have suggested to Breckinridge Robertson the picture of one of the foolish virgins in the New Testament who had neglected to trim their lamps, for as he descended the steps of the rotunda, he called back, derisively, "Behold the bridegroom cometh!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All at once my mind became cool and collected. Not a moment was to be lost; the case was as nearly desperate as it could possibly be. Of course, "Senior Math" was out of the question for that day. I turned my back on the rotunda and proceeded straight to Olivier's Bookshop as if by instinct, and there, with much discrimination and within less than five minutes, I purchased over the counter three volumes, namely, Keep's Homer containing six books of the "Iliad" (I determined I had to let the "Odyssey" slide), a compact little Homeric Dictionary bound in yellow cloth (very convenient for my purpose), and, last and most indispensable of all, a Bohn's Library edition of "Homer's Iliad literally translated," which is on my bookshelf now almost as good as new, with my name on the title page inscribed in faded ink just as I wrote it on Saint Patrick's Day nearly three score years ago. With this parcel of books under my arm I hastened to my solitary room on Monroe Hill which I had not entered for more than two days, and there I set to work in earnest. Rome was not built in a day, and was there any man alive who could read the "Iliad" and learn all there was to know about Homer in less than twenty-four hours? Yet that was the task I had to perform in some kind of fashion -not just translation only, but Homeric grammar, syntax and metre, Greek civilization in the time of Homer, and then, Who was Homer anyway? (the Homeric Question, as it was called, including Wolf's Prolegomena ad Hoinemm [1795] and "the present aspect" of the controversy). Not all the king's horses and all the king's men, supposing they were at my disposal, pulling together and doing their utmost to help, could suffice to enable me to accomplish the Herculean labour by the appointed hour. It was long past midnight when I put aside the lapboard I had used to support all the volumes spread out before me and rose from my chair. Yet my head was clear as a bell, and I went to bed and slept soundly until Andrew Jackson came early in the morning and made the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The examination lasted all day Tuesday, and I was weary enough when it was finished. Yet I had a faint ray of hope that I might have passed it without much credit, for I had had one or two "breaks." The passage to be translated was one I had happened to read by the help of my "pony," and as luck would have it, not a single question had been asked about the "Odyssey."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Weeks passed, filled for me with secret anxiety, and then one day near the end of the session, Mr. Humphreys announced before beginning the lecture that morning that he would write on the board the list of students who had been successful in passing the examination. My name came first, Breckinridge Robertson's second. He was sitting next me, and I tried to look unconcerned and a trifle bored. Yet nothing could conceal my astonishment. I knew Homer nodded sometimes, but I did not suppose that Mr. Humphreys had acquired that habit also. I have never ceased to wonder how I managed to pass that examination at the top of the class. Not even Phineas Finn was more surprised and elated when he found he had been duly elected member of Parliament for the borough of Loughshane in Ireland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the 1880's Sweetbriar College for women had not yet been founded, and as a rule young ladies in Virginia had to be content with such higher education as could be obtained in a first-class finishing school on the order of Edgehill within sight of Monticello or Miss Baldwin's famous seminary in Staunton. Yet, odious as comparisons are, it is open to doubt whether the débutante of that remote age, who had perhaps never read a line of Virgil's Aeneid or even so much as heard of Boyle's Law about the pressure and volume of a gas, was not to all intents and purposes as well equipped with useful knowledge as her accomplished granddaughter is nowadays who has graduated at Bryn Mawr magna cum laude and has read Schopenhaur's essays. Be that as it may, I can testify from my own experience that a college belle who flourished at the University of Virginia in my student days knew more than enough to "come in out of the rain," as the saying is, and contrived somehow to make a show of erudition, enough to keep pace with those beaux who prided themselves on their academic accomplishments. If the conversation in the parlour happened to turn on some paradox in Noah K.'s moral philosophy, or maybe if the rule in Shelley's case was tossed on the carpet for discussion by one of Mr. Minor's enthusiastic disciples, indeed no matter how intricate and recondite the subject might be, the versatility of the young lady in question was apt to be no less extraordinary and remarkable than her ingenuity and sagacity. She might be "uncertain, coy, and hard to please," but she could be a "ministering angel" if the occasion demanded it. For instance, suppose you were "down on your luck," simply wretched for fear of "flunking" to-morrow in Latin. All you had to do was to put on your hat, maybe change your suit of clothes, and go across the Lawn, let us say, to seek comfort from one of the high priestesses who had her abode over there, or possibly indeed without having to cross the Lawn you might find her in the Pavilion next door to your room. The chances were that in less than an hour all your dread of Colonel Peters and his terrible Syllabus would have subsided completely, and your mind would be tranquil. She would know exactly what your weakness was, would tell you in the sweetest way in the world how to remedy it, and would send you back to your "midnight oil" restored in body and soul, doubtless with a big slice of sponge cake besides. My dear fellow, you would be a man again fortified against adversity, like one who has gone to a good doctor and has been cured of St. Vitus's dance. I used to hear that Delia Page (who lived in the Pavilion at the north end of West Lawn) took her male patients, one at a time, out to the University Cemetery or somewhere in that vicinity. She sat on the stile, and he sat at her feet; he gave her his book to hold, and she heard him his lesson. Then they went home hand in hand together and had supper in her father's house, and the next day it was told all over the campus how he had "curled" in Chemistry, so noticeably indeed that even Dr. Mallet unbended and bowed towards him. Delia Page's reputation for rescuing students from the Slough of Despond was certainly very high in those days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If there is a spark of poetic fire in a man's breast, his sweetheart is mighty apt to kindle it into flame. Perhaps also the lonely genius of Edgar Allan Poe still brooded over West Range where he had lived in the short interval of his college days. Whatever may have been the source of inspiration, certain it is that from time to time an aspirant among us bolder than the rest would woo the muse and try his prentice hand at ars poetica in one form or another. The ballads and sonnets that were composed in the University in the 1880's, the fair Rosalinds to whom they were indited, and even the writers themselves, for the most part anonymous, nearly all alike are now buried in perhaps merciful oblivion. Yet for good or ill some little residue of these lyrics has been rescued and preserved in Tom Wood's Arcade Echoes from which I have quoted already. In my judgment Edmund Watson Taylor's sonnet beginning with the lines, Within the deep'ning mirror of thine eyes I see a sweet reflection of my face, richly deserves a place in any anthology of American poetry. A ballad entitled "Declaration in Assumpsit," composed, I believe, by my friend Robert ("Bolivar") Saunders, was another piece that ranked high in our youthful estimation, not so much for its tuneful rhythm as for its accurate legal lore. All I can quote from memory is the first verse: John Doe complains of Susan Roe, That she with scheming art, Has stolen from the said Joe Doe His valuable heart. No doubt the case was ultimately tried in court, but I do not, know the sequel, though I suspect Susan remained in possession of her booty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The rivalry between different cliques of college belles was often jealous and intense without ever coming to an open declaration of war. In the University and its environs various powerful combinations flourished which might have been called "sororities," as, for example: the Burthe sisters, Maggie, Nonnie, Maud, and Adèle, who had their headquarters in their mother's home at one end of West Range; the Minor sisters, Mattie, Susie, and Nannie, and the Venable ditto, whose camps were side by side on East Lawn; the Harrison sisters, Virginia, Hebe, and Lizzie, whose bower was in "The Grove" on what is now called Wertland Street; the Southall sisters, Mary, Martha, and Emily (or "Dolly") and the Robertson sisters, Emma, Alice, and Lettie, who between them might be said to dominate Park Street downtown in Charlottesville; and Virginia and Maggie Mason at "Clermont" just off the highway that is known now as Rugby Avenue. Each of these organizations did a thriving business and was a social centre whose influence in university affairs was far from negligible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Private Willis in Iolanthe, doing sentry duty in the palace yard at Westminster, could not help thinking as he paced back and forth how strange and really "comi-cál" it was That every boy and every gal That's born into the world alive Is either a little Libe-rál Or else a little Conserva-tíve. So also when I was a boy I used to wonder how it came to pass that every girl in Virginia was predestined from birth to be either a "round-dancer" or else (God help. her!) a "square dancer," who would have to take her chances in life as best she could under that handicap. The Burthe, Harrison, Mason, and Robertson girls all belonged in the first category and chased "the glowing hours with flying feet"; whereas, the Minor, Venable, and Southall girls, who had been taught to believe that "Thou shalt not waltz" was one of the Ten Commandments, could only sit by the wall and "look on" at the "German" or "final ball" that used to be held in the rotunda at the end of the session, no doubt sighing to think how sinful and delightful the spectacle was and wishing their parents had been cast in a different mould. At that voluptuous hour the "dancing girl" was in her element and certainly at a premium; yet in spite of her manifest advantage, even she could not monopolize all the gay cavaliers assembled on the ballroom floor that evening. If you happened to glance over towards one of the alcoves, the chances were that you would see there that other girl, who never danced a step, seated like the queen of hearts in the midst of her faithful courtiers. Nay, you might even fancy that she viewed with disdain her graceful rival swaying to and fro in the mazes of the waltz.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In some households where round-dancing was outlawed, card-playing was a cardinal sin also. Yet it might be that a girl who was strictly forbidden to dance might be allowed to take a hand in a game of whist, particularly if her father was addicted to that pastime and a fourth player was needed to make a table for the evening. On the whole I am disposed to think that the young folks in that generation were perhaps more sinned against than sinning; yet it seems to me also that old and young mingled together then with greater freedom and mutual pleasure than is the custom nowadays.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Occasionally one of Calico's shining lights would suddenly take it into her dear little head to get married, and naturally an event of that kind always made a great stir in the community. I believe I have already alluded to Hebe Harrison's wedding which took place soon after I came to college; and yet before the session ended, Alice Robertson, supposed to be the heroine of Jack Mosby's operetta, crowned her romantic career by marrying Allen Hanckel. These were both heavy losses, but calico is one of those precious commodities that has.-a way of keeping up the supply, and in my day, I am thankful to say, there never was any dearth of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To all intents and purposes the last act of the drama of the Civil War was finished when the curtain went down at Appomattox in 1865 and marked the end of an era. The pathos of that decision was nowhere more poignantly felt than in the proud commonwealth that once had been the Old Dominion. Alien customs, newfangled ways, innovations, and upheavals are the inevitable consequences of defeat in battle; yet men like my father and many others, who had striven in vain to stem the tide and avert the fatal blow, clung stubbornly to the ancient faith and civilization in which the had been reared and nurtured and sought to preserve some remnants of a way of life that was still dear to them. It is true that here and there might be found a Confederate soldier who after the war tried to curry favour with the conquerors, but dear bought is the honey that is licked from a thorn, as I think he was apt to find to his cost. In the dark days of Reconstruction, before I was born, not much could be done in the way of resistance by even the staunchest patriots; yet their labour was not all in vain, just as the best carriage-horses are those that hold back against the coach as it goes rolling and tumbling downhill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can never forget one day when I was a little boy just beginning to learn my letters. I came home from school and proudly announced that I knew my alphabet from A to Zee! If I had dropped a bombshell in the house, I could not have created a greater commotion. Even my dear mother averted her face as if I were no child of hers. My father's countenance changed from pride to anger, as I stood trembling before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never again let me hear you say Zee," he said sternly, pronouncing the word in a tone of contempt. "That letter is Zed as it was in the time of Chaucer, and not all the Yankee spelling-books that were ever composed in Connecticut can change it!" With that he tossed the brand-new book in the fire, and my recollection is that next day he sent me to another school with a note to the teacher advising her to be careful about our mother-tongue. From that hour I have never pronounced that letter any way but Zed, even when long afterwards I taught Mathematics in the North and always excited a titter in the class by saying X, Y, and Zed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, by the time I was ready to go to college, the "New South," as it was called, was making headway in spite of all the forces of reaction and conservatism, and a new testament was being preached all over the land and dinned in the cars of my generation. The worst misfortune that can befall a vanquished people is to lose faith in themselves and begin to call in question their highest principles and most cherished beliefs; yet something like that was the inevitable aftermath of the Civil War in the South. Novelties and innovations, trivial enough by themselves and almost too slight to be noticed, yet in the aggregate quite significant, were gradually gaining ground in a steady trend away from what was ancient and long-established and towards new and alien civilization. The tendency could be plainly discerned in the University of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The year before I entered college was marked by the appearance at the end of the session of the first volume of Corks and Curls. The original name which it bears to this day was invented by my honoured friend Hampden Bagby, who was the first editor-in-chief. Well do I remember bow it was hailed with enthusiasm as a great and promising achievement; yet it was really nothing much to boast of after all, being at best no more than a poor and servile imitation of the hardy annuals that had been issued regularly year after year in such venerable northern colleges as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Those were famous institutions, to be sure, ancient and honourable, yet totally different in conception and plan from Mr. Jefferson's "academic village" in Virginia, which had no president, no curriculum, and which at first conferred no degrees. What did we know of class-systems and the distinctions of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors? No procession of scholars in gowns and caps, led by deans and other dignitaries with all the insignia of coloured hoods and sashes, had ever paraded on our campus. In the University of Virginia every student was like every other student and mingled freely and on equal terms with all his comrades in a common society where there was neither Jew nor Greek nor any kind of barrier or caste-distinction. I myself was an "Academ," but many of my closest friends and boon companions in college were in the Law class or the Medical School with pursuits and aims in life far apart from mine. My outlook was enlarged by coming in contact with fellow-students in Law, Medicine, and Engineering, and in this way my knowledge and sympathies were broadened perhaps without my realizing it at the time. I have felt since that this association was a distinct contribution to my education. A large community of miscellaneous young collegians thrown together as if by accident, left much to themselves, and free to mingle one with another in mutual harmonious association, constitutes in itself an automatic school of education. Youth is raw, intemperate, and inexperienced, but youth is likewise keen and open-hearted, quick and observant, critical and generous at the same time; and when many youths come in daily contact and interchange ideas and opinions with one another, they learn without being taught.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Corks and Curls in itself was certainly not much of an innovation, but a cloud no bigger than a man's hand may yet be a portent in the sky and a sign of the times. It came to birth in a period of transition when Thomas Jefferson's model was being metamorphosed, almost imperceptibly at first, and like all else in the South at that time was undergoing a sea-change, whether for good or for ill only the future could tell. A new pattern was slowly in process of formation fundamentally different in some respects from the simplicity of the original mould.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of much greater significance than Corks and Curls and a step that was indeed of far-reaching consequence, was the entrance of the University of Virginia into the arena of intercollegiate athletics, heretofore as foreign to us as a Spanish Plaza de Toros. Yet it was plain to see that we could never hope to overtake the seasoned colleges in the North in this untried field of endeavour, though such was our ambition at first. Unquestionably we had some good native material for outdoor sports. Was not Addison Greenway, a magnificent specimen of physical prowess, as stout and stalwart as Ajax, and Allen Potts as nimble and fleet-footed as Achilles? We were sure that neither Harvard nor Yale in all their glory could bring forward two champions more worthy to wear the crown of wild olives. Yet not all the chivalry and valour of Greenway and Potts could save us from ignominious defeat when that redoubtable captain Paul Dashiell and his football team from the Johns Hopkins University "came down like a wolf on the fold" and scattered our eleven to the four winds of heaven. That first encounter was so humiliating and at the same time so enlightening that we set to work next year to pay back the score; indeed, I believe we did fare rather better in this second game. In the interim we had ransacked the wilds of Albemarle County and found at last a mighty giant in the person of big Billy Garth; him, therefore, we fetched from his father's farm and drilled day and night to play centre-rush on our team. He proved to be a formidable obstacle to our opponents, and stood his ground with all the stubbornness of an ox that refuses to yield an inch. Even so, we could not prevail against Captain Dashiell's brilliant tactics. The enemy was wily and resourceful, and this time they sprung on us, all unsophisticated as we were, their new trick of the "forward pass" that completely bewildered big Billy Garth and circumvented him entirely. We learned that more was needed besides brawn and muscle to play the noble game of football. Fas est et ab hoste doceri, but it took two signal defeats in order for us to profit by this ancient maxim in the art of warfare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remember a baseball team that came all the way from the University of Vermont, an institution we had never heard of before. They were tall mountaineers, every mother's son of them; they muffed balls and piled up errors in the field, but how those fellows could bat! Allen Potts nearly ran his legs off trying in vain to overtake a swift ball that hovered for a moment high over his head and then landed deep down in centre field or even over the fence. By the time he got his hands on it, the tall Vermonter who had launched it had scampered round the bases for a home run. To us who watched the game from the side-lines, the utter helplessness of our team under that terrific onslaught of batting was a dreary spectacle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, a farsighted and resourceful individual in. our midst, Felix H. Levy by name, who was afterwards a famous lawyer in New York, conceived a brilliant idea and promptly executed it. In short, he built a high wooden fence all around the circuit of the old playground back of Dawson's Row, the gate whereof, -as I recollect, was not more than a stone's throw from the old brick mansion called "Montebello." Thereafter, in order to witness an athletic game everybody had to pay a fee of not less than fifty cents for admission. Ingenious and farsighted as Mr. Jefferson was, I doubt whether such an idea as Felix Levy's amphitheatre and gladiatorial shows ever once occurred to him as a necessary and fundamental part of his "academic village." Athletics at the University of Virginia was now on a paying basis. As a form of amusement and recreation the old debating societies were back numbers, -and college politics revolved around the new Athletic Association with its high officials, managers, etc, Now at any rate we were in line with the big colleges in the North.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These changes, and others not unconnected with them, took place towards the end of the century when Queen Victoria still sat on her throne. The best way of dating the epoch, more or less precisely, is by saying that it was in the days when mantelpieces, marble, mahogany, oak, and pine alike, were ordinarily draped with lambrequins made of Canton flannel, in case you did not happen to have any more elegant material, and looped up gracefully in the middle or at one side by a bow of bright ribbon, as beautiful to look at as it was easy to catch on fire, and easier still to catch all the vagrant dust that floated around in search of a place to settle. It was the time also when elderly spinsters tenderly nursed growing plants in long wooden boxes nailed outside tight against the windows so that never again could the Winds be shut. The window box, as I recall it, was filled with some unearthly kind of soil that soon got to be dry and hard as a brick; yet, if all went well, one or two dingy nasturtiums, possibly also a liver-coloured geranium, somehow struggled to maintain a dreary and precarious existence in it. But why do I pause to speak of such paltry trifles and signs of the times as lambrequins and window boxes, for was it not the time also, or nigh unto it, when a girl in Richmond named Irene Langhorne blossomed out in all her peerless beauty, and, so to speak, set the James on fire? The truth is, when I was in college, she was not yet more than "sweet sixteen," and hardly anybody could have prophesied then that the end of good Victoria's reign would be marked by the advent of the new phenomenon that came to be known as "the Gibson girl." In those days impecunious Virginians like myself -and goodness knows the woods were full of them! -used to save every penny they could rake and scrape in order to go to New York once a year and have a big frolic for as many days as their scanty means would allow. You lived in a hall-room on the top floor of a rather questionable boardinghouse, generally, it seems to me, on East 21St Street. The acme of bliss was to have at least one square meal in the famous restaurant of the old St. Denis Hotel on lower Broadway nearly opposite the present site of the huge Wanamaker Stores. A beefsteak eaten in the St. Denis Hotel was an episode long to be remembered and often related. The only drawback to that one glorious dinner in New York was the tip you had to give the waiter, because after that it was always doubtful whether as much as fifty cents would be left in your purse. That was what it cost to buy -in admission ticket for the peanut gallery of a theatre close at hand where there was a chance of seeing glamourous Lillian Russell, exposed to view as far as the law allowed, or maybe those inimitable comedians Robson and Crane who were the talk of the town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While I know I must not exceed the limits of my story, it is permissible for me to add here that the decade that got to be known as "the gay nineties" was an eventful one in the annals of the University of Virginia, yet not gay without alloy, for one fateful Sunday in 1895, several years after I had left college, the rotunda was suddenly enveloped in flames and came near being destroyed by fire. Dire as the calamity certainly seemed to be at the time, it turned out to be something like a blessing in disguise, for naught but a consuming fire could ever have severed the old "Annex" building from the rotunda and made it possible to restore the latter to its pristine symmetry and simplicity. Bad as the "Annex" was from an architectural point of view, it was not without its treasures and hallowed associations: the painting called "The School of Athens" hung in the big auditorium upstairs, the large lecture-room of the class in junior Natural Philosophy and Mr. Smith's historic laboratories were both on the ground floor, and in my time, just before the hour for Mr. Minor's lecture, the long flight of stone steps leading down to the basement was usually crowded from top to bottom by eager disciples of law in anticipation of the arrival of their master. No vestige of the old eyesore was left above ground after the restoration of the rotunda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I believe I have already noted that Dr. Barringer was the last professor in the University of Virginia to hold the ancient and honourable post of Chairman of the Faculty. During his administration Cabell Hall and other handsome buildings were erected to enlarge and complete the quadrangle of the Lawn as it appears today. Meanwhile, under the capable guidance and practically sole supervision of Mr. Thornton, a new School of Engineering was beginning to take shape. The total number of students enrolled in college was increasing steadily year by year. The "academic village" was expanding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">According to the Bible, when Samuel was an old man, the elders of Israel came to him and begged him to make them a king to rule over them and judge them "like all the nations." So likewise towards the close of the last century, a movement was set on foot to abolish the office of Chairman of the Faculty and anoint a president in his place to have dominion over the University of Virginia, subject only to the Board of Visitors. The great argument in favour of this proposal was that presidents were the heads of all the other colleges in the land, and that if the right man was found for the job, it was not too much to hope that his competence would be shown by his ability to raise money for an institution so deserving and so much in need of financial encouragement and support. The richly endowed colleges in the North were examples of the munificence of private benefactors. It might be hard for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but the theory was that it was harder still for a benevolent rich man not to stick his nose in a trap set for him by a good and efficient college president.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was more than a decade after I left college before this radical change was made in the government of the University of Virginia, and if I allude to it here, it is simply because the seeds of the new order began to be sown long before the fruit itself appeared above ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due course my first session in the University of Virginia came to an end; yet I remember little of The Finals of 1889 except the evening of the celebration of the Jefferson Literary Society when Gordon Battle presided over the exercises on that occasion. That was the evening when Henry W. Grady (1851-1889), known far and wide as "the silver-tongued orator of the South," delivered a famous address that roused his audience to a high pitch of enthusiasm. My intimate friend, Thomas Longstreet Wood, had won the magazine medal, and, consequently, it fell to his lot to introduce the distinguished speaker who was the guest of honour. Grady was a man of fine presence and ample proportions, whereas Tom Wood was slight of build and naturally a little nervous because of the task that lay before him. The contrast in the appearance of the, two speakers could hardly have been more marked, and I remember that I myself, seated far back in the big auditorium, was disturbed by a feeling of anxiety for my comrade when he came forward to the edge of the platform and bowed to the audience. Tom began a little haltingly and diffidently at first, but when he explained that he was there that evening simply because he was in somewhat the same position as Brer Rabbit and "bleeged to clime dat tree," the audience roared with laughter and appreciation, and thereafter, Tom kept them all in such good humour that everybody was sorry when he finished his short speech. The loudest applause came from Mr. Grady himself, who went out of his way to pay a tribute to his young sponsor. I believe that was the last time Henry W. Grady appeared in public, for he died of pneumonia a few months afterwards. Tom Wood dedicated Arcade Echoes (1890) in his honour; then, alas, Tom Wood's short life ended also. It was in the autumn of 1881 that Hampden Bagby, Raleigh Minor, and I stood with our heads bowed before a little mural tablet that was erected to the memory of that gifted youth in the village-church at Ivy where he was born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Finals of 1889 are memorable also as being the last days in college of three older students who were among my lifelong friends; each of whom, outstanding and facile princeps in one way or another, was at that time the worthy object of my youthful admiration and affection. The only one of the trinity who is now alive is George Gordon Battle, who for more than half a century has been a leader of the bar in the city of New York and certainly one of the most eminent and useful citizens of the great metropolis. Among the other honours that were heaped on him at The Finals was the degree of Master of Arts. Not long afterwards he crowned all his laurels by winning Martha Bagby for his bride, and surely that was glory enough for any mortal man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other two friends to whom I referred were John Staige Davis, Jr., and Charles Venable Carrington, each of whom took the oath of Hippocrates at the end of the session and was duly proclaimed to be a full-fledged M.D. Fielding Lewis Taylor, another lifelong friend of mine, got his Master of Arts degree that same year, along with Gordon Battle, but he stayed two more years in college until he graduated in Medicine in 1891.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Staige Davis, following in the footsteps of his illustrious sire, rose easily to the stature of a great physician and renowned teacher of Medicine in the University of Virginia, beloved far and wide and noted above all for his brilliant and charming personality and his sparkling wit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of all those I have mentioned I suppose I was closest to Charley Carrington; yet I lost contact with him almost completely when we separated and he went to Richmond to practice medicine. During that one year when we were in college together, he was my beau ideal , both my guide and mentor. He was one of nature's noblemen, handsome, gay, and debonair, chivalrous, and upright in thought, word, and deed. He wielded a good influence over me in the perilous days of youth, and I have never ceased to be grateful to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Charley Carrington left college, I had the good fortune to fall heir to his room, 34 East Lawn, next door to Colonel Venable's pavilion. I moved from Monroe Hill and lived there as long as I was in college. Not the room only but everything in it fell to my lot, for in the course of a long sojourn, C. V. C. (as he used to call himself) had accumulated a really prodigious pile of junk of one sort or another, some of which proved to be useful and convenient to me. He bequeathed it all with a lordly air: miscellaneous articles, odds and ends, canes, umbrellas, razors, curtains, lambrequins, counterpanes, jars, bowls, bric-a-brac, and I know not what else besides, much of it mere flotsam and jetsam that had been left behind by transient guests whom Charley Carrington, the most hospitable fellow that ever lived, had entertained from time to time. It took nearly a week to sort out all this plunder and dispose of it to the best advantage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On or before the first day of the following session, as soon as I was comfortably installed in my new quarters and ready to receive visitors, I tacked a card on the outside of the front door with my name inscribed on it and the announcement "Licentiate in Greek and Mathematics" written underneath it. It was intended to notify the passer-by that within that lowly abode dwelt one who was duly qualified and accredited to give instruction in either or both of the subjects named. At least a week passed without any notice being taken of the advertisement, and then one day there was a knock on the door. An applicant entered and told me with a little embarrassment that he had come to be "coached in Greek." My purse was low at the time, and I remember distinctly that I was badly in need of ten dollars, which was the price of the course of two lessons a week for six months, according to my recollection. I welcomed the pilgrim with joy. A schedule of hours was made out which was mutually satisfactory and convenient to us both. Far from haggling over the fee, as I was afraid he might do, the young gentleman insisted on paying half of it in advance. Then he bowed politely and departed. For more than a month I made a point of being on hand at the appointed hours of instruction, but I never again laid eyes on my pupil until many years afterwards when I happened to be present at the University of Virginia on some notable occasion. Then I was casually introduced to him again without recognizing him. Later I learned that he was then a member of the Board of Visitors. His name, as I recall it, was Oliver, and if he is alive today, I owe him at least as much as five dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here again I find I have inadvertently been led to trespass on the contents of the next chapter of my memoirs which concerns my second year in college.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">IV FIRST GLIMPSE IN NATURE'S REALM 1889-1890</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Inflamed with the study of learning and the admiration of virtue; stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men and worthy patriots, dear to God and famous to all ages." MILTON, Tract on Education.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As long as Charley Carrington was in residence as a student, his hospitable room on East Lawn was indeed a model of comfort and cleanliness, but when he abandoned it and turned it over to me, chaos was its proper name. The rubbish had all to be cleared away before the floors and walls could be washed and scoured, but at last when the carpet was laid and the furniture put in place, I contemplated my work with much satisfaction and said to myself that my new habitation had an air of respectability, to say the least.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now if a young lady, bent on some errand or other or perhaps just taking a morning stroll, happened to saunter past the open door of a dormitory room on the arcade, she would never have dared to peep inside, no matter how great her curiosity might have been, for in the days of my youth the rules of feminine decorum were rigidly prescribed, and unbecoming conduct, as it used to be called, could give rise to scandal. However, if she and I met each other outside, and particularly if at that moment I was lucky enough to be in tier good graces, she would be apt to inquire what was the colour of my curtains in case she might take it into her pretty little head to make a bow of ribbon to hold the folds in place. Of course, Aunt Mary's stepdaughters, Mary, Cantey, and Natalie Venable, my next-door neighbours, were almost like my own first cousins. However, not even the boldest of the three would have been so indiscreet as to put her tiny foot inside the door of my room on the Lawn, but Cantey made a lambrequin to hang over the mantelpiece, Natalie gave me an upholstered chair that had come out of her own room upstairs in the house next door, and "Mamie" (as the eldest sister used to be called) was constantly sending ebon George, the high and mighty butler, to bring me a saucer of chocolate ice cream during those laborious days when often as not I was to be found standing on a chair and trying to hang a picture properly without anybody near at hand to tell me whether the frame was tipped too far one way or the other and was exactly midway between the head of the bed and the foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day soon after the session began, being in a hurry to get to class, I forgot to bolt the latch on the door when I left the room, and when I returned about an hour later, a beautiful old gold watch which I had carelessly laid on the end of the mantelpiece was gone! I never laid eyes on it again. It was a cherished heirloom bequeathed to me by my old "mammy" Malvina Sparks when she made tier will and died in my father's home some years before I came to college. Inside the case an inscription was engraved relating that the watch had been given to Malvina by her old mistress Miss Matilda Southall of Williamsburg, a lady. who died long before I was born. I prized this watch not for its own sake only, but because it was the sole token I had in the world of the dearly beloved old coloured lady by whose side I had stood so often when I was a little boy and she was making gingerbread on the kitchen table. Aunt Mary had known Malvina too, and she was full of sympathy when I told her of the loss of my watch and she insisted on sending at once for the only policeman in the town of Charlottesville. He was an old Confederate soldier with a wooden leg, and in spite of all that he could do, no trace of the thief was ever found. Only a few years ago I lost another valuable heirloom in much the same way. It was a gold watch chain which my honoured father-in-law, William R. Abbot, Esq., of Bellevue in Bedford County, Virginia (1838-1916), wore in his waistcoat to the day of his death, and which I had worn ever since with a Phi Beta Kappa key attached to it. I believe I would give all my earthly possessions if only Malvina's watch and Mr. Abbot's gold chain were restored to me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon after the session opened, Aunt Mary took me aside one day and took me by surprise also, for she asked me how I would like to be Colonel Venable's private secretary and get my meals at her table by way of compensation. The payment was ample, and I told her immediately that nothing could be more to my taste and particularly the meals at her table which I had tasted many times already and knew how good they were. Besides, if the truth must be told, I welcomed the joyous prospect of being brought three times daily in company of tier gay and charming stepdaughters, to say nothing of the pleasure that would be afforded by the elder members of the household also. I knew well what a genial and jolly old soul Colonel Venable could be when he was not in his classroom and was separated entirely from Solid Analytic Geometry. As I have already mentioned, he had an inexhaustible fund of good stories and memorabilia of his eventful life, just the night before when I was there for supper he had told me about an aristocratic old gentleman in Halifax County, a friend of his father, who when he was solicited to vote for Thomas Jefferson, of Albemarle, for president of the United States, shook his head thoughtfully and firmly declined to do so because Mr. Jefferson lived at Monticello, and that was "a little too fur North" in his opinion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even on a strictly business basis, undoubtedly I bad the best of the new bargain, for now I did not have to pay for my meals in a boardinghouse and my duties as private secretary were more nominal than real. As well as I could see, my chief business was to make myself agreeable to every member of the family. Occasionally, it might be as often as once a week, the Colonel would send for me to come to his office on the other side of the house from my room on the Lawn and would give me a manuscript notebook wherein certain pages had been turned down for me to copy early next morning on the blackboard in his lecture-room. My recollection is that this ancient and dilapidated volume contained young Venable's original notes, made when he was a student in Germany before the outbreak of the Civil War, and if so, I can testify that his handwriting in youth was nearly as illegible as it was later in life. I deciphered these enigmatic compositions as best I could, mathematical formulae and all, and if the transcription I wrote on the board was not a faithful copy in every detail, nobody, not even the Colonel himself, ever questioned it or compared it with the authentic version.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After ransacking my memory I can recall only one other duty that I was called on to perform that year in my capacity of private secretary, and certainly from my point of view it was in the nature of a frolic rather than a task. When Colonel Venable was Chairman of the Faculty, he had inaugurated a system of University Extension Teaching which I never clearly under stood only I know it involved holding yearly examinations in certain accredited academics and schools in the state of Virginia. Accordingly, towards the end of the session he commissioned me as his duly appointed representative to conduct a series of examinations that were held that year in a Jesuit ' School or Roman Catholic Seminary in the city of Alexandria and perhaps also in the Episcopal High School near by, for I remember spending one night in the latter institution. Invested as I was with some thing like proconsular authority, I went on this mission with a high sense of my own dignity and importance. The question papers had all been prepared beforehand by certain professors in the Academic Department of the University, and all I had to do was to preside at the ceremony of holding the examinations and to take care that everything was carried out with due decorum. Perhaps I was absent from the University on this business for an interval of three days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here I may mention another little job I had this session that was likewise a source of pleasure and profit, though it was without pecuniary reward. The Faculty Reading Room, as it used to be called, was a pet project of Professor Perkinson, and indeed I suppose he was the prime mover in it. It occupied two communicating dormitory rooms on East Lawn between Mr. Schele's pavilion and that of Dr. Holmes, and fairly regularly every afternoon a number of professors might be found there who had come to read the newspapers and current magazines in much the same way as the reading room of the Colonnade Club on the other side of the Lawn is used nowadays. Professor Perkinson offered to give me access to this clubroom on condition that I keep the periodicals in order, replacing the old numbers with the new ones that came by post from day to day. The task took little time, and I was glad to have an opportunity of glancing through the papers and magazines. However, the chief advantage was that I got to be acquainted with nearly all the members of the faculty, indeed almost on terms of familiarity with some of them, especially the younger men and instructors who were nearer my own age. One day when I happened to be present, Colonel Peters and Mr. Humphreys were having a hot dispute about a line of Juvenal which neither of them could remember word for word. Now in the old days at Richmond College, Juvenal was, so to speak, "right up my alley," and by a stroke of good luck that particular line (about Syrian Orontes having been emptied into the Tiber) * was on the tip of my tongue, and out I came with it, much to the astonishment of my learned superiors. Colonel Peters, a generous, kindhearted man, patted me on the back and prophesied that the world would hear from me one day; yet great as Colonel Peters was in his own line, and much as he may have had the "gift of tongues," alas, he did not have the gift of prophecy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I look back on it now, it seems to me that that session when I was virtually a member of the Venable household was certainly [*] lam pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes. Juvenal, Satire III. one of the happiest years of my life, profitable and noteworthy in many ways. It was a high privilege to be closely associated with such a great gentleman and scholar as Colonel Venable. His eldest daughter, who did all the housekeeping and presided at the head of the dinner table opposite her father, was a very accomplished young woman. At that time she was already engaged to be married to Dr. Charles Lancelot Minor, of Brooklyn, New York, who had graduated in Medicine a year or two previously and was afterwards to be known all over the land as one of the leading authorities in the diagnosis and treatment of tubercular diseases. Cantey Venable was a very gifted and cultured young lady also, with a large circle of friends and admirers of both sexes. Before I finished college she was wedded to Clarence Dallam, of Paducah, Kentucky, but alas, her life was cut short and she died in 1891.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Natalie Venable, youngest of the three sisters, was a charming débutante then, and I can testify that she did a thriving and disconcerting business among the students. I might have sued for her hand myself had I not realized early in the action that I never could stand the ghost of a chance against such formidable rivals as Hampden Bagby, Sherrard Tabb, Stewart Bryan, and Raleigh Minor who were among the foremost aspirants. Her choice of Raleigh in the end was a lucky one for me, for I was ever afterwards a welcome guest in their hospitable home on West Lawn where they lived so many happy years after he got to be a distinguished professor of Law, as his father was before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That year when I was Colonel. Venable's secretary, his elder son Frank Preston Venable was already professor of Chemistry in the University of North Carolina and destined to be president of that college not long afterwards. One other member of Aunt Mary's household was her darling son and only child, then still a schoolboy about twelve years old and now the famous surgeon, Dr. Charles Scott Venable, Jr., of San Antonio, Texas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An incidental advantage of being a guest at Aunt Mary's table was that it gave me the opportunity of meeting many eminent and interesting people who happened to be entertained in her home from time to time. It was there, for example, that I was introduced to President Grover Cleveland, though I doubt whether that exalted personage ever knew of my existence. It was there too that I first became acquainted with Dr. Barringer and his wife at a dinner given in their honour soon after they came to the University and lived in their first home on East Range.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two families of Minor and Venable lived next door to each other on East Lawn and were allied by close ties of ancient friendship. The first time I came in contact with Raleigh Minor, DKE, and his elder brother John, Chi Phi, who bore his father's honoured name, was in my uncle's house on Park Street in Charlottesville, where Mary, Martha, and "Dolly" Southall were already eligible young ladies with many admirers before I ever* came to college. My special chums in the Minor household were Raleigh and his younger sister Nannie Jacquelin Minor, but indeed I was fondly attached to every member of that big family, old and young alike. The Minor's of Albemarle have ever been a comely race, men and women both; yet, it seems to me, Raleigh Colston Minor was the comeliest of them all, as certainly he was one of the most loveable of men. His handsome and distinguished appearance was conspicuous in any company where he was present, and the qualities of his mind and heart were no less rare and beautiful than his outward countenance. Full well I know, "I shall not look upon his like again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Minor's private sanctum and study, in the last dormitory room on East Lawn, communicated with the drawing room in his pavilion by a door that had been made in the intervening wall. The affable and dignified old gentleman liked the society of young people, and even when he was supposed to be engrossed in more serious occupations, he contrived to overhear much of the nonsense and merriment that echoed in the evening from the adjacent room where his lively daughters and their swains were holding carnival. At last his secret inclinations would get the better of him, and presently we would be aware of Mr. Minor's stately presence standing in our midst. Instantly everyone rose to his feet to greet him. True, we stood in awe of him, his own children most of all; yet I was bolder than the rest, rather an impudent youngster, I daresay. Of course, my salutation was perfectly respectful, but the young ladies could scarcely conceal their consternation when I asked their father to tarry awhile and make himself perfectly at home in our midst. Mr. Minor took kindly to me, always showing me some mark of favour, and I shall always believe there was a bond of mutual affection between us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every morning as soon as breakfast was finished and before the company rose from the table, Mr. Minor had family prayers in the big dining room across the hall from the parlour. The congregation was generally a large one, including not only Mrs. Minor herself — "Aunt Ellen," as we used to call her — and her numerous stepchildren as well as the maidservant and the manservant (old "Uncle Alfred" who helped to wait on the table as best he could in spite of his obvious rheumatism and other infirmities), but all the strangers also who happened to be "within the gates" of that hospitable mansion, quite a goodly number as a rule. I remember the ceremony well because I was there for breakfast many times whenever I spent the night and shared Raleigh's room upstairs. It began with the formal reading of a long chapter in the Bible which Mr. Minor expounded as</field>
      <field name="fulltext">he went along, occasionally asking hard and uncomfortable questions only too apt to expose the ignorance of his hearers, or, what was worse, their sinful inattention. Then at, a given signal, with much noise and clatter, all with one accord pushed their chairs back from the table and knelt devoutly on their knees. At this moment I was deathly afraid of sneezing or of being taken with a fit of hiccoughs, for then Mr. Minor would wait patiently until perfect silence prevailed, but the interruption was considered to be both unnecessary and unseemly. It goes almost without saying that Mr. Minor prayed long and fervently, never omitting, it seemed to me, to implore the divine blessing on every man and beast, not at home only but in the far jungles of Africa where the heathen were naturally a source of Christian anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On one particularly memorable occasion I, sitting at table with my back to the Latrobe stove, was wretchedly uncomfortable all through breakfast, and when the time came to kneel down in front of that furnace, my temperature had almost reached the point of combustion. I looked behind me under the table and described there in the darkness a clear, unimpeded, if somewhat circuitous, passage leading between the feet of the prostrate company to what appeared to be a vacant space on the opposite side of the long table. Instantly and unhesitatingly I crawled towards the distant haven, trying to make as little disturbance as possible and somewhat painfully aware that, even if I reached port in safety, no chair was placed there for my elbows to rest on and that I would be left kneeling as it were in mid-air without visible means of support. As soon as the benediction was pronounced, I leaped to my feet hoping to mingle with the throng and escape without detection, but Mr. Minor quickly spied me, and chuckling all over with mirth (for he divined what had happened), expressed astonishment at finding me after prayers on the other side of the room. There was nothing to do but to make a clean breast of it, and so I retorted, "Well, sir, fire in an ordinary oven may not be as consuming is hell-fire in the New Testament about which you were telling us just now, but the oven was closer to me at the moment and appeared to be the greater evil of the two." Mr. Minor took his cane from the outstretched hand of the old coloured butler, and pointing it at me, "Alfred," said he, "the next time that young gentleman is here for breakfast, please find a seat for him as far from Hades as possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On remote Monroe Hill the atmosphere had not been so charged with combustibles as it was on the Lawn in the midst of the rivalry and jealousy between the different sororities. We are told in the Bible, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon," but as far as I know, scripture is silent about not swearing allegiance to two different girls at the same time. In my new environment I found that if I ranged myself in the Venable-Minor camp, it was more or less an understood thing that I must not be seen too often with one of the Burthe girls or their feminine allies. So it came to pass (even now I am ashamed to confess it) that almost imperceptibly and unwittingly my visits to "Clermont," where I had been wont to spend so many happy and delightful hours, and where such kindly welcome had always greeted me, got to be less and less frequent until at last they ceased entirely. Such is the way of thoughtless, thankless, and uncivil youth; yet I ought to have known it is not the way of a gentleman. To this day the remembrance of my infidelity to dear and lovely Maggie Mason is like a blot on my scutcheon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was hard to say whether the Burthe girls annexed the ATO fraternity, lock, stock, and barrel, or whether those dashing and impetuous youths had one and all sworn an oath that they, and they only, were to be the guardians and champions of those enchanting sisters. Yet I knew it was as much as the life of a DKE was worth in those days for him to pay serious attention to Maggie, Nonnie, or Maud; though now and then, I myself did venture on their premises and once indeed ran foul of a statuesque maiden, one of their cousins from New Orleans, who might easily have turned my head, had I not found out in time that Edwin Hobson would not brook trespassing on his preserves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Charles Minor who married Mary Venable happened to be a Delta Psi, and I have always wondered if it were by virtue of that connection that along about 1890-91, the brotherhood of St. Anthony, Stewart Bryan, Billy Peterkin, Winslow Randolph, Tom Pinckney and all their subalterns, took over Cantey and Natalie Venable with as little compunction or ceremony as the Nazis showed when they invaded Norway in 1940. No matter what time of day you happened to call on either one of those popular young ladies, she was almost sure to be surrounded by a phalanx of devoted Delta Psi's; and Hampden Bagby used to complain bitterly that so far as he was concerned, "Miss Natalie might as well be incommunicado," unless he chose to have an interview under the watchful eye of a Delta Psi sentinel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the way of education, and apart from Mathematics, the past decade of my life had been spent exclusively among the ancients, nor can I say now, according to my mature judgment, that that precious time of youth had been spent in vain, in. view of the fact that the roots of modern culture and civilization go deep down in the centuries of the past. The study of Greek and Latin is certainly an excellent mental discipline if it be nothing more, and at least I had acquired a certain power of learning intelligently and comprehendingly each new lesson appointed to be done. Yet it is strange indeed to think that at the age of eighteen I was as ignorant as the ancients themselves of the magic realm of science that had flourished and borne fruit ever richer and richer from the time of the discovery of America and the renascence of Europe. Undoubtedly, my second session in the University of Virginia when for the first time in my life I set foot in this new kingdom of knowledge was the turning point of all my education. Before that year, Natural Philosophy had been to me a name only as to the meaning whereof I had only the dimmest conception; now it was a case of love at first sight. Greece and Rome were left behind as if they had never mattered!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that period it had not entered my head to think of planning my course of study with a view to obtaining the degree of Master of Arts, and I suppose it must have been simply a genuine thirst for knowledge that led me to apply that year for graduation in the Schools of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry. Doubtless I consulted my father and he approved of the programme. How was it that nobody told me that it was nothing short of folly to take the senior class in Natural Philosophy without having completed the prerequisite course in the junior class? Yet no human being interposed the slightest objection or gave me a word of advice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Junior Natural" was intended to be a rather thorough survey of general physics, not altogether elementary, yet not difficult, only perfectly novel to me. On the other hand, "Senior Natural," by common consent supposed to be the hardest subject in the M.A. curriculum of those, days, was indeed a very advanced course on "Sound and Light," which it might be inferred was entirely beyond my grasp at the time. The first lesson was in a formidable little textbook called Vibratory Motion and Sound, the very title seemed to give me vertigo. I plunged headlong into this sea of symbols and mathematical formulae, floundering from one page to the next in the vain hope of clutching hold of a solid rock where I could rest and have a breathing spell. Worse even than this preliminary textbook was the solid array of "Notes" with which Professor Smith had covered all the blackboards before the class assembled and which had to be copied after class, even if no clue could be gained as to the meaning thereof. So great, was my bewilderment that I sought refuge in the old library in the whispering gallery of the rotunda, consulting every learned treatise I could find there that might if possible cast a ray of illumination on the ineffable mystery of "Light and Sound" in which I was enmeshed. Only the other day I visited the imposing new Alderman Library that now adorns the University of Virginia, and quite unexpectedly and unaccountably a feeling of curiosity seized me to look again at Sir John Herschel's celebrated article on "Light" published originally in 1828 in the London Encyclopaedia Metropolitana, for, it had been one of the luminous and voluminous treatises I waded through that year when I was a candidate for graduation in the School of Natural Philosophy. I wondered if that huge old folio tome, nearly if not quite as big as Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, was indeed still in existence, and if perchance it had escaped combustion in the fire of 1895 when the rotunda itself came so near being consumed. The courteous attendant brought the identical volume to me and placed it in my hands once more, safe and sound, almost hale and hearty still. As I opened it and turned to the long essay on "Light," written so soon after the triumph of the Young-Fresnel undulatory theory, a. little scrap of note paper lying between the pages fell to the floor. I stooped down and picking it up, recognized my own youthful handwriting, the pencil marks as unfaded as if it had been written yesterday instead of nearly threescore years ago. From that day to this, I thought to myself, this particular volume had remained unopened, and no other student in the University of Virginia had ever taken the trouble to read Sir John Herschel's epoch-making essay on "Light."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not wretched William Cowper himself nor the poet's "Castaway" I think was ever more at sea that I was that first half-year in "Senior Natural"; yet even then I was buoyed up by an unquenchable enthusiasm and an abiding faith that I was on the verge of a strange new world nobler and richer than all I had ever seen before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile at the same time I was attending regularly the lectures in the junior class with eager enjoyment and not without profit and instruction. Strange as it may sound to some of my youthful contemporaries (if any such are still alive), I believe I can truthfully say I never missed a syllable that was uttered, for in those impressionable days I was under some kind of a spell. Mr. Smith was my hero, and I was his humble disciple. As I gazed at him from my seat in class just as the lecture was about to begin, I used to say to myself in a kind of ecstasy: Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice, Him or her I shall follow, As the water follows the moon, silently, With fluid steps anywhere around the globe. In the first place Mr. Smith had indeed a beautiful mind that seemed to be reflected is much in his countenance as in the words that fell from his lips. Ben Jonson said of Shakespeare that he loved the man and honoured his memory "on this side idolatry as much as any," and such was the admiration and adoration I felt then for "Frank Smith," as we fondly called him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No doubt Mr. Smith's lectures were over the beads of most of us, and equally no doubt many of his youthful hearers like careless Gallio in the Bible were downright bored. Yet even the dullest member of the class was bound to be thrilled by the sudden and unexpected burst of eloquence that from time to time fell upon the ears of all who were present in that crowded lecture-room. At that moment it was as if "Frank Smith" were communing with himself, oblivious of his surroundings and unmindful of his audience, transfigured and borne aloft on the wings of his high imagination. Usually the great moment came at the climax of a successful experiment that had just been demonstrated to the class. It might be elicited perhaps by the manifest evidence of the prodigious force of water expanding in the act of freezing and bursting asunder an iron bomb shell; or by the beautiful geometrical union of two soap bubble films in strict obedience to the laws of surface-tension in liquids; or by the symmetrical sand pattern that delineated the nodal lines on a plate of brass that had been startled by the bow of a violin into a spasm of musical ecstasy; or indeed by any one of a hundred strange and exquisite natural phenomena such as we had never seen before or dreamed could' come to pass. "Frank Smith" himself seemed to glow with new rapture and astonishment, childlike and unfeigned, each time he summoned his wonder-working "daemon" to appear and do his bidding before the whole assembled "Junior Natural" class, and as he spoke his incantation, the whole class with one accord thundered with applause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My old colleague George Vincent Wendell, himself a great teacher of Physics in Columbia University, told me that once when he was connected with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Francis H. Smith of the University of Virginia had been invited to Boston to deliver the principal address on some momentous occasion and that it was by all odds the most eloquent speech he ever heard in his life. I can well believe it, and yet I doubt whether that notable oration in the city of Boston was as eloquent and stirring as many an unconscious and spontaneous soliloquy we used to overhear when Mr. Smith stood before us in his own lecture-room lost in admiration of one of nature's miracles which he had just performed for our benefit and instruction and, like Shelley's skylark, poured forth his heart "in profuse strains of unpremeditated art."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Smith had been a pupil of William B. Rogers (1804-1882), and doubtless he had learned from that illustrious master the art of experimental dexterity and manipulation. Much of his apparatus was made by his own hands and was often exceedingly ingenious, all the more useful and efficient for being so plain and simple. The demonstration and measurement of the earth's diurnal rotation by means of Foucault's pendulum was always a notable day in class, and then the old lecture-room in the "Annex" would be crowded by spectators from all parts of the University. The pendulum was hung from the roof of the building, and as the heavy iron bob swung slowly to and fro just over the top of the lecture table, a delicate little lever with a tiny bit of mirror-glass fastened by sealing wax at the end of the long arm was brushed aside ever so little at each transit, while a spot of light reflected from the mirror traversed a distant scale on the wall and recorded the movement of the earth. I believe this impressive experiment was duly performed each session, never once unsuccessfully, as far as I know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luminous fountains and cascades of water are such a common spectacle nowadays that often they may be seen by night even at a village fair without exciting comment, much less wonder and awe. Yet the first time I ever beheld a fiery jet of water in Mr. Smith's lecture-room, darkened for the purpose, it was to me a weird and memorable sight. It so happened that day that I had been up all night at some convivial party or other, and when I took my accustomed seat in class I was too drowsy to keep my eyes open. Suddenly I was aroused by the sound of applause all around me in the completely dark room except that a little distance in front of me I perceived to my astonishment what seemed to be a molten stream of fire issuing from an invisible source and disappearing on the floor beneath. For a moment I thought my last hour was come and I was on the brink of inferno! In order to make the experiment more striking, as I found out afterwards, Mr. Smith had interposed a plate of red glass in the path of the beam of sunlight reflected into the room from the heliostat on the window sill outside, and it was the red light condensed by a lens to a focus just behind the orifice near the bottom of the tall cylindrical reservoir mounted on a table that had imparted its own colour to the out-pouring jet of water. Yet even with this explanation it was hard at first for me to comprehend how the innumerable rays of light, caught and imprisoned in the jet by total internal reflection, were compelled to pursue the parabolic arc of the falling stream of liquid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus during the whole of that session, hardly a day went by without my witnessing in class some new and striking natural phenomenon in illustration of the subject under discussion. Those ingenious and beautiful demonstrations, artfully contrived and nearly always faultlessly executed, accompanied as they often were by Mr. Smith's ejaculations of wonder and delight, brought me face to face with Nature herself, unknown, mysterious power, sublime, indifferent, above all free from any taint of human error and superstition. This was the world in which I was born, and I myself was "a child of Nature cradled in her arms until my turn comes to die and to remain somewhere and somehow in her embrace"; so I thought to myself then in the budtime of youth, but not in those words, which were nearly the last words of my dear friend Dean Woodbridge of Columbia University. I can never forget his saying, with the childlike simplicity that was so characteristic of him, that to the end of his days he was afflicted with a sense of indecency whenever he referred to Nature as "it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As a teacher Professor Smith was not entirely without fault. Perhaps he yielded too much to his own enthusiasm and was sometimes tempted to dwell longer than necessary on a particular subject; the consequence being that when the bell tolled for the class to be dismissed, more often than not he had failed to cover the ground that had been laid out in advance. Accordingly, when the end of the session was at hand, the latter part of the course was usually not quite finished and had to be slurred over more or less summarily and inadequately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nevertheless, as I look back from the standpoint of ripe judgment and larger appreciation, I am deliberately of the opinion that in thoroughness of treatment and in excellence of presentation, perhaps most of all 'in being completely abreast of the modern conceptions of the science of that day, the lectures in Natural Philosophy which I heard in the University of Virginia in 1890 were much superior to any course of general physics that was then being given in the United States. Professor Tyndall's lectures at the Royal Institution in London, where the pace had been set first by Sir Humphrey Davy and afterwards by Michael Faraday, were indeed a little earlier than my time; yet I venture to say that Professor Smith's lectures compared favourably with Tyndall's in art of exposition and in vigour of language, while I doubt whether the latter was Professor Smith's equal in mathematical insight and scientific precision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Smith was a pillar in the Methodist church and a man of deep religious convictions at the time when the "conflict" between religion and science was fierce and bitter. The cosmogony of the book of Genesis was being called in question by the new doctrines of geology and evolution. The three musketeers of science were Herbert Spencer in philosophy, Thomas H. Huxley in biology, and John Tyndall in physics; each of whom liked nothing better than to goad his orthodox adversary and prick every vulnerable joint in his armour. If you went to church on Sunday, the preacher in the pulpit never could finish his sermon without holding up to scorn that unholy trinity which was bent on undermining the foundations of Christian belief. If Mr. Smith ever alluded to these controversial questions in his lectures, it was only occasionally, and then more in sorrow than in rebuttal. When the upholders of divine providence cited the peculiar and anomalous behavior of water in the act of freezing as a manifest evidence of benevolent design in the laws of Nature, Professor Tyndall retorted that bismuth is another substance that likewise expands on solidifying, notwithstanding there are no fishes in bismuth whose lives are to be saved. I well remember Mr. Smith's comment in which, without taking sides one way or the other, he deplored that even so big a man as Professor Tyndall could not refrain from sneering at his opponents in an argument.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Professor Rowland at the Johns Hopkins University, who was my teacher also, was famous for having made a screw for his dividing engine which had such a fine and accurate thread that by means thereof he had been able to rule thousands of equal-space parallel lines within the width of an inch on a piece of speculum metal used for a diffraction-grating. In fact, it was such an excellent screw that in his enthusiasm Professor Rowland thought he might say it was simply perfect. However, a few years later the inventor announced that he had still further improved the original apparatus, and so one day in Senior Natural Philosophy Mr. Smith rubbed his hands and smiled blandly at us sitting there before him. "Now at last," said he, "Professor Rowland has succeeded in making a plusperfect screw."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For my part, shall I ever forget that it was "Frank Smith" who in the days of my youth held the lamp of science before my ardent eyes and lighted a kindred flame in me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">More than any man I ever knew, Dr. Mallet was imbued with the simplicity of the character of a gentleman, and such I believe was the impression he made on those who knew him intimately. Reserved and dignified, yet always polite and affable, he was known to be of unimpeachable integrity and above reproach in every human relationship. Renowned at home and abroad, in some ways Dr. Mallet towered above all his colleagues. To me he seemed the very embodiment of the ideal man of science, accurate and painstaking, just and impartial.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Department of Chemistry was housed in a separate building opposite West Range and directly behind the brick structure that used to be Dr. Mallet's residence, and I think it occupied the site of the building that is now used by the Department of Psychology. The class in General Chemistry, perhaps the largest in college, comprised both academic and medical students. Unlike Professor Smith, Dr. Mallet had such poise and self-restraint, and was withal so impersonal in his manner and void of outward enthusiasm, that one might have supposed that his lecture was being delivered by an animated automaton mechanically incapable of making a mistake. No matter how much his audience might be carried away — and at times we were greatly impressed — it would have been something like sacrilege to applaud the speaker or disturb the even tenour of his careful exposition and expert illustrations that dovetailed together as if they were both of one piece. During the whole hour and a half allotted to the lecture, the genius of science hovered above our heads as if to invoke both meekness and reverence, and when the lecture was finished promptly at the stroke of the clock, everybody present was aware that not a word could be added or subtracted without impairing its scientific completeness. Then Dr. Mallet bowed stiffly, disappeared quickly through the door leading to the laboratory, and the class dispersed in silence with as much sobriety and decorum as a congregation leaving church. The speaker's farewell gesture had been as much as to say, "Here endeth the lesson. He that bath cars to hear, let him hear, for this is my last word on the subject of this lecture!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a printed syllabus which served as a guide for the subject of Dr. Mallet's lectures, and it was supplemented by Fowne's Chemistry, a large funereal volume bound in black cloth, very satisfactory for a reference book. We had painstakingly to commit to memory a great array of facts in order to pass the final examination in Chemistry, but otherwise the course was not difficult. Yet I remember being seized with something like deathbed repentance the night before examination and scarcely getting a wink of sleep even after having gone to bed at last, laden with anxiety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On all ordinary occasions, in the classroom as well as on the campus, our instructors were genial and companionable enough, made of flesh and blood like ourselves. However, on the day of examination the professor's countenance was changed, his whole demeanour was cold and distant, and it seemed as if no drop of the milk of human kindness flowed in his veins. Now in those ancient days an examination was a formal and solemn ceremony that lasted all day long, sometimes far into the night. Your previous records, "corks" and "curls" both, counted for naught, for on that day all was at stake. The penalty of failure was as sure and unrelenting as the sentence pronounced by a British judge; only, there was no appeal and no amnesty. Nothing was left to be done except to take that subject again next year from start to finish, and indeed every year thereafter until the examination was duly passed. Woe to the delinquent who fell short of the requisite mark which was seventy-five per cent and even higher in Law and Medicine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not all the intervening years have blotted out the painful memory of that dies irae when I took the final examination in "Senior Natural." According to my recollection there were not more than about ten candidates for graduation that year, including, besides myself, Mallory K. Cannon, James H. Corbitt, C. L. DeMott, Joe Dunn (whose M. A. that year hinged on this examination), Snowden Marshall, and "Math" (James S.) Miller (who it seems to me was at the same time instructor in Natural Philosophy that year). The clock of the rotunda had not finished striking the appointed hour when Professor Smith, punctual to the minute that day if never before, quietly entered the lecture-room by the private door from his laboratory and immediately began writing the questions Oil the board, while we looked on in awful suspense. It was soon apparent that no mercy was to be shown that day of battle; black despair shone on every countenance, and only Mr. Smith's face was as placid and benevolent as ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Mallet, a member of the faculty committee appointed for holding the examination, showed his face in the torture-chamber during the course of the morning, as in duty bound, for Dr. Mallet never neglected any task however slight and unimportant. He and Mr. Smith held a whispered colloquy lasting only a few minutes and quite inaudible to our cars. Some jest or other passed between them, for both were shaking with subdued laughter. Such mirth was unseemly at that hour, and it irritated me. Then Dr. Mallet vanished as noiselessly as he had come, but the serene smile that lighted Mr. Smith's face lingered there all day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile my languid and irresolute pen had scarcely scrawled more than two or three aimless lines on the smooth sheet of foolscap paper spread on the writing bench before me. The questions on the blackboard were all so sinister and enigmatic that I was at a loss as to how to begin, and in desperation I tore that first sheet from the pad and began a new one, resolved to write something there, no matter how irrelevant it might be, for precious time was ebbing fast. Occasionally during that long and mournful day we paused to look around and exchange looks of silent misery with one another; then our hearts were filled with hatred towards "Frank Smith" whom we had loved once but who now had betrayed us. At length the shades of evening began to fall. It was getting dark; yet not one of us had finished his dreary task. When Henry Martin and another janitor tiptoed into the room to light the lamps, it was the signal of insurrection. With one accord we assembled in a corner of the big lecture-room and conferred together. It was agreed to ask Mr. Smith, humbly but boldly, to have pity upon us by giving at least a single alternate question that might be substituted for one of those already on the board which we had been struggling to answer the livelong day. Snowden Marshall was deputed to be our spokesman. When we realized that Mr. Smith had graciously consented to our plea, a mighty sigh of relief was heaved from all our breasts, and now at last a ray of hope gleamed in every eye. Mr. Smith went to the blackboard and wrote a new question by the side of the old ones that had been staring us in the face; then he turned towards the class and rubbed his hands together, as he had a way of doing. The beatific smile that had never left his face beamed down upon us, and his voice was gentle as if it came from the lips of St. Francis. "Young gentlemen," he began — yet I shall not try to repeat the exact words, though I know my old friend Joe Dunn remembers each syllable and every intonation of that brief speech. The gist of it was that the question which had just been written on the board was one that had been propounded originally by Sir Isaac Newton in the form of an anagram that had to be deciphered first before it was intelligible, and that only one person had succeeded in answering it in Newton's lifetime. That champion was one of the two Bernouilli brothers, James and John, I forget which, both famous mathematicians in their day. Then was the cup of our wretchedness filled to the brim, insult was added to injury, and not one of us deigned to read Mr. Smith's translation of Newton's anagram. We signed our pledges, folded ..our foolscap pages, and piling the papers on the lecture table, marched forth into the outer darkness, without another word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet the sequel of that examination was not as bad as we had feared. Strange to relate, I believe nearly all of us passed, even Joe Dunn who was certainly the most downhearted of that anxious group. After all, Mr. Smith's heart was not made of stone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My good friend Dean Woodbridge, whose wise sayings I am fond of quoting, once pointed out the distinction between what is rational and what is reasonable. I remember his saying that it was like the difference between mind and soul, not a partition so much as a change of accent; for (said be) "when the soul thinks, it is mind; when the mind feels, it is soul." So likewise, he continued, "the rational is rigourous, impersonal and averse to compromise; the reasonable is yielding, personal, and makes compromise a virtue." Now the examination system at the University of Virginia was rational, no matter how absolutely unreasonable it may have been. It was rational inasmuch as it forced the student to strive with all his might and keep himself in trim as the athlete was bound to do who competed in the Olympic Games, and because it certainly accomplished its purpose if that purpose was to sift the chaff from the wheat. Yet it was wholly unreasonable forasmuch as it tossed the chaff aside as more or less worthless and without raison d'être at least from the point of view of the University itself. If such were indeed the purpose of this machinery, it must be admitted it was vastly efficient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This "juggernaut" reached "an all-time high" in the session when Professor Thornton, who was then Dean of the School of Engineering, "flunked" every mother's son in the class in Kinematics and Dynamics. That was long after my day, and when I ventured once to ask Dean Thornton if the story really was true, he parried the question by saying that what he regretted most was being compelled the following year to discard an exceedingly meritorious textbook on the subject (written by Prof. J. G. Macgregor, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh) and substitute in place of it a much inferior book, simply because students were no better than dunces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While I am far from defending the rigidity, not to say ruthlessness, of the examination system as it existed — when I was a student in the University of Virginia; yet I am bound to say that, with all its faults, it was infinitely better in its results than the leniency that is shown in many of our colleges nowadays. Certainly there is sad waste of time and money in some of these institutions where a diploma of graduation has come to mean little more than a union card in the American Federation of Labour. My firm conviction is that nothing would be more salutary in the field of education for pupils and teachers alike than a really drastic means, whatever it may be, of winnowing from the student body all such — often through no fault of their own — as are manifestly out of place and have no business in that environment. The only reason why it is not done is because it would greatly diminish the number of so-called students in attendance, and that is a result that would be nothing short of a calamity in the eyes of trustees, legislators, and alumni! Nevertheless the purge would be beneficial in the highest degree to the delinquents themselves, many of whom would have been rescued in time to be transformed into good and useful citizens in the community. The greatest advantage, however, would be intramural, for then all the powers and resources of the school could be concentrated upon the comparatively few who are not merely capable of higher education but eager and resolute to obtain it. The teachers would be put on their mettle by their pupils, and the end achieved would be to the glory of Almighty God and for the good of the nation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In some quarters it is getting to be the fashion to dispense with examinations altogether. The mere task of having to write a coherent and intelligent essay is in itself a useful exercise which is ample justification for requiring a student to stand a severe written examination. Anybody who has undergone the ordeal knows, if he is truthful about it, that in no other way could he have been made to get such a grasp of the subject as a whole and to comprehend its total significance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hardly anybody now alive is old enough ever to have seen and heard that boisterous old callithump known as a "dyke," which was famous enough once upon a time. The practice is said to have originated at the University of Virginia immediately after the Civil War, and it lasted down to my own day. My recollection is that a description of this barbarous custom, possibly in verse, was published in one of the early volumes of Corks and Curls. Whether or not my memory here is at fault, I do know that "The Big Horn on the Range" is the title of one of the first poems in Arcade Echoes, where it is reliably reported to have been "a mammoth dyking horn five feet and more in height" that spread terror to all "calicoists" whenever it sounded loud and fierce at dead of night. Many students in the late 1860's were old soldiers who had laid down their arms at Appomattox or had been among the remnants of General Johnston's army when it too was forced to surrender soon afterwards in North Carolina. Any one of those battle-scarred veterans would have been lucky indeed if he had been left another suit of clothes besides his ragged old uniform; and if afterwards he went to college, his scant wardrobe, such as it was, hid to do for all occasions, a funeral or a festival, a lecture in the morning or a visit to his sweetheart in the evening. In those days a guy rich enough to have a fancy waistcoat and bold enough to wear it in public was conspicuously "on a dyke," as the saying was; in other words, he was a shining mark and went abroad at his peril, as he might soon find out had he not before been aware of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first "dyke" I ever witnessed took place, not long after I came to college, down on the old "Triangle" at the foot of the Lawn, which was the evening rendezvous of many a lovesick couple in the days before the Lawn was extended as far as Cabell Hill after the fire of 1895. That evening a big reception was being given in Mr. Minor's home to which, I suppose, nearly all the é lite in the neighbourhood had been ceremoniously invited some days earlier. Soon after dark, the guests began to arrive, generally two at a time, a lady and the gentleman who escorted tier. Presently a solitary figure, arrayed in his best apparel, sauntered leisurely down the arcade and turned at last to enter the door thrown wide open to receive him. By this time the gaiety within was audible and visible from the pavement outside, as the festive guests went to and fro across the wide hall between the two big front rooms. Suddenly in the solemn darkness outdoors, the ominous sound of the big tin horn was heard, reverberating far and wide, and instantly a roar of voices ascended from the Lawn like that of the rebel yell in battle. A huge mob of students who had been lying crouched on the ground, silent and invisible, leaped to its feet as if it were a band of savages, each with a lighted torch in his hands which he held aloft. At that moment I happened to be standing in front of Colonel Peters's pavilion directly opposite Mr. Minor's, and to my astonishment I saw and heard it all. It was as if Bedlam had been let loose without a moment's warning. The torches, made of waste rags dipped in kerosene each wrapped and tied around the end of a pole whose other end was grasped in the hands of what appeared to be a dancing dervish, illuminated the darkness with a weird and lurid light. The dervishes themselves were clad in nightshirts or other white linen that had been thrown over their outer garments. In the twinkling of an eye the well-dressed but hapless saunterer above mentioned, who already had one foot on the doorstep, was plucked bodily from the threshold and borne away in triumph amid jeers and shouts of joy. The procession marched the whole length of the Lawn with their captive in the front rank, who by this time was not merely dishevelled almost beyond recognition but even denuded of parts of his outer raiment. Mounting the steps of the rotunda, the motley throng yelled themselves hoarse. demanding a speech, and the poor fellow tried to comply as best he could, thereby hoping, but hoping in vain, to appease his tormentors. If any speech was ever uttered, it was drowned in the tumult. Then the mob rushed down the Lawn again all the way to the "Triangle" where they had started, and quickly separated in two parallel rows about a yard apart extending from one side of the Lawn to the other. The victim, poised at the end of the line not far from where I was standing, was held in position ready to be catapulted headlong into Mr. Minor's front hall the instant the signal was given. By the time he had run the long gauntlet, being urged forward and pushed from behind at every step, he had acquired such prodigious momentum that is was all the poor fellow could do to conic to a halt before crashing into the buttress at the rear wall of Mr. Minor's mansion, a wreck of his former self and a pitiful sight to see. Those rugged old soldiers who had trudged barefooted on the long marches of the Army of Northern Virginia or even their lusty offspring who had known all the trials and tribulations of poverty were rough playfellows at best and had a private and singular notion of full and frolic. A "dyke" was horseplay, meant to be good-natured and expected to be taken as such by all concerned, above all by the "dykee" himself, if that was his proper name, but just the same it was sheer rowdyism without a redeeming feature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last of these obnoxious performances was in the next session (1889-90) when a man named Bondurant, highly and justly esteemed by those who knew him, perhaps a little dandified in demeanour, was in the act of escorting Mary Mallet to a party that was being given one evening in the Chaplain's House in Gildersleeve Wood, unless I am mistaken, for now so many of the old landmarks are obliterated that I cannot always be sure about the location of the old places in and around the University. According to the accepted code, a gentleman who went to a party with a lady on his arm was inviolable and sacrosanct, but on this occasion our hero was really too tempting a prey to be permitted to escape, for he actually had on a swallow-tail coat and his wing collar was adorned by a white muslin butterfly-tie! To be sure, the lady had stepped across the threshold in safety, but Mr. Bondurant was perhaps two paces behind her and not yet quite inside the doorway. He did contrive to follow her, but not without the loss of one of his coattails that was jerked away from behind by unseen hands. Violent words were exchanged and shouts of anger. The gentleman was not afraid of the devil, and he hurled defiance at his persecutors; nay, he even challenged the ringleaders, each in turn and by name if he knew his name, to meet him next day in single combat. Students from all over the college, most of whom had not witnessed the affair or been implicated in it, resented the outrage. Without even knowing Bondurant, some of them espoused his cause and volunteered to fight his battles for him. Next day — to make a long story short — at divers hours and at as many different places, in fact almost everywhere within and without the precincts of the University, perhaps not less than a dozen fist-fights took place, often as not between adversaries who were previously totally unacquainted with each other. The most memorable encounter was a really desperate fight between Snowden Marshall, substituting for Bondurant, and big, burly John P. East who came from the Valley of Virginia. It is doubtful whether either of those two pugilists had ever heard the other's name before that day. The sequel was that after pommelling each other unmercifully and after East had been felled to the ground once if not thrice, he and Snowden Marshall shook hands with mutual admiration. In later years both went to New York to live, and both rose to be distinguished citizens of the metropolis whose lifelong and devoted friendship for each other got to be the talk of the town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, public indignation on this occasion was so outspoken, and the outrage so flagrant, that the hilarious sport of "dyking" simply died a natural death and has never been heard of again from that day to this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The session of 1889-90 was the year too when Martha Bagby, famous Richmond belle, came for a visit to Dr. William C. Dabney's family who lived in the pavilion at the north end of East Lawn that had been Dr. Cabell's residence for so many years. Naturally her advent made a great flutter not only from Dawson's Row to Carr's Hill but in town and county also as far as the good tidings spread, for Martha Bagby was known to be "a gem of purest ray serene," as gay and sparkling as she was beautiful and precious. Her hosts sent out invitations to a big reception to be given in her honour, but as dancing was banned in that austere household, in lieu thereof, an ingenious parlour-game called "post office" was invented by resourceful Martha and her boon companion Susie Minor, for the amusement and delectation of the guests who would comprise all the Beauty and all the Chivalry of Albemarle. Many days of eager and industrious preparation were spent in advance by those two confederates, ever more and more confident of the brilliant success that would reward their efforts. In token of great favour, Miss Martha sent for me and let me into the secret; and there on the spot I was nominated and appointed to the office of "postmaster," without either giving consent or daring to demur, although at the moment I was aware neither of the duties nor of the privileges of that conspicuous rank. Meanwhile, with the aid of several other talented individuals and henchmen, the two young ladies set to work to compose all manner of humourous verses, Limericks, and lampoons which were supposed to be letters that had come through the post office addressed to all and sundry of the assembled guests, one letter for each lady and one also for the swain who accompanied her. At last the notes were all cleverly concocted, neatly written, and duly placed in their proper envelopes; and each was so facetious and appropriate that it was hard to say one was better than another where all were pronounced to be palpable hits as good as could be. Meanwhile the rumour spread that this was to be a party the like of which for mirth and innocent merriment had not been seen since the brave days when Lafayette had been fêted in Charlottesville, as indeed proved to be the literal and unvarnished truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The booth for the post office was located in a little alcove at the rear of the big drawing room near the foot of a winding stairway that led to the upper storey of Dr. Dabney's home, and accordingly, on the appointed evening and at a concerted signal, all the guests from far and near were assembled in front of it eager to enjoy the frolic. Here I ought to pause to say that the postmaster whom I had been chosen to impersonate was supposed to be a low sort of fellow who did not scruple to read all the documents, private and personal, that passed through his hands, nor to reveal the contents. On this occasion it was his infamous business to read these letters aloud, sotto voce but quite audibly, without omitting to call the names of the ladies and gentlemen present to whom they were addressed. One example must suffice as being more or less typical of all. This note, written in a Spencerian hand by one of the scribes employed by the conspirators, was addressed to Miss Natalie Venable and read as follows: There was a young man named "Drum" Fletcher, Who said, This girl, I will catch her! But the 'Melican man, Though he does all he can, Can't beat the Chinee, you betcha! The foreigner here alluded to was Jim Woods of Pantops, a Master of Arts of the University, who was going to China as a medical missionary and had some hopes of taking Miss Natalie with him on that expedition; and indeed it was not altogether a bad idea, considering all the mischief she was doing here at home. "Drum" Fletcher was John Drummond Fletcher or "Little Flick," as we used to call him because he was not much taller than the top of Miss Natalie's shoulder. He was a dandy fellow who came from Accomac or somewhere on the Eastern Shore, and at that time he was Jim Woods's deadly rival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not remember the wording of the note that was sent to Raleigh Minor, but I know it was not in verse but in sober prose and made him furious. At that period of his existence he seldom missed spending an evening downtown on Park Street in speechless adoration of Martha Southall. The message he got purported to be from her dignified father and stated succinctly that owing to the steadily increasing throng of visitors that came to see his daughters, he had been put to considerable expense for keeping the front gate of the yard in repair, just recently having had to get new hinges and a new latch also. Consequently, he begged to notify all concerned, and Raleigh in particular, that he had installed a turnstile with a nickel-in-the-slot machine which he hoped would be found to pay for itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now as all these revelations proceeded to be divulged without the slightest regard for the laws of civilized society, the temper of the company, instead of getting gayer and gayer, got glummer and glummer. Every new victim waited with mingled terror and indignation for his or her turn to come, and everybody glared at the postmaster with hatred, as if lynching would be too good for him if he got what he deserved. Under the circumstances I was beginning to feel a good deal of concern, and I must confess I stumbled over my lines. The ticking of the grandfather's clock at the foot of the stairs was plainly louder and louder; but the greatest uneasiness of all came at the moment when, happening to glance behind me, I was just in time to perceive Martha Bagby, the cynosure of every eye, disappearing upstairs around the curve in the bannisters. When the game started, she had been sitting on the bottom step, keen with excitement, and prepared to prompt me if I made a mistake. Heaven knows I was in need of tier help, though I never could catch tier whisper, it was confused with so much giggling. Yet withal she was a lady of singular discernment, and when she sensed the way the wind was blowing or even when she saw that there was not any breeze at all and the atmosphere was stagnant as it was that evening, she could take to her heels as fist as any minx and leave me to perish all alone in my guilt. The simple fact was that amid the deathlike silence that greeted each letter as it was read aloud, Miss Martha had deliberately mounted one step higher on the winding stairway until at last she vanished out of sight. Then whatever courage I had left ebbed out as gas oozes from a pricked balloon. A heap of unread letters was still before me when, in a quavering voice, I announced that the game was ended; a minute later I was standing with my back to the fire in the little cloakroom that was ordinarily Dr. Dabney's office. It was full of indignant gentlemen who would have naught to do with me. Raleigh Minor curled his lip, "Little Flick" averted his face, and nobody ever would have dreamed that Jim Woods over there in the corner, with that angry scowl on his countenance, was about to carry the blessed gospel to the benighted heathen! Luckily, I did not suffer bodily injury, much as I longed to inflict it on everybody present, but it was many days before I got absolution and forgiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It bid fair to be a dismal ending of what had started out to be a gay party, but then refreshments were served, mighty good refreshments that were efficacious for dispersing spleen and all uncharitableness. Martha Bagby descended once more into the arena, and when she told the guests goodnight, everybody said how sweet and charming she was, and nobody was to blame but me. Then she set to work to heal my wounds and told me I had been simply wonderful, while everybody else was stupid, and of course I believed her, for under the soft touch of woman man is as putty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Everybody knows of course that the head and arms are both missing from the figure of the Winged Victory (Niké de Samothrace) in the Louvre, and therefore it is no wonder that the student from the University of Texas, seeing this beautiful statue for the first time, and being told its name, exclaimed, "God help Defeat!" When Martha Bagby told me I had covered myself with glory in the game of "post office," I wondered how it must feel to be covered with shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was in the spring of 1889 , when I still lived on Monroe Hill, that Murray Mason McGuire ( 1872-1945), younger son of my revered teacher, came to the University with a baseball team from Richmond and tarried there several days as my guest. Young as he was at that time, his fame as a pitcher and wizard for "down-shoots" and puzzling curves had gone abroad already, and we did not scruple to persuade him to leave his father's school and matriculate as a student in the University before the end of the session so as to be eligible to play on our baseball team in the season that was just then beginning. That was the start of his celebrated career, although the next session (1889-90) was really his first year in college. The DKE's were jubilant, none more than myself, over having prevailed on Murray McGuire to cast in his lot with our tribe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before the end of the calendar year of 1889, the first number of the weekly newspaper called College Topics made its appearance under the joint editorship of Hunt Chipley and Legh Page; and by the end of the session (1889-90) Breckinridge Robertson had been appointed editor-in-chief with "Kit" (Adam C.) Carson as assistant editor. Breckinridge was now forging ahead in prominence and was soon to become, especially during the next three or four years, one of the foremost students in college. In 1893 he and Carson were sworn political foes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Certainly in the 1880's and all during the time I was in college, hardly any honour to be obtained by a student was considered to be greater than an invitation to join the famous society of Eli Banana, as indeed I daresay is still the case. Eli Banana was not so much an order of merit as it was a badge of distinction, coveted by all but obtained by few. The Eli's were known to be jolly good fellows who, whether or not they had come to college on purpose to have a good time, certainly seemed to all the rest of us to have achieved that purpose. Yet among them there was a goodly sprinkling of members such, for instance, as Hampden Bagby and Archer Anderson, who were not just dashing leaders of society, perhaps addicted also to going on sprees, but who ranked at the top in all intellectual pursuits and might even be models of sobriety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Allen Potts, noted athlete, destined to marry Gertrude Rives, was an Eli who, as far as I know, never touched a drop of liquor all the time he was in college. Yet on the festive day of initiation of new recruits, when the big drum sounded loud and long and the Eli's paraded up and down the Lawn, and indeed from one end of the campus to the other, singing and carousing from twilight to dawn, it was Allen Potts who led the procession and was to all appearance the noisiest and drunkest of them all. On one such night a little before dawn, they arrived in front of my room on Monroe Hill, a picked gang of which Allen Potts was the ringleader. Solitary and alone inside, I trembled, not in my boots, but in my bed,,. as I heard the shouting and the shooting just under the lintel of the door; hoping, yet scarcely expecting, that the latch might prove strong enough to hold fast against the impending assault. Locks and bolts were as naught to Allen Potts when he was on a "dry drunk," and to him it was the simplest process on earth to hurl a shower of beer bottles against the door itself until he broke a panel and could pull it loose. If his sportive humour had ended there, I might have been thankful enough, but when the empty bottles came hurtling through the air into the room itself and burst in fragments all about my head, it was indeed a critical moment, un mauvais quart d'heure. A clothes-bag slung over his shoulder was laden with missiles, an entire panel had been ripped from the door, and there I lay in bed completely at the mercy of this lunatic. All I could do was to pull the mattress up over my head and crouch under it until the ammunition was spent and the bombardment ceased. It mattered little how angry and indignant I may have been afterwards. Allen Potts was a good fellow, but not a good playfellow. I liked him and shunned him, just as one might feel towards a wildcat that was disposed to be friendly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was during the earlier half of this same session, not long before Christmas I believe, that the TILKA society was founded as a kind of rival of Eli Banana, perhaps originally intended to be on a little higher plane. The charter members included the following prominent students in college: Hunt Chipley, Joe Dunn, E. E. Garrett, Edwin Gibson, J. Leighton Hubard, W. H. Thompson Loyall, Joseph McElroy, Raleigh Minor, Sidney M. Neely, Sherrard Tabb, Robert Tunstall Taylor, Walter H. Taylor, A. Lee Thurman, Robert F. Williams, and James B. Woods, perhaps also one or two others. The first "goats" to be initiated were Tom Pinckney and myself. The cherub-face of Thomas Pinckney, of Charleston, South Carolina, rises before me now as I write his name and remember how I loved him once. He had a cherub's face indeed, dear and sweet to behold; yet were it kindled with anger, verity I believe Richard the Lionhearted might have quailed before it! Torn Pinckney was short in stature, a little fellow, thorough-bred as an Arabian pony, gentle as a dove, and stout as steel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That session Raleigh Minor was elected final president of the Jefferson Literary Society, without opposition, and the DKE's were all elated. As alumni orator at The Finals, Mr. Lawrence Marye delivered a long and scholarly address, which was dull and tedious to me and perhaps to others also, for on such occasions the audience was easily bored and not always courteous. Among the graduates who were distinguished that year were: Joseph B. Dunn, Halstead S. Hedges, James B. Lovett, and Walter F. Taylor, each of whom got the degree of M. A.; Otto G. Ramsay, William M. Randolph, and James B. Woods, all three of whom graduated in Medicine; and P. H. C. Cabell, Charles F. Fenner, John D. Fletcher, Felix H. Levy, H. Dent Minor, John B. Minor, Jr., Raleigh C. Minor, Jefferson Davis Norris, Edward W. Robertson, Minton W. Talbot, and John Wilson, who all got their hard-earned B. L.'s. The above list from memory is far from complete, but I hope it is accurate as far as it goes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nobody could have been more inconspicuous than I was at The Finals of 1890, and what I remember best about it now, indeed almost the only thing I can recall, is that it was the time when Annie Doggett came from Richmond and was the guest of Nannie Minor. Now she was a mighty pretty maiden, and, consequently, I took her around the nine-mile circuit as many times as I could persuade the keeper of the livery stable to let me have a horse and buggy for the purpose; yet it was all in vain!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another chap, whom I cannot forgive to this day, took her around the twelve-mile circuit and cut me out entirely! She had too many strings to her bow or too many beaux on her string — you see even now I am tongue-tied and cannot tell exactly how it was. Cardinal Wolsey charged Cromwell to fling away ambition; so when Mr. A. D. Payne sent me the livery-stable bill, I flung it out the window, and no doubt lost pretty Annie Doggett at the same time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Truth to say, at the end of the session of 1889-90, not everything was as I might have wished and hoped; yet, notwithstanding, my second session in the University of Virginia had been a good and joyful year for me, the best of all that had gone before, annus mirabilis . That year I had peeped into the realm of science, my lips had touched the fruit of a new tree of knowledge, and I had found that it was sweet to my taste. Now the session had ended, the campus was deserted, and Annie Doggett had returned in triumph to Richmond. I stood alone on the Lawn, it was night, and the stars were overhead, I asked myself the question, Dic cur hic? and could get no answer. Where lies the land to which the ship would go? Far, far ahead is all her seaman know</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Incerti quo fata ferant. Virgil, Aeneid, III 7.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEANWHILE DURING MY LONG ABSENCE FROM HOME which had now lasted two years, my father's health never robust even in early life, was beginning to fade more and more, insomuch that along about 1890 he felt obliged to relinquish his somewhat provisional and perhaps not entirely congenial task as editor of the Central Presbyterian. That was a weekly newspaper of considerable renown in those days and a leading organ of religious opinion particularly throughout the South. He had undertaken it in the beginning chiefly as a means of livelihood, and now it had become too onerous to be borne longer. So it came to pass that ere I had finished my second session in the University of Virginia, our home in Richmond was abandoned, and my father, mother, and sister moved to Norfolk to live, where they had many family ties. Thereafter, I used to go to see them in Norfolk fairly regularly from time to time certainly as often as twice every year as long as my fattier lived and indeed until I myself got married in 1899 and had ceased to live in Virginia. His end came in September, 1897, a few months before he would have reached the allotted span of three-score years and ten. My mother and sister continued to live in Norfolk many years afterwards, until, alas, each of them died also, first my mother in 1919 and then Evelyn in 1924. The three graves lie side by side in Elmwood Cemetery in old Norfolk, and now of all that once happy household, for more than a score of years I have been the sole survivor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My father's retirement from active employment entailed a serious reduction of his income, and I foresaw that it might no longer be possible for him to afford to send me to college in order to finish my education. True, my expenses were comparatively small, for as a native of the state of Virginia I was exempt from tuition as long as I continued in the academic department of the University; besides, the Thompson Brown Scholarship contributed nearly as much as a hundred dollars towards defraying the actual cost of living, which was mighty little then as compared with now. * Nevertheless, I was resolved that I must not be a burden on my father any longer, even if I had to go to work to earn my living.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While I was at a loss what to do under the circumstances, luckily enough, I was offered a post as teacher in my old school in Richmond at a salary of something like $700, as well as I recollect, together with my board and lodgings in Mr. McGuire's home. My father advised me to take it, not so much for the sake of relieving him at a time when he needed relief, as because he believed a year spent in reaching would be a useful experience and would at the same time afford leisure for making up my mind as to what was to be my real vocation in life. While I certainly did not have the slightest inclination to study either Law or Medicine, perhaps I cherished a vague and silly notion of being a writer and making a living by my pen. Divining my secret ambition, my father ridiculed and discouraged it from the outset. "A writer," said he, "must have something to write about. Literature simply [*] Even as late as 1898, when I was a fellow of the Johns Hopkins University, it cost only ten dollars a month to rent a large and comfortable furnished room at 416 Hoffman Street in Baltimore, fuel and all included (everything except kerosene oil for a student's lamp and towels for the washstand); and I got three meals a day, the best I ever had in my life, at Mrs. Snowden's fashionable boardinghouse near by on Eutaw Street, for which I paid $3.50 a week. for its own sake is a poor business. A man who is just a writer, and nothing more, is close to being a trifler." The upshot of it all was that for the present at least I was glad to take advantage of the opportunity that had conic to me, and accordingly, early in the autumn of 1890, I went to Richmond to enter upon my new employment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The venerable, if somewhat decayed, old mansion on Gamble's Hill where I had gone to school had been pulled down about that time, and, . consequently, Mr. McGuire had had to find new quarters for his establishment. The school now was located farther uptown on the second floor of a spacious new building that had been erected at the northeast corner of Main and Belvidere streets. The ground floor was taken up by a row of shops fronting on Main Street. The residence of the schoolmaster's family was close by in a two-storey house on Belvidere Street, a thoroughfare which skirted Monroe Park and was a right of way of 'the R. F. &amp; P. Railroad from Elba Station near what was then the end of Broad Street and led through the tunnel beneath Gamble's Hill to the downtown terminus on Byrd Street by the river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the days when I was a student at Richmond College, Patrick Henry Cary Cabell, originally from Nelson County if I am not mistaken, had been Mr. McGuire's right-hand man and chief assistant. Having just graduated in Law at the University, he was back again at his old job; only not quite on the same footing as before, for while he lived in Mr. McGuire's home and continued to teach the higher classes in Latin and perhaps a class in Greek also, his main occupation was the practice of his new profession, and so he spent the greater part of each day in his office downtown. In fact, I saw little of him that whole session, yet enough to perceive that he was a man of unusual ability, fond of society and possibly inclined to be a little too convivial for his own good. In the upper school that year besides myself, the other new teacher was Charles Massie, who I believe was a son of Mr. Rodes Massie, a lovable fellow, very modest, yet diligent and capable withal. He and I got to be very friendly without being intimate, although it was perhaps mainly my fault that I saw little of him outside school hours. On the other hand, he and Cabell, whose ages were quite far apart, were thrown together to a certain extent mainly because they shared the same bedroom on the ground floor of Mr. McGuire's house; but while Massie was usually in bed by nine o'clock, as likely as not Cabell might not come home at all or perhaps not until long after midnight. However, Cabell and Massie were not exactly bedfellows inasmuch as their couches were side by side with a little passageway between, but no two individuals were farther apart in disposition and manner of life. Cabell had been an Eli Banana at the University and was something of a society leader in Richmond; whereas, Massie never attended the University and seldom went anywhere far from home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it happened, quite early in the session, that late one night long after Massie was in bed and fast asleep, Cabell came home in a hilarious mood and roused Massie by singing one of the Eli songs at the top of his lungs. What it lacked in tune was made up in volume. When Massie tried to reason with him and implored him not to disturb the whole household, Cabell consented to keep quiet on condition that Massie, lying in bed opposite the couch on which he was sitting, would hold a glass mug for him while he poured out one last dram from the nearly empty demijohn that he had brought home with him. Massie stretched out his arm and took the glass, while Cabell, tilting the bottle over his shoulder, tried to pour the liquor into it; but his hand was unsteady, and some of the contents spilled on the floor. Now at this critical moment when they were thus engaged, a faint sound was heard in the hall outside; an interloper was fumbling in the dark for the latch on the door. They paused to listen, and now they could recognise Mr. McGuire's voice, as if he were alone and talking to himself in some perplexity. The truth was that the "boss," roused from sleep, had got out of bed in his nightshirt and tiptoed downstairs to find out what was going on in the house at that time of night. What perplexed him, however, was that ere he reached the lowest step, the commotion that had been so loud and boisterous a moment before had suddenly died out completely; all was still and silent as the grave. Now by this time poor Massie was in a cold sweat fearing that he was about to be caught in flagrante delicto, and knowing that thereafter his reputation for sobriety would be irretrievably lost. Not daring to budge from his telltale posture, but nodding desperately and frantically at Cabell, he pointed to the door with the hand that was free; then quick as a flash reached for the electric switch by the side of the bed just inside the door. The door opened gently, Mr. McGuire stood on the sill in the darkness, and Massie could almost hear his own heart beating. Would "the boss" turn on the light and reveal Cabell and him in all their iniquity? The suspense was fearful; it seemed to Massie it would never end. Yet a few seconds later, the door was shut as softly as it had been opened, and Mr. McGuire's footsteps were heard as he slowly ascended the stairs. With a sigh of relief, Massie lighted the lamp again and set the half-filled glass tumbler down on the floor. At that same moment the demijohn slid of its own accord from Cabell's shoulder and rested on the floor also, with Cabell's hand still clutching it by the handle. Then, without another word, Cabell himself sank back on the bed and fell into the arms of Morpheus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Massie told me the story at recess next day, he was haggard still, for he declared he never got another wink of sleep that whole night long. Mr. McGuire never alluded to the midnight disturbance, and the whole household maintained a discreet silence, although I believe Cabell kept Massie on tenterhooks by threatening to make a clean breast of it. Yet everybody knew that Massie was as innocent as a lamb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the time when I was a lad not more than twelve years old, I had known all the members of the McGuire household more or less familiarly, some indeed intimately, and was much attached to them. Once for a whole fortnight or longer I had sojourned under the roof of the old house on Gamble's Hill while my mother and father were absent from Richmond on a long visit in New York. I was always particularly fond of Mrs. McGuire, her husband's second wife, who, having no children of her own, had a motherly tenderness that endeared her to little boys and easily accounted for the great influence she had over them as mistress of the lower school. Indeed, it was said that this estimable lady, who before her marriage was Miss Rose Morris, was as competent and highly qualified for her task as "the boss" was himself as supreme ruler.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clara McGuire, her father's only daughter, was a strikingly handsome girl, as I remember her, dignified and aloof, who regarded Massie and me with polite and unfeigned indifference. In some strange way the picture of Lucinda Roanoke in Anthony Trollope's The Eustace Diamonds rises before me as I try to recall Clara McGuire's appearance and manner; yet I do not believe there was any resemblance. She was plainly a great favourite of her grandmother who lived in the house also. That venerable and accomplished old lady was the widow of Rev. John Peyton McGuire who had been the principal of the Episcopal High School when the Yankees occupied Alexandria at the outbreak of the Civil War, and although I did not know it at the time, she was the author of The Diary of a Refugee, the graphic narrative of one who had herself been a participant and eyewitness of the tribulations of the people of Virginia during that desperate struggle. The opportunity of conversing with her was a privilege which I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated whenever it was vouchsafed. Another inmate of the household was a red-headed young woman who I believe was Mrs. McGuire's niece named Susie Morris and who was her aunt's sole and faithful assistant in the conduct of the school for little boys. Massie soon ingratiated himself with every member of the family and was a great favourite. Cabell may have been on hand for breakfast, but I think he got his other meals downtown. Murray McGuire was absent that year at the University, and his elder brother John Peyton McGuire, Jr., who afterwards succeeded his father, was away from home also. Robert and Garnett Nelson, two sons of the Reverend Dr. Kinloch Nelson of the Episcopal Theological Seminary, and nephews of Mr. McGuire, were both diligent and conscientious schoolboys who lived in the house and to whom I soon became much attached, especially afterwards when they went to the University and were my clubmates in the DKE fraternity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Domestically speaking, the McGuire ménage was pretty much left to run itself with the help of a couple of rather inefficient and slovenly servants. Indeed nobody seemed to give a thought to housekeeping, least of all Mrs. McGuire herself who certainly had all she could do to teach school from morning to night. Clara may have attended to it after a fashion, and perhaps it was her job; but then, although I did not know it at the time, she was engaged to be married, and was indeed actually wedded to a young clergyman ere the end of the session. Altogether the various individuals that made up the household were a group of earnest and worthy folks, young and old alike, each intent on the school in one way or another, morning, afternoon, and night; it was a solid phalanx, orderly and well-drilled, whose slogan might have been like that of the three musketeers, "All for one, and one for all!" On Sunday everybody with one accord, save only Cabell and me, attended St. James Church whose beloved rector was the Reverend Dr. Joshua Peterkin; in fact, not on Sunday only but on all other days as well, it might be said with truth, not even the vaunted crew of H.M.S. Pinafore were ever more "attentive to their duty" and more bent on doing their appointed tasks than Mr. McGuire and all his satellites and dependents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it is not without a certain sense of shame that I feel bound to say that I cannot include myself in this goodly company, for honourable as I might have been in some respects, it certainly cannot be said that I was the slave of duty. On the contrary, at the very outset of the session, I drew the line and politely but firmly declined to stay on the job in the afternoon and be "kept in" along with the delinquents who were penalized by having to write columns after school was dismissed. I had served my time at that occupation when I was a schoolboy myself, and now when I had become a man, I was resolved, in this one instance at least, to do as St. Paul said and "put away childish things." In a word, I left this irksome and disagreeable task to be divided between Massie and Mr. McGuire, who were both too good-natured and yielding to offer any resistance. Without condoning my conduct, I contrived afterwards to find some justification for it. The fact is that during that entire session neither Massie nor I received more than about fifty dollars at the outside towards the payment of our salaries, although ultimately of course every cent was paid that was due. Mr. McGuire was the justest and most upright of men, but he was slipshod in business, so much so indeed that I doubt whether he ever collected thousands of dollars that were owed him for tuition. Lacking funds of my own, and needing the wherewithal to pay current expenses, I was reduced to borrowing from Tom, Dick, and Harry, and really led a precarious kind of existence all that year. When Nannie Minor came to town and stayed with Annie Doggett, it was incumbent on me to take them to the theatre occasionally, only I had no credit at either the box office or the florist shop. Massie was in somewhat the same predicament, but his tastes were not expensive, and besides the poor fellow was so tired out after staying in school all day from nine o'clock in the morning sometimes until five o'clock in the afternoon, that by going to bed soon after supper, he saved what little money he had. But no matter how I tried to exculpate my conduct that year with respect to Massie, to this day my conscience is not easy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In my spare time I had laid out quite an elaborate programme of Selbst-studium, as it is called in German, which included, besides trying to get a little better acquainted with scientific subjects, a pretty ambitious course of reading in English literature. It was inconvenient not to have a room all to myself, and as that was not feasible in Mr. McGuire's rather crowded house, I rented a comfortable apartment just around the corner on Main Street in one of a row of frame houses which was the dwelling of Miss McRae and her sister, who proved to be kind and considerate landladies in every way. As a rule, I was in the habit of taking at least one meal a day somewhere downtown, but I daresay I must have had breakfast and lunch pretty regularly at the school table, though now after the lapse of all the intervening years my recollection is a little hazy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the recent innovations in the school was a special new class in elementary science, chiefly chemistry in the mildest possible form. Having sat at the feet of "Frank Smith" and "Jack Mallet" in the University of Virginia, and being indeed, so to speak, fresh from those fountains of wisdom, I was commissioned to have charge of the new enterprise. A considerable outlay of money had been expended in the way of buying an assortment of apparatus consisting mainly of test tubes, flasks, funnels, retorts, Bunsen burners, rubber tubing, corks, files, filter paper, sulphuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acid, etc.; and a separate room equipped with the necessary plumbing fixtures, together with a cabinet and demonstration table, was set apart for the purpose of instruction. The textbook I selected was Remsen's Briefer Course , as I believe it was called (but I am not certain), which had a companion volume or laboratory manual designed for the use of uninitiated teachers such as I certainly was at that time. The directions were clear and minute down to the smallest detail of manipulation, and I entered on the task with eager enthusiasm, even hoping I might emulate Dr. Mallet in some slight degree. At the end of the first fortnight I had gained so much confidence that I was prepared to generate hydrogen gas and collect it in a flask in full view of the class of boys looking on in breathless expectation. Now as everybody knows, this elementary substance is wholly invisible and not distinguishable to the eye from ordinary air, but, luckily or unluckily, it is highly inflammable as ordinary air is not. All I had to do in order to demonstrate that I really did have a flask filled with honest-to-goodness hydrogen gas was to apply a lighted match to it and let the little flame at the end of the glass tube speak for itself. I proceeded to do so in accordance with the written instructions; only, I am sorry to say, I did not take the precaution to make sure that all the oxygen or air originally in the flask had been duly expelled. Nature has her own way of jogging the memory, and the consequence was, a terrific explosion ensued! Glad in deed I was that my nose that day was not so monstrous as that of the mysterious "stranger" in Slawkenbergius's Tale in Tristram Shandy, for the cork in the bottle flew past that obstacle, just grazing it, and lodged deep in the plaster of the ceiling. For a moment the whole building swayed to and fro as if a gentle earthquake had passed around the corner of Main and Belvidere streets, and the next instant Mr. McGuire in quite a flutter hurried from his room to mine to find out if any of us were still alive. It was hard at first to estimate the extent of the damage and the number of casualties, for a cloud of vapour enveloped the room, and, as they say at sea, "the visibility was low." Presently, however, the smoke cleared away and the boys crawled from under the benches and began in a dazed way to collect the debris of broken glass that was scattered all over the floor. With the utmost composure I tried to explain to the Principal that the experiment had really succeeded beyond my expectations; for while at first I had only intended to show the spectators that hydrogen could indeed be ignited, now everybody present, and indeed Mr. McGuire himself and others who were not at the scene at the time, had a practical and convincing proof of what could happen when hydrogen and oxygen met under suitable conditions and were locked in a tight embrace. However, that was the only demonstration of hydrogen gas per se that my class in elementary chemistry ever got that year, and from that day to this, whenever I have sought to follow in Dr. Mallet's footsteps, I have been conscious of treading on dangerous ground and have learned to be duly circumspect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was on that occasion that I first became aware of the presence in class of a pupil by the name of Harry Langhorne, as droll and delightful a chap as I ever knew. He was a younger brother of that glorious Irene then just about to blossom forth in all her girlhood beauty, Harry had been one of the first to emerge from under the benches, and now he was wiping the acid off the table with a towel. Not having lost my wits entirely, I warned him to be careful not to get that stuff on his fingers, and to be sure to rinse the towel under the hydrant. As he hung the cloth on the rack, he looked at me out of the corner of his eye and drawled in his inimitable way, "It was a pretty close call you had from that stopper! Would you like me to get on a chair and dig it out from the ceiling, so you can have it for a keepsake?" I looked him straight in the eye. "You are right, Harry," I said, "it was a close call, but I am sure neither you nor I would ever mind being a martyr for the sake of science." "No," he replied, after a moment's silence, "I wouldn't mind being a martyr of science, but I believe I would mind busting on an experiment!" Then he dodged the lick I aimed at him, but from that day we were fast friends. Measured by years, Harry Langhorne's life was a short one, but as long as he lived he bubbled over with wit and humour, as kindly and homely as the mirth of Will Rogers, and I believe he lives still in the memory of all who ever came in contact with him, just as he lives now in my own recollections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among the schoolboys I had many other favourites besides Harry Langhorne and the two Nelson boys, none of them very far below my own age; but the only names I can recall at the moment are those of Jonathan Bryan, Gessner Harrison, Cotesworth Pinckney, "Fat-eye" Powers, Morgan Robinson, Carter Wormeley, and little Jack Page, the merriest of them all, who is now the farnous Dr. John Randolph Page of New York City, and, as far as I know, the sole survivor of all that group of jolly playmates so overflowing with life when I used to hobnob with them five-and-fifty years ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What gave me most pleasure of all was that Raleigh Minor spent that year 1890-91 in Richmond also, for he began to practise law there in partnership with Edwin B. Thomasson, an Englishman by birth who in his college days had been an ardent beau of Mary Southall. While the legal ability of that short-lived firm was conspicuous enough, clients were only too conspicuous by their absence, and the office was a happy loafing place for me and others of the same kind who were not dependent on patronage and were without a cent in the world. Scarcely a day ever went by all winter long without my meeting Raleigh either downtown in his dolce far niente workshop or uptown in my own sequestered cloister. Many an evening we had supper together in some shabby little restaurant or other, where each of us devoured a pile of hot waffles plastered over with butter and molasses and drank a bottle of beer to wash it down; for we never pretended to be epicures, and appeasement of hunger was an end in itself. No doubt those Gargantuan meals sowed the seed of the woeful dyspepsia that plagued my life until in the fulness of time at last I got married and by God's mercy was blessed with a wife who, besides all her other charms and accomplishments, had the art also of making waffles that were at once the best in the world and the least deleterious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After supper, as likely as not, Raleigh would accompany me to my lodgings, and there, having found a good book, we would take turns in reading aloud with long intermissions for criticism and discussion, until the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to midnight. Then Raleigh would get up to go home, or sometimes I prevailed upon him to share my double bed and tarry until morning. In the course of the long winter I know we read nearly all the plays of Shakespeare and many other masterpieces of the great English writers, mainly poetry or fiction, commenting on them as we went along with much show of discernment as befitted two young gentlemen just out of college.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the spring of 1891, the great actor Joe Jefferson came to town for a short engagement at the Richmond Theatre, and for weeks in advance everybody had been looking forward to this big event. The Rivals was the play of all others in his répertoire that Raleigh and I longed to see, but the price of admission. was high for those days, and alas! both our purses were empty, as was generally the case. I am afraid, by that time our credit in Richmond was none too good either. At any rate, we had a meeting expressly for the purpose of considering what was best to be done under the circumstances. It was voted without a dissenting voice, yet not . without much reluctance, that there was really but one thing to do, and that was to stay at home that evening and read The Rivals aloud to each other. In my room where we sat down together to carry out this resolution, each with a copy of the play open in his hands before him, we were too much off the beaten track to hear the carriages roll past on their way to the theatre; yet incredulous as it may be, the simple truth is that my friend and I had a good time all by ourselves that evening. You see there were Romans who lived as late as "the gay nineties."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All during that pleasant nine months I spent in Richmond amid the old associations of my boyhood, Raleigh Minor was a friend in need and a tower of strength; but the chief delight and best solace of all was a sweetheart who lived not far from Gamble's Hill and whom I used to see, rain or shine, as often as was permitted. "Her bright smile haunts me still" just as if I saw her now once more in all her simple charm and grace, "too dear for my possessing!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a year of growth for me in many ways, and I marvel at the amount of solid and useful reading I accomplished in that period. I have mentioned already that my room at Miss McRae's was just around the corner from the schoolhouse. As I passed the door of the grocery on my way thither one cold, winter day, a sharp pain suddenly clutched me by the throat and I thought to myself, "This is tonsilitis, this is, in its most virulent form." Perhaps I was in for a siege and in that case it would be just as well to lay in a stock of provisions; so I entered the shop and bought a hunk of cheese, a box of crackers, and a bag of oranges and then hurried home to my snug and comfortable apartment. It took less than a minute to get into my wrapper and slippers and be seated in front of the cheerful fire that blazed on the hearth. A little tired and out of, breath, anxious too about that sore throat, I was yet not at all low-spirited. The bag of oranges was on the table beside my chair, and I took one and began to suck the juice. Instantly my teeth clamped shut as if they were being held in a vise and a sharp pain darted through my head. However, the clamp was gradually released, and the pang was gone; so I put the orange to my lips again. "Ouch!" I yelled and dropped the orange on the floor. The landlady came running upstairs, and no sooner had she entered the room and taken one look at me than she clasped her hands and ejaculated, "Gracious goodness! you are all swelled out with the mumps! "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so I was; it was ignominious but true. I knew I. would certainly be quarantined for a week at least. 'Luckily, however, good Miss McRae could bring me my meals and agreed to do so on the spot; and mighty good meals they turned out to be, cooked by her own hands and served just. as daintily as if they had been meant for the Prince of Wales. Telephones had not then been invented, but I despatched notes all over town, first of all to Mr. McGuire, then to dear Sallie Randolph, and to Raleigh Minor, indeed to everybody of high or low degree in the town of Richmond who might be expected to sympathize with me in my stricken and benighted condition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now it so happened that the day before I came down with the mumps, namely, February 10, 1891 (for that is the date inscribed in a book lying open here on the desk before me), I had been downtown browsing about in West &amp; Johnston's Bookshop on Main Street and had come home that evening with a three-volume edition of Carlyle's French Revolution, published in London by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall and bound in red cloth, an acquisition that has been one of the treasures of my modest library ever since. I might have fancied that I had travelled much "in the realms of gold" before; yet up to that time I had never read a line of the voluminous writings of Thomas Carlyle. Now when I was shut up in my room with the mumps was the time to begin The French Revolution. I took my seat in front of the fire and opened the first volume, nor did I ever close it again that whole day until long past midnight, only pausing now and then to snatch a morsel of food. That wonderful book absorbed me as completely as if I had been transported to another planet. The story itself was a thrilling one from start to finish, from Louis Bien-aimé, who lay on his deathbed, to that young artillery officer named Buonaparte who fired "a whiff of grapeshot" at the mob and put an end to the Reign of Terror; and the way it was told and unfolded before my eyes, the epic poetry of each chapter, held me spellbound. Carlyle's imagination and power of description were enhanced rather than impeded by the strange, uncouth phraseology that, in spite of its singular "nodosities and angularities," quite fascinated me. At times the language soared to heights of eloquence unmatched in English prose. Humour was mixed with pathos in such just proportion, that as I continued to read one episode after another, it was as though I were being borne along by a current as powerful and irresistible as it was enchanting and intoxicating. All the motley throng of actors in that epoch-making drama came to life again and passed before my eyes just as they had moved and had their being here on earth a century before: Riquetti Mirabeau, "with black Samson locks under the slouch hat," his face all pitted with smallpox; "Scipio Americanus" LaFayette, renowned hero of two worlds; Anacharsis Klootz, with "the human species at his heels"; Danton, "king of the market place," andace et toujours audace; citoyen Marat and nemesis in the guise of Charlotte Corday; Robespierre, "the sea-green incorruptible"; with a host of other unforgettables, nearly all of whom, sooner or later, ran afoul of Dr. Guillotin's newly invented machine!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O evening sun of July," that memorable midsummer day in 1789 when the Bastille fell; and that other evening early in October when the Oeil-de-Bauf rallied round Marie Antoinette, "fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts," and the band struck up, O Richard, O mon Roi, l'univers t'abandonne! — shall I ever live to forget that blissful interval in the days of my youth when, confined indoors by the mumps, I sat by the fire all day long and read such passages as those in Carlyle's French Revolution?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may not have been history "according to Hoyle" or according to Clio, sternest of all the muses; yet what other artist has ever painted such vivid historical canvasses as are to be found in the writings of Thomas Carlyle? I could not rest satisfied until I had purchased the whole of his works, some forty volumes or more, all in the same uniform edition bound in red cloth, and there the volumes are now all on one long shelf of my bookcase. Old notebooks which I kept once are filled with long excerpts copied from those precious volumes, and I run across them still, and take delight in them still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet now I shun those books which once I perused so eagerly. Carlyle was surely a great magician with words and was a prophet once, but now his style grates on me. He has not changed in all these years, but I have changed, and that is something sad to acknowledge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many little incidents enlivened those days I spent in Richmond, yet now I suppose they are scarcely worth recording. However, I may tell one anecdote simply to show that I was a gullible young man, perhaps not even as wise as Moses, the Vicar of Wakefield's son, who came home from the fair with a gross of green spectacles that he had taken in exchange for his father's old colt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Going for a walk one midwinter afternoon, soon after school was out, I wound up as usual in the law offices of Messrs. Thomasson &amp; Minor where, indeed, I found quite a large company assembled already. They were all in a state of much excitement over the story of a silver mine in Arizona which was being exploited for all it was worth. It was the first time I had ever heard of it, It was called the "Tiger" mine, and Dick Thompson knew all about it, having been to Arizona and seen with his own eyes. There he was in the room with us and could vouch for the fabulous riches that were being dug out of the hole in the round as fast as picks and shovels could lay bare the glittering metal. Dick was from Culpeper, and was a younger brother of Barbour Thompson, who was not just President of the Southern Railway, but the husband too of Mary Marye (and everybody there present knew that Mary Marye was one of the prettiest as well as one of the wittiest girls that ever was born in Virginia). Dick himself was a modest fellow, not given to blowing his own horn, and was as much as we could do to worm out of him that he owned a huge block of Tiger Mine stock, had bought it indeed at ten cents a share at a time when he knew beforehand that it would certainly be selling soon for a dollar or more. We crowded around him, listening open-mouthed, and there was not one of the company who did not envy Dick with all his heart and wish he was standing in his shoes. As to the mine itself and all its possibilities, there was no room for doubt, for Dick was as transparently honest and sincere as the four evangelists of the New Testament all put together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It got to be late in the afternoon, and the company dispersed about dark. That evening Raleigh and I had supper together at some little tavern or other on Broad Street, and there he told me a secret. The long and the short of it was that Dick Thompson had done Raleigh a great favour and persuaded one of his associates, in fact one of the top men in the syndicate, to let Raleigh in on the Tiger Mine at the original rock-bottom price of ten cents a share. The man higher up was a particular friend of Dick's, and besides he liked what he had heard about Raleigh. While he could not afford to part with more than a small slice of his holdings, he was good-natured and consented to let Dick's friend have a little piece of cake. "For God's sake, Raleigh," I pleaded, "can't you see Dick again and get him to intercede for me also." Raleigh shook his head and said he was afraid there was not the slightest chance of buying another share now when the mine was pouring out silver day and night. If they would just let me have fifty dollars' worth, I went on pleading, it would mean so little to them and so much to me. I went home and went to bed, downhearted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, next day about noon there came a knock on the door of my classroom in school, and a messenger entered and handed me a note from Raleigh. Could I come to his office immediately on business that brooked no delay? — so the note read. I went straight to Mr. McGuire and got him to excuse me from duty for the rest of that day, and in less than a half-hour I was in my friend's office downtown. It was on the upper floor of the building which was occupied downstairs by the banking house of John L. Williams &amp; Son; or was the name of the firm then Lancaster &amp; Williams? Raleigh was expecting me, and as I entered the room, he waved before my eyes a certificate for 500 shares of Arizona Tiger Silver Mine Stock made out in my name. I was so breathless with excitement that I could hardly listen to the explanation, but the gist of it was that he had seen Dick Thompson again soon after breakfast and by dint of much persuasion got him to consent to give me a bite of El Dorado also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I clasped Raleigh to my heart, but he said there was no time for that because the next thing to be done was to raise the fifty dollars that must be paid for the certificate before the bank closed that day. My first thought was to apply to Mr. McGuire to let me have that amount on my salary, but that plan involved going all the way back uptown, and then it might be too late. Besides, it was doubtful whether Mr. McGuire himself would have that much cash on hand to give me on the spur of the moment. A better plan, Raleigh thought, would be to go downstairs and see if between us we could get Mr. Williams to lend me the money. That gentleman knew us both, or rather he knew both of our fathers, and received us in the most cordial way when we entered his office. As soon as we told him what our errand was, he gave the a note to sign, only there was some doubt whether Raleigh's proposed endorsement would be sufficient security. That was a real dilemma, but luckily enough, while that question was under discussion, an elderly gentleman, quite a stranger to me, happened to pass by the window on the street outside. I cannot recall his name, but Raleigh knew him and was indeed related to him in some way. Raleigh went to the door and hailed his cousin, and they spoke a few words together. Then they came inside, and the gentleman bowed to me politely and shook hands with Mr. Williams. When he had endorsed the note, he bade us all adieu amid profuse expressions of gratitude from both Raleigh and me. Mr. Williams looked at the note thoughtfully, almost doubtfully, it seemed to me; then he tapped the bell on his table, a clerk entered the room, Mr. Williams gave him the note, the clerk retired and returned a minute or two later with five crisp ten-dollar bills which he put in my hands. Early in the ensuing summer, as soon as my salary was paid in full, the first debt I discharged, e pluribus unum, was the IOU that had been signed that day in Mr. Williams's office with so much formality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What became of the El Dorado in Arizona, I never really have known from that day to this. The stock-certificate was endorsed and placed in Raleigh's hands for safe keeping, and I never again laid eyes on it. Some four of five years afterwards when I was a teacher in the Miller Manual Training School of Albemarle, Raleigh wrote to ask me to join him and Heath Dabney at the annual meeting of the Virginia State Bar Association, which was held that year in the old Homestead Hotel at the Hot Springs. It was a lark for all of us and we had a jolly time together, moving in high society and living on the fat of the land for a few days. When I went to pay my hotel bill, the clerk informed me that Mr. Minor had been there before me and paid his own bill and mine at the same time. From the clerk's office J went straight to my friend's room where I found him packing his satchel; but when I asked him to tell me how much I owed him, to my utter amazement he replied, without looking up from his task, "Oh, forget it! Haven't I been owing you fifty dollars ever since I got you into that bloomin' Tiger Mine?" Perhaps that was the first time the subject had been mentioned between us since those remote days when we both lived in Richmond, and now what Raleigh said was so preposterous and ridiculous that at first I could not believe he was in earnest. However, he meant exactly what he said, and as I never did succeed in finding out the precise amount of the bill, to this day I am afraid Raleigh was never fully compensated. Yet when I recall that day when we gathered around Dick Thompson and listened to his tale, the words of Zophar in the book of Job come to mind: Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine; even though I myself have not been able to find it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The exploitation of the silver mine in Arizona long antedated the rush for gold in the Klondike in 1897, for the former was nearly contemporary with the peak of that disasterous land boom in Virginia when "towns on paper" sprang up like mushrooms overnight from one end of the state to the other. Their brand-new hotels and ready-made factories were the mute and empty monuments which were all that was left to tell the tale when the financial panic of 1893 spread like wildfire all over the land. Young and inexperienced as I was, with scarcely ever as much as two silver dollars in my pocket to rub together, it is not to be supposed, simply because I had the hardihood to speculate in a silver mine, that I was a victim of the prevalent fever and, like nearly everybody else in those days, dreamed of "getting rich quick." On the contrary, while I know I was vain and conceited, ignorant and foolish also, I can truthfully say I never entertained a thought of laying up for myself treasures upon earth, not so much because I was afraid that moth and rust would corrupt or that thieves might break through and steal, as because indeed my pure affections were quite otherwise engaged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was still as far as ever from choosing a vocation (if indeed one can ever be said to choose a calling); yet I knew that sooner or later, the sooner the better, I must needs come to grips with that problem and reach a decision. For one thing I was painfully aware of my ignorance of both French and German, and was gradually beginning to realize that in case I did intend to pursue science and philosophy, it behooved me to acquire a decent familiarity with those two foreign languages, even though I might never learn to converse freely in any but my native tongue, This desideratum in my education was sufficient reason in itself to enable me to make up my mind to return to the University of Virginia for at least one more year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is well known that there is no better way of learning a subject than by having to teach it to others. I believe it is true likewise that in order to be a really good and capable teacher, the master himself should be far ahead of his pupils. I was conscious of my own shortcomings on this score and of lack of depth in languages, mathematics, and science, the subjects I tried to reach that year in McGuire's School. It was quite plain to me that much of my effort was wasted entirely, for not even a good teacher can force "the young idea to shoot" if the pupil in question, through no fault of his own, has no organ of sensitivity and cannot be stimulated by knowledge for which he has not the slightest taste. Why, I said to myself, why does Mr. McGuire spread his dish of Latin before Harry Langhorne (to take just one example), when it is plain that every mouthful is unpalatable to that delightful and ingenuous youth, and that no coaxing will ever make him swallow it? Let Cicero denounce Catiline with ever so much fervour and eloquence, Harry Langhorne will never take sides with either of the two, keen as he is for all that is going on around him and for all that makes sense according to his understanding. The boy who sat next to Harry in the Latin class wore spectacles and his hair was parted in the middle, but even through his glasses I could see his eyes beam with delight when he caught sight of a long passage of the text in oratio obliqua and realized immediately why the mood had changed from indicative to subjunctive; for that boy had a native turn for this kind of game and loved it much better than he ever would love baseball. I had then been teaching school less than a year, but already I was beginning to think that schools were mighty inefficient, and that between teachers and pupils there was a heap of lost motion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The truth is that all that year my mind was lying fallow in the freshness of youth when the intellect is as vigourous as its conclusions are rash, for then it has not been mellowed by experience nor been informed by. experiment, the foundation stories of all knowledge that is not based simply on intuition. Certainly at this stage of my existence my reflections were not profound or very coherent; yet I believe they were earnest and sincere and perhaps riot all in vain. For instance, I was desirous of finding out what Emerson meant when he said that there was "law for man, and law for thing," for in the course of my reading I had come across that line in one of his poems, and though I could not fathom the sense, I believed I had a glimmering of the truth hidden in it. As I have already said, those were the days when much was being talked and written about the "conflict" between religion and science, and certainly I was unable to reconcile two such powerful antagonists. Yet in this world, I asked myself, are we riot bound to take much on faith that cannot be proved at all? If a man knows that the law of gravitation is true, of course he believes in that law; but surely that is not what is meant by faith as it is defined, for example, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and is indeed the very opposite of faith. If, as Emerson seemed to say, there is "a law for man" and another "law for thing," then I argued perhaps in reality there is no "conflict" at all between religion and science: could that be a correct deduction from Emerson's cryptic saying? To this day I am still at sea, yet such was my youthful interpretation, and wide of the mark as it may have been, it served me well amid those old controversies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If I have cited this one instance of my childish meditations, which I happen to remember now, it is not because I attach any particular importance to it, but because I wish to have an excuse for calling attention to an exceedingly timely and thoughtful essay entitled "The humanities in peace and war" which was published originally in the Classical Journal for January, 1944. Curiously enough, the author, Dr. J. Duncan Spaeth, professor emeritus of English in Princeton University, begins his article by quoting the whole of Emerson's verse: There are two laws discrete Not reconciled, Law for man, and law for thing; The one builds town and fleet, But it runs wild, And doth the man unking; but Dr. Spaeth's interpretation is not the same as mine was years ago, yet indeed, far better. Hear what this wise and erudite commentator has to say on the subject, for it is worth hearing:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Science is organized knowledge of the 'law for thing.' Efficiency results from the use of this knowledge. The humanities teach insight into the 'law for man.' Enrichment of life and enlargement of spirit are the fruits of this insight. Science advances by experiment; the humanities build on experience. Science through controlled experiment creates the knowledge that is power; the humanities through controlled experience create the power that is character. They enrich the individual by the experience of the race. This enrichment of personality by vicarious experience we name culture, and the arts that foster it we name liberal....</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The humanities look backward, the physical sciences look forward. The humanities, inspired as they are by the experience of the past, may degenerate into mere traditionalism unless the insights they transmit are tested and vitalized by fresh knowledge and new experience. The physical sciences, dedicated as they are to intellectual pioneering, may degenerate into mere experimentalism unless 'The Mind in the Making' is guided by the intuitions of the mind that has discovered what is worth preserving from the experience of the past."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot refrain from quoting several more lines from this remarkable essay, inasmuch as this last excerpt is particularly significant in the anxious days in which we are now living:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In war, especially a mechanized war, the 'law for thing' demands priority. But the threat of war to the world of spirit is that it tends to make temporary priorities permanent. Yet the defenders of the ramparts of the spirit know that the power of the ideal outlasts the ideal of power, that 'faith is an anvil that has outworn many hammers,' * that the prophets and seers and poets, the captains and leaders in the armies of the spirit, have access to sources of power beyond the reach of the organizers of force, and survive the latter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, during the interlude in the days of my youth when my studies at the University of Virginia had been interrupted for one year, not all my thoughts, by any means, were concentrated on deep philosophic questions which at that time I was certainly not mature enough to tackle, much less to grasp; nor indeed was all my spare time spent in reading the masterpieces of English literature, as possibly might be inferred from the memoirs I have related thus far. With the advent of spring "'a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love," and it was so with me in the spring of 1891.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[*] John Buchan, Pilgrim's Way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yestreen when to the trembling string The dance gaed thro' the lighted ha', To thee my fancy took its wing, I sat, but neither heard not saw; Tho' this was fair and that was braw, And yon the toast of a' the town, I sighed and said amang them a', Ye are na Mary Morison. Only, in my case, it was not Mary Morison but Sallie Randolph to whom the song applied. She was Bishop Randolph's eldest unmarried daughter, about my own age. I brought garlands to her, being heels-over-head in love, and to me she was like renowned Sylvia and really did excel each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Everybody knows how lovable Bishop Randolph was all the days of his life, and when he lived in Richmond, he was in his prime. His family was indeed a delightful and charming household, to cacti of whom I was attached by a youthful admiration and devotion that neither separation nor lapse of years has diminished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not long after my dear friend Nannie Minor had returned home from the visit she paid Annie Doggett in Richmond in February, 1891, she wrote to my sweetheart, Sallie Randolph, and invited her to be her guest for the University of Virginia Finals in June. Nobody rejoiced more than I did when the invitation was accepted, for as far as it was in my power, I was determined to make Sallie Randolph's début at the University as signal a triumph as a girl ever had in this world. For her and me that spring was a time of eager expectation of the pleasure that was in store for us at the end of the session, However, the few weeks that remained before I left Richmond had to be devoted mainly to my duties in school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My earthly possessions and impedimenta in the way of furniture and luggage were certainly not enough to give me much concern, but such as they were, they had to be packed before my departure. In the course of the year I had accumulated quite a quantity of books of one kind and another; they were my "library" and represented the bulk of my real and personal property. The only hard task of moving was to put these books in a suitable case and send them to Charlottesville ere I left town. One afternoon, just two or three days before the end of the school year, I went to the big dry-goods store of Fourqurean, Price &amp; Company, which, as well as I recall, was not far from Dupuy's Drugstore on Broad Street; and there in the basement I picked out a large cubical wooden box such as I thought would be ample to hold all my books and more besides. It was ordered to be sent to Miss McRae's house and taken to my room upstairs, and there I found it in the middle of the floor next day when I</field>
      <field name="fulltext">came home from school. I had been busy all morning holding a final examination in Geometry, and I had under my arm a heap of papers that had to be graded as soon as possible. However, I decided to pack the books first and be done with it. The task was soon finished, but it was a tight squeeze to get all the books in the box, big and capacious as it certainly was. At last when I nailed the top fast, I was thankful to be rid of a job that had been weighing on my mind for some days. The huge obstacle in the middle of the floor was much in the way , but in spite of all I could do to push it a little to one side, it was too heavy and would not move an inch, I wondered how I had been such a fool as not to have put the empty case in a more convenient place, but the thing was done, and there the box would have to stay until day after tomorrow when I planned to leave town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. McGuire told me about a respectable old coloured man who had a horse and wagon and was just the fellow I needed for hauling the box of books to the freight depot of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad on lower Broad Street, quite a long way, considerably more than a mile, from my lodgings on upper Main Street. He came to see me and we both agreed that he would have to bring another man to help him with the job.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The morning of my last day in Richmond was a busy time, for I had many errands to do and two or three farewell visits to make, besides looking after my luggage and getting to the station in time to take the afternoon train for Charlottesville. Immediately after breakfast, the last thing I did before leaving the house was to remind my landlady again that the old coloured man would be there around noon to get the box of books in accordance with his instructions. My train was due to leave about three o'clock, and knowing that I had to go first to the freight office and buy my ticket afterwards, I supposed that I would be allowing ample time if I got back to my apartment by one o'clock, simply in order to pick up my bags and say goodbye to Miss McRae.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That excellent lady was waiting for me in the doorway when I returned, and tears were streaming from her eyes, but not because she was sad to think that she might never see me again. She sobbed as if her heart would break, because, she said, her house was "a total wreck," no other word could describe it. The old coloured man and his horse and wagon, each as rickety as could be, had pulled up before the front gate at the appointed hour, and she had conducted him and another infirm individual upstairs to my room. There by dint of prodigious efforts, by twisting first one way and then the other, little by little they had shifted the huge unwieldy burden to the top of the staircase, and there the box and everything in it, as if suddenly animated, had wrenched loose from the two feeble old men and tumbled headlong down the steps from top to bottom! As far as words went, that was the end of the story; in testimony whereof Miss McRae simply pointed to the havoc that had been wrought. The evidence was eloquent enough, but I must not pause to describe it. The steps leading from porch to pavement were almost as badly mutilated as the inside staircase, Had it not been for the help of a passer-by oil the street, the two old coloured men could never have succeeded in lifting the box on to the wagon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course, I was overwhelmed with mortification and sympathy, but all I could do was to assure my landlady that I would pay the damages and more besides. There was not another minute to spare, and bidding Miss McRae and her sister farewell, I hailed a streetcar and waved another adieu through the window when I got inside. At last I was on the way to the depot, my troubles all behind me! It was some satisfaction to be unable to think of a single thing I had left undone. The streetcar was drawn by a mule and went at a slow pace, stopping at nearly every crossing to let off a passenger or to take on a new one; so I had abundance of time for reflection. At the corner of Main and Ninth streets I had to get on another streetcar which had an extra mule hitched to it at that place in order to help pull up the long bill past Capitol Square from Main to Broad Street. We had passed old Monumental Church not far from the C. &amp; 0. Depot, when suddenly the car came to a dead standstill in the middle of a block, where a crowd was collected around an old horse that had fallen in the roadway, not in its own tracks only, but right athwart the street-railway tracks also. Two policemen were trying to remove the harness and loosen the traces that were tied to a dilapidated wagon that was hardly able to stand upright on its sprawling wheels. Then in that old vehicle the box of books which I had not seen since early that morning met my eyes again! There was not a minute to lose. The freight office, luckily enough, was not more than two blocks away, and thither I hastened as fast as my legs would carry me. Well, to make a long story short, two railway porters fetched the box of books in a truck from the wagon to the depot, not without, loud groans all along the route, and in the end I caught my train and was on the way to Charlottesville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, when in due course the books arrived in Charlottesville by freight, nearly as much trouble was encountered all over again hauling them from the depot there to my room on the Lawn, but I have dwelt too long on this episode already. It was an expensive lesson, as the lessons of experience are wont to be. Many years afterwards when I lived in Geneva, New York, and had to move to Auburn, Alabama, with all my household possessions, my beloved friend and learned colleague, Dr. William P. Durfee, Dean of Hobart College, helped me to pack my furniture for that long pilgrimage. With his own bands he made sets of boxes to hold my books, each neat and compact box exactly like another so that when they were piled one on top of the other they formed a bookcase, not only useful and convenient but ornamental also by reason of its perfect simplicity. As I watched Dr. Durfee with his hammer and saw, I blushed to remember the ungainly box of books I had packed in the days of my youth, or rather in the days of my ignorance, and despatched from Richmond to Charlottesville amid so much sorrow and sweat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was near the end of June, 1891, and The Finals of the University of Virginia were in full swing, even if the baccalaureate sermon had not yet been preached. Sallie Randolph had come from Richmond, gay as a lark with all her new frocks and sashes, and beaux flocked to see her at the Minors' where she was staying. One of the early events of the gay season was an amateur play, "Charley's Aunt," I believe it was, which was given in the Townhall in Charlottesville, and I took Sallie Randolph to see it. The play was gotten up by Tom Dabney, who had been teaching school that year at McCabe's in Petersburg, and it was thought to be a great scandal, not to say outrage, that the female parts were taken by boys clad in womanly garments, which indeed were lavish in those days and nearly always included bustles. Colonel Venable fumed and swore that no daughter of his should ever witness such a degrading spectacle. All I know is that Sallie Randolph and I sat through the play and enjoyed it for what it was worth; as for me, I would have enjoyed a Punch and Judy show just as much if only I were by her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then one day when she was at the zenith of her fame, Sallie Randolph stayed indoors, and word went round that she had been taken ill. I never saw her again, or said farewell. It was typhoid fever, that dread malady that took its toll of victims every summer when I was a lad. Bishop Randolph and his wife came from Richmond and watched day and night by their daughter's bedside. Day after day I lingered on the doorstep of Mr. Minor's house, never once losing hope, yet dumb with fear and anguish. Hopes and prayers were all in vain. Upstairs within that darkened chamber Sallie Randolph breathed her last, and I stood beneath the casement-window forlorn and desolate. Ah, what avails the sceptred race, Ah, what the form divine! What every virtue, every grace! Rose Aylmer, all were thine.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">DOUBTLESS NO INDIVIDUAL ON EARTH HAS SUCH A PALPABLE air of superiority and tone of condescension as a full-fledged senior in college. Though I myself had not yet attained this high rank in 1891 or indeed anything like it, I am inclined to think I took myself rather seriously at that time and halfway expected to be regarded by my fellows as something on the order of an elder statesman. If so, I was quickly disillusioned. I was certainly more mature than I had been three years previously when I first matriculated in the University, and much more serious also, being absorbed now in my work and having little time to bestow on Calico and other frivolous diversions to which I had once been addicted. However, it was not only I myself who had changed in the course of two or three years, for as a matter of fact there was a subtle change also in the atmosphere of the whole student body, not quite clear to me at first, yet very perceptible. Nearly all my old comrades had finished their prescribed courses, and their dear familiar faces were now no longer to be seen on the campus. To me it seemed as if a totally new criterion of distinction had been established during that year when I was absent in Richmond and as if a new order of knights had been created. In the somewhat disdainful mood I was in at the time, the parvenus who had risen to prominence in college looked like pygmies as compared with their predecessors to whom I had given such willing and unquestioning allegiance in days gone by. So it is always when a revolution has been accomplished: an individual who has taken no part in it and has himself been "ploughed under," as the saying is, never does quite relish the new situation and is indeed disposed to be resentful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most obvious innovation was the complete ascendency of athletics in all student activities. Breckinridge Robertson was not an athlete himself, but he aspired to be the chieftain of the powerful Athletic Association, and Colston Blackford of Lynchburg and Oliver M. Catchings from Mississippi followed close in his footsteps. The real athletes who were idolized by the students were my old friend Addison Greenway; John Greenway, even more popular than his elder brother, and afterwards famous comrade of Rough Rider Teddy Roosevelt; Murray McGuire, whom we verily believed to be the greatest college base ball pitcher of all time; "Cap" Smith from South Carolina, beloved from one end of college to the other; A. Lee Thurman, big and handsome, who afterwards married Mary Cochran, as handsome and almost as big as he was; Bill Abbot, who never curried favour but always found it, and whose darling elder sister Jeannie was one day to be my own dear wife; and other champions too, less noted, yet who shone resplendent enough in those far-off days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From 1888 to 1890, Hampden Bagby had been a teacher in Clarence Wallace's high school for boys in Nashville, Tennessee, and now having returned to the University in 1890, was working towards the degree of Ph.D. in Physics or Natural Philosophy. During the same session 1891-92 my other intimate friend Raleigh Minor gave up practising law in Richmond and exchanged places with his elder brother John B. Minor, Jr., who for the past year had been helping his aged father as acting instructor in Common Law, and who now became the other partner of Edwin B. Thomasson's law firm in Richmond. The three of us together, Hampden Bagby, Raleigh Minor, and I, were a DKE trinity to whom was joined also Sherrard Tabb; yet, much as we esteemed ourselves, we were forced to admit, sorrowfully enough, that we had sunk in the esteem of the Venable girls and were now not much better than "poor fish" in their inconstant hearts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, sometime during that year when I was in Richmond, Mary Venable had been duly wedded to Dr. Charles L. Minor, Delta Psi; and from that day forth, if indeed not earlier, the DKE sphere of influence no longer extended much beyond the threshold of Aunt Mary's house. Though I had returned to college and was again living next door on East Lawn, I was not now a regular guest at her table as I had been previously; yet I cannot recall the boardinghouse where I got my meals. For the time being Cantey and Natalie Venable were, so to speak, mesmerized and under the dominion of a foreign yoke, for such was the phrase used by the Saxon DKE's to describe the Norman conquest of the Delta Psi's. This situation, so ignominious for me and my comrades, lasted more than a year. Yet in the end the DKE's may be said to have been the real victors; for just when Cantey Venable seemed to be within Billy Peterkin's grasp, that is, towards the end of my last session in college (1892-93), young Lochinvar came out of the West in the guise of Clarence Dallam of Paducah, Kentucky, a DKE before my time, and carried Miss Cantey away as his bride, having indeed been engaged to her all the time. Then several years later, my chum Raleigh Minor, darkest of all dark horses, won Miss Natalie's fair, if unscrupulous, hand in one of the most exciting steeple-chases of all the "gay nineties." If here my metaphors are mixed, it is because the events themselves were mixed and not capable of being recorded in sober prose. I know that I, for one, was generally on the false scent and never got on the track of the real fox until he was standing in front of the altar, meek as a lamb. I do know for certain, however, that up to that moment, frolicsome Natalie had as many as three DKE's and one Delta Psi all tied on her string in tandem, as one might say, and that the fury of the DKE's towards one another was fiercer than their common hatred of the lone Delta Psi. The truth is, in those days the romantic affairs of Miss Natalie Venable were as complex and mysterious as those of one of Dostoievsky's heroines, and even Katerina Ivanovna might have yielded the palm to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While I was teaching school in Richmond, two important changes of instructors had taken place in the University, which I must notice here. First, "Math" Miller, who had formerly been Colonel Venable's right bower, had been transferred to the post of instructor in Physics or Natural Philosophy; and, second, young Harrison Randolph, who, like Dr. Goldsmith, touched nothing that he did not adorn, had taken Miller's place in Mathematics. Being absent from college at the time, I had not kept pace with the shifts and promotions among the satellites in the faculty; nor was I aware that inasmuch as Miller himself was leaving the University at the end of the session 1890-91, the post of instructor in Physics had become vacant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon after I returned from Richmond to Charlottesville, perhaps about the middle of June, 1891, I received a message from Professor Smith asking me to come to see him at his office. At the same time my friend Jim Corbitt from Tidewater Virginia, afterwards the Honorable James H. Corbitt (1869-1945), a leading member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia for many years, received a similar, if not identical, invitation. Whether we went together to see Professor Smith, or whether each of us had a separate interview, I cannot recall, but the upshot was that each of us was offered the post of half-time instructor in Physics at a salary of $400 per annum. I was both dazed and elated, it seemed too good to be true, and while I accepted the proposition not without inward trepidation, I accepted it also without a moment's hesitation, and my recollection is that Jim Corbitt did likewise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What greater happiness could be in store for me than to be constantly in the light of "Frank" Smith's countenance, to serve him day and night without ceasing, and to show him by word and deed that I was his faithful and devoted disciple? Nor was the stipend of $400 to be considered otherwise than as a bountiful and providential dispensation whereby all my pecuniary difficulties had been suddenly solved as if by the wand of a fairy godmother. The only apprehension in my mind was as to whether I myself was equal to the opportunity. How was I fitted to be an instructor of Physics when, for example, I had never heard a lecture or opened a book on the subject of electricity and magnetism? My ignorance, as none knew better than I, was truly colossal, and I knew that "Frank" Smith knew it also. I believe Corbitt had the same misgivings. The bargain which I made in the end was that while I, for my part, promised to leave no stone unturned in order to make me capable and worthy of my task, yet Mr. Smith, on his part, must consent to be patient and forbearing without expecting much at first. So it was agreed with mutual protestations of friendship and goodwill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The die was cast. From that moment I resolved to be a natural philosopher all the days of my life, nor have I ever repented of that decision. That selfsame evening I read a chapter in Helmholtz's popular scientific lectures and copied in my notebook Schiller's famous line as quoted by the great physicist: Wer um die Göttin freit, sucht in ihr nicht das Weib; which I took to mean that I would woo my heavenly mistress even though I might never hope to win her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I was in college, it was the custom for the senior class in Natural Philosophy to study light and sound one year and electricity and magnetism the next year, in regular alternation. Now neither Corbitt nor I had ever taken the latter subject, which, as it turned out, was to be given in the session 1891-92; so it behooved us both not only to attend the senior class that year but to prepare for it in advance by studying hard during the long summer vacation. The chief textbook was Cumming's Theory of Electricity, which somehow has vanished from my library; a really excellent book in its way, except that I took a violent dislike to the author. It seems to me his Christian name was Linnaeus, which had a heathenish sound, but what I disliked most of all was that I never could discover a trace of the milk of human kindness in a single page of that volume. However, two far more formidable treatises which I tackled at the same time were Andrew Gray's Theory and Practice of Absolute Measurements in Electricity and Magnetism (London, 1888),which had just been published a year or two previously, and Atkinson's English translation of Mascart and Joubert on electricity and magnetism (London, 1883),each in two large volumes. Stewart and Gee's Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics (London, 1889),the second volume of which was devoted to electricity, was another work which I studied carefully that summer, trying out the laboratory exercises as best I could by myself. I remember reading also Oliver Lodge's Modern Views of Electricity (London, 1889)and perhaps P. G. Tait's Recent Advances in Physical Science (London, 1885), wherein that "fiery Celtic" author crossed swords, in the preface to the third edition, with Professor du Bois-Reymond, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin. My old college-mate Joe Dunn was now at the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria, and when he heard that I was an instructor in Physics, he sent me a copy of the Life of James Clerk Maxwell (London, 1884),a welcome gift indeed, though I never was sure whether it was intended to signify approval or disapproval of my new and strange occupation. Accordingly, by the end of my first year as instructor, I had already accumulated a little collection of standard books on physics and had diligently studied most of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I have mentioned before, my friend Hampden Bagby was likewise studying Physics at this time, However, he was wiser than I was and more far-sighted, inasmuch as he was well on the road to the degree of Ph.D., which he soon obtained. I did not realize then, or afterwards until it was too late, the academic advantage and prestige of a doctorate, which was almost a sine qua non for getting a place as teacher in an American college. The fact that Bagby and I were trudging along the same scientific path and were actuated by the same motives and the same purpose in life proved to be a great help and stimulus to me; especially as he was farther advanced than I was, and, consequently, I learned much from him in those early days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few years later, in 1895, when news reached this country by cable of Röntgen's discovery of the so-called X-rays, Jim Corbitt was still instructor in Physics in the University of Virginia, Hampden Bagby had already begun his long and distinguished career as a professor in Hampden-Sydney College, and I was teaching Mathematics and Physics in the Miller Manual Training School of Albemarle. At the same time I believe Henry Louis Smith, afterwards president of Washington and Lee University, was taking postgraduate Physics under "Frank" Smith. Within not much more than a fortnight after the announcement in the New York Herald of the discovery of the hitherto unknown radiation, each of the four young physicists above mentioned had succeeded, quite independently of one another, in making good X-ray skiagrams of such things as a bunch of keys and perhaps also of human finger bones and the skeleton of a frog. As far as I know, although I am entirely unable to prove it, these were the earliest X-ray pictures that were obtained in the United States.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In October, 1891, soon after the opening of the session, Mr. Smith was summoned to Kansas City, Missouri, by the death of his son Harry Smith, a promising young lawyer in that fast-growing midwestern metropolis. Thus suddenly and quite unexpectedly it devolved on Corbitt and me to meet the classes in Natural Philosophy and conduct them as best we could in Mr. Smith's absence of about ten days. The division of labour we made between ourselves was for Corbitt to take the senior class and for me to have charge of the big junior class. It was short notice; yet I had to make a pretense of giving the lectures, and the thought of it put me on my mettle. Fortunately, the class was just beginning, and the subject to be expounded was quite elementary, concerning indeed nothing more abstruse than the composition and resolution of vectors (parallelogram and triangle of forces, velocities, etc.). However, I sat up late at night in preparation for the task ahead of me next day and committed almost by heart three or four pages of one of the early chapters of Daniell's Textbook of the Principles of Physics (London, 1885) which I intended to intersperse with illustrations and anecdotes culled from Dr. Neill Arnott's delightful little volume on the Elements of Physics (7th ed., 1887); as, for example, the vertical and horizontal motions concerned in ascending or descending a flight of steps, the path pursued by a boy skating athwart the smooth surface of a cake of ice that is being carried down stream by the current of the river, the track of smoke issuing from a locomotive going north so many miles an hour while the wind was blowing east, etc. Much to my relief, I believed I had acquitted myself fairly well on this first adventure, and I gained a little confidence in my ability to cope with an emergency; yet withal I was conscious of owing much to the courtesy and forbearance of my auditors. They were good sports, appreciating my difficulties and refraining from taking advantage of them and putting me to shame, as they might easily have done. However, I was glad when Mr. Smith returned and took the reins in his own hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My colleague and I were certainly very inexperienced that first year, and our shortcomings must have been manifest; yet in industry and fidelity Mr. Smith never had before or afterwards two more zealous and conscientious assistants. However, it seemed to me he rewarded us with little encouragement and with scant courtesy. Much as I loved and admired him, there were times when I felt something akin to resentment when, in spite of all my efforts to please my employer, I could not win a word of approbation from him. On the contrary, in a mild and gentle way Mr. Smith was apt to show signs of impatience and even of vexation whenever I happened to be a little clumsy and did not quite fulfill his expectations. Indeed I was not always responsible for a blunder I made, inasmuch as I had had no previous instruction on the subject and was necessarily ignorant of the modus operandi with respect to a particular experiment which was being demonstrated to the class and which I myself was witnessing for the first time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once indeed Mr. Smith subjected me to much mortification in public, nor can I forgive him for it even to this day. He was wont to prepare the experiments for his lecture without my assistance, but while the lecture was in progress I sat on a front bench so as to be at Mr. Smith's beck and call in case he happened to need me. On this particular occasion the subject of discussion concerned the behaviour of gases and the validity of Boyle's Law. The instrument used for some demonstration or other was a piece of homemade apparatus, such as Mr. Smith was ingenious in constructing, consisting mainly of glass tubes and scales fastened together on an upright wooden support. I had never seen it before that day and was ignorant of its purpose and operation. In the midst of the experiment Mr. Smith paused and beckoned to me to lend a hand, What he wanted me to do was merely to stand at the blackboard behind him and write down two rows of figures as he called them aloud from the readings of the empirical scale. I was aware that the numbers had to be manipulated according to some unexplained process in order to obtain certain numerical results that would tend to verify the law. The operation was simple enough if only I had been let into the secret beforehand, but as it was, I stood there more or less bewildered. Mr. Smith glanced behind him, and seeing that I was at a loss, snatched the stick of chalk from my fingers and with the utmost facility completed the required computations. The whole class tittered, and I walked back to my seat rebuked and humiliated. Of course, I remonstrated with Mr. Smith after class, but he made light of the affair without offering a word of apology.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is painful to discover that the idol you have bowed down before and worshipped has feet of clay. It is a singular fact that in the time of my apprenticeship, that is, during the two years that I was instructor in Natural Philosophy, it never occurred to me to seek aid or advice from Mr. Smith, sorely as I was in need of both. It was impossible for me to get near to him or to gain his favour. It was as if an invisible barrier stood between us. Yet afterwards, for many years as long as Mr. Smith lived, that barrier was removed. I shall never cease to regard him as one of the most gifted men I have ever known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here I cannot refrain from relating another anecdote of an entirely different and rather ludicrous nature concerning an episode that took place in the electrical laboratory that first year when Corbitt and I were colleagues. together. More than once I have already had occasion to allude to Bob Radford, eccentric and erudite instructor in Ancient Languages, who at this time was an applicant for the degree of Master of Arts. The only subject he had not yet completed in that iron-clad curriculum was Natural Philosophy, for which he had not only no predilection but a most inveterate and unconcealed antipathy. In the laboratory he was like a fish out of water or perhaps more like a bull in a china shop. It was enough for him to put his finger on a piece of apparatus for it to get out of order, and indeed it would be lucky if the instrument was not damaged beyond repair. Now one of the most delicate and intractable of all scientific instruments is Coulomb's torsion balance for measuring the force of attraction or repulsion of two separate charges of electricity and verifying the law of the inverse square of the distance between them. It is simple enough in construction, for it consists essentially of a long and exceedingly light lever suspended inside a closed cylindrical glass case by a quartz fibre, so as to oscillate to and fro in a horizontal plane under the slightest compulsion. It is not necessary to describe the apparatus more in detail, except to say that the balance is so sensitive that in order to read the measurements on the circular scale on the outside of the case, the observer has to look through a telescope mounted on a table so far away from the instrument itself that the movements of the needle will not be affected by his own nearness to it. The fact is that the experiment is so difficult to perform accurately and successfully that I doubt whether it was ever accomplished even by Coulomb who devised it; nevertheless, it was one of the prescribed experiments in Mr. Smith's course in electricity and magnetism. Of course, it was a farce to expect Radford to do this feat, but Corbitt and I explained the whole thing carefully and gave him a sheet of written instructions; then with many cautions left him to his own devices and the instrument itself to his tender mercy! How many days and weeks poor Radford persisted at his dreary task without making any progress, I cannot say precisely. All I know is that long before he desisted and gave it up in despair, he was haggard and woebegone, and Coulomb's torsion-balance was so completely out of adjustment that we had to send to Messrs. Queen &amp; Company in Philadelphia for an entire new set of levelling screws. It got to such a pass that the mere sight of the apparatus was enough to set Radford in a paroxysm of rage. Occasionally Corbitt and I used to watch him from a hiding place behind one of the brick pillars of the laboratory in the old "Annex" building, where we could see him and the contortions of his face without being seen ourselves. Ever and anon Radford would mop his brow with a handkerchief compressed into a hard knot in his clenched fist, and then the sight of his agony might have melted a heart of stone; yet I am ashamed to say we split our sides with suppressed laughter. The Holy Inquisition never invented a device that was more truly an instrument of torture than Coulomb's torsion-balance was that session for Bob Radford; and if either of the two instructors ventured to say a kindly word to him or offered a bit of advice, all the thanks he got was a look of hatred such as might have flashed from the eyes of John Randolph of Roanoke towards one of his adversaries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There must have been a special dispensation in Radford's behalf, whereby he was not held accountable for his lack of ability in laboratory work; for after all he graduated in Natural Philosophy, magna cum laude or otherwise, and certainly got his M. A. degree at the end of the session.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now that I ranked as a member of the faculty, even though my foot was on the lowest round of the ladder, the two last years I spent in the University were on a somewhat different footing from that of the previous years. However, I was still a regularly matriculated student and a candidate for graduation, first, in Modern Languages (both French and German), and, afterwards, in History and Latin, and I was as active as ever in fraternity affairs. Besides Hampden Bagby, Robertson Gordon, Murray McGuire, Bob Mason, Raleigh Minor, Sherrard Tabb, Joe Winston, and myself, other members of Eta Chapter of DKE in 1891-92 were: Joseph P. Green, Lewis Machen, Robert Nelson, Herbert Old, Charles T. Reifsnider, P. S. Rhett, Albert and Barnwell Stewart, J. Waverley Thomas and several others whom I remember without being able to call their names at the moment. Our club meetings were held pretty regularly every Saturday night in the little DKE cottage on Carr's Hill where Tom Wood and Jeff Norris used to room together when I first came to college. Yet it seems to me I must have spent the whole of that session deeply engrossed in my studies, for of all the four years of my college career the haziest in my memory is that third year, a really eventful year of my life when, knowing that I was no more than a raw recruit in the ranks of Physics, I set to work in dead earnest with no other ambition except to be worthy of my high calling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My friend Sherrad Tabb got his M.D. degree in June, 1892, and planned to spend the next year or two in Richmond as interne in St. Luke's Hospital, which Dr. Hunter McGuire and his gifted son Stuart had established recently in a new building erected back of Capitol Square not far from the old Exchange Hotel and Ballard House. Sherrard boarded in college at Mrs. Perkinson's in Dr. Holmes's house on East Lawn, and now when he was packing his things and getting ready to depart, he sent a bundle of miscellaneous articles to my room for me to look over and dispose of for what they were worth. Of all that pile of plunder the only two pieces I can recall were a framed picture or sepia print of a girl lying sideways on a sofa with one arm under her head and a dreamy look in her eyes turned towards the spectator, and a sealed demijohn of pure applejack brandy which I suppose Sherrard had purchased from one of those peddlers who used to issue from the Ragged Mountains and prowl around the University at night tempting us to buy their illicit "moonshine." That picture hung on the wall of my room for a year or more, and the girl and I used to gaze at each other with mutual admiration. I lost sight of her when I myself left college and have never seen her again from that day to this. As for the jug of brandy, I lost sight of it almost from the moment I got it, for I put it on the floor in a dark corner of the closet where my washstand was and forgot all about it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During those years when I was an instructor in Physics, I lived at the University all the year round and kept steadily at work through the long summer when everybody else was having a vacation. Under the circumstances my room was a convenient storehouse for many little treasures and keepsakes that were left in my care while the owners were absent from college. Ordinarily the precious archives and secret minutes of Eta Chapter were in the custody of the guardian who lived in the DKE cottage, but when the end of the session came and the cottage was vacant, the heavy wooden chest in which these valuables were kept under lock and key was conveyed to my domicile on East Lawn and entrusted to my care. The box was about eighteen inches high from the floor, too high to get under the bed, and the only place to put it was on the hearth in front of the unused grate, although it was in the way there, and I used to stumble over it in the dark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In midsummer the Lawn of the University of Virginia can be as hot and nearly as desolate as the desert itself. I happen to recall one particular evening about the middle of July, 1892, partly because even late at night the mercury hovered around 90°. Not a breath of air was stirring, and as far as I knew, I was the only human being anywhere in my vicinity that had not put out his light and gone to bed. Yet quiet as it was all around me, and lonely as I was, trying to put my mind on my book, the little room itself was the arena of incessant — or may I say, "insectuous"? — activity; for the door and the window both were wide open, the electric bulb that hung from the ceiling was brightly lighted, and every variety of fly, moth, and beetle that ever flourished in Albemarle, myriads of every species, were swarming and buzzing around my head and having no end of fun at my expense, just as if it had been a rehearsal of one of the plagues of Egypt. By midnight the heat and the flies together were more than I could endure, and I closed my book and decided I would extinguish the light and go to bed. just at that moment Harrison Randolph entered the room from the arcade outside, as noiselessly and as stealthily as an Indian, and flung himself down in the chair on the other side of the table. "Hail to thee, blithe spirit!" I exclaimed rising from my chair and extending my hand to greet him, not noticing at first the dejection of his countenance. It turned out that he had been spending the evening with the Venable girls next door, but not having heard a sound from that quarter, I think it passed through my mind that it could not have been a very gay party. Harrison was not very communicative, and all I could get from him was that he had eaten something at supper that had disagreed with him and given him a pain in the stomach. Then he asked me if I would be good enough to give him a dose of bicarbonate of soda. Alas! the shelf in my closet where I kept my little stock of drugs contained paregoric, castor oil, and epsom salts in abundance, but not even a half teaspoonful of soda. Then I spied the demijohn of applejack brandy in the corner on the floor and without a word pulled it forth and set it on top of the wooden chest in front of the fireplace. Harrison watched me gloomily while I tried to be cheerful and recommended brandy as "the sovereign'st thing on earth" to restore a disordered stomach. Neither he nor I, I was pretty sure, had ever tasted a drop of "mountain dew" before that hour; and as I poured out a jigger-full in a little medicine glass and held it up to the light, clear as crystal and colourless as water, my hand shook and I came near spilling the contents. Then suddenly I raised the glass to my lips and, turning my eyes towards the ceiling above me, emptied it down my throat in one gulp. After waiting several moments in suspense, I smacked my lips and remarked placidly, "By Jove! that's the smoothest fire-water that ever flowed through a gullet, if only you know how to quaff it." So saying, I poured out another jigger and handed it to Harrison sitting opposite me, and without another word he tossed it down his throat just as he had seen me do it a moment before. The effect was instantaneous and miraculous; his eyes sparkled, his tongue was unloosed, and the pain in his stomach took flight as if it had been wafted away by the wand of a magician.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now we were two young and ambitious instructors who had come together that hot summer night and were in the mood for deep philosophic discussion. As the subject of conversation got deeper and deeper, the talk got to be more animated and elevated and was louder and louder. Ever and anon one of the two disputants would pause for a moment, pour out another jigger from the bountiful demijohn, and toss it down his throat as nonchalantly as if he had been the Duke of Wellington. The jug was on the chest midway between us, and we ourselves were not a yard apart. The hard black beetles buzzed and droned about our heads; yet we talked on and on unceasingly at the top of our lungs. Mathematics and physics, religion and philosophy, all intermingled, were the themes of discussion, and every word that was uttered I believe might have been heard on Observatory Mountain. The moon had sunk long since, but whether day had begun to dawn, I cannot say for certain, though suddenly it dawned on me that we were bawling at each other beyond all propriety. Therewith, all at once, I lowered my voice and said with perfect composure that while our discussion was like one of Plato's dialogues, the manner in which it was being conducted was certainly too boisterous. "Well," said Harrison rising from his seat and speaking also in a perfectly natural tone of voice, "I suppose you are right, but it has been mighty enjoyable and profitable too, and now it's pretty late, and I had better be getting home." He lived with his mother and sisters in a frame house which I believe is still standing, just around the corner from Main Street on the way to Fry's Spring. From my room on the Lawn it was not a long way he had to go to get to his house; yet I begged him, but begged him in vain, to abide with me as the night was far spent. So we parted with many a fond adieu.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not without some little difficulty that I got on my feet, undressed, turned out the light, and at last got in bed. When I waked next morning, rather later than usual, the first object that met my eyes was the demijohn on the wooden chest, with the medicine glass beside it, both in position just as we had left them a few short hours before. By morning it had turned a little cooler, and by the time I had shaved and dressed, I had an appetite for breakfast and did not seem to be any the worse for not having had as much sleep as usual. On my way to the post office about an hour later, just as I was passing the corner of East Range in front of "Wash Hall," I noticed a solitary figure coming towards me up the hill. His step was not very brisk, but as we drew nearer to each other, his appearance was familiar and strange at the same time. It was not until we were just a few yards apart that I recognized my friend Harrison Randolph, only there was a long strip of court plaster over one eye and a shorter piece behind the ear on the other side. "Good Gracious!" I exclaimed. "Yes," he replied with a faint smile, "I must have hit every pillar and post on my way home last night, but for all that, I know now that moonshine or whatever was in that bottle is efficacious for a pain in the stomach! "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last time I heard of Harrison Randolph (who I believe is just my own age), he was president emeritus of the College of Charleston, South Carolina, where he had had a long and distinguished career for more than half a century. Since those far-off days when we were two youthful instructors in the University of Virginia I have never laid eyes on him. I wonder if he will vouch for the accuracy of the story I have just related about that hot summer night when we talked and drank together in my room on East Lawn; certainly one of the most profitable and enjoyable evenings I ever spent in my life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In addition to his many other natural endowments, Harrison Randolph had a real genius for music, and it was worth going to chapel on Sunday evening just to hear him play the organ. The grey-stone chapel, so incongruous with the architectural plan of the University and so manifestly out of place, erected mostly by private subscription, was in those days the newest edifice on the campus. To that pious enterprise I believe my dear Aunt Mary contributed a large sum of money, and I well remember the day when the new chapel was dedicated with much pomp and ceremony, the preacher for the occasion being the Reverend Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton University, who was afterwards ambassador at the Hague. "Pete" Adams of Lynchburg, who had a heavenly tenor voice, used to sing regularly in the choir; and on any one of those rare and memorable occasions when Ethel Neely of Norfolk happened to be visiting at the Robertson's on Park Street and it was noised abroad that she was going to sing a solo at vespers, you may be sure not an empty pew was to be found in the chapel that Sunday evening. It was indeed an exceptionally good choir, but it mattered little to me whether it was good or bad so long as I could sit in a pew and gaze steadfastly at Jeannie Randolph, Harrison's younger sister .and a member of the choir also; truly "a thing of beauty and a joy forever." No vestal virgin was ever haughtier or more disdainful, nor did Jeannie Randolph notice me more than the dust under her feet. If she ever smiled at all, it was in secret as far as I know, for certainly she never smiled on me; yet to this day I cannot forget what an enchanting sight it was to see Jeannie Randolph in the chapel choir as far removed from me as the evening star in the firmament.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Voulez vous some peanuts haben?" — some such polite and polyglot question was the form of salutation by which a candidate for graduation in the School of Modern Languages was wont to greet a fellow candidate. For my part that was about as far as I ever got in the gentle art of conversation in a foreign tongue. It is true, in my early boyhood I had sojourned the whole of one winter in the cathedral town of Amiens and had acquired perhaps as much facility in speaking colloquial French as a native Virginian is likely to obtain under such favourable conditions; yet by the time I was old enough to go to college the memory of that accomplishment was not much more than a myth, and I am sure that no word I ever uttered at that time would have led even a detective on the order of Sherlock Holmes to suspect that a portion of my youth had been passed on the banks of the Somme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nevertheless, thanks to Professor William H. Perkinson, who was an able and conscientious teacher, by the end of the session of 1891-92, my progress in learning French and German, without indeed being much to boast of, was at least such that I might claim to have a bowing, if not a speaking, acquaintance with the foremost writers in both languages, not excepting the great lyric and dramatic poets. The practical advantage which I gained that year was worth far more than I realized on the day when I received my diploma, for thereafter I was to enjoy free access to the great library of scientific literature not in the English language only but in French and German as well. In a comparatively few years, that is, by the time I was a fellow in Physics at the Johns Hopkins University (1898-99), I venture to say that German treatises on physics and mathematics outnumbered all the other volumes on the three or four shelves of my bookcase.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I had planned to take Professor Noah K. Davis's course in Moral Philosophy in my fourth year in the University (1892-93), but just as I was about to matriculate at the beginning of the session, it dawned on me that, according to the new regulations of the Board of Visitors, all that stood between me and the attainment of the degree of Master of Arts was graduation in the Schools of Latin and History. Hitherto I had never entertained any thought of planning my curriculum with reference to that aim, but now that the degree happened to be within my grasp, I decided wisely enough that I could not afford to let the opportunity slip. On the other hand, I was so entirely engrossed in my new scientific pursuits that the thought of studying Latin once more and "wasting precious time in that graveyard" (as I remember saying to my father at the time) was distasteful if not actually bitter. The task was not a grievous one nor altogether uncongenial, only my heart was not in it, and for the time being Greeks and Romans had ceased to play any part in the plan of my life. Yet now in retrospect I am glad indeed that I elected to take Latin and sit at the feet of "Old Pete," for otherwise I should certainly have missed a part of the atmosphere of the University of Virginia in the days when "Latin, Greek, and Math." taken all in one session was the trinity known as "the green ticket."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colonel William Elisha Peters was a renowned scholar in his own domain, simple and unaffected in all his ways, and as rugged and absolute as the ablative absolute itself. Latin syntax was his forte and Latin metre was his hobby, but of Latin literature itself I think he had no more appreciation than he had of the art of the Etruscans. Marcus Tullius Cicero was Colonel Peters's favourite author simply because his writings were the model and criterion of classical Latin prose, wherein every sentence, nay indeed every word, was to be taken as an original and indisputable contribution to Latin grammar. From Ennius and Terence to Seneca and Pliny, Colonel Peters had the ipsissima verba of every Latin author on the tip of his tongue and could quote them at a moment's notice by way of apt illustration and confirmation of the dogmas of his own Syllabus and Case Notes, two erudite volumes that as curiosities of literature might be said to be as truly super grammaticam as the Emperor Sigismund himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I doubt whether I ever had a kinder or truer friend in the world than Colonel Peters was in the days when I was a pupil in his class, for I stood high in his favour at that time. It came about by pure accident. One day when I was least expecting to be "called on" to recite and was totally unprepared, he asked me out of a clear sky to translate a passage in Livy which I had never before laid eyes on until that very instant when Charley Abbot, or whoever happened to be seated on the bench next to me, handed me his open book and put his finger on the place. As I recollect it, the first word of the sentence was the verb constitutum est, which stared me in the face as if it were the signal of battle. Then suddenly it flashed across my mind that, according to the code we had to go by in all such matters, one of two translations was permissible; namely, either "the fact was established that" or "the result was" ditto, depending on whether the following clause was the accusative and infinitive (oratio obliqua) or was ut with the subjunctive, and the only question was which of the two renderings was the correct one in this particular instance. At this distance from the event my memory may not be entirely accurate as to the details, but I do know that I took a chance that day and fortune favoured me. No sooner had I pronounced the right words than Colonel Peters came down from his platform and almost embraced me; henceforth, I had to live up to the reputation of being his star pupil for that year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Dabney's course in European History, which I took that same session also, began, I believe, with the age of the Antonines and came down to the fall of Napoleon. It was a pure delight to me from start to finish, instructive, stimulating, and exceedingly interesting. The textbooks, including Bryce's Holy Roman Empire, Froude's sketch of Caesar, and Dabney's own essay on The Causes of the French Revolution, as well as several other volumes whose titles I have forgotten, were all classics of their kind. It was a privilege indeed to be a pupil of Heath Dabney, as indeed I fully realized at the time; yet it was a higher privilege, as I have realized more and more every year of my life, to know Heath Dabney affectionately and intimately. Not only I but many others also can bear witness that here indeed was un chevalier sans peur et sans reproche, as true and steadfast a gentleman as ever walked on earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The culmination of those contests for the honour of being final president of the Jefferson Literary Society occurred during the last year I was in college. The fight waged between the two opposing candidates, Murray McGuire of Richmond and Mallory K. Cannon of Norfolk, was long and bitter. As instructor in Physics it is doubtful whether I ought to have descended into the arena of college politics, but I was a violent partisan and could not keep out of it. As a matter of fact, I was the active manager of McGuire's campaign, and Breckinridge Robertson was my firm ally and efficient helper. "Mike" Cannon was a prominent student in college who had taken his M. A. Degree in June, 1892, along with Harrison Randolph and Bob Radford, and who was now in the Law School. The political leader of the Cannonites was an Irishman from Clarke County, known as "Kit" Carson, and afterwards widely known in the Philippine Islands as Judge Adam C. Carson. He was a man of no mean ability, a born politician if ever there was one, clever, resourceful and adroit, affable, good-natured, and likable; but in my opinion he was absolutely untrustworthy and unscrupulous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That battle was a celebrated affair more than half a century ago, but the story is too long to tell, and besides, the real facts of the controversy on which everything hinged were never completely revealed or ascertained beyond the shadow of a doubt. it is certain that more than three-fourths of the entire student body would have cast their votes in favour of McGuire, if only they might have been members of the Jefferson Society and had had the right of suffrage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It so happened that at the beginning of the session not more than a mere handful of students were enrolled as members of the Society. As soon as it became apparent that McGuire was the overwhelming choice of the college at large, the Cannonites, who happened to have for the time being a majority in the Jefferson Society, resorted to the questionable tactics of preventing applicants for membership from joining the organization. Accordingly, regularly every Saturday evening the instant the Society was called to order, "Kit" Carson or one of his henchmen made a motion to adjourn without transaction of business, simply in order to thwart the perfectly perfunctory election of new members. Week after week, with well-nigh incredible difficulty, Breckinridge Robertson and I assembled our cohorts in front of the doors of the Jefferson Society, some two or three hundred all told, seeking and demanding admittance for them; week after week admittance was denied them, unlawfully and scandalously, as we bitterly contended. We believed that the enemy had resorted to a mean subterfuge in order to escape certain defeat, and the feeling between the two parties was at fever-heat. Certain parliamentary questions were involved. The only copy of the new constitution of the Society which had been ratified and adopted but which had not yet been printed, disappeared mysteriously from the desk of the secretary where it had been kept, and was never afterwards found; the reason of its disappearance, as we alleged, was because this document explicitly forbade the employment of the tactics that had been adopted by our opponents. Dissension rose to such a pitch that each side denounced the other in broadsides published in College Topics. When that sheet appeared one Saturday afternoon (in December, as well as I recall), excitement was intense everywhere on the campus. That same evening long before the appointed hour of the meeting of the Jefferson Society, the hall on West Range was already packed and jammed with members and applicants for membership so that not a bit of standing room was left, while outside a mob of students was assembled under the arcade. No pretence was made of calling the meeting to order, and if a speaker sought to make himself heard above all the din and hubbub, he had first of all to elbow his way through the throng to the rostrum where other orators were getting up steam also. Breckinridge Robertson was the first to get the floor, and then even that turbulent and unruly audience was mesmerized and constrained to preserve a certain decorum by listening to his quiet and forceful presentation of our side of the controversy; for Breckinridge Robertson was naturally one of the best debaters I have ever heard, and it was easy to see that his speech poured oil on the troubled waters and produced a profound impression. When he concluded, "Kit" Carson ,vas already on his feet, so that it cannot be said that he rose to reply, nor indeed can it be said that he attempted to reply to the argument at all. However, he did speak, and spoke at great length. His voice was smooth and insinuating, his manner cool and deliberate, and from the point of view of his admirers I suppose his harangue was considered clever. I was not an unprejudiced judge, and to me standing there opposite him on the rostrum it was as if every word that Carson uttered was as false and insolent as if it had issued from the lips of Lucifer. It was all I could do to hear him in silence to the end, and when he finished, I looked him square in the face and told him that he was both a blackguard and a liar! Then pandemonium broke loose in the hall of the Jefferson Society. Tom Pinckney of South Carolina and Lee Marshall of Maryland, two of the gamest fighting cocks ever bred on earth, were close behind me on the platform, and had they not been held in leash at that moment, they would have leaped on Carson and saved me from my own fate. It was a tense moment which might easily .have led to a free-for-all fight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How the crowd dispersed that evening without riot and bloodshed, I cannot tell because I myself was so wrought up and so much in the thick of it that I really never knew all that happened afterwards. Before the morning dawned, Carson and I had had a furious fist-fight upstairs in the old gymnasium at the end of East Range. That encounter lasted thirteen rounds, and was a bloody affair in dead earnest. Neither of the two combatants had the faintest notion of boxing, and each slugged the other with mortal hatred. Every blow landed full in the face, and then one of the so-called pugilists would pummel the other unmercifully pursuing him round and round the ring until the gong sounded. The mortification I experienced was far worse than the punishment I got, and I had plenty of both that night. The Irishman took a lot of punishment too, but in the end, I am sorry to say, he was the victor; for when in the last round I stumbled over a piece of furniture that was nailed to the floor and fell and was felled to the ground at the same time, that was the end of the battle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a week or more afterwards before my swollen features had subsided enough to assess the damage I had sustained; then I had to go to Richmond in order to get Joe Dunn's brother, Dr. John Dunn, to mend my nose and heal some other broken places in my physiognomy. It was an uncomfortable experience, not only because for some reason or other I could not be given a local anaesthetic and had to endure the pain as best I could, but also because I dreaded to appear in public in such a sorry plight. I can never forget how kind Mrs. Bagby was to me at this time and how grateful I was to her. I stayed in her home nearly a week during that ordeal, and it was there that I met Lucy Day of Smithfield who was the guest of Martha Bagby and her sister. The Democratic Convention which nominated Thomas S. Martin of Scottsville for U. S. Senator from Virginia happened to be in session in Richmond at that time, and Lucy Day boasted that if Tom Martin was elected she would marry him one day. While everything was still hanging in the balance, and while I was being renovated by Dr. John Dunn, I remember writing a "poem" to Lucy Day, one of its verses being as follows: Miss Lucy Day, Miss Lucy Day, Pray, fling away ambition! If angels fall in that a way, Can you escape perdition? Needless to say, that headstrong young lady paid no heed to my muse, and so far as subsequent events were concerned, I might as well have held my peace. Tom Martin was elected Senator, Lucy Day became his bride, and they went to Washington to live; thereafter, being so far above me and my earthly existence that I never laid eyes on either of them again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That disorderly meeting of the Jefferson Society, followed as it was late that night by a gladiatorial combat between two of the principal debaters, was the crisis and climax of the fierce Cannon-McGuire political campaign that had been waged all over college for weeks and weeks. So much bitterness and resentment had been engendered that it is no wonder the faculty was bound to intervene and put an end to it. It was mutually agreed on both sides to submit the fundamental question at stake to a committee of arbitration, with power to decide which of the two candidates for the office of final president was entitled to be declared victor without further contest. Accordingly, two leading members of the faculty, Professor Noah K. Davis and Dr. Paul B. Barringer, were chosen as umpires in the dispute. The case was argued before this committee at great length, and it took a long time to adjudicate it. Each side presented a written brief of many foolscap pages, and through the years that have come and gone, I still have the original of the paper I wrote in behalf of the supporters of Murray McGuire. "Noah K.," who was chairman of the committee, took his duty very seriously and was a great stickler for formality and parliamentary procedure. The preambles and felicitations that he deemed to be appropriate and necessary in order to signify our perfect confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the arbitrators were hard to anticipate, and frequently a note which I had addressed to the committee was returned because it was not couched in diplomatic language. Many times Breckinridge Robertson and I were summoned at a moment's notice to appear in Professor Davis's study just across the Lawn from my room, in order to clarify or correct sonic phraseology we had used. As far as we could judge, it was a matter of no importance; yet we never dared say so in the presence of the supreme being before whom we stood in fear and trembling. On such occasions the old gentleman received us graciously — and cordially enough, bidding us take our places on the sofa opposite the big armchair in which he himself was seated; then without another word he would close his eyes, let his head sink down in his long beard, and go into some kind of trance, very much as if he were acting a part in the Book of Revelation. Thereafter, for ten or fifteen minutes it seemed to me, not a sound would be made in the room, even Noah K.'s groans de profundis that ordinarily came with the regularity of clockwork ceased to be heard. Presently he would open his eyes. and begin to speak in an oracular voice, while we, sitting on the sofa, listened in silent amazement to the outflow of his prolonged meditation. When we were dismissed, neither Breckinridge nor I had the slightest inkling whether the omens were adverse or favourable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">However, at last the decision of the committee of arbitration was pronounced in our favour. So it came to pass that in June, 1893, Murray McGuire was indeed final president of the Jefferson Literary Society, having won what used to be regarded as the highest honour conferred by the students themselves on one of their number. Alas! by that time the interest and excitement of the campaign had died out, and the ancient Jefferson Society, already on the wane, was pretty nearly defunct as the arena of college politics.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My incursion into that famous campaign in the session 1892-93 brought me into personal contact with a greater number of students than I had ever known before in any one year, for it was my business to solicit votes in behalf of our popular candidate. Nobody was eligible to vote unless he was a registered member of the Jefferson Literary Society and had duly paid an initiation fee of ten dollars. The poll tax was high, the enthusiasm of the average partisan was seldom more than lukewarm, and the task of the "spellbinder" was an uphill job. Never before was my acquaintance among my college-mates so widespread and indiscriminate; yet never before since I first set foot on the campus was I oppressed by such a sense of loneliness and aloofness. Not many of the comrades of earlier years were left in college to keep me company, and I myself, student and instructor at the same time, had become a kind of amphibious animal, so to speak, of such dubious nature that the ordinary undergraduate was a little at a loss as how to take me. Among the younger men in college that year to whom I was fondly attached were Bill Abbot, Ned Craighill, Lee Marshall, Tom Pinckney, and Henry Rieley, to mention only such dearly remembered names as leap from my pen in the act of writing; yet they treated me more as a mentor and "elder statesman" than as one of themselves and were under a constraint not altogether compatible with pure and unalloyed friendship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One of the big society events that took place towards the end of the session was the wedding of Cantey Venable to Clarence Dallam of Paducah, Kentucky, to which I know I have alluded already. The day before the ceremony the bridegroom came to town escorted by a tribe of thorough-bred Kentuckians, in whose honour he gave a "wine-supper" that same evening in a room over Eisenmann's Saloon on Main Street. As toastmaster on that festive occasion I won great applause by re-affirming Aristotle's doctrine of Nature's abhorrence of a vacuum; which led to much debate, especially as to whether an empty bottle was a vacuum within the meaning of the law, for if so, how could a wine-bottle ever stay empty? as was plainly in evidence by empty bottles all over the table. In those antediluvian days when Mr. Hotopp's Monticello Wine Company was a going concern and flourished in Charlottesville in spite of Mrs. Cochran's Temperance Union, a brand called "Hermann" was renowned not only for its excellent flavour but above all for its notorious potency. Many bottles of this wine were emptied at Clarence Dallam's pre-nuptial banquet, and so enraptured were the Kentuckians by its merits and spirits that it is said that they bought the entire stock next day and carried it back home with them. I do not vouch for the story, but I must say I have never seen another bottle of Hermann wine from that day to this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot remember distinctly whether it was that same spring or in the following autumn, 1893, that Susie Minor was led to the altar by John Wilson of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but I know I was present at that ceremony also. One of her lovely bridesmaids was a girl named Jeannie Abbot, and it was then that I saw her for the first time in my life. She was clad that evening in a grey crêpe-de-chine gown with an accordion pleated skirt that was mighty becoming to her tall graceful figure. Little did I realize then that that charming and cultivated girl would one day be my wedded wife and evermore as long as I lived be all the world to me!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fourteenth of June was the last day of the session 1892-93, and likewise my last day in the University of Virginia. On that day I was publicly declared to be a Master of Arts, along with John Stewart Bryan, James H. Corbitt, J. Markham Marshall, Flugh H. Young, Robert F. Whitehead and several others whose names I have forgotten. Among those who graduated in Law were George Ainslie (who married Nonnie Burthe), A. C. Carson, Oliver P. Catchings, James E. Heath, Jr., J. Jordan Leake (final president of the "Jeff." in 1892), J. Breckinridge Robertson, and E. Randolph Williams; and in Medicine my two clubmates Powell C. Fauntleroy and Joseph B. Greene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The days of my youth were ended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Those horse-and-buggy days when I was a student at the University of Virginia lie far behind me; nor did I ever dream then that I should live to see the time when a speaker standing in front of a little radio-electric instrument might be heard distinctly in his natural voice by an attentive listener in the farthest part of the globe. Then the University of Virginia was but a small and unpretentious college as compared with what it has grown to be in little more than half a century. If the number of students can be taken as a measure of size, the University now is, roughly speaking, six times as big as it was then, and the teaching staff has probably increased in something like the same proportion. New and imposing buildings equipped with every modern convenience and all the costly apparatus that is requisite nowadays for the purposes of higher education, have been erected all over the campus. In actual dollars and cents I daresay the annual budget of the great Alderman Library with all its useful adjuncts and departments exceeds the total revenue of the University as it was in my time. However, in less obvious ways I believe the University of Virginia in 1890 was not inferior to the lordly institution which it has since become ere yet the first half of the twentieth century is completed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alma Mater can justly upbraid me for many and grievous shortcomings, but she cannot reproach me for lack of gratitude and filial affection. Without exception I look back on my teachers in the University of Virginia with respect bordering on veneration, though I do not doubt that their places are filled now by scholars no less renowned and no less worthy of love and admiration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a great university, as I conceive it, it should always be possible for a capable and diligent student to obtain what is called a "liberal" education as distinguished from a "useful" or vocational training, important as the latter may be also, and as it certainly is for proficiency in the learned professions. Years ago when I was a young professor in Hobart College, Geneva, New York, my honoured friend Dr. Durfee, said to me once that if he could have his way, he would write over the archway of the college gate, "Nothing useful taught here." Of course, what he meant to imply was that the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake was such a pure and high endeavour that it ought not to be hampered or frustrated by any ulterior motive of profit and utility. It is now considerably more than a century since Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in the United States, each independently of the other, yet almost simultaneously, discovered and studied the curious phenomenon of electromagnetic induction between currents of electricity in different circuits. When someone asked Faraday "After all what is the use of it?" he replied by asking in his turn, "What is the use of a child save that one day it may grow to be a man?" It is common knowledge now that those original and ingenious experiments were the forerunners of the marvellous industrial applications of the science of electricity that in our own day have revolutionized man's life on this planet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In proportion as an individual has acquired the intellectual culture implied by a liberal education, he is thereby qualified and enabled to use his reason intelligently and effectively with respect to nearly every subject that is brought to his attention, reaching out towards the truth if haply he may grasp some portion of it. A liberal education enlarges the mind and empowers it to survey and contemplate many objects at once, just as the mobile eye scans a wide field of fixation in order to assign each visible item to its proper place with respect to all the others within the range of its orbit, and thus to obtain a just and comprehensive idea and perception of the entire scheme. as an ordered whole. A cultivated mind is open and dispassionate, its conclusions are rational and tentative, subject to revision in the light of clearer and deeper insight; hence, it never assumes infallibility and is never intolerant of the different conclusions of other cultivated minds. "The bodily eye," says Cardinal Newman, "the organ for apprehending material objects, is provided by nature; the eye of the mind, of which the object is truth, is the work of discipline and habit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is no easy matter to sift truth from error; yet it is the task of all others on which man's salvation depends. Doubtless one reason that people on earth today are confused and tossed by such contrary beliefs and winds of doctrine is because the leaders of public opinion, alas, more often than not, are themselves deficient in liberal education. Year after year our modern colleges and institutions of learning send forth hosts of fresh graduates, some of them no doubt expert and skillful enough in their own special and narrow provinces; yet withal so limited in nearly all other fields of knowledge that for the purpose of comprehending a variety of phenomena in their mutual interdependence, such education as they have acquired is indeed more of a hindrance than an advantage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The original meaning of the word universitas was simply "a number, a plurality, or aggregate of persons; Universitas vestra, in a letter addressed to a body of persons, meant merely 'the whole of you.'" In the earliest period the word was never used by itself but generally in some such phrase as universitas magistrorum et discipulorum meaning a community of teachers and scholars. In the foundation of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson lived to see the achievement and fruition of the fondest dream of his old age. The site of the new institution was chosen amid congenial surroundings of great natural beauty, and Mr. Jefferson himself designed the plan and supervised the construction of the buildings that are to this day a lasting monument to his genius and labor. But the aim of all his endeavors was the establishment in his native land of a community of teachers and scholars that would flourish and endure from generation to generation, a beacon light to all mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The university exists for its pupils, not for the teachers only.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It should be hospitable to those alone who crave its fellowship and "are inflamed with the study of learning and the admiration of virtue." * The ideal university begins with a group of eminent and gifted instructors; it emerges in a class of distinguished scholars. The primary concern of such an institution is not the comfort or even the well-being of the student, neither his amusement nor his happiness, worthy of consideration as all these factors of his life certainly are. The time-honoured maxim, mens sana in corpore sano, is valid and applicable in every walk of life, and perhaps it needs to be stressed particularly in the sedentary occupations of a scholar; but there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that the heart of a university lies in the gymnasium or on the athletic field, much less in a clubhouse or recreation centre. Fraternities and convivial societies, carnivals [*] In the inaugural address delivered by Professor Thomas H. Huxley in 1874 as Rector of Aberdeen University, he draws a striking picture "of many a brave and frugal Scotch boy, spending the summer in hard manual labour, that he may have the privilege of wending his way in autumn to this University, with a bag of oatmeal, ten pounds in his pocket, and his own stout heart to depend upon through the northern winter," etc. In 1867, the year before the University of North Carolina had to close its doors on account of the chaotic condition in the South during the 19tragic era" of Reconstruction, the parents of Peter Mitchel Wilson of Warrenton, N. C., decided to send their son to Scotland in order to complete his education in the University of Edinburgh. There the youth found a small group of comrades from his native land who had come on the same errand, and there, above all, he came in contact with such notable men and great teachers as John Stuart Blackie, Peter Guthrie Tait, and Philip Kelland, to mention only three of the most illustrious names. Long afterwards Peter Mitchel Wilson wrote a delightful volume of memoirs called Southern Exposure (The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, N. C., 1927) in which a whole chapter is devoted to describing the Edinburgh faculty and students as he knew them in 1867. The native Scotch students (he says) seemed to him to be "almost another race in their capacity for self-denial and their unconquerable will to learn. We were poor enough in this world's goods — as I have shown, all of us came from the losing side in a disastrous war. But we literally did not know the meaning of the word 'poverty' as it was spelled by some of those Edinburgh boys. Many and many of them came to class hungry and cold. Anything to get an education, that Ultima Thule of Scotch ambition." and gladiatorial games, pastimes and creature-comforts, all perfectly innocent and harmless enough in themselves, are at most the accidents and incidentals of college life, in no wise peculiar to it; for all these pleasures and diversions may be equally enjoyed in almost any other section of society, by merchants in the city, by farmers in the country, or by artisans in the factory. To be sure, neither the moral life not the social life can, or ought to, be divorced from the intellectual life, and both must have their due and proper place in the ideal of a university as an institution enduring from generation to generation and dedicated to the quest of knowledge and wisdom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The aims and rewards of the scholar in the university are not those of the market place, and the standards of excellence are not measured by the ordinary yardsticks of the world at large. In the midst of the world, and by no means unmindful of it, the university is set apart, separate and distinct. In proportion as it is influenced and controlled by church or state, it is likely to come short of its purpose and endeavour. The spirit that animates a Newton, a Darwin, a Helmholtz, or a Pasteur has little or naught to do with the petty and ephemeral concerns of everyday life. Devoted to the task he has set himself to do, the true scientific explorer is heedless of the toil and careless of the wages; piloted by the everlasting stars, he keeps his eye steadfast on the goal and will not be turned aside. To him all the wealth of the Indies is as fool's gold compared with the prize of wresting from Nature a precious secret never before divulged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The size of a university is not a measure of its achievement. A little grain of radium will outweigh a car-load of lead in intrinsic value. Useful, praiseworthy, influential, and powerful as some of our modern universities undoubtedly are, especially here in the United States, nevertheless, it seems to me that the essential purpose of the establishment is in danger of being obscured and possibly lost sight of altogether.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Industry, patience, humility, faith — these are the distinguishing traits of the truth-seekers in the realm of intellect. The ideal university is an aristocracy of such philosophers and scholars as will steadily resist and withstand all pressure from without that tries to introduce the facile aims of democracy. In this sense the great lines of Lucretius come to my mind as being applicable to the conception of a university as an earthly. institution, yet exalted above the vanity and turmoil of earthly strife: Sweeter by far on Wisdom's rampired height To pace serene the porches of the light, And thence look down — down on the purblind herd Seeking, and never finding, in the night The road to peace — the peace that all might hold, But yet is missed by young men and by old, Lost in the strife for palaces and powers, The axes, and the lictors, and the gold.</field>
