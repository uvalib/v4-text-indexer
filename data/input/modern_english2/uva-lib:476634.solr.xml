      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I DRIVEN FROM HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A BOY of sixteen, with a small gripsack in his hand, trudged along the country road. He was of good height for his age, strongly built, and had a frank, attractive face. He was naturally of a cheerful temperament, but at present his face was grave, and not without a shade of anxiety. This can hardly be a matter of surprise when we consider that he was thrown upon his own resources, and that his available capital consisted of thirty-seven cents in money, in addition to a good education and a rather unusual amount of physical strength. These last two items were certainly valuable, but they cannot always be exchanged for the necessaries and comforts of life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For some time his steps had been lagging, and from time to time he had to wipe the moisture from his brow with a fine linen handkerchief, which latter seemed hardly compatible with his almost destitute condition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hasten to introduce my hero, for such he is to be, as Carl Crawford, son of Dr. Paul Crawford, of Edgewood Center. Why he had set out to conquer fortune single-handed will soon appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few rods ahead Carl's attention was drawn to a wide-spreading oak tree, with a carpet of verdure under its sturdy boughs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will rest here for a little while,” he said to himself, and suiting the action to the word, threw down his gripsack and flung himself on the turf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is refreshing,” he murmured, as, lying upon his back, he looked up through the leafy rifts to the sky above. “I don't know when I have ever been so tired. It's no joke walking a dozen miles under a hot sun, with a heavy gripsack in your hand. It's a good introduction to a life of labor, which I have reason to believe is before me. I wonder how I am coming out — at the big or the little end of the horn?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused, and his face grew grave, for he understood well that for him life had become a serious matter. In his absorption he did not observe the rapid approach of a boy somewhat younger than himself, mounted on a bicycle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy stopped short in surprise, and leaped from his iron steed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, Carl Crawford, is this you? Where in the world are you going with that gripsack?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl looked up quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Going to seek my fortune,” he answered, soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I hope you'll find it. Don't chaff, though, but tell the honest truth.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have told you the truth, Gilbert.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a puzzled look, Gilbert, first leaning his bicycle against the tree, seated himself on the ground by Carl's side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Has your father lost his property?” he asked, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Has he disinherited you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not exactly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you left home for good?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have left home — I hope for good.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you quarreled with the governor?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hardly know what to say to that. There is a difference between us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He doesn't seem like a Roman father — one who rules his family with a rod of iron.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he is quite the reverse. He hasn't backbone enough.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So it seemed to me when I saw him at the exhibition of the academy. You ought to be able to get along with a father like that, Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I could but for one thing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have a stepmother!” said Carl, with a significant glance at his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So have I, but she is the soul of kindness, and makes our home the dearest place in the world.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are there such stepmothers? I shouldn't have judged so from my own experience.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I love her as much as if she were my own mother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are lucky,” said Carl, sighing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me about yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She was married to my father five years ago. Up to the time of her marriage I thought her amiable and sweet-tempered. But soon after the wedding she threw off the mask, and made it clear that she disliked me. One reason is that she has a son of her own about my age, a mean, sneaking fellow, who is the apple of her eye. She has been jealous of me, and tried to supplant me in the affection of my father, wishing Peter to be the favored son.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How has she succeeded?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think my father feels any love for Peter, but through my stepmother's influence he generally fares better than I do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why wasn't he sent to school with you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because he is lazy and doesn't like study. Besides, his mother prefers to have him at home. During my absence she worked upon my father, by telling all sorts of malicious stories about me, till he became estranged from me, and little by little Peter has usurped my place as the favorite.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why didn't you deny the stories?” asked Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I did, but no credit was given to my denials. My stepmother was continually poisoning my father's mind against me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you give her cause? Did you behave disrespectfully to her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” answered Carl, warmly. “I was prepared to give her a warm welcome, and treat her as a friend, but my advances were so coldly received that my heart was chilled.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Poor Carl! How long has this been so?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“From the beginning — ever since Mrs. Crawford came into the house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are your relations with your step-brother — what's his name?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Peter Cook. I despise the boy, for he is mean, and tyrannical where he dares to be.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think it would be safe for him to bully you, Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He tried it, and got a good thrashing. You can imagine what followed. He ran, crying to his mother, and his version of the story was believed. I was confined to my room for a week, and forced to live on bread and water.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shouldn't think your father was a man to inflict such a punishment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It wasn't he — it was my stepmother. She insisted upon it, and he yielded. I heard afterwards from one of the servants that he wanted me released at the end of twenty-four hours, but she would not consent.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long ago was this?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It happened when I was twelve.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was it ever repeated?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, a month later; but the punishment lasted only for two days.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And you submitted to it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had to, but as soon as I was released I gave Peter such a flogging, with the promise to repeat it, if I was ever punished in that manner again, that the boy himself was panic-stricken, and objected to my being imprisoned again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He must be a charming fellow!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You would think so if you should see him. He has small, insignificant features, a turn-up nose, and an ugly scowl that appears whenever he is out of humor.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And yet your father likes him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think he does, though Peter, by his mother's orders, pays all sorts of small attentions — bringing him his slippers, running on errands, and so on, not because he likes it, but because he wants to supplant me, as he has succeeded in doing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have finally broken away, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I couldn't stand it any longer. Home had become intolerable.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Pardon the question, but hasn't your father got considerable property?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have every reason to think so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Won't your leaving home give your step-mother and Peter the inside track, and lead, perhaps, to your disinheritance?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose so,” answered Carl, wearily; “but no matter what happens, I can't bear to stay at home any longer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're badly fixed — that's a fact!” said Gilbert, in a tone of sympathy. “What are your plans?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. I haven't had time to think.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. A FRIEND WORTH HAVING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GILBERT wrinkled up his forehead and set about trying to form some plans for Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It will be hard for you to support yourself,” he said, after a pause; “that is, without help.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is no one to help me. I expect no help.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thought your father might be induced to give you an allowance, so that with what you can earn, you may get along comfortably.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think father would be willing to do this, but my stepmother would prevent him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then she has a great deal of influence over him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, she can twist him round her little finger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't understand it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You see, father is an invalid, and is very nervous. If he were in perfect health he would have more force of character and firmness. He is under the impression that he has heart disease, and it makes him timid and vacillating.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Still he ought to do something for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose he ought. Still, Gilbert, I think I can earn my living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What can you do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I have a fair education. I could be an entry clerk, or a salesman in some store, or, if the worst came to the worst, I could work on a farm. I believe farmers give boys who work for them their board and clothes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think the clothes would suit you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am pretty well supplied with clothing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert looked significantly at the gripsack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you carry it all in there?” he asked, doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, no,” he answered. “I have a trunkful of clothes at home, though.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why didn't you bring them with you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would if I were an elephant. Being only a boy, I would find it burdensome carrying a trunk with me. The gripsack is all I can very well manage.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I tell you what,” said Gilbert. “Come round to our house and stay overnight. We live only a mile from here, you know. The folks will be glad to see you, and while you are there I will go to your house, see the governor, and arrange for an allowance for you that will make you comparatively independent.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, Gilbert; but I don't feel like asking favors from those who have ill-treated me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nor would I — of strangers; but Dr. Crawford is your father. It isn't right that Peter, your stepbrother, should be supported in ease and luxury, while you, the real son, should be subjected to privation and want.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know but you are right,” admitted Carl, slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course I am right. Now, will you make me your minister plenipotentiary, armed with full powers?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I believe I will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's right. That shows you are a boy of sense. Now, as you are subject to my directions, just get on that bicycle and I will carry your gripsack, and we will seek Vance Villa, as we call it when we want to be high-toned, by the most direct route.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, no, Gilbert; I will carry my own gripsack. I won't burden you with it,” said Carl, rising from his recumbent position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here, Carl, how far have you walked with it this morning?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“About twelve miles.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, of course, you're tired, and require rest. Just jump on that bicycle, and I'll take the gripsack. If you have carried it twelve miles, I can surely carry it one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are very kind, Gilbert.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why shouldn't I be?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But it is imposing up on your good nature.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Gilbert had turned his head in a backward direction, and nodded in a satisfied way as he saw a light, open buggy rapidly approaching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's my sister in that carriage,” he said. “She comes in good time. I will put you and your gripsack in with her, and I'll take to my bicycle again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your sister may not like such an arrangement.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Won't she though! She's very fond of beaux, and she will receive you very graciously.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You make me feel bashful, Gilbert.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't be long. Julia will chat away to you as if she'd known you for fifty years.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was very young fifty years ago,” said Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hi, there, Jule!” called Gilbert, waving his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julia Vance stopped the horse, and looked inquiringly and rather admiringly at Carl, who was a boy of fine appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me introduce you to my friend and schoolmate, Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl took off his hat politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Crawford,” said Julia, demurely; “I have often heard Gilbert speak of you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope he said nothing bad about me, Miss Vance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You may be sure he didn't. If he should now — I wouldn't believe him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You've made a favorable impression, Carl,” said Gilbert, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am naturally prejudiced against boys — having such a brother,” said Julia; “but it is not fair to judge all boys by him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is outrageous injustice!” said Gilbert; “but then, sisters seldom appreciate their brothers.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Some other fellows' sisters may,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They do, they do!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you ever see such a vain, conceited boy, Mr. Crawford?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course you know him better than I do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, Carl; it's too bad for you, too, to join against me. However, I will forget and forgive. Jule, my friend, Carl, has accepted my invitation to make us a visit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am very glad, I am sure,” said Julia, sincerely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And I want you to take him in, bag and baggage, and convey him to our palace, while I speed thither on my wheel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To be sure I will, and with great pleasure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can't you get out and assist him into the carriage, Jule?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you,” said Carl; “but though I am somewhat old and quite infirm, I think I can get in without troubling your sister. Are you sure, Miss Vance, you won't be incommoded by my gripsack?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not at all.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I will accept your kind offer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a trice Carl was seated next to Julia, with his valise at his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Won't you drive, Mr. Crawford?” said the young lady.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't let me take the reins from you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think it looks well for a lady to drive when a gentleman is sitting beside her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was glad to take the reins, for he liked driving.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now for a race!” said Gilbert, who was mounted on his bicycle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right!” replied Carl. “Look out for us!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They started, and the two kept neck and neck till they entered the driveway leading up to a handsome country mansion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl followed them into the house, and was cordially received by Mr. and Mrs. Vance, who were very kind and hospitable, and were favorably impressed by the gentlemanly appearance of their son's friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Half an hour later dinner was announced, and Carl, having removed the stains of travel in his schoolmate's room, descended to the dining-room, and, it must be confessed, did ample justice to the bounteous repast spread before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon Julia, Gilbert and he played tennis, and had a trial at archery. The hours glided away very rapidly, and six o'clock came before they were aware.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gilbert,” said Carl, as they were preparing for tea, “you have a charming home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have a nice house, too, Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True; but it isn't a home — to me. There is no love there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That makes a great difference.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If I had a father and mother like yours I should be happy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must stay here till day after tomorrow, and I will devote to-morrow to a visit in your interest to your home. I will beard the lion in his den — that is, your stepmother. Do you consent?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I consent; but it won't do any good.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We will see.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III. INTRODUCES PETER COOK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GILBERT took the morning train to the town of Edgewood Center, the residence of the Crawfords. He had been there before, and knew that Carl's home was nearly a mile distant from the station. Though there was a hack in waiting, he preferred to walk, as it would give him a chance to think over what he proposed to say to Dr. Crawford in Carl's behalf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was within a quarter of a mile of his destination when his attention was drawn to a boy of about his own age, who was amusing himself and a smaller companion by firing stones at a cat that had taken refuge in a tree. Just as Gilbert came up, a stone took effect, and the poor cat moaned in affright, but did not dare to come down from her perch, as this would put her in the power of her assailant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That must be Carl's stepbrother, Peter,” Gilbert decided, as he noted the boy's mean face and turn-up nose. “Stoning cats seems to be his idea of amusement. I shall take the liberty of interfering.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter Cook laughed heartily at his successful aim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hit her, Simon,” he said. “Doesn't she look seared?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must have hurt her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I expect I did. I'll take a bigger stone next time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He suited the action to the word, and picked up a rock which, should it hit the poor cat, would in all probability kill her, and prepared to fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Put down that rock!” said Gilbert, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter turned quickly, and eyed Gilbert insolently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who are you?” he demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No matter who I am. Put down that rock!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What business is it of yours?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall make it my business to protect that cat from your cruelty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter, who was a natural coward, took courage from having a companion to back him up, and retorted: “You'd better clear out of here, or I may fire at you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do it if you dare!” said Gilbert, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter concluded that it would be wiser not to carry out his threat, but was resolved to keep to his original purpose. He raised his arm again, and took aim; but Gilbert rushed in, and striking his arm forcibly, compelled him to drop it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean by that, you loafer?” demanded Peter, his eyes blazing with anger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To stop your fun, if that's what you call it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I've a good mind to give you a thrashing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert put himself in a position of defense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sail in, if you want to!” he responded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Help me, Simon!” said Peter. “You grab his legs, and I'll upset him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Simon, who, though younger, was braver than Peter, without hesitation followed directions. He threw himself on the ground and grasped Gilbert by the legs, while Peter, doubling up his fists, made a rush at his enemy. But Gilbert, swiftly eluding Simon, struck out with his right arm, and Peter, unprepared for so forcible a defense, tumbled over on his back, and Simon ran to his assistance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert put himself on guard, expecting a second attack; but Peter apparently thought it wiser to fight with his tongue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You rascal!” he shrieked, almost foaming at the mouth; “I'll have you arrested.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What for?” asked Gilbert, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“For flying at me like a — a tiger, and trying to kill me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert laughed at this curious version of things.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thought it was you who flew at me,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What business had you to interfere with me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll do it again unless you give up firing stones at the cat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll do it as long as I like.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She's gone!” said Simon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys looked up into the tree, and could see nothing of puss. She had taken the opportunity, when her assailant was otherwise occupied, to make good her escape.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm glad of it!” said Gilbert. “Good-morning, boys! When we meet again, I hope you will be more creditably employed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't get off so easy, you loafer,” said Peter, who saw the village constable approaching. “Here, Mr. Rogers, I want you to arrest this boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Constable Rogers, who was a stout, broad-shouldered man, nearly six feet in height, turned from one to the other, and asked: “What has he done?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He knocked me over. I want him arrested for assault and battery.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And what did you do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I? I didn't do anything.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is rather strange. Young man, what is your name?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gilbert Vance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't live in this town?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I live in Warren.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What made you attack Peter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because he flew at me, and I had to defend myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is this so, Simon? You saw all that happened.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ye — es,” admitted Simon, unwillingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That puts a different face on the matter. I don't see how I can arrest this boy. He had a right to defend himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He came up and abused me — the loafer,” said Peter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That was the reason you went at him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you anything to say?” asked the constable, addressing Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; when I came up I saw this boy firing stones at a cat, who had taken refuge in that tree over there. He had just hit her, and had picked up a larger stone to fire when I ordered him to drop it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was no business of yours,” muttered Peter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I made it my business, and will again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did the cat have a white spot on her forehead?” asked the constable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And was mouse colored?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, it's my little girl's cat. She would be heartbroken if the cat were seriously hurt. You young rascal!” he continued, turning suddenly upon Peter, and shaking him vigorously. “Let me catch you at this business again, and I'll give you such a warming that you'll never want to touch another cat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me go!” cried the terrified boy. “I didn't know it was your cat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It would have been just as bad if it had been somebody else's cat. I ve a great mind to put you in the lockup.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, don't, please don't, Mr. Rogers!” implored Peter, quite panic-stricken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you promise never to stone another cat?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then go about your business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter lost no time, but scuttled up the street with his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am much obliged to you for protecting Flora's cat,” then said the constable to Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are quite welcome, sir. I won't see any animal abused if I can help it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are right there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wasn't that boy Peter Cook?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. Don't you know him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; but I know his stepbrother, Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A different sort of boy! Have you come to visit him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he is visiting me. In fact, he has left home, because he could not stand his step-mother's ill-treatment, and I have come to see his father in his behalf.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He has had an uncomfortable home. Dr. Crawford is an invalid, and very much under the influence of his wife, who seems to have a spite against Carl, and is devoted to that young cub to whom you have given a lesson. Does Carl want to come back?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he wants to strike out for himself, but I told him it was no more than right that he should receive some help from his father.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is true enough. For nearly all the doctor's money came to him through Carl's mother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid Peter and his mother won't give me a very cordial welcome after what has happened this morning. I wish I could see the doctor alone.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So you can, for there he is coming up the street.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert looked in the direction indicated, and his glance fell on a thin, fragile-looking man, evidently an invalid, with a weak, undecided face, who was slowly approaching.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy advanced to meet him, and, taking off his hat, asked politely: “Is this Dr. Crawford?”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV. AN IMPORTANT CONFERENCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DR. CRAWFORD stopped short, and eyed Gilbert attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know you,” he said, in a querulous tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am a schoolmate of your son, Carl. My name is Gilbert Vance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you have come to see my son you will be disappointed. He has treated me in a shameful manner. He left home yesterday morning, and I don't know where he is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can tell you, sir. He is staying — for a day or two — at my father's house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where is that?” asked Dr. Crawford, his manner showing that he was confused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In Warren, thirteen miles from here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know the town. What induced him to go to your house? Have you encouraged him to leave home?” inquired Dr. Crawford, with a look of displeasure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir. It was only by chance that I met him a mile from our home. I induced him to stay overnight.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you bring me any message from him?” “No, sir, except that he is going to strike out for himself, as he thinks his home an unhappy one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is his own fault. He has had enough to eat and enough to wear. He has had as comfortable a home as yourself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't doubt that, but he complains that his stepmother is continually finding fault with him, and scolding him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He provokes her to do it. He is a headstrong, obstinate boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He never had that reputation at school, sir. We all liked him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you mean to imply that I am in fault?” said the doctor, warmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think you know how badly Mrs. Crawford treats Carl, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course, of course. That is always said of a stepmother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not always, sir. I have a stepmother myself, and no own mother could treat me better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are probably a better boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't accept the compliment. I hope you'll excuse me saying it, Dr. Crawford, but if my stepmother treated me as Carl says Mrs. Crawford treats him I wouldn't stay in the house another day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Really, this is very annoying,” said Dr. Crawford, irritably. “Have you come here from Warren to say this?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, not entirely.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps Carl wants me to receive him back. I will do so if he promises to obey his stepmother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That he won't do, I am sure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then what is the object of your visit?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To say that Carl wants and intends to earn his own living. But it is hard for a boy of his age, who has never worked, to earn enough at first to pay for his board and clothes. He asks, or, rather, I ask for him, that you will allow him a small sum, say three or four dollars a week, which is considerably less than he must cost you at home, for a time until he gets on his feet.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know,” said Dr. Crawford, in a vacillating tone. “I don't think Mrs. Crawford would approve this.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It seems to me you are the one to decide, as Carl is your own son. Peter must cost you a good deal more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know Peter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have met him,” answered Gilbert, with a slight smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know what to say. You may be right. Peter does cost me more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And Carl is entitled to be treated as well as he.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I ought to speak to Mrs. Crawford about it. And, by the way, I nearly forgot to say that she charges Carl with taking money from her bureau drawer before he went away. It was a large sum, too — twenty-five dollars.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is false!” exclaimed Gilbert, indignantly. “I am surprised that you should believe such a thing of your own son.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford says she has proof,” said the doctor, hesitating.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then what has he done with the money? I know that he has but thirty-seven cents with him at this time, and he only left home yesterday. If the money has really been taken, I think I know who took it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Peter Cook. He looks mean enough for anything.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What right have you to speak so of Peter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because I caught him stoning a cat this morning. He would have killed the poor thing if I had not interfered. I consider that worse than taking money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I don't know what to say. I can't agree to anything till I have spoken with Mrs. Crawford. Did you say that Carl had but thirty seven cents?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I presume you don't want him to starve?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, of course not. He is my son, though he has behaved badly. Here, give him that!” and Dr. Crawford drew a ten-dollar bill from his wallet, and handed it to Gilbert</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir. This money will be very useful. Besides, it will show Carl that his father is not wholly indifferent to him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course not. Who says that I am a bad father?” asked Dr. Crawford, peevishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think, sir, there would be any difficulty between you and Carl if you had not married again.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl has no right to vex Mrs. Crawford. Besides, he can't agree with Peter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is that his fault or Peter's?” asked Gilbert, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not acquainted with the circumstances, but Mrs. Crawford says that Carl is always bullying Peter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He never bullied anyone at school.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is there anything, else you want?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; Carl only took away a little underclothing in a gripsack. He would like his woolen clothes put in his trunk, and to have it sent — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps it had better be sent to my house. There are one or two things in his room also that he asked me to get.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why didn't he come himself?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because he thought it would be unpleasant for him to meet Mrs. Crawford. They would be sure to quarrel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, perhaps he is right,” said Dr. Crawford, with an air of relief. “About the allowance, I shall have to consult my wife. Will you come with me to the house?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I should like to have the matter settled to-day, so that Carl will know what to depend upon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert rather dreaded the interview he was likely to have with Mrs. Crawford; but he was acting for Carl, and his feelings of friendship were strong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he walked beside Dr. Crawford till they reached the tasteful dwelling occupied as a residence by Carl and his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How happy Carl could he here, if he had a stepmother like mine,” Gilbert thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They went up to the front door, which was opened for them by a servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jane, is Mrs. Crawford in?” asked the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; not just now. She went to the village to do some shopping.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is Peter in?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you will have to wait till they return.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can't I go up to Carl's room and be packing his things?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I think you may. I don't think Mrs. Crawford would object.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good heavens! Hasn't the man a mind of his own?” thought Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jane, you may show this young gentleman up to Master Carl's room, and give him the key of his trunk. He is going to pack his clothes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When is Master Carl coming back?” asked Jane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I don't know. I think he will be away for a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish it was Peter instead of him,” said Jane, in a low voice, only audible to Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She showed Gilbert the way upstairs, while the doctor went to his study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you a friend of Master Carl's?” asked Jane, as soon as they were alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Jane.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And where is he?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At my house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he goin' to stay there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“For a short time. He wants to go out into the world and make his own living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And no wonder — poor boy! It's hard times he had here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn't Mrs. Crawford treat him well?” asked Gilbert, with curiosity</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is it trate him well? She was a-jawin' an' a-jawin' him from mornin' till night. Ugh, but she's an ugly cr'atur'!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How about Peter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He's just as bad — the m'anest bye I iver set eyes on. It would do me good to see him flogged.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She chatted a little longer with Gilbert, helping him to find Carl's clothes, when suddenly a shrill voice was heard calling her from below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Shure, it's the madam!” said Jane, shrugging her shoulders. “I expect she's in a temper;” and she rose from her knees and hurried downstairs.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V. CARL'S STEPMOTHER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FIVE minutes later, as Gilbert was closing the trunk, Jane reappeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The doctor and Mrs. Crawford would like to see you downstairs,” she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert followed Jane into the library, where Dr. Crawford and his wife were seated. He looked with interest at the woman who had made home so disagreeable to Carl, and was instantly prejudiced against her. She was light complexioned, with very light-brown hair, cold, gray eyes, and a disagreeable expression which seemed natural to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear,” said the doctor, “this is the young man who has come from Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford surveyed Gilbert with an expression by no means friendly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is your name?” she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gilbert Vance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did Carl Crawford send you here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I volunteered to come.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did he tell you that he was disobedient and disrespectful to me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he told me that you treated him so badly that he was unwilling to live in the same house with you,” answered Gilbert, boldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, upon my word!” exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, fanning herself vigorously. “Dr. Crawford, did you hear that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And what do you think of it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I think you may have been too hard upon Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Too hard? Why, then, did he not treat me respectfully? This boy seems inclined to be impertinent.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I answered your questions, madam,” said Gilbert, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you side with your friend Carl?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I certainly do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford bit her lip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the object of your coming? Does Carl wish to return?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thought Dr. Crawford might have told you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl wants his clothes sent to him,” said the doctor. “He only carried a few with him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall not consent to it. He deserves no favors at our hands.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was too much even for Dr. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You go too far, Mrs. Crawford,” he said. “I am sensible of the boy's faults, but I certainly will not allow his clothes to be withheld from him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, well! spoil him if you choose!” said the lady, sullenly. “Take his part against your wife!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have never done that, but I will not allow him to be defrauded of his clothes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no more to say,” said Mrs. Crawford, her eyes snapping. She was clearly mortified at her failure to carry her point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you wish the trunk to be sent to your house?” asked the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I have packed the clothes and locked the trunk.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like to examine it before it goes,” put in Mrs. Crawford, spitefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To make sure that nothing has been put in that does not belong to Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you mean to accuse me of stealing, madam?” demanded Gilbert, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford tossed her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know anything about you,” she replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dr. Crawford, am I to open the trunk?” asked Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” answered the doctor, with unwonted decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hate that boy! He has twice subjected me to mortification,” thought Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know very well,” she said, turning to her husband, “that I have grounds for my request. I blush to mention it, but I have reason to believe that your son took a wallet containing twenty-five dollars from my bureau drawer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I deny it!” said Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you know about it, I should like to ask?” sneered Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know that Carl is an honorable boy, incapable of theft, and at this moment has but thirty-seven cents in his possession.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So far as you know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If the money has really disappeared, madam, you had better ask your own boy about it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is insufferable!” exclaimed Mrs. Crawford, her light eyes emitting angry flashes. “Who dares to say that Peter took the wallet?” she went on, rising to her feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was an unexpected reply. Jane entered the room at this moment to ask a question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I say so, ma'am,” she rejoined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What?” ejaculated Mrs. Crawford, with startling emphasis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't mean to say anything about it till I found you were charging it on Master Carl. I saw Peter open your bureau drawer, take out the wallet, and put it in his pocket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a lie!” said Mrs. Crawford, hoarsely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's the truth, though I suppose you don't want to believe it. If you want to know what he did with the money ask him how much he paid for the gold ring he bought of the jeweler down at the village.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are a spy — a base, dishonorable spy!” cried Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't say what you are, ma'am, to bring false charges against Master Carl, and I wonder the doctor will believe them.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leave the house directly, you hussy!” shrieked Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If I do, I wonder who'll get the dinner?” remarked Jane, not at all disturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't stay here to be insulted,” said the angry lady. “Dr. Crawford, you might have spirit enough to defend your wife.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She flounced out of the room, not waiting for a reply, leaving the doctor dazed and flurried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope, sir, you are convinced now that Carl did not take Mrs. Crawford's money,” said Gilbert. “I told you it was probably Peter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you sure of what you said, Jane?” asked the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir. I saw Peter take the wallet with my own eyes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is his mother's money, and they must settle it between them I am glad Carl did not take it. Really, this has been a very unpleasant scene.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sorry for my part in it. Carl is my friend, and I feel that I ought to stand up for his rights,” remarked Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, certainly, that is right. But you see how I am placed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see that this is no place for Carl. If you will allow me, I will send an expressman for the trunk, and take it with me to the station.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I see no objection. I — I would invite you to dinner, but Mrs. Crawford seems to be suffering from a nervous attack, and it might not be pleasant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I agree with you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Peter entered the room, and looked at Gilbert with surprise and wrath, remembering his recent discomfiture at the hands of the young visitor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My stepson, Peter,” announced Dr. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Peter and I have met before,” said Gilbert, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are you here for?” asked Peter, rudely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not to see you,” answered Gilbert, turning from him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My mother'll have something to say to you,” went on Peter, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She will have something to say to you,” retorted Gilbert. “She has found out who stole her money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter's face turned scarlet instantly, and he left the room hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps I ought not to have said that, Dr Crawford,” added Gilbert, apologetically, “but I dislike that boy very much, and couldn't help giving him as good as he sent.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is all very unpleasant,” responded Dr. Crawford, peevishly. “I don't see why I can't live in peace and tranquility.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't intrude upon you any longer,” said Gilbert, “if you will kindly tell me whether you will consent to make Carl a small weekly allowance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't say now. I want time to think. Give me your address, and I will write to Carl in your care.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gilbert left the house and made arrangements to have Carl's trunk called for. It accompanied him on the next train to Warren.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI. MRS. CRAWFORD'S LETTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“HOW did you like my stepmother?” asked Carl, when Gilbert returned in the afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She's a daisy!” answered Gilbert, shrugging his shoulders. “I don't think I ever saw a more disagreeable woman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you blame me for leaving home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I only wonder you have been able to stay so long. I had a long conversation with your father.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford has made a different man of him. I should have no trouble in getting along with him if there was no one to come between us.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He gave me this for you,” said Gilbert, producing the ten-dollar bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did my stepmother know of his sending it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; she was opposed to sending your trunk, but your father said emphatically you should have it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad he showed that much spirit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have some hopes that he will make you an allowance of a few dollars a week.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That would make me all right, but I don't expect it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will probably hear from your father to-morrow or next day, so you will have to make yourself contented a little longer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you are not very homesick, Mr. Crawford?” said Julia, coquettishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would ask nothing better than to stay here permanently,” rejoined Carl, earnestly. “This is a real home. I have met with more kindness here than in six months at my own home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have one staunch friend at home,” said Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't allude to Peter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So far as I can judge, he hates you like poison. I mean Jane.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Jane is a real friend. She has been in the family for ten years. She was a favorite with my own mother, and feels an interest in me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way, your stepmother's charge that you took a wallet containing money from her drawer has been disproved by Jane. She saw Peter abstracting the money, and so informed Mrs. Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not at all surprised. Peter is mean enough to steal or do anything else. What did my stepmother say?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She was very angry, and threatened to discharge Jane; but, as no one would be left to attend to the dinner, I presume she is likely to stay.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I ought to be forming some plan,” said Carl, thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wait till you hear from home. Julia will see that your time is well filled up till then. Dismiss all care, and enjoy yourself while you may.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed to be sensible advice, and Carl followed it. In the evening some young people were invited in, and there was a round of amusements that made Carl forget that he was an exile from home, with very dubious prospects.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are all spoiling me,” he said, as Gilbert and he went upstairs to bed. “I am beginning to understand the charms of home. To go out into the world from here will be like taking a cold shower bath.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never forget, Carl, that you will be welcome back, whenever you feel like coming,” said Gilbert, laying his band affectionately on Carl's shoulder. “We all like you here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, old fellow! I appreciate the kindness I have received here; but I must strike out for myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you feel about it, Carl?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope for the best. I am young, strong and willing to work. There must be an opening for me somewhere.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning, just after breakfast, a letter arrived for Carl, mailed at Edgewood Center.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is it from your father?” asked Gilbert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; it is in the handwriting of my stepmother. I can guess from that that it contains no good news.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the letter, and as he read it his face expressed disgust and annoyance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Read it, Gilbert,” he said, handing him the open sheet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the missive:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“CARL CRAWFORD: — AS your father has a nervous attack, brought on by your misconduct, he has authorized me to write to you. As you are but sixteen, he could send for you and have you forcibly brought back, but deems it better for you to follow your own course and suffer the punishment of your obstinate and perverse conduct. The boy whom you sent here proved a fitting messenger. He seems, if possible, to be even worse than yourself. He was very impertinent to me, and made a brutal and unprovoked attack on my poor boy, Peter, whose devotion to your father and myself forms an agreeable contrast to your studied disregard of our wishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your friend had the assurance to ask for a weekly allowance for you while a voluntary exile from the home where you have been only too well treated. In other words, you want to be paid for your disobedience. Even if your father were weak enough to think of complying with this extraordinary request, I should do my best to dissuade him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Small doubt of that!” said Carl, bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In my sorrow for your waywardness, I am comforted by the thought that Peter is too good and conscientious ever to follow your example. While you are away, he will do his utmost to make up to your father for his disappointment in you. That you may grow wise in time, and turn at length from the error of your ways, is the earnest hope of your stepmother,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANASTASIA CRAWFORD.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It makes me sick to read such a letter as that, Gilbert,” said Carl. “And to have that sneak and thief — as he turned out to be — Peter, set up as a model for me, is a little too much.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I never knew there were such women in the world!” returned Gilbert. “I can understand your feelings perfectly, after my interview of yesterday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She thinks even worse of you than of me,” said Carl, with a faint smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no doubt Peter shares her sentiments. I didn't make many friends in your family, it must be confessed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You did me a service, Gilbert, and I shall not soon forget it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did your stepmother come from?” asked Gilbert, thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. My father met her at some summer resort. She was staying in the same boarding house, she and the angelic Peter. She lost no time in setting her cap for my father, who was doubtless reported to her as a man of property, and she succeeded in capturing him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder at that. She doesn't seem very fascinating.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She made herself very agreeable to my father, and was even affectionate in her manner to me, though I couldn't get to like her. The end was that she became Mrs. Crawford. Once installed in our house, she soon threw off the mask and showed herself in her true colors, a cold-hearted, selfish and disagreeable woman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder your father doesn't recognize her for what she is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She is very artful, and is politic enough to treat him well. She has lost no opportunity of prejudicing him against me. If he were not an invalid she would find her task more difficult.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did she have any property when your father married her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not that I have been able to discover. She is scheming to have my father leave the lion's share of his property to her and Peter. I dare say she will succeed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let us hope your father will live till you are a young man, at least, and better able to cope with her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I earnestly hope so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your father is not an old man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is fifty-one, but he is not strong. I believe he has liver complaint. At any rate, I know that when, at my stepmother's instigation, he applied to an insurance company to insure his life for her benefit, the application was rejected.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't know anything of Mrs. Crawford's antecedents?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What was her name before she married your father?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She was a Mrs. Cook. That, as you know, is Peter's name.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps, in your travels, you may learn something of her history.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't leave us to-morrow?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I must go to-day. I know now that I must depend wholly upon my own exertions, and I must get to work as soon as possible.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will write to me, Carl?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, when I have anything agreeable to write.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let us hope that will be soon.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII. ENDS IN A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL obtained permission to leave his trunk at the Vance mansion, merely taking out what he absolutely needed for a change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When I am settled I will send for it,” he said. “Now I shouldn't know what to do with it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were cordial good-bys, and Carl started once more on the tramp. He might, indeed, have traveled by rail, for he had ten dollars and thirty-seven cents; but it occurred to him that in walking he might meet with some one who would give him employment. Besides, he was not in a hurry to get on, nor had he any definite destination. The day was fine, there was a light breeze, and he experienced a hopeful exhilaration as he walked lightly on, with the world before him, and any number of possibilities in the way of fortunate adventures that might befall him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had walked five miles, when, to the left, he saw an elderly man hard at work in a hay field. He was leaning on his rake, and looking perplexed and troubled. Carl paused to rest, and as he looked over the rail fence, attracted the attention of the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I say, young feller, where are you goin'?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know — exactly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't know where you are goin'?” repeated the farmer, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl laughed. “I am going out in the world to seek my fortune,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You be? Would you like a job?” asked the farmer, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What sort of a job?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'd like to have you help me hayin'. My hired man is sick, and he's left me in a hole. It's goin' to rain, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Going to rain?” repeated Carl, in surprise, as he looked up at the nearly cloudless sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. It don't look like it, I know, but old Job Hagar say it'll rain before night, and what he don't know about the weather ain't worth knowin'. I want to get the hay on this meadow into the barn, and then I'll feel safe, rain or shine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And you want me to help you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; you look strong and hardy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I am pretty strong,” said Carl, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, what do you say?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right. I'll help you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl gave a spring and cleared the fence, landing in the hay field, having first thrown his valise over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're pretty spry,” said the farmer. “I couldn't do that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, you're too heavy,” said Carl, smiling, as he noted the clumsy figure of his employer. “Now, what shall I do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take that rake and rake up the hay. Then we'll go over to the barn and get the hay wagon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where is your barn?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The farmer pointed across the fields to a story-and-a-half farmhouse, and standing near it a good-sized barn, brown from want of paint and exposure to sun and rain. The buildings were perhaps twenty-five rods distant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you used to hayin'?” asked the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, no, not exactly; though I've handled a rake before.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl's experience, however, had been very limited. He had, to be sure, had a rake in his hand, but probably he had not worked more than ten minutes at it. However, raking is easily learned, and his want of experience was not detected. He started off with great enthusiasm, but after a while thought it best to adopt the more leisurely movements of the farmer. After two hours his hands began to blister, but still he kept on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have got to make my living by hard work,” he said to himself, “and it won't do to let such a little thing as a blister interfere.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he had been working a couple of hours, he began to feel hungry. His walk, and the work he had been doing, sharpened his appetite till he really felt uncomfortable. It was at this time — just twelve o'clock — that the farmer's wife came to the front door and blew a fish horn so vigorously that it could probably have been heard half a mile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The old woman's got dinner ready,” said the farmer. “If you don't mind takin' your pay in victuals, you can go along home with me, and take a bite.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I could take two or three, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ho, ho! that's a good joke! Money's scarce, and I'd rather pay in victuals, if it's all the same to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you generally find people willing to work for their board?” asked Carl, who knew that he was being imposed upon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I might pay a leetle more. You work for me till sundown, and I'll give you dinner and supper, and — fifteen cents.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl wanted to laugh. At this rate of compensation he felt that it would take a long time to make a fortune, but he was so hungry that he would have accepted board alone if it had been necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I agree,” he said. “Shall I leave my rake here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; it'll be all right.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll take along my valise, for I can't afford to run any risk of losing it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Jest as you say.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Five minutes brought them to the farmhouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can I wash my hands?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, you can go right to the sink and wash in the tin basin. There's a roll towel behind the door. Mis' Perkins” — that was the way he addressed his wife — “this is a young chap that I've hired to help me hayin'. You can set a chair for him at the table.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right, Silas. He don't look very old, though.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, ma'am. I ain't twenty-one yet,” answered Carl, who was really sixteen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shouldn't say you was. You ain't no signs of a mustache.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I keep it short, ma'am, in warm weather,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It don't dull a razor any to cut it in cold weather, does it?” asked the farmer, chuckling at his joke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, no, sir; I can't say it does.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a boiled dinner that the farmer's wife provided, corned beef and vegetables, but the plebeian meal seemed to Carl the best he ever ate. Afterwards there was apple pudding, to which he did equal justice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I never knew work improved a fellow's appetite so,” reflected the young traveler. “I never ate with so much relish at home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After dinner they went back to the field and worked till the supper hour, five o'clock. By that time all the hay had been put into the barn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We've done a good day's work,” said the farmer, in a tone of satisfaction, “and only just in time. Do you see that dark cloud?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In half an hour there'll be rain, or I'm mistaken. Old Job Hagar is right after all.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The farmer proved a true prophet. In half an hour, while they were at the supper table, the rain began to come down in large drops — forming pools in the hollows of the ground, and drenching all exposed objects with the largesse of the heavens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where war you a-goin' to-night?” asked the farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was thinkin' that I'd give you a night's lodgin' in place of the fifteen cents I agreed to pay you. Money's very skeerce with me, and will be till I've sold off some of the crops.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall be glad to make that arrangement,” said Carl, who had been considering how much the farmer would ask for lodging, for there seemed small chance of continuing his journey. Fifteen cents was a lower price than he had calculated on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's a sensible idea!” said the farmer, rubbing his hands with satisfaction at the thought that he had secured valuable help at no money outlay whatever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning Carl continued his tramp, refusing the offer of continued employment on the same terms. He was bent on pursuing his journey, though he did not know exactly where he would fetch up in the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At twelve o'clock that day he found himself in the outskirts of a town, with the same uncomfortable appetite that he had felt the day before, but with no hotel or restaurant anywhere near. There was, however, a small house, the outer door of which stood conveniently open. Through the open window, Carl saw a table spread as if for dinner, and he thought it probable that he could arrange to become a boarder for a single meal. He knocked at the door, but no one came. He shouted out: “Is anybody at home?” and received no answer. He went to a small barn just outside and peered in, but no one was to be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What should he do? He was terribly hungry, and the sight of the food on the table was tantalizing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll go in, as the door is open,” he decided, “and sit down to the table and eat. Somebody will be along before I get through, and I'll pay whatever is satisfactory, for eat I must.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered, seated himself, and ate heartily. Still no one appeared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't want to go off without paying,” thought Carl. “I'll see if I can find somebody.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the door into the kitchen, but it was deserted. Then he opened that of a small bedroom, and started back in terror and dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There suspended from a hook — a man of middle age was hanging, with his head bent forward, his eyes wide open, and his tongue protruding from his mouth!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII. CARL FALLS UNDER SUSPICION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To a person of any age such a sight as that described at the close of the last chapter might well have proved startling. To a boy like Carl it was simply overwhelming. It so happened that he had but twice seen a dead person, and never a victim of violence. The peculiar circumstances increased the effect upon his mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He placed his hand upon the man's face, and found that he was still warm. He could have been dead but a short time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What shall I do?” thought Carl, perplexed. “This is terrible!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then it flashed upon him that as he was alone with the dead man suspicion might fall upon him as being concerned in what night be called a murder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had better leave here at once,” he reflected. “I shall have to go away without paying for my meal.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He started to leave the house, but had scarcely reached the door when two persons — a man and a woman — entered. Both looked at Carl with suspicion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are you doing here?” asked the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I beg your pardon,” answered Carl; “I was very hungry, and seeing no one about, took the liberty to sit down at the table and eat. I am willing to pay for my dinner if you will tell me how much it amounts to.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wasn't my husband here?” asked the woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I am afraid something has happened to your husband,” faltered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl silently pointed to the chamber door. The woman opened it, and uttered a loud shriek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here, Walter!” she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her companion quickly came to her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My husband is dead!” cried the woman; “basely murdered, and there,” pointing fiercely to Carl, “there stands the murderer!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Madam, you cannot believe this!” said Carl, naturally agitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What have you to say for yourself?” demanded the man, suspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I only just saw — your husband,” continued Carl, addressing himself to the woman. “I had finished my meal, when I began to search for some one whom I could pay, and so opened this door into the room beyond, when I saw — him hanging there!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't believe him, the red-handed murderer!” broke out the woman, fiercely. “He is probably a thief; he killed my poor husband, and then sat down like a cold-blooded villain that he is, and gorged himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Things began to look very serious for poor Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your husband is larger and stronger than myself,” he urged, desperately. “How could I overpower him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It looks reasonable, Maria,” said the man. “I don't see how the boy could have killed Mr. Brown, or lifted him upon the hook, even if he did not resist.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He murdered him, I tell you, he murdered him!” shrieked the woman, who seemed bereft of reason. “I call upon you to arrest him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not a constable, Maria.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then tie him so he cannot get away, and go for a constable. I wouldn't feel safe with him in the house, unless he were tied fast. He might hang me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Terrible as the circumstances were, Carl felt an impulse to laugh. It seemed absurd to hear himself talked of in this way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tie me if you like!” he said. “I am willing to wait here till some one comes who has a little common sense. Just remember that I am only a boy, and haven't the strength of a full-grown man!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The boy is right, Maria! It's a foolish idea of yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I call upon you to tie the villain!” insisted the woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just as you say! Can you give me some rope?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From a drawer Mrs. Brown drew a quantity of strong cord, and the man proceeded to tie Carl's hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tie his feet, too, Walter!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Even if you didn't tie me, I would promise to remain here. I don't want anybody to suspect me of such a thing,” put in Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How artful he is!” said Mrs. Brown. “Tie him strong, Walter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two were left alone, Carl feeling decidedly uncomfortable. The newly-made widow laid her head upon the table and moaned, glancing occasionally at the body of her husband, as it still hung suspended from the hook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, William, I little expected to find you dead!” she groaned. “I only went to the store to buy a pound of salt, and when I come back, I find you cold and still, the victim of a young ruffian! How could you be so wicked?” she demanded fiercely of Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have told you that I had nothing to do with your husband's death, madam.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who killed him, then?” she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. He must have committed suicide.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't think you are going to escape in that way. I won't rest till I see you hung!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I had never entered the house,” thought Carl, uncomfortably. “I would rather have gone hungry for twenty four hours longer than find myself in such a position.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Half an hour passed. Then a sound of voices was heard outside, and half a dozen men entered, including besides the messenger, the constable and a physician.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why was he not cut down?” asked the doctor, hastily. “There might have been a chance to resuscitate him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't think of it,” said the messenger. “Maria was so excited, and insisted that the boy murdered him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was pointed out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That boy? What nonsense!” exclaimed Dr. Park. “Why, it would be more than you or I could do to overpower and hang a man weighing one hundred and seventy-five pounds.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's what I thought, but Maria seemed crazed like.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I tell you he did it! Are you going to let him go, the red-handed murderer?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Loose the cord, and I will question the boy,” said Dr. Park, with an air of authority.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl breathed a sigh of relief, when, freed from his bonds, he stood upright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll tell you all I know,” he said, “but it won't throw any light upon the death.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Park listened attentively, and asked one or two questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you hear any noise when you were sitting at the table?” he inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was the door closed?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That of itself would probably prevent your hearing anything. Mrs. Brown, at what hour did you leave the house?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At ten minutes of twelve.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is now five minutes of one. The deed must have been committed just after you left the house. Had you noticed anything out of the way in your — husband's manner?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, not much. He was always a silent man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Had anything happened to disturb him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He got a letter this morning. I don't know what was in it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We had better search for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The body was taken down and laid on the bed. Dr. Park searched the pockets, and found a half sheet of note paper, on which these lines were written:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“MARIA: — I have made up my mind I can live no longer. I have made a terrible discovery. When I married you, I thought my first wife, who deserted me four years ago, dead. I learn by a letter received this morning that she is still living in a town of Illinois. The only thing I can do is to free you both from my presence. When you come back from the store you will find me cold and dead. The little that I leave behind I give to you. If my first wife should come here, as she threatens, you can tell her so. Good-by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WILLI AM.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The reading of this letter made a sensation. Mrs. Brown went into hysterics, and there was a scene of confusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think I can go?” Carl asked Dr. Park.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. There is nothing to connect you with the sad event.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl gladly left the cottage, and it was only when he was a mile on his way that he remembered that he had not paid for his dinner, after all.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX. A PLAUSIBLE STRANGER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THREE days later found Carl still on his travels. It was his custom to obtain his meals at a cheap hotel, or, if none were met with, at a farmhouse, and to secure lodgings where he could, and on as favorable terms as possible. He realized the need of economy, and felt that he was practicing it. He had changed his ten-dollar bill the first day, for a five and several ones. These last were now spent, and the five-dollar bill alone remained to him. He had earned nothing, though everywhere he had been on the lookout for a job.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Toward the close of the last day he overtook a young man of twenty-five, who was traveling in the same direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-afternoon,” said the young man, sociably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-afternoon, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you bound, may I ask?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To the next town.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Fillmore?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, if that is the name.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So am I. Why shouldn't we travel together?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no objection,” said Carl, who was glad of company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you in any business?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, but I hope to find a place.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, a smart boy like you will soon find employment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope so, I am sure. I haven't much money left, and it is necessary I should do something.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just so. I am a New York salesman, but just now I am on my vacation — taking a pedestrian tour with knapsack and staff, as you see. The beauty of it is that my salary runs on just as if I were at my post, and will nearly pay all my traveling expenses.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are in luck. Besides you have a good place to go back to. There isn't any vacancy, is there? You couldn't take on a boy?” asked Carl, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, there might be a chance,” said the young man, slowly. “You haven't any recommendations with you, have you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I have never been employed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It doesn't matter. I will recommend you myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You might be deceived in me,” said Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll take the risk of that. I know a reliable boy when I see him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you. What is the name of your firm?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“F. Brandes &amp; Co., commission merchants, Pearl Street. My own name is Chauncy Hubbard, at your service.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's a good name. I predict that we shall be great chums, if I manage to get you a place in our establishment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is Mr. Brandes a good man to work for?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, he is easy and good-natured. He is liberal to his clerks. What salary do you think I get?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I couldn't guess.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Forty dollars a week, and I am only twenty-five. Went into the house at sixteen, and worked my way up.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have certainly done well,” said Carl, respectfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I'm no slouch, if I do say it myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't wonder your income pays the expenses of your vacation trip.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It ought to, that's a fact, though I'm rather free handed and like to spend money. My prospects are pretty good in another direction. Old Fred Brandes has a handsome daughter, who thinks considerable of your humble servant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think there is any chance of marrying her?” asked Carl, with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think my chance is pretty good, as the girl won't look at anybody else.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is Mr. Brandes wealthy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, the old man's pretty well fixed, worth nearly half a million, I guess.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps he will take you into the firm,” suggested Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very likely. That's what I'm working for.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At any rate, you ought to save something out of your salary.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I ought, but I haven't. The fact is, Carl,” said Chauncy Hubbard, in a burst of confidence, I have a great mind to make a confession to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall feel flattered, I am sure,” said Carl, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have one great fault — I gamble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you?” said Carl, rather startled, for he had been brought up very properly to have a horror of gambling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I suppose it's in my blood. My father was a very rich man at one time, but he lost nearly all his fortune at the gaming table.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That ought to have been a warning to you, I should think.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It ought, and may be yet, for I am still a young man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Hubbard,” said Carl, earnestly, “I feel rather diffident about advising you, for I am only a boy, but I should think you would give up such a dangerous habit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Say no more, Carl! You are a true friend. I will try to follow your advice. Give me your hand.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl did so, and felt a warm glow of pleasure at the thought that perhaps he had redeemed his companion from a fascinating vice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I really wish I had a sensible boy like you to be my constant companion. I should feel safer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you really have such a passion for gambling, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; if at the hotel to-night I should see a party playing poker, I could not resist joining them. Odd, isn't it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad I have no such temptation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, you are lucky. By the way, how much money have you about you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Five dollars.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you can do me a favor. I have a ten-dollar bill, which I need to get me home. Now, I would like to have you keep a part of it for me till I go away in the morning. Give me your five, and I will hand you ten. Out of that you can pay my hotel bill and hand me the balance due me in the morning.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you really wish me to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Enough said. Here is the ten.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl took the bill, and gave Mr. Hubbard his five-dollar note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are placing considerable confidence in me,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am, it is true, but I have no fear of being deceived. You are a boy who naturally inspires confidence.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl thought Mr. Chauncy Hubbard a very agreeable and sensible fellow, and he felt flattered to think that the young man had chosen him as a guardian, so to speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way, Carl, you haven't told me,” said Hubbard, as they pursued their journey, “how a boy like yourself is forced to work his own way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can tell you the reason very briefly — I have a stepmother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I understand. Is your father living?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But he thinks more of the stepmother than of you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid he does.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have my sympathy, Carl. I will do all I can to help you. If you can only get a place in our establishment, you will be all right. Step by step you will rise, till you come to stand where I do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That would satisfy me. Has Mr. Brandes got another daughter?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, there is only one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I shall have to be content with the forty dollars a week. If I ever get it, I will save half.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I could.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can if you try. Why, you might have two thousand dollars saved up now, if you had only begun to save in time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have lost more than that at the gaming table. You will think me very foolish.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I do,” said Carl, frankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are right. But here we are almost at the village.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is there a good hotel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes — the Fillmore. We will take adjoining rooms if you say so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And in the morning you will pay the bill?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two travelers had a good supper, and retired early, both being fatigued with the journey. It was not till eight o'clock the next morning that Carl opened his eyes. He dressed hastily, and went down to breakfast. He was rather surprised not to see his companion of the day before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Has Mr. Hubbard come down yet?” he asked at the desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he took an early breakfast, and went off by the first train.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is strange. I was to pay his bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He paid it himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl did not know what to make of this. Had Hubbard forgotten that he had five dollars belonging to him? Fortunately, Carl had his city address, and could refund the money in New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well! I will pay my own bill. How much is it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A dollar and a quarter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl took the ten-dollar bill from his wallet and tendered it to the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of changing it at once, the clerk held it up to the light and examined it critically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't take that bill,” he said, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because it is counterfeit.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl turned pale, and the room seemed to whirl round. It was all the money he had.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X. THE COUNTERFEIT BILL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ARE you sure it is counterfeit?” asked Carl, very much disturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am certain of it. I haven't been handling bank bills for ten years without being able to tell good money from bad. I'll trouble you for another bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's all the money I have,” faltered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here, young man,” said the clerk, sternly, “you are trying a bold game, but it won't succeed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am trying no game at all,” said Carl, plucking up spirit. “I thought the bill was good.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you get it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“From the man who came with me last evening — Mr. Hubbard.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The money he gave me was good.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did he give you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A five-dollar bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was my five-dollar bill,” said Carl, bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your story doesn't seem very probable,” said the clerk, suspiciously. “How did he happen to get your money, and you his?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He told me that he would get to gambling, and wished me to take money enough to pay his bill here. He handed me the ten-dollar bill which you say is bad, and I gave him five in return. I think now he only wanted to get good money for bad.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your story may be true, or it may not,” said the clerk, whose manner indicated incredulity. “That is nothing to me. All you have to do is to pay your hotel bill, and you can settle with Mr. Hubbard when you see him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I have no other money,” said Carl, desperately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I shall feel justified in ordering your arrest on a charge of passing, or trying to pass, counterfeit money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't do that, sir! I will see that you are paid out of the first money I earn.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must think I am soft,” said the clerk, contemptuously. “I have seen persons of your stripe before. I dare say, if you were searched, more counterfeit money would be found in your pockets.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Search me, then!” cried Carl, indignantly. “I am perfectly willing that you should.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Haven't you any relations who will pay your bill?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no one to call upon,” answered Carl, soberly. “Couldn't you let me work it out? I am ready to do any kind of work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Our list of workers is full,” said the clerk, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Carl! he felt that he was decidedly in a tight place. He had never before found himself unable to meet his bills. nor would he have been so placed now but for Hubbard's rascality. A dollar and a quarter seems a small sum, but if you are absolutely penniless it might as well be a thousand. Suppose he should be arrested and the story get into the papers? How his stepmother would exult in the record of his disgrace! He could anticipate what she would say. Peter, too, would rejoice, and between them both his father would be persuaded that he was thoroughly unprincipled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What have you got in your valise?” asked the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Only some underclothing. If there were anything of any value I would cheerfully leave it as security. Wait a minute, though,” he said, with a sudden thought. “Here is a gold pencil! It is worth five dollars; at any rate, it cost more than that. I can place that in your hands.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me see it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl handed the clerk a neat gold pencil, on which his name was inscribed. It was evidently of good quality, and found favor with the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll give you a dollar and a quarter for the pencil,” he said, “and call it square.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wouldn't like to sell it,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't get any more for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wasn't thinking of that; but it was given me by my mother, who is now dead. I would not like to part with anything that she gave me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You would prefer to get off scot-free, I suppose?” retorted the clerk, with a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I am willing to leave it in your hands, but I should like the privilege of redeeming it when I have the money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well,” said the clerk, who reflected that in all probability Carl would never come back for it. “I'll take it on those conditions.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl passed over the pencil with a sigh. He didn't like to part with it, even for a short time, but there seemed no help for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right. I will mark you paid.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl left the hotel, satchel in hand, and as he passed out into the street, reflected with a sinking heart that he was now quite penniless. Where was he to get his dinner, and how was he to provide himself with a lodging that night? At present he was not hungry, having eaten a hearty breakfast at the hotel, but by one o'clock he would feel the need of food. He began to ask himself if, after all, he had not been unwise in leaving home, no matter how badly he had been treated by his stepmother. There, at least, he was certain of living comfortably. Now he was in danger of starvation, and on two occasions already he had incurred suspicion, once of being concerned in a murder, and just now of passing counterfeit money. Ought he to have submitted, and so avoided all these perils?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No!” he finally decided; “I won't give up the ship yet. I am about as badly off as I can be; I am without a cent, and don't know where my next meal is to come from. But my luck may turn — it must turn — it has turned!” he exclaimed with energy, as his wandering glance suddenly fell upon a silver quarter of a dollar, nearly covered up with the dust of the street. “That shall prove a good omen!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stooped over and picked up the coin, which he put in his vest pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was wonderful how the possession of this small sum of money restored his courage and raised his spirits. He was sure of a dinner now, at all events. It looked as if Providence was smiling on him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two miles farther on Carl overtook a boy of about his own age trudging along the road with a rake over his shoulder. He wore overalls, and was evidently a farmer's boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-day!” said Carl, pleasantly, noticing that the boy regarded him with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-day!” returned the country lad, rather bashfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you tell me if there is any place near where I can buy some dinner?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There ain't no tavern, if that's what you mean. I'm goin' home to dinner myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where do you live?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Over yonder.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pointed to a farmhouse about a dozen rods away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think your mother would give me some dinner?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I guess she would. Mam's real accommodatin'.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you ask her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; just come along of me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned into the yard, and followed a narrow path to the back door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll stay here while you ask,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy entered the house, and came out after a brief absence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mam says you're to come in,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl, glad at heart, and feeling quite prepared to eat fifty cents' worth of dinner, followed the boy inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A pleasant-looking, matronly woman, plainly but neatly attired, came forward to greet him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nat says you would like to get some dinner,” she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered Carl. “I hope you'll excuse my applying to you, but your son tells me there is no hotel near by.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The nearest one is three miles away from here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think I can hold out so long,” said Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sit right down with Nat,” said the farmer's wife, hospitably. “Mr. Sweetser won't be home for half an hour. We've got enough, such as it is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evidently Mrs. Sweetser was a good cook. The dinner consisted of boiled mutton, with several kinds of vegetables. A cup of tea and two kinds of pie followed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was hard to tell which of the two boys did fuller justice to the meal. Nat had the usual appetite of a healthy farm boy, and Carl, in spite of his recent anxieties, and narrow escape from serious peril, did not allow himself to fall behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your mother's a fine cook!” said Carl, between two mouthfuls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ain't she, though?” answered Nat, his mouth full of pie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Carl rose from the table he feared that he had eaten more than his little stock of money would pay for.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much will it be, Mrs. Sweetser?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, you're quite welcome to all you've had,” said the good woman, cheerily. “It's plain farmer's fare.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I never tasted a better dinner,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Sweetser seemed pleased with the compliment to her cooking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come again when you are passing this way,” she said. “You will always be welcome to a dinner.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl thanked her heartily, and pressed on his way. Two hours later, at a lonely point of the road, an ill-looking tramp, who had been reclining by the wayside, jumped up, and addressed him in a menacing tone:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Young feller, shell over all the money you have got, or I'll hurt you! I'm hard up, and I won't stand no nonsense.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl started and looked into the face of the tramp. It seemed to him that he had never seen a man more ill-favored, or villainous-looking.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI. THE ARCHERY PRIZE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SITUATED as he was, it seemed, on second thought, rather a joke to Carl to be attacked by a robber. He had but twenty-five cents in good money about him, and that he had just picked up by the merest chance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do I look like a banker?” he asked, humorously. “Why do you want to rob a boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The way you're togged out, you must have something,” growled the tramp, “and I haven't got a penny.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your business doesn't seem to pay, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't you make fun of me, or I'll wring your neck! Just hand over your money and be quick about it! I haven't time to stand fooling here all day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A bright idea came to Carl. He couldn't spare the silver coin, which constituted all his available wealth, but he still had the counterfeit note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't take all my money, will you?” he said, earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much have you got?” asked the tramp, pricking up his ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl, with apparent reluctance, drew out the ten-dollar bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tramp's face lighted up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is your name Vanderbilt?” he asked. “I didn't expect to make such a haul.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can't you give me back a dollar out of it? I don't want to lose all I have.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I haven't got a cent. You'll have to wait till we meet again. So long, boy! You've helped me out of a scrape.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Or into one,” thought Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tramp straightened up, buttoned his dilapidated coat, and walked off with the consciousness of being a capitalist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl watched him with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope I won't meet him after he has discovered that the bill is a counterfeit,” he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He congratulated himself upon being still the possessor of twenty-five cents in silver. It was not much, but it seemed a great deal better than being penniless. A week before he would have thought it impossible that such a paltry sum would have made him feel comfortable, but he had passed through a great deal since then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About the middle of the afternoon he came to a field, in which something appeared to be going on. Some forty or fifty young persons, boys and girls, were walking about the grass, and seemed to be preparing for some interesting event.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl stopped to rest and look on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's going on here?” he asked of a boy who was sitting on the fence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a meeting of the athletic association,” said the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What are they doing?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They try for prizes in jumping, vaulting, archery and so on.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This interested Carl, who excelled in all manly exercises.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose I may stay and look on?” he said, inquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, of course. Jump over the fence and I'll go round with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed pleasant to Carl to associate once more with boys of his own age. Thrown unexpectedly upon his own resources, he had almost forgotten that he was a boy. Face to face with a cold and unsympathizing world, he seemed to himself twenty-five at least.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Those who wish to compete for the archery prize will come forward,” announced Robert Gardiner, a young man of nineteen, who, as Carl learned, was the president of the association. “You all understand the conditions. The entry fee to competitors is ten cents. The prize to the most successful archer is one dollar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Several boys came forward and paid the entrance fee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Would you like to compete?” asked Edward Downie, the boy whose acquaintance Carl had made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am an outsider,” said Carl. “I don't belong to the association.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll speak to the president, if you like.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't want to intrude.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It won't be considered an intrusion. You pay the entrance fee and take your chances.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward went to the president and spoke to him in a low voice. The result was that he advanced to Carl, and said, courteously:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you would like to enter into our games, you are quite at liberty to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you,” responded Carl. “I have had a little practice in archery, and will enter my name for that prize.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paid over his quarter and received back fifteen cents in change. It seemed rather an imprudent outlay, considering his small capital; but he had good hopes of carrying off the prize, and that would be a great lift for him. Seven boys entered besides Carl. The first was Victor Russell, a lad of fourteen, whose arrow went three feet above the mark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The prize is mine if none of you do better than that,” laughed Victor, good-naturedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope not, for the credit of the club,” said the president. “Mr. Crawford, will you shoot next?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would prefer to be the last,” said Carl, modestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“John Livermore, your turn now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John came a little nearer than his predecessor, but did not distinguish himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If that is a specimen of the skill of the clubmen,” thought Carl, “my chance is a good one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next came Frank Stockton, whose arrow stuck only three inches from the center of the target.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good for Fred!” cried Edward Downie. “Just wait till you see me shoot!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you a dangerous rival?” asked Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can hit a barn door if I am only near enough,” replied Edward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Edward Downie!” called the president.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward took his bow and advanced to the proper place, bent it, and the arrow sped on its way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a murmur of surprise when his arrow struck only an inch to the right of the centre. No one was more amazed than Edward himself, for he was accounted far from skillful. It was indeed a lucky accident.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you say to that?” asked Edward, triumphantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think the prize is yours. I had no idea you could shoot like that,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nor I,” rejoined Edward, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl Crawford!” called the president.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl took his position, and bent his bow with the greatest care. He exercised unusual deliberation, for success meant more to him than to any of the others. A dollar to him in his present circumstances would be a small fortune, while the loss of even ten cents would be sensibly felt. His heart throbbed with excitement as he let the arrow speed on its mission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His unusual deliberation, and the fact that he was a stranger, excited strong interest, and all eyes followed the arrow with eager attentiveness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a sudden shout of irrepressible excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl's arrow had struck the bull's-eye and the prize was his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Christopher!” exclaimed Edward Downie, “you've beaten me, after all!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm almost sorry,” said Carl, apologetically, but the light in his eyes hardly bore out the statement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never mind. Everybody would have called it a fluke if I had won,” said Edward. “I expect to get the prize for the long jump. I am good at that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So am I, but I won't compete; I will leave it to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, no. I want to win fair.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl accordingly entered his name. He made the second best jump, but Edward's exceeded his by a couple of inches, and the prize was adjudged to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have my revenge,” he said, smiling. “I am glad I won, for it wouldn't have been to the credit of the club to have an outsider carry off two prizes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am perfectly satisfied,” said Carl; “I ought to be, for I did not expect to carry off any.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl decided not to compete for any other prize. He had invested twenty cents and got back a dollar, which left him a profit of eighty cents. This, with his original quarter, made him the possessor of a dollar and five cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My luck seems to have turned,” he said to himself, and the thought gave him fresh courage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was five o'clock when the games were over, and Carl prepared to start again on his journey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you going to take supper?” asked Downie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — don't — know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come home with me. If you are in no hurry, you may as well stay overnight, and go on in the morning.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you sure it won't inconvenience you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not at all.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I'll accept with thanks.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII. AN ODD ACQUAINTANCE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AFTER breakfast the next morning Carl started again on his way. His new friend, Edward Downie, accompanied him for a mile, having an errand at that distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you good luck, Carl,” he said, earnestly. “When you come this way again, be sure to stop in and see me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will certainly do so, but I hope I may find employment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At any rate,” thought Carl, as he resumed his journey alone, “I am better off than I was yesterday morning. Then I had but twenty-five cents; now I have a dollar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was satisfactory as far as it went, but Carl was sensible that he was making no progress in his plan of earning a living. He was simply living from hand to mouth, and but for good luck he would have had to go hungry, and perhaps have been obliged to sleep out doors. What he wanted was employment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about ten o'clock when, looking along the road, his curiosity was excited by a man of very unusual figure a few rods in advance of him. He looked no taller than a boy of ten; but his frame was large, his shoulders broad, and his arms were of unusual length. He might properly be called a dwarf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad I am not so small as that,” thought Carl. “I am richer than he in having a good figure. I should not like to excite attention wherever I go by being unusually large or unusually small.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some boys would have felt inclined to laugh at the queer figure, but Carl had too much good feeling. His curiosity certainly was aroused, and he thought he would like to get acquainted with the little man, whose garments of fine texture showed that, though short in stature, he was probably long in purse. He didn't quite know how to pave the way for an acquaintance, but circumstances favored him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little man drew out a handkerchief from the side pocket of his overcoat. With it fluttered out a bank bill, which fell to the ground apparently unobserved by the owner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl hurried on, and, picking up the bill, said to the small stranger as he touched his arm: “Here is some money you just dropped, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little man turned round and smiled pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you. Are you sure it is mine?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; it came out with your handkerchief.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me see. So it is mine. I was very careless to put it loose in my pocket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You were rather careless, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of what denomination is it?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a two-dollar note.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you had been a poor boy,” said the little man, eying Carl keenly, “you might have been tempted to keep it. I might not have known.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What makes you think I am not a poor boy?” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are well dressed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is true; but all the money I have is a dollar and five cents.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know where to get more? You have a good home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had a home, but now I am thrown on my own exertions,” said Carl, soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear me! That is bad! If I were better acquainted, I might ask more particularly how this happens. Are you an orphan?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; my father is living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And your mother is dead?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is your father a poor man?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; he is moderately rich.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yet you have to fight your own way?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir. I have a stepmother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see. Are you sure you are not unreasonably prejudiced against your stepmother? All stepmothers are not bad or unkind.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know that, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yours is, I presume?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can judge for yourself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl recited some incidents in his experience with his stepmother. The stranger listened with evident interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not in general in favor of boys leaving home except on extreme provocation,” he said, after a pause; “but in your case, as your father seems to take part against you, I think you may be justified, especially as, at your age, you have a fair chance of making your own living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad you think that, sir. I have begun to wonder whether I have not acted rashly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In undertaking to support yourself?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How old are you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sixteen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At fourteen I was obliged to undertake what you have now before you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To support yourself?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I was left an orphan at fourteen, with no money left me by my poor father, and no relatives who could help me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you make out, sir?” asked Carl, feeling very much interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I sold papers for a while — in Newark, New Jersey — then I got a place at three dollars a week, out of which I had to pay for board, lodging and clothes. Well, I won't go through my history. I will only say that whatever I did I did as well as I could. I am now a man of about middle age, and I am moderately wealthy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am very much encouraged by what you tell me, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps you don't understand what a hard struggle I had. More than once I have had to go to bed hungry. Sometimes I have had to sleep out, but one mustn't be afraid to rough it a little when he is young. I shouldn't like to sleep out now, or go to bed without my supper,” and the little man laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I expect to rough it, but if I could only get a situation, at no matter what income, I should feel encouraged.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have earned no money yet?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I earned a dollar yesterday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At what kind of work?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Archery.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little man looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is that a business?” he asked, curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll explain how it was,” and Carl told about the contest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So you hit the mark?” said the little man, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somehow, there was something in the little man's tone that put new courage into Carl, and incited him to fresh effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder, sir,” he said, after a pause, “that you should be walking, when you can well afford to ride.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little man smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is by advice of my physician,” he said. “He tells me I am getting too stout, and ought to take more or less exercise in the open air. So I am trying to follow his advice ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you in business near here, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At a large town six miles distant. I may not walk all the way there, but I have a place to call at near by, and thought I would avail myself of the good chance offered to take a little exercise. I feel repaid. I have made a pleasant acquaintance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is my card,” and the little man took out a business card, reading thus: HENRY JENNINGS, FURNITURE WAREHOUSE, MILFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I manufacture my furniture in the country,” he continued, “but I ship it by special arrangements to a house in New York in which I am also interested.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, I see. Do you employ many persons in your establishment?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“About thirty.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think you could make room for me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think you would like the business?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am prepared to like any business in which I can make a living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is right. That is the way to look at it. Let me think.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For two minutes Mr. Jennings seemed to be plunged in thought. Then he turned and smiled encouragingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can come home with me,” he said, “and I will consider the matter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir,” said Carl, gladly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have got to make a call at the next house, not on business, though. There is an old schoolmate lying there sick. I am afraid he is rather poor, too. You can walk on slowly, and I will overtake you in a few minutes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“After walking half a mile, if I have not overtaken you, you may sit down under a tree and wait for me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Before I leave you I will tell you a secret.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The two dollars you picked up, I dropped on purpose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On purpose?” asked Carl, in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I wanted to try you, to see if you were honest.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you had noticed me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. I liked your appearance, but I wanted to test you.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. AN UNEQUAL CONTEST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL walked on slowly. He felt encouraged by the prospect of work, for he was sure that Mr. Jennings would make a place for him, if possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is evidently a kind-hearted man,” Carl reflected. “Besides, he has been poor himself, and he can sympathize with me. The wages may be small, but I won't mind that, if I only support myself economically, and get on.” To most boys brought up in comfort, not to say luxury, the prospect of working hard for small pay would not have seemed inviting. But Carl was essentially manly, and had sensible ideas about labor. It was no sacrifice or humiliation to him to become a working boy, for he had never considered himself superior to working boys, as many boys in his position would have done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked on in a leisurely manner, and at the end of ten minutes thought he had better sit down and wait for Mr. Jennings. But he was destined to receive a shock. There, under the tree which seemed to offer the most inviting shelter, reclined a figure only too well-known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was the tramp who the day before had compelled him to surrender the ten-dollar bill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ill-looking fellow glanced up, and when his gaze rested upon Carl, his face beamed with savage joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So it's you, is it?” he said, rising from his seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered Carl, doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you remember me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have cause to remember you, my chicken. That was a mean trick you played upon me,” and he nodded his head significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should think it was you that played the trick on me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you make that out?” growled the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You took my money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I did, and much good it did me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know why, don't you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl might have denied that he knew the character of the bill which was stolen from him, but I am glad to say that it would have come from him with a very ill grace, for he was accustomed to tell the truth under all circumstances.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You knew that the bill was counterfeit, didn't you?” demanded the tramp, fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was told so at the hotel where I offered it in payment for my bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yet you passed it on me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't pass it on you. You took it from me,” retorted Carl, with spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That makes no difference.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think it does. I wouldn't have offered it to anyone in payment of an honest bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Humph! you thought because I was poor and unfortunate you could pass it off on me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed so grotesque that Carl found it difficult not to laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know it nearly got me into trouble?” went on the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How was that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I stopped at a baker's shop to get a lunch. When I got through I offered the bill. The old Dutchman put on his spectacles, and he looked first at the bill, then at me. Then he threatened to have me arrested for passing bad money. I told him I'd go out in the back yard and settle it with him. I tell you, boy, I'd have knocked him out in one round, and he knew it, so he bade me be gone and never darken his door again. Where did you get it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was passed on me by a man I was traveling with.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much other money have you got?” asked the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very little.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Give it to me, whatever it is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was a little too much for Carl's patience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no money to spare,” he said, shortly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Say that over again!” said the tramp, menacingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you don't understand me, I will. I have no money to spare.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'll spare it to me, I reckon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here,” said Carl, slowly backing. “You've robbed me of ten dollars. You'll have to be satisfied with that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was no good. It might have sent me to prison. If I was nicely dressed I might pass it, but when a chap like me offers a ten-dollar bill it's sure to he looked at sharply. I haven't a cent, and I'll trouble you to hand over all you've got.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why don't you work for a living? You are a strong, able-bodied man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'll find I am if you give me any more of your palaver.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl saw that the time of negotiation was past, and that active hostilities were about to commence. Accordingly he turned and ran, not forward, but in the reverse direction, hoping in this way to meet with Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, that's your game, is it?” growled the tramp. “You needn't expect to escape, for I'll overhaul you in two minutes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Carl ran, and his rough acquaintance ran after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It could hardly be expected that a boy of sixteen, though stout and strong, could get away from a tall, powerful man like the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking back over his shoulder, Carl saw that the tramp was but three feet behind, and almost able to lay his hand upon his shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dodged dexterously, and in trying to do the same the tramp nearly fell to the ground. Naturally, this did not sweeten his temper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll half murder you when I get hold of you,” he growled, in a tone that bodied ill for Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The latter began to pant, and felt that he could not hold out much longer. Should he surrender at discretion?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If some one would only come along,” was his inward aspiration. “This man will take my money and beat me, too.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As if in reply to his fervent prayer the small figure of Mr. Jennings appeared suddenly, rounding a curve in the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Save me, save me, Mr. Jennings!” cried Carl, running up to the little man for protection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the matter? Who is this fellow?” asked Mr. Jennings, in a deep voice for so small a man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That tramp wants to rob me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't trouble yourself! He won't do it,” said Jennings, calmly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV. CARL ARRIVES IN MILFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE tramp stopped short, and eyed Carl's small defender, first with curious surprise, and then with derision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Out of my way, you midget!” he cried, “or I'll hurt you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Try it!” said the little man, showing no sign of fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, you're no bigger than a kid. I can upset you with one finger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He advanced contemptuously, and laid his hand on the shoulder of the dwarf. In an instant Jennings had swung his flail-like arms, and before the tramp understood what was happening he was lying flat on his back, as much to Carl's amazement as his own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaped to his feet with an execration, and advanced again to the attack. To be upset by such a pigmy was the height of mortification.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'm going to crush you, you mannikin!” he threatened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jennings put himself on guard. Like many small men, he was very powerful, as his broad shoulders and sinewy arms would have made evident to a teacher of gymnastics. He clearly understood that this opponent was in deadly earnest, and he put out all the strength which he possessed. The result was that his large-framed antagonist went down once more, striking his head with a force that nearly stunned him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It so happened that at this juncture reinforcements arrived. A sheriff and his deputy drove up in an open buggy, and, on witnessing the encounter, halted their carriage and sprang to the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the matter, Mr. Jennings?” asked the sheriff, respectfully, for the little man was a person of importance in that vicinity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That gentleman is trying to extort a forced loan, Mr. Clunningham.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ha! a footpad?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sheriff sprang to the side of the tramp, who was trying to rise, and in a trice his wrists were confined by handcuffs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I know you, Mike Frost,” he said. “You are up to your old tricks. When did you come out of Sing Sing?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Three weeks since,” answered the tramp, sullenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They want you back there. Come along with me!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was assisted into the buggy, and spent that night in the lockup.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did he take anything from you, Carl?” asked Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; but I was in considerable danger. How strong you are!” he added, admiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Strength isn't always according to size!” said the little man, quietly. “Nature gave me a powerful, though small, frame, and I have increased my strength by gymnastic exercise.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings did not show the least excitement after his desperate contest. He had attended to it as a matter of business, and when over he suffered it to pass out of his mind. He took out his watch and noted the time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is later than I thought,” he said. “I think I shall have to give up my plan of walking the rest of the way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I shall be left alone,” thought Carl regretfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then a man overtook them in a carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He greeted Mr. Jennings respectfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you out for a long walk?” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, but I find time is passing too rapidly with me. Are you going to Milford?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you take two passengers?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You and the boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; of course I will see that you don't lose by it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I ought not to charge you anything, Mr. Jennings. Several times you have done me favors.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And I hope to again, but this is business. If a dollar will pay you, the boy and I will ride with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It will be so much gain, as I don't go out of my way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can take the back seat, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings. “I will sit with Mr. Leach.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were soon seated and on their way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Relative of yours, Mr. Jennings?” asked Leach, with a backward glance at Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Like most country folks, he was curious about people. Those who live in cities meet too many of their kind to feel an interest in strangers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; a young friend,” answered Jennings, briefly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Goin' to visit you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I think he will stay with me for a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then the conversation touched upon Milford matters in which at present Carl was not interested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After his fatiguing walk our hero enjoyed the sensation of riding. The road was a pleasant one, the day was bright with sunshine and the air vocal with the songs of birds. For a time houses were met at rare intervals, but after a while it became evident that they were approaching a town of considerable size.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is this Milford, Mr. Jennings?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered the little man, turning with a pleasant smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How large is it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think there are twelve thousand inhabitants. It is what Western people call a `right smart place.' It has been my home for twenty years, and I am much attached to it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And it to you, Mr. Jennings,” put in the driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is pleasant to hear,” said Jennings, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is true. There are few people here whom you have not befriended.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is what we are here for, is it not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish all were of your opinion. Why, Mr. Jennings, when we get a city charter I think I know who will be the first mayor.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not I, Mr. Leach. My own business is all I can well attend to. Thank you for your compliment, though. Carl, do you see yonder building?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pointed to a three-story structure, a frame building, occupying a prominent position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is my manufactory. What do you think of it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shouldn't think a town of this size would require so large an establishment,” answered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are right,” he said. “If I depended on Milford trade, a very small building would be sufficient. My trade is outside. I supply many dealers in New York City and at the West. My retail trade is small. If any of my neighbors want furniture they naturally come to me, and I favor them as to price out of friendly feeling, but I am a manufacturer and wholesale dealer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Shall I take you to your house, Mr. Jennings?” asked Leach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, if you please.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leach drove on till he reached a two-story building of Quaker-like simplicity but with a large, pleasant yard in front, with here and there a bed of flowers. Here he stopped his horse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We have reached our destination, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings. “You are active. Jump out and I will follow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl needed no second invitation. He sprang from the carriage and went forward to help Mr. Jennings out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, thank you, Carl,” said the little man. “I am more active than you think. Here we are!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He descended nimbly to the ground, and, drawing a one-dollar bill from his pocket, handed it to the driver.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't like to take it, Mr. Jennings,” said Mr. Leach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not? The laborer is worthy of his hire. Now, Carl, let us go into the house.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV. MR. JENNINGS AT HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JENNINGS did not need to open the door. He had scarcely set foot on the front step when it was opened from inside, and Carl found a fresh surprise in store for him. A woman, apparently six feet in height, stood on the threshold. Her figure was spare and ungainly, and her face singularly homely, but the absence of beauty was partially made up by a kindly expression. She looked with some surprise at Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is a young friend of mine, Hannah,” said her master. “Welcome him for my sake.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad to see you,” said Hannah, in a voice that was another amazement. It was deeper than that of most men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As she spoke, she held out a large masculine hand, which Carl took, as seemed to be expected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What am I to call you?” asked Hannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's a strange name.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is not common, I believe.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You two will get acquainted by and by,” said Mr. Jennings. “The most interesting question at present is, when will dinner be ready?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In ten minutes,” answered Hannah, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl and I are both famished. We have had considerable exercise,” here he nodded at Carl with a comical look, and Carl understood that he referred in part to his contest with the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah disappeared into the kitchen, and Mr. Jennings said: “Come upstairs, Carl. I will show you your room.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up an old-fashioned stairway Carl followed his host, and the latter opened the door of a side room on the first landing. It was not large, but was neat and comfortable. There was a cottage bedstead, a washstand, a small bureau and a couple of chairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you will come to feel at home here,” said Mr. Jennings, kindly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir. I am sure I shall,” Carl responded, gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There are some nails to hang your clothing on,” went on Mr. Jennings, and then he stopped short, for it was clear that Carl's small gripsack could not contain an extra suit, and he felt delicate at calling up in the boy's mind the thought of his poverty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir,” said Carl. “I left my trunk at the house of a friend, and if you should succeed in finding me a place, I will send for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is well!” returned Mr. Jennings, looking relieved. “Now I will leave you for a few moments. You will find water and towels, in case you wish to wash before dinner.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was glad of the opportunity. He was particular about his personal appearance, and he felt hot and dusty. He bathed his face and hands, carefully dusted his suit, brushed his hair, and was ready to descend when he heard the tinkling of a small bell at the foot of the front stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He readily found his way into the neat dining-room at the rear of the parlor. Mr. Jennings sat at the head of the table, a little giant, diminutive in stature, but with broad shoulders, a large head, and a powerful frame. Opposite him sat Hannah, tall, stiff and upright as a grenadier. She formed a strange contrast to her employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder what made him hire such a tall woman?” thought Carl. “Being so small himself, her size makes him look smaller.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a chair at one side, placed for Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sit down there, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings. “I won't keep you waiting any longer than I can help. What have you given us to-day, Hannah?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Roast beef,” answered Hannah in her deep tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is nothing better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The host cut off a liberal slice for Carl, and passed the plate to Hannah, who supplied potatoes, peas and squash. Carl's mouth fairly watered as he watched the hospitable preparations for his refreshment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I never trouble myself about what we are to have on the table,” said Mr. Jennings. “Hannah always sees to that. She's knows just what I want. She is a capital cook, too, Hannah is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hannah looked pleased at this compliment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are easily pleased, master,” she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should be hard to suit if I were not pleased with your cooking. You don't know so well Carl's taste, but if there is anything he likes particularly he can tell you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are very kind, sir,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There are not many men who would treat a poor boy so considerately,” he thought. “He makes me an honored guest.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When dinner was over, Mr. Jennings invited Carl to accompany him on a walk. They passed along the principal street, nearly every person they met giving the little man a cordial greeting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He seems to be very popular,” thought Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At length they reached the manufactory. Mr. Jennings went into the office, followed by Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A slender, dark-complexioned man, about thirty-five years of age, sat on a stool at a high desk. He was evidently the bookkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Any letters, Mr. Gibbon?” asked Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; here are four.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are they from?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“From New York, Chicago, Pittsburg and New Haven.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do they relate to?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Orders. I have handed them to Mr. Potter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Potter, as Carl afterwards learned, was superintendent of the manufactory, and had full charge of practical details.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is there anything requiring my personal attention?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I don't think so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way, Mr. Gibbon, let me introduce you to a young friend of mine — Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bookkeeper rapidly scanned Carl's face and figure. It seemed to Carl that the scrutiny was not a friendly one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad to see you,” said Mr. Gibbon, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way, Mr. Jennings,” said the bookkeeper, “I have a favor to ask of you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go on, Mr. Gibbon,” rejoined his employer, in a cordial tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Two months since you gave my nephew, Leonard Craig, a place in the factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I remember.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think the work agrees with him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He seemed a strong, healthy boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He has never been used to confinement, and it affects him unpleasantly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does he wish to resign his place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have been wondering whether you would not be willing to transfer him to the office. I could send him on errands, to the post office, and make him useful in various ways.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had not supposed an office boy was needed. Still, if you desire it, I will try your nephew in the place.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am bound to tell you, however, that his present place is a better one. He is learning a good trade, which, if he masters it, will always give him a livelihood. I learned a trade, and owe all I have to that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True, Mr. Jennings, but there are other ways of earning a living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And I thought of giving Leonard evening instruction in bookkeeping.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That alters the case. Good bookkeepers are always in demand. I have no objection to your trying the experiment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you mentioned the matter to your nephew?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I just suggested that I would ask you, but could not say what answer you would give.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It would have been better not to mention the matter at all till you could tell him definitely that he could change his place.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know but you are right, sir. However, it is all right now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings, “I will take you into the workroom.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI. CARL GETS A PLACE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I SUPPOSE that is the bookkeeper,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. He has been with me three years. He understands his business well. You heard what he said about his nephew?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is his sister's son — a boy of about your own age. I think he is making a mistake in leaving the factory, and going into the office. He will have little to do, and that not of a character to give him knowledge of business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Still, if he takes lessons in bookkeeping — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The boy will never make a bookkeeper,” he said. “His reason for desiring the change is because he is indolent. The world has no room for lazy people.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder, sir, that you have had a chance to find him out.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Little things betray a boy's nature, or a man's, for that matter. When I have visited the workroom I have noticed Leonard, and formed my conclusions. He is not a boy whom I would select for my service, but I have taken him as a favor to his uncle. I presume he is without means, and it is desirable that he should pay his uncle something in return for the home which he gives him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much do you pay him, sir, if it is not a secret?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, no; he receives five dollars a week to begin with. I will pay him the same in the office. And that reminds me; how would you like to have a situation in the factory? Would you like to take Leonard's place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, if you think I would do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I feel quite sure of it. Have you ever done any manual labor?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you have always been to school.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are a gentleman's son,” proceeded Mr. Jennings, eying Carl attentively. “How will it suit you to become a working boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall like it,” answered Carl, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't be too sure! You can tell better after a week in the factory. Those in my employ work ten hours a day. Leonard Craig doesn't like it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All I ask, Mr. Jennings, is that you give me a trial.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is fair,” responded the little man, looking pleased. “I will tell you now that, not knowing of any vacancy in the factory, I had intended to give you the place in the office which Mr. Gibbon has asked for his nephew. It would have been a good deal easier work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall be quite satisfied to take my place in the factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come in, then, and see your future scene of employment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They entered a large room, occupying nearly an entire floor of the building. Part of the space was filled by machinery. The number employed Carl estimated roughly at twenty-five.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite near the door was a boy, who bore some personal resemblance to the bookkeeper. Carl concluded that it must be Leonard Craig. The boy looked round as Mr. Jennings entered, and eyed Carl sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How are you getting on, Leonard?” Mr. Jennings asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Pretty well, sir; but the machinery makes my head ache.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your uncle tells me that your employment does not agree with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I don't think it does.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He would like to have you in the office with him. Would you like it, also?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir,” answered Leonard, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well. You may report for duty at the office to-morrow morning. This boy will take your place here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard eyed Carl curiously, not cordially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you'll like it,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I shall.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You two boys must get acquainted,” said Mr. Jennings. “Leonard, this is Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Glad to know you,” said Leonard, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think I shall like that boy,” thought Carl, as he followed Mr. Jennings to another part of the room.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII. CARL ENTERS THE FACTORY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN they left the factory Mr. Jennings said, with a smile:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now you are one of us, Carl. To-morrow you begin work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad of it, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't ask what salary you are to get.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am willing to leave that to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Suppose we say two dollars a week and board — to begin with.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is better than I expected. But where am I to board?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At my house, for the present, if that will suit you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall like it very much, if it won't inconvenience you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hannah is the one to be inconvenienced, if anyone. I had a little conversation with her while you were getting ready for dinner. She seems to have taken a liking for you, though she doesn't like boys generally. As for me, it will make the home brighter to have a young person in it. Hannah and I are old-fashioned and quiet, and the neighbors don't have much reason to complain of noise.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I should think not, ' said Carl, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is one thing you must be prepared for, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is that, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your living in my house — I being your employer — may excite jealousy in some. I think I know of one who will be jealous.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard Craig?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And his uncle. However, don't borrow any trouble on that score. I hope you won't take advantage of your position, and, thinking yourself a favorite, neglect your duties.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will not, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Business and friendship ought to be kept apart.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is right, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am going back to the house, but you may like to take a walk about the village. You will feel interested in it, as it is to be your future home. By the way, it may be well for you to write for your trunk. You can order it sent to my house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right, sir; I will do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went to the post office, and, buying a postal card, wrote to his friend, Gilbert Vance, as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“DEAR GILBERT: — Please send my trunk by express to me at Milford, care of Henry Jennings, Esq. He is my employer, and I live at his house. He is proprietor of a furniture factory. Will write further particulars soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"CARL CRAWFORD.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This postal carried welcome intelligence to Gilbert, who felt a brotherly interest in Carl. He responded by a letter of hearty congratulation, and forwarded the trunk as requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl reported for duty the next morning, and, though a novice, soon showed that he was not without mechanical skill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At twelve o'clock all the factory hands had an hour off for dinner. As Carl passed into the street he found himself walking beside the boy whom he had succeeded — Leonard Craig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-morning, Leonard,” said Carl, pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-morning. Have you taken my place in the factory?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think you shall like it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I shall, though, of course, it is rather early to form an opinion.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't like it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't want to grow up a workman. I think I am fit for something better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Jennings began as a factory hand.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose he had a taste for it. I haven't.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you like your present position better?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, yes; it's more genteel. How much does Jennings pay you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Two dollars a week and board.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How is that? Where do you board?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“With him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh!” said Leonard, his countenance changing. “So you are a favorite with the boss, are you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. He gave me warning that he should be just as strict with me as if we were strangers.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long have you known him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I met him for the first time yesterday,” he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's very queer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, perhaps it is a little singular.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you a poor boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have to earn my own living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see. You will grow up a common workman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall try to rise above it. I am not ashamed of the position, but I am ambitious to rise.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am going to be a bookkeeper,” said Leonard. “My uncle is going to teach me. I would rather be a bookkeeper than a factory hand.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you are right in preparing yourself for such a post.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the two boys separated, as they were to dine in different places.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard was pleased with his new position. He really had very little to do. Twice a day he went to the post office, once or twice to the bank, and there was an occasional errand besides. To Carl the idleness would have been insupportable, but Leonard was naturally indolent. He sat down in a chair by the window, and watched the people go by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first afternoon he was in luck, for there was a dog fight in the street outside. He seized his hat, went out, and watched the canine warfare with the deepest interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I will buy you a system of bookkeeping,” said his uncle, “and you can study it in the office.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Put it off till next week, Uncle Julius. I want to get rested from the factory work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It seems to me, Leonard, you were born lazy,” said his uncle, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't care to work with my hands.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you care to work at all?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like to be a bookkeeper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know that my work is harder and more exhausting than that of a workman in tho factory?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't want to exchange with him, do you?” asked Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's where I agree with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings took several weekly papers. Leonard was looking over the columns of one of them one day, when he saw the advertisement of a gift enterprise of a most attractive character. The first prize was a house and grounds valued at ten thousand dollars. Following were minor prizes, among them one thousand dollars in gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard's fancy was captivated by the brilliant prospect of such a prize.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Price of tickets — only one dollar!” he read. “Think of getting a thousand dollars for one! Oh, if I could only be the lucky one!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took out his purse, though he knew beforehand that his stock of cash consisted only of two dimes and a nickel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder if I could borrow a dollar of that boy Carl!” he deliberated. “I'll speak to him about it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This happened more than a week after Carl went to work in the factory. He had already received one week's pay, and it remained untouched in his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard joined him in the street early in the evening, and accosted him graciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you going?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nowhere in particular. I am out for a walk.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So am I. Shall we walk together?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you like.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After talking on indifferent matters, Leonand said suddenly: “Oh, by the way, will you do me a favor?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Lend me a dollar till next week.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In former days Carl would probably have granted the favor, but he realized the value of money now that he had to earn it by steady work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid it won't be convenient,” he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does that mean that you haven't got it?” asked Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I have it, but I am expecting to use it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wouldn't mind paying you interest for it — say twenty-five cents,” continued Leonard, who had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift enterprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would be ashamed to take such interest as that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I have a chance of making a good deal more out of it myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In what way?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is my secret.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why don't you borrow it of your uncle?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He would ask too many questions. However, I see that you're a miser, and I won't trouble you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He left Carl in a huff and walked hastily away. He turned into a lane little traveled, and, after walking a few rods, came suddenly upon the prostrate body of a man, whose deep, breathing showed that he was stupefied by liquor. Leonard was not likely to feel any special interest in him, but one object did attract his attention. It was a wallet which had dropped out of the man's pocket and was lying on the grass beside him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII. LEONARD'S TEMPTATION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEONARD was not a thief, but the sight of the wallet tempted him, under the circumstances. He had set his heart on buying a ticket in the gift enterprise, and knew of no way of obtaining the requisite sum — except this. It was, indeed, a little shock to him to think of appropriating money not his own; yet who would know it? The owner of the wallet was drunk, and would be quite unconscious of his loss. Besides, if he didn't take the wallet, some one else probably would, and appropriate the entire contents. It was an insidious suggestion, and Leonard somehow persuaded himself that since the money was sure to be taken, he might as well have the benefit of it as anyone else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So, after turning over the matter in his mind rapidly, he stooped down and picked up the wallet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man did not move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Emboldened by his insensibility, Leonard cautiously opened the pocketbook, and his eyes glistened when he saw tucked away in one side, quite a thick roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He won't miss one bill,” thought Leonard. “Anyone else might take the whole wallet, but I wouldn't do that. I wonder how much money there is in the roll.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He darted another glance at the prostrate form, but there seemed no danger of interruption. He took the roll in his hand, therefore, and a hasty scrutiny showed him that the bills ran from ones to tens. There must have been nearly a hundred dollars in all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Suppose I take a five,” thought Leonard, whose cupidity increased with the sight of the money. “He won't miss it, and it will be better in my hands than if spent for whiskey.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How specious are the arguments of those who seek an excuse for a wrong act that will put money in the purse!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I think I may venture to take a five, and, as I might not be able to change it right away, I will take a one to send for a ticket. Then I will put the wallet back in the man's pocket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So far, all went smoothly, and Leonard was proceeding to carry out his intention when, taking a precautionary look at the man on the ground, he was dumfounded by seeing his eyes wide open and fixed upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard flushed painfully, like a criminal detected in a crime, and returned the look of inquiry by one of dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What — you — doing?” inquired the victim of inebriety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — is this your wallet, sir?” stammered Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Course it is. What you got it for?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I saw it on the ground, and was afraid some one would find it, and rob you,” said Leonard, fluently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Somebody did find it,” rejoined the man, whose senses seemed coming back to him. “How much did you take?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I? You don't think I would take any of your money?” said Leonard, in virtuous surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Looked like it! Can't tell who to trust.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I assure you, I had only just picked it up, and was going to put it back in your pocket, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man, drunk as he was, winked knowingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Smart boy!” he said. “You do it well, ol' fella!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But, sir, it is quite true, I assure you. I will count over the money before you. Do you know how much you had?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nev' mind. Help me up!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard stooped over and helped the drunkard to a sitting position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where am I? Where is hotel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard answered him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take me to hotel, and I'll give you a dollar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, sir,” said Leonard, briskly. He was to get his dollar after all, and would not have to steal it. I am afraid he is not to be praised for his honesty, as it seemed to be a matter of necessity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish he'd give me five dollars,” thought Leonard, but didn't see his way clear to make the suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He placed the man on his feet, and guided his steps to the road. As he walked along, the inebriate, whose gait was at first unsteady, recovered his equilibrium and required less help.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long had you been lying there?” asked Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't know. I was taken sick,” and the inebriate nodded knowingly at Leonard, who felt at liberty to laugh, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you ever get sick?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not that way,” answered Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Smart boy! Better off!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They reached the hotel, and Leonard engaged a room for his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Has he got money?” asked the landlord, in a low voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered Leonard, “he has nearly a hundred dollars. I counted it myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's all right, then,” said the landlord. “Here, James, show the gentleman up to No. 15.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Come, too,” said the stranger to Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The latter followed the more readily because he had not yet been paid his dollar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door of No. 15 was opened, and the two entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will stay with the gentleman a short time,” said Leonard to the boy. “If we want anything we will ring.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's your name?” asked the inebriate, as he sank into a large armchair near the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard Craig.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Never heard the name before.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What's your name, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What yon want to know for?” asked the other, cunningly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The landlord will want to put it on his book.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My name? Phil Stark.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Philip Stark?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; who told you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be seen that Mr. Stark was not yet quite himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You told me yourself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I did — 'scuse me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, sir. By the way, you told me you would pay me a dollar for bringing you to the hotel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I did. Take it,” and Philip Stark passed the wallet to Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard felt tempted to take a two-dollar bill instead of a one, as Mr. Stark would hardly notice the mistake. Still, he might ask to look at the bill, and that would be awkward. So the boy contented himself with the sum promised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir,” he said, as he slipped the bill into his vest pocket. “Do you want some supper?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I want to sleep.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you had better lie down on the bed. Will you undress?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; too much trouble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stark rose from the armchair, and, lurching round to the bed, flung himself on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you don't want me any longer,” said Leonard. ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No. Come round to-morrer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard opened the door and left the room. He resolved to keep the appointment, and come round the next day. Who knew but some more of Mr. Stark's money might come into his hands? Grown man as he was, he seemed to need a guardian, and Leonard was willing to act as such — for a consideration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's been a queer adventure!” thought Leonard, as he slowly bent his steps towards his uncle's house. “I've made a dollar out of it, anyway, and if he hadn't happened to wake up just as he did I might have done better. However, it may turn out as well in the end.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are rather late, Leonard,” said his uncle, in a tone that betrayed some irritation. “I wanted to send you on an errand, and you are always out of the way at such a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll go now,” said Leonard, with unusual amiability. “I've had a little adventure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“An adventure! What is it?” Mr. Gibbon asked, with curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard proceeded to give an account of his finding the inebriate in the meadow, and his guiding him to the hotel. It may readily be supposed that he said nothing of his attempt to appropriate a part of the contents of the wallet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What was his name?” asked Gibbon, with languid curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Phil Stark, he calls himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A strange change came over the face of the bookkeeper. There was a frightened look in his eyes, and his color faded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Phil Stark!” he repeated, in a startled tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What brings him here?” Gibbon asked himself nervously, but no words passed his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know the name?” asked Leonard, wonderingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — have heard it before, but — no, I don't think it is the same man.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX. AN ARTFUL SCHEME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“DOES this Mr. Stark intend to remain long in the village!” inquired the bookkeeper, in a tone of assumed indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He didn't say anything on that point,” answered Leonard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He did not say what business brought him here, I presume?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, he was hardly in condition to say much; he was pretty full,” said Leonard, with a laugh. “However, he wants me to call upon him to-morrow, and may tell me then.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He wants you to call upon him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, uncle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you going?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; why shouldn't I?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see no reason,” said Gibbon, hesitating. Then, after a pause he added: “If you see the way clear, find out what brings him to Milford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, uncle, I will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Uncle Julius seems a good deal interested in this man, considering that he is a stranger,” thought the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bookkeeper was biting his nails, a habit he had when he was annoyed. “And, Leonard,” he added slowly, “don't mention my name while you are speaking to Stark.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, I won't, if you don't want me to,” answered Leonard, his face betraying unmistakable curiosity. His uncle noted this, and explained hurriedly: “It is possible that he may be a man whom I once met under disagreeable circumstances, and I would prefer not to meet him again. Should he learn that I was living here, he would be sure to want to renew the acquaintance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, I see. I don't think he would want to borrow money, for he seems to be pretty well provided. I made a dollar out of him to-day, and that is one reason why I am willing to call on him again. I may strike him for another bill.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is no objection to that, provided you don't talk to him too freely. I don't think he will want to stay long in Milford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wouldn't if I had as much money as he probably has.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you often meet the new boy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl Crawford?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I see him on the street quite often.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He lives with Mr. Jennings, I hear.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So he tells me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is rather strange. I didn't suppose that Jennings would care to receive a boy in his house, or that tall grenadier of a housekeeper, either. I expect she rules the household.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She could tuck him under her arm and walk off with him,” said Leonard, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The boy must be artful to have wormed his way into the favor of the strange pair. He seems to be a favorite.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, uncle, I think he is. However, I like my position better than his.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He will learn his business from the beginning. I don't know but it was a mistake for you to leave the factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not at all sorry for it, uncle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your position doesn't amount to much.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am paid just as well as I was when I was in the factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But you are learning nothing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are going to teach me bookkeeping.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Even that is not altogether a desirable business. A good bookkeeper can never expect to be in business for himself. He must be content with a salary all his life.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have done pretty well, uncle.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But there is no chance of my becoming a rich man. I have to work hard for my money. And I haven't been able to lay up much money yet. That reminds me? Leonard, I must impress upon you the fact that you have your own way to make. I have procured you a place, and I provide you a home — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You take my wages,” said Leonard, bluntly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A part of them, but on the whole, you are not self-supporting. You must look ahead, Leonard, and consider the future. When you are a young man you will want to earn an adequate income.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course, I shall, uncle, but there is one other course.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I may marry an heiress,” suggested Leonard, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bookkeeper winced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thought I was marrying an heiress when I married your aunt,” he said, “but within six months of our wedding day, her father made a bad failure, and actually had the assurance to ask me to give him a home under my roof.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you do it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I told him it would not be convenient.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What became of him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He got a small clerkship at ten dollars a week in the counting room of a mercantile friend, and filled it till one day last October, when he dropped dead of apoplexy. I made a great mistake when I married in not asking him to settle a definite sum on his daughter. It would have been so much saved from the wreck.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did aunt want him to come and live here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, women are always unreasonable. She would have had me support the old man in idleness, but I am not one of that kind. Every tub should stand on its own bottom.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I say so, too, uncle. Do you know whether this boy, Carl Crawford, has any father or mother?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“From a word Jennings let fall I infer that he has relatives, but is not on good terms with them. I have been a little afraid he might stand in your light.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How so, uncle?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Should there be any good opening for one of your age, I am afraid he would get it rather than you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't think of that,” said Leonard, jealously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Living as he does with Mr. Jennings, he will naturally try to ingratiate himself with him, and stand first in his esteem.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is true. Is Mr. Jennings a rich man, do you think?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I think he is. The factory and stock are worth considerable money, but I know he has other investments also. As one item he has over a thousand dollars in the Carterville Savings Bank. He has been very prudent, has met with no losses, and has put aside a great share of his profits every year.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder he don't marry.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Marriage doesn't seem to be in his thoughts. Hannah makes him so comfortable that he will probably remain a bachelor to the end of his days.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps he will leave his money to her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is likely to live as long as she.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She is a good deal longer than he,” said Leonard, with a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bookkeeper condescended to smile at this joke, though it was not very brilliant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Before this boy Carl came,” he resumed thoughtfully, “I hoped he might take a fancy to you. He must die some time, and, having no near blood relative, I thought he might select as heir some boy like yourself, who might grow into his favor and get on his blind side.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is it too late now?” asked Leonard, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps not, but the appearance of this new boy on the scene makes your chance a good deal smaller.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish we could get rid of him,” said Leonard, frowning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The only way is to injure him in the estimation of Mr. Jennings.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I know of a way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mention it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here is an advertisement of a lottery,” said Leonard, whose plans, in view of what his uncle had said, had experienced a change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will write to the manager in Carl's name, inquiring about tickets, and, of course, he will answer to him, to the care of Mr. Jennings. This will lead to the suspicion that Carl is interested in such matters.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is a good idea. It will open the way to a loss of confidence on the part of Mr. Jennings.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will sit down at your desk and write at once.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days later Mr. Jennings handed a letter to Carl after they reached home in the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A letter for you to my care,” he explained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl opened it in surprise, and read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“OFFICE OF GIFT ENTERPRISE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"MR. CARL CRAWFORD: — Your letter of inquiry is received. In reply we would say that we will send you six tickets for five dollars. By disposing of them among your friends at one dollar each, you will save the cost of your own. You had better remit at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yours respectfully, PITKINS &amp; GAMP,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Agents.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl looked the picture of astonishment when he read this letter.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX. REVEALS A MYSTERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“PLEASE read this letter, Mr. Jennings,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His employer took the letter from his hand, and ran his eye over it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you wish to ask my advice about the investment?” he said, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir. I wanted to know how such a letter came to be written to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn't you send a letter of inquiry there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, and I can't understand how these men could have got hold of my name.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked thoughtful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Some one has probably written in your name,” he said, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But who could have done so?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you will leave the letter in my hands, I may be able to obtain some information on that point.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall be glad if you can, Mr. Jennings.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't mention to anyone having received such a letter, and if anyone broaches the subject, let me know who it is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, I will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings quietly put on his hat, and walked over to the post office. The postmaster, who also kept a general variety store, chanced to be alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-evening, Mr. Jennings,” he said, pleasantly. “What can I do for you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I want a little information, Mr. Sweetland, though it is doubtful if you can give it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Sweetland assumed the attitude of attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know if any letter has been posted from this office within a few days, addressed to Pitkins &amp; Gamp, Syracuse, New York?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; two letters have been handed in bearing this address.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings was surprised, for he had never thought of two letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you tell me who handed them in?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Both were handed in by the same party.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And that was — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A boy in your employ.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked grave. Was it possible that Carl was deceiving him?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The boy who lives at my house?” he asked, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; the boy who usually calls for the factory mail. The nephew of your bookkeeper I think his name is Leonard Craig.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, I see,” said Mr. Jennings, looking very much relieved. “And you say he deposited both letters?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you happen to remember if any other letter like this was received at the office?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here he displayed the envelope of Carl's letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; one was received, addressed to the name of the one who deposited the first letters — Leonard Craig.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, Mr. Sweetland. Your information has cleared up a mystery. Be kind enough not to mention the matter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will bear your request in mind.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings bought a supply of stamps, and then left the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Carl,” he said, when he re-entered the house, “I have discovered who wrote in your name to Pitkins &amp; Gamp.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who, sir?” asked Carl, with curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard Craig.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But what could induce him to do it?” said Carl, perplexed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He thought that I would see the letter, and would be prejudiced against you if I discovered that you were investing in what is a species of lottery.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Would you, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should have thought you unwise, and I should have been reminded of a fellow workman who became so infatuated with lotteries that he stole money from his employer to enable him to continue his purchases of tickets. But for this unhappy passion he would have remained honest.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard must dislike me,” said Carl, thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is jealous of you; I warned you he or some one else might become so. But the most curious circumstance is, he wrote a second letter in his own name. I suspect he has bought a ticket. I advise you to say nothing about the matter unless questioned.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Carl met Leonard in the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way,” said Leonard, “you got a letter yesterday?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I brought it to the factory with the rest of the mail.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard looked at him curiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He seems to be close-mouthed,” Leonard said to himself. “He has sent for a ticket, I'll bet a hat, and don't want me to find out. I wish I could draw the capital prize — I would not mind old Jennings finding out then.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you ever hear from your — friends?” he asked a minute later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not often.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I thought that letter might be from your home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; it was a letter from Syracuse.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I remember now, it was postmarked Syracuse. Have you friends there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“None that I am aware of.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yet you receive letters from there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That was a business letter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was quietly amused at Leonard's skillful questions, but was determined not to give him any light on the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard tried another avenue of attack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, dear!” he sighed, “I wish I was rich.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shouldn't mind being rich myself,” said Carl, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose old Jennings must have a lot of money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Jennings, I presume, is very well off,” responded Carl, emphasizing the title “Mr.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If I had his money I wouldn't live in such Quaker style.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Would you have him give fashionable parties?” asked Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I don't know that he would enjoy that; but I'll tell you what I would do. I would buy a fast horse — a two-forty mare — and a bangup buggy, and I'd show the old farmers round here what fast driving is. Then I'd have a stylish house, and — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't believe you'd be content to live in Milford, Leonard.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think I would, either, unless my business were here. I'd go to New York every few weeks and see life.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You may be rich some time, so that you can carry out your wishes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you know any easy way of getting money?” asked Leonard, pointedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The easy ways are not generally the true ways. A man sometimes makes money by speculation, but he has to have some to begin with.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can't get anything out of him,” thought Leonard. “Well, good-evening.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He crossed the street, and joined the man who has already been referred to as boarding at the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stark had now been several days in Milford. What brought him there, or what object he had in staying, Leonard had not yet ascertained. He generally spent part of his evenings with the stranger, and had once or twice received from him a small sum of money. Usually, however, he had met Mr. Stark in the billiard room, and played a game or two of billiards with him. Mr. Stark always paid for the use of the table, and that was naturally satisfactory to Leonard, who enjoyed amusement at the expense of others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard, bearing in mind his uncle's request, had not mentioned his name to Mr. Stark, and Stark, though he had walked about the village more or less, had not chanced to meet Mr. Gibbon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had questioned Leonard, however, about Mr. Jennings, and whether he was supposed to be rich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard had answered freely that everyone considered him so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But he doesn't know how to enjoy his money,” he added.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We should,” said Stark, jocularly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You bet we would,” returned Leonard; and he was quite sincere in his boast, as we know from his conversation with Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way,” said Stark, on this particular evening, “I never asked you about your family, Leonard. I suppose you live with your parents.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir. They are dead.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then whom do you live with?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“With my uncle,” answered Leonard, guardedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is his name Craig?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I've got to tell him,” thought Leonard. “Well, I don't suppose there will be much harm in it. My uncle is bookkeeper for Mr. Jennings,” he said, “and his name is Julius Gibbon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philip Stark wheeled round, and eyed Leonard in blank astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your uncle is Julius Gibbon!” he exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I'll be blowed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you — know my uncle?” asked Leonard, hesitating.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I rather think I do. Take me round to the house. I want to see him.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI. AN UNWELCOME GUEST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN Julius Gibbon saw the door open and Philip Stark enter the room where he was smoking his noon cigar, his heart quickened its pulsations and he turned pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How are you, old friend?” said Stark, boisterously. “Funny, isn't it, that I should run across your nephew?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very strange!” ejaculated Gibbon, looking the reverse of joyous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a happy meeting, isn't it? We used to see a good deal of each other,” and he laughed in a way that Gibbon was far from enjoying. “Now, I've come over to have a good, long chat with you. Leonard, I think we won't keep you, as you wouldn't be interested in our talk about old times.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Leonard, you may leave us,” added his uncle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard's curiosity was excited, and he would have been glad to remain, but as there was no help for it, he went out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they were alone, Stark drew up his chair close, and laid his hand familiarly on the bookkeeper's knee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I say, Gibbon, do you remember where we last met?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon shuddered slightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” he answered, feebly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was at Joliet — Joliet Penitentiary. Your time expired before mine. I envied you the six months' advantage you had of me. When I came out I searched for you everywhere, but heard nothing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you know I was here?” asked the bookkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't know. I had no suspicion of it. Nor did I dream that Leonard, who was able to do me a little service, was your nephew. I say, he's a chip of the old block, Gibbon,” and Stark laughed as if he enjoyed it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean by that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was lying in a field, overcome by liquor, an old weakness of mine, you know, and my wallet had slipped out of my pocket. I chanced to open my eyes, when I saw it in the hands of your promising nephew, ha! ha!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He told me that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But he didn't tell you that he was on the point of appropriating a part of the contents? I warrant you he didn't tell you that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did he acknowledge it? Perhaps you misjudged him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He didn't acknowledge it in so many words, but I knew it by his change of color and confusion. Oh, I didn't lay it up against him. We are very good friends. He comes honestly by it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon looked very much annoyed, but there were reasons why he did not care to express his chagrin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On my honor, it was an immense surprise to me,” proceeded Stark, “when I learned that my old friend Gibbon was a resident of Milford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you had never found it out,” thought Gibbon, biting his lip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No sooner did I hear it than I posted off at once to call on you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I see.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stark elevated his eyebrows, and looked amused. He saw that he was not a welcome visitor, but for that he cared little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Haven't you got on, though? Here I find you the trusted bookkeeper of an important business firm. Did you bring recommendations from your last place?” and he burst into a loud guffaw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you wouldn't make such references,” snapped Gibbon. “They can do no good, and might do harm.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't be angry, my dear boy. I rejoice at your good fortune. Wish I was equally will fixed. You don't ask how I am getting on.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you are prosperous,” said Gibbon, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I might be more so. Is there a place vacant in your office?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And if there were, you might not recommend me, eh?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is no need to speak of that. There is no vacancy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Upon my word, I wish there were, as I am getting to the end of my tether. I may have money enough to last me four weeks longer, but no more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't see how I can help you,” said Gibbon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How much salary does Mr. Jennings pay you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A hundred dollars a month,” answered the bookkeeper, reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not bad, in a cheap place like this.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It takes all I make to pay expenses.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I remember — you have a wife. I have no such incumbrance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is one question I would like to ask you,” said the bookkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Fire away, dear boy. Have you an extra cigar?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here is one,”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thanks. Now I shall be comfortable. Go ahead with your question.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What brought you to Milford? You didn't know of my being here, you say.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Neither did I. I came on my old business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I heard there was a rich manufacturer here — I allude to your respected employer. I thought I might manage to open his safe some dark night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, no,” protested Gibbon in alarm. “Don't think of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not?” asked Stark, coolly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because,” answered Gibbon, in some agitation, “I might be suspected.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, perhaps you might; but I have got to look out for number one. How do you expect me to live?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Go somewhere else. There are plenty of other men as rich, and richer, where you would not be compromising an old friend.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's because I have an old friend in the office that I have thought this would be my best opening.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Surely, man, you don't expect me to betray my employer, and join with you in robbing him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's just what I do expect. Don't tell me you have grown virtuous, Gibbon. The tiger doesn't lose his spots or the leopard his stripes. I tell you there's a fine chance for us both. I'll divide with you, if you'll help me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I've gone out of the business,” protested Gibbon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I haven't. Come, old boy, I can't let any sentimental scruples interfere with so good a stroke of business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't help you!” said Gibbon, angrily. “You only want to get me into trouble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't help me?” said Stark, with slow deliberation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I can't honorably. Can't you let me alone?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sorry to say, I can't. If I was rich, I might; but as it is, it is quite necessary for me to raise some money somewhere. By all accounts, Jennings is rich, and can spare a small part of his accumulations for a good fellow that's out of luck.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'd better give up the idea. It's quite impossible.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is it?” asked Stark, with a wicked look. “Then do you know what I will do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What will you do?” asked Gibbon, nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will call on your employer, and tell him what I know of you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You wouldn't do that?” said the bookkeeper, much agitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not? You turn your back upon an old friend. You bask in prosperity, and turn from him in his poverty. It's the way of the world, no doubt; but Phil Stark generally gets even with those who don't treat him well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me what you want me to do,” said Gibbon, desperately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell me first whether your safe contains much of value.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We keep a line of deposit with the Milford Bank.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you mean to say that nothing of value is left in the safe overnight?” asked Stark, disappointed</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is a box of government bonds usually kept there,” the bookkeeper admitted, reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ah, that's good!” returned Stark, rubbing his hands. “Do you know how much they amount to?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think there are about four thousand dollars.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good! We must have those bonds, Gibbon.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII. MR. STARK IS RECOGNIZED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL STARK was resolved not to release his hold upon his old acquaintance. During the day he spent his time in lounging about the town, but in the evening he invariably fetched up at the bookkeeper's modest home. His attentions were evidently not welcome to Mr. Gibbon, who daily grew more and more nervous and irritable, and had the appearance of a man whom something disquieted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard watched the growing intimacy with curiosity. He was a sharp boy, and he felt convinced that there was something between his uncle and the stranger. There was no chance for him to overhear any conversation, for he was always sent out of the way when the two were closeted together. He still met Mr. Stark outside, and played billiards with him frequently. Once he tried to extract some information from Stark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You've known my uncle a good while,” he said, in a tone of assumed indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, a good many years,” answered Stark, as he made a carom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Were you in business together?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not exactly, but we may be some time,” returned Stark, with a significant smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, that isn't decided.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you first meet Uncle Julius?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The kid's growing curious,” said Stark to himself. “Does he think he can pull wool over the eyes of Phil Stark? If he does, he thinks a good deal too highly of himself. I will answer his questions to suit myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why don't you ask your uncle that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I did,” said Leonard, “but he snapped me up, and told me to mind my own business. He is getting terribly cross lately.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's his stomach, I presume,” said Stark, urbanely. “He is a confirmed dyspeptic — that's what's the matter with him. Now; I've got the digestion of an ox. Nothing ever troubles me, and the result is that I am as calm and good-natured as a May morning.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't you ever get riled, Mr. Stark?” asked Leonard, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, hardly ever. Sometimes when I am asked fool questions by one who seems to be prying into what is none of his business, I get wrathy, and when I'm roused look out !”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He glanced meaningly at Leonard, and the boy understood that the words conveyed a warning and a menace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is anything the matter with you, Mr. Gibbon? Are you as well as usual?” asked Mr. Jennings one morning. The little man was always considerate, and he had noticed the flurried and nervous manner of his bookkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; what makes you ask?” said Gibbon, apologetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps you need a vacation,” suggested Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, no, I think not. Besides, I couldn't be spared.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would keep the books myself for a week to favor you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are very kind, but I won't trouble you just yet. A little later on, if I feel more uncomfortable, I will avail myself of your kindness.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do so. I know that bookkeeping is a strain upon the mind, more so than physical labor.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were special reasons why Mr. Gibbon did not dare to accept the vacation tendered him by his employer. He knew that Phil Stark would be furious, for it would interfere with his designs. He could not afford to offend this man, who held in his possession a secret affecting his reputation and good name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The presence of a stranger in a small town always attracts public attention, and many were curious about the rakish-looking man who had now for some time occupied a room at the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among others, Carl had several times seen him walking with Leonard Craig</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard,” he asked one day, “who is the gentleman I see you so often walking with?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a man that's boarding at the hotel. I play billiards with him sometimes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He seems to like Milford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. He's over at our house every evening.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he?” asked Carl, surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he's an old acquaintance of Uncle Julius. I don't know where they met each other, for he won't tell. He said he and uncle might go into business together some time. Between you and me, I think uncle would like to get rid of him. I know he doesn't like him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This set Carl to thinking, but something occurred soon afterwards that impressed him still more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Occasionally a customer of the house visited Milford, wishing to give a special order for some particular line of goods. About this time a Mr. Thorndike, from Chicago, came to Milford on this errand, and put up at the hotel. He had called at the factory during the day, and had some conversation with Mr. Jennings. After supper a doubt entered the mind of the manufacturer in regard to one point, and he said to Carl: “Carl, are you engaged this evening?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you carry a note for me to the hotel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, sir; I shall be glad to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Thorndike leaves in the morning, and I am not quite clear as to one of the specifications he gave me with his order. You noticed the gentleman who went through the factory with me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is Mr. Thorndike. Please hand him this note, and if he wishes you to remain with him for company, you had better do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hannah,” said Mr. Jennings, as his messenger left with the note, “Carl is a pleasant addition to our little household?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, indeed he is,” responded Hannah, emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If he was twice the trouble I'd be glad to have him here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is easy to get along with.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Surely.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yet his stepmother drove him from his father's house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She's a wicked trollop, then!” said Hannah, in a deep, stern voice. “I'd like to get hold of her, I would.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What would you do to her?” asked Mr. Jennings, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'd give her a good shaking,” answered Hannah.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I believe you would, Hannah,” said Mr. Jennings, amused. “On the whole, I think she had better keep out of your clutches. Still, but for her we would never have met with Carl. What is his father's loss is our gain.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What a poor, weak man his father must be,” said Hannah, contemptuously, “to let a woman like her turn him against his own flesh and blood!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I agree with you, Hannah. I hope some time he may see his mistake.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl kept on his way to the hotel. It was summer and Mr. Thorndike was sitting on the piazza smoking a cigar. To him Carl delivered the note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's all right!” he said, rapidly glancing it over. “You may tell Mr. Jennings,” and here he gave an answer to the question asked in the letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir, I will remember.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Won't you sit down and keep me company a little while?” asked Thorndike, who was sociably inclined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir,” and Carl sat down in a chair beside him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you have a cigar?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, thank you, sir. I don't smoke.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is where you are sensible. I began to smoke at fourteen, and now I find it hard to break off. My doctor tells me it is hurting me, but the chains of habit are strong.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All the more reason for forming good habits, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Spoken like a philosopher. Are you in the employ of my friend, Mr. Jennings?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Learning the business?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is my present intention.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you ever come out to Chicago, call on me, and if you are out of a place, I will give you one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you not a little rash, Mr. Thorndike, to offer me a place when you know so little of me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I trust a good deal to looks. I care more for them than for recommendations.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment Phil Stark came out of the hotel, and passing them, stepped off the piazza into the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Thorndike half rose from his seat, and looked after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who is that?” he asked, in an exciting whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A man named Stark, who is boarding at the hotel. Do you know him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do I know him?” repeated Thorndike. “He is one of the most successful burglars in the West.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII. PREPARING FOR THE BURGLAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL stared at Mr. Thorndike in surprise and dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A burglar!” he ejaculated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I was present in the courtroom when he was convicted of robbing the Springfield bank. I sat there for three hours, and his face was impressed upon my memory. I saw him later on in the Joliet Penitentiary. I was visiting the institution and saw the prisoners file out into the yard. I recognized this man instantly. Do you know how long he has been here?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“For two weeks I should think.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He has some dishonest scheme in his head, I have no doubt. Have you a bank in Milford?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He may have some design upon that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is very intimate with our bookkeeper, so his nephew tells me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Thorndike looked startled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ha! I scent danger to my friend, Mr. Jennings. He ought to be apprised.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He shall be, sir,” said Carl, firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you see him to-night?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I am not only in his employ, but I live at his house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps I ought to go home at once.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No attempt will be made to rob the office till late. It is scarcely eight o'clock. I don't know, however, but I will walk around to the house with you, and tell your employer what I know. By the way, what sort of a man is the bookkeeper?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know him very well, sir. He has a nephew in the office, who was transferred from the factory. I have taken his place.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think the bookkeeper would join in a plot to rob his employer?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't like him. To me he is always disagreeable, but I would not like to say that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long has he been in the employ of Mr. Jennings?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“As long as two years, I should think.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You say that this man is intimate with him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard Craig — he is the nephew — says that Mr. Philip Stark is at his uncle's house every evening.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So he calls himself Philip Stark, does he?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Isn't that his name?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose it is one of his names. He was convicted under that name, and retains it here on account of its being so far from the place of his conviction. Whether it is his real name or not, I do not know. What is the name of your bookkeeper?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Julius Gibbon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't remember ever having heard it. Evidently there has been some past acquaintance between the two men, and that, I should say, is hardly a recommendation for Mr. Gibbon. Of course that alone is not enough to condemn him, but the intimacy is certainly a suspicious circumstance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two soon reached the house of Mr. Jennings, for the distance was only a quarter of a mile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings seemed a little surprised, but gave a kindly welcome to his unexpected guest. It occurred to him that he might have come to give some extra order for goods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are surprised to see me,” said Thorndike. “I came on a very important matter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A look of inquiry came over the face of Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's a thief in the village — a guest at the hotel — whom I recognize as one of the most expert burglars in the country.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I know whom you mean, a man of moderate height, rather thick set, with small, black eyes and a slouch hat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Exactly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What can you tell me about him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Thorndike repeated the statement he had already made to Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think our bank is in danger?” asked the manufacturer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps so, but the chief danger threatens you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What makes you think so?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because this man appears to be very intimate with your bookkeeper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you know that?” asked the little man, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I refer you to Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leonard Craig told me to-night that this man Stark spent every evening at his uncle's house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked troubled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sorry to hear this,” he said. “I dislike to lose confidence in any man whom I have trusted.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you noticed anything unusual in the demeanor of your bookkeeper of late?” asked Thorndike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he has appeared out of spirits and nervous.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That would seem to indicate he is conspiring to rob you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This very day, noticing the change in him, I offered him a week's vacation. He promptly declined to take it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course. It would conflict with the plans of his confederate. I don't know the man, but I do know human nature, and I venture to predict that your safe will be opened within a week. Do you keep anything of value in it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There are my books, which are of great value to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But not to a thief. Anything else?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I have a tin box containing four thousand dollars in government bonds.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Coupon or registered?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Coupon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nothing could be better — for a burglar. What on earth could induce you to keep the bonds in your own safe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To tell the truth, I considered them quite as safe there as in the bank. Banks are more likely to be robbed than private individuals.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Circumstances alter cases. Does anyone know that you have the bonds in your safe?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My bookkeeper is aware of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, my friend, I caution you to remove the bonds from so unsafe a depository as soon as possible. Unless I am greatly mistaken, this man, Stark, has bought over your bookkeeper, and will have his aid in robbing you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is your advice?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To remove the bonds this very evening,” said Thorndike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think the danger so pressing?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of course I don't know that an attempt will be made to-night, but it is quite possible. Should it be so, you would have an opportunity to realize that delays are dangerous.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Should Mr. Gibbon find, on opening the safe to-morrow morning, that the box is gone, it may lead to an attack upon my house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you to leave the box in the safe.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I understand that you advised me to remove it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not the box, but the bonds. Listen to my plan. Cut out some newspaper slips of about the same bulk as the bonds, put them in place of the bonds in the box, and quietly transfer the bonds in your pocket to your own house. To-morrow you can place them in the bank. Should no burglary be attempted, let the box remain in the safe, just as if its contents were valuable.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your advice is good, and I will adopt it,” said Jennings, “and thank you for your valuable and friendly instruction.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If agreeable to you I will accompany you to the office at once. The bonds cannot be removed too soon. Then if anyone sees us entering, it will be thought that you are showing me the factory. It will divert suspicion, even if we are seen by Stark or your bookkeeper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May I go, too?” asked Carl, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly,” said the manufacturer. “I know, Carl, that you are devoted to my interests. It is a comfort to know this, now that I have cause to suspect my bookkeeper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was only a little after nine. The night was moderately dark, and Carl was intrusted with a wax candle, which he put in his pocket for use in the office. They reached the factory without attracting attention, and entered by the office door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings opened the safe — he and the bookkeeper alone knew the combination — and with some anxiety took out the tin box. It was possible that the contents had already been removed. But no! on opening it, the bonds were found intact. According to Mr. Thorndike's advice, he transferred them to his pocket, and substituted folded paper. Then, replacing everything, the safe was once more locked, and the three left the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Thorndike returned to the hotel, and Mr. Jennings to his house, but Carl asked permission to remain out a while longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is on my mind that an attempt will be made to-night to rob the safe,” he said. “I want to watch near the factory to see if my suspicion is correct.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, Carl, but don't stay out too long!” said his employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Suppose I see them entering the office, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't interrupt them! They will find themselves badly fooled. Notice only if Mr. Gibbon is of the party. I must know whether my bookkeeper is to be trusted.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV. THE BURGLARY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL seated himself behind a stone wall on the opposite side of the street from the factory. The building was on the outskirts of the village, though not more than half a mile from the post office, and there was very little travel in that direction during the evening. This made it more favorable for thieves, though up to the present time no burglarious attempt had been made on it. Indeed, Milford had been exceptionally fortunate in that respect. Neighboring towns had been visited, some of them several times, but Milford had escaped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The night was quite dark, but not what is called pitchy dark. As the eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, they were able to see a considerable distance. So it was with Carl. From his place of concealment he occasionally raised his head and looked across the way to the factory. An hour passed, and he grew tired. It didn't look as if the attempt were to be made that night. Eleven o'clock pealed out from the spire of the Baptist Church, a quarter of a mile away. Carl counted the strokes, and when the last died into silence, he said to himself:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will stay here about ten minutes longer. Then, if no one comes, I will give it up for to-night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time was nearly up when his quick ear caught a low murmur of voices. Instantly he was on the alert. Waiting till the sound came nearer, he ventured to raise his head for an instant above the top of the wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His heart beat with excitement when he saw two figures approaching. Though it was so dark, he recognized them by their size and outlines. They were Julius Gibbon, the bookkeeper, and Phil Stark, the stranger staying at the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl watched closely, raising his head for a few seconds at a time above the wall, ready to lower it should either glance in his direction. But neither of the men did so. Ignorant that they were suspected, it was the farthest possible from their thoughts that anyone would be on the watch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Presently they came so near that Carl could hear their voices.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish it was over,” murmured Gibbon, nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Don't worry,” said his companion. “There is no occasion for haste. Everybody in Milford is in bed and asleep, and we have several hours at our disposal.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must remember that my reputation is at stake. This night's work may undo me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My friend, you can afford to take the chances. Haven't I agreed to give you half the bonds?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall be suspected, and shall be obliged to stand my ground, while you will disappear from the scene.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Two thousand dollars will pay you for some inconvenience. I don't see why you should be suspected. You will be supposed to be fast asleep on your virtuous couch, while some bad burglar is robbing your worthy employer. Of course you will be thunderstruck when in the morning the appalling discovery is made. I'll tell you what will be a good dodge for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Offer a reward of a hundred dollars from your own purse for the discovery of the villain who has robbed the safe and abstracted the bonds.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark burst out into a loud guffaw as he uttered these words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hush!” said Gibbon, timidly. “I thought I heard some one moving.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What a timid fool you are!” muttered Stark, contemptuously. “If I had no more pluck, I'd hire myself out to herd cows.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It's a better business,” said Gibbon, bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, each to his taste! If you lose your place as bookkeeper, you might offer your services to some farmer. As for me, the danger, though there isn't much, is just enough to make it exciting.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't care for any such excitement,” said Gibbon, dispiritedly. “Why couldn't you have kept away and let me earn an honest living?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because I must live as well as you, my dear friend. When this little affair is over, you will thank me for helping you to a good thing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course all this conversation did not take place within Carl's hearing. While it was going on, the men had opened the office door and entered. Then, as Carl watched the window closely he saw a narrow gleam of light from a dark lantern illuminating the interior.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now they are at the safe,” thought Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We, who are privileged, will enter the office and watch the proceedings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon had no difficulty in opening the safe, for he was acquainted with the combination. Stark thrust in his hand eagerly and drew out the box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is what we want,” he said, in a tone of satisfaction. “Have you a key that will open it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I shall have to take box and all.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let us get through as soon as possible,” said Gibbon, uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can close the safe, if you want to. There is nothing else worth taking?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then we will evacuate the premises. Is there an old newspaper I can use to wrap up the box in? It might look suspicious if anyone should see it in our possession.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, here is one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He handed a copy of a weekly paper to Phil Stark, who skillfully wrapped up the box, and placing it under his arm, went out of the office, leaving Gibbon to follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where will you carry it?” asked Gibbon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Somewhere out of sight where I can safely open it. I should have preferred to take the bonds, and leave the box in the safe. Then the bonds might not have been missed for a week or more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That would have been better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That was the last that Carl heard. The two disappeared in the darkness, and Carl, raising himself from his place of concealment, stretched his cramped limbs and made the best of his way home. He thought no one would be up, but Mr. Jennings came out from the sitting-room, where he had flung himself on a lounge, and met Carl in the hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well?” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The safe has been robbed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who did it?” asked the manufacturer, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The two we suspected.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you see Mr. Gibbon, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he was accompanied by Mr. Stark.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You saw them enter the factory?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; I was crouching behind the stone wall on the other side of the road.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long were they inside?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not over fifteen minutes — perhaps only ten.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Gibbon knew the combination,” said Jennings, quietly. “There was no occasion to lose time in breaking open the safe. There is some advantage in having a friend inside. Did you see them go out?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carrying the tin box with them?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir. Mr. Stark wrapped it in a newspaper after they got outside.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But you saw the tin box?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, if necessary, you can testify to it. I thought it possible that Mr. Gibbon might have a key to open it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I overheard Stark regretting that he could not open it so as to abstract the bonds and leave the box in the safe. In that case, he said, it might be some time before the robbery was discovered.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He will himself make an unpleasant discovery when he opens the box. I don't think there is any call to pity him, do you, Carl?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir. I should like to be within sight when he opens it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The manufacturer laughed quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” he said; “if I could see it I should feel repaid for the loss of the box. Let it be a lesson for you, my boy. Those who seek to enrich themselves by unlawful means are likely in the end to meet with disappointment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think I need the lesson?” asked Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, my lad. I am sure you don't. But you do need a good night's rest. Let us go to bed at once, and get what sleep we may. I won't allow the burglary to keep me awake.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laughed in high good humor, and Carl went up to his comfortable room, where he soon lost all remembrance of the exciting scene of which he had been a witness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings went to the factory at the usual time the next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he entered the office the bookkeeper approached him pale and excited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Jennings,” he said, hurriedly, “I have bad news for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it, Mr. Gibbon?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When I opened the safe this morning, I discovered that the tin box had been stolen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings took the news quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you any suspicion who took it?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir. I — I hope the loss is not a heavy one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do not care to make the extent of the loss public. Were there any marks of violence? Was the safe broken open?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Singular; is it not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you will allow me I will join in offering a reward for the discovery of the thief. I feel in a measure responsible.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will think of your offer, Mr. Gibbon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He suspects nothing,” thought Gibbon, with a sigh of relief.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV. STARK'S DISAPPOINTMENT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHILIP STARK went back to the hotel with the tin box under his arm. He would like to have entered the hotel without notice, but this was impossible, for the landlord's nephew was just closing up. Though not late for the city, it was very late for the country, and he looked surprised when Stark came in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am out late,” said Stark, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is, late for Milford. In the city I never go to bed before midnight.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you been out walking?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You found it rather dark, did you not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is dark as a pocket.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You couldn't have found the walk a very pleasant one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are right, my friend; but I didn't walk for pleasure. The fact is, I am rather worried about a business matter. I have learned that I am threatened with a heavy loss — an unwise investment in the West — and I wanted time to think it over and decide how to act.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see,” answered the clerk, respectfully, for Stark's words led him to think that his guest was a man of wealth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I was rich enough to be worried by such a cause,” he said, jokingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you were. Some time I may be able to throw something in your way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think it would pay me to go to the West?” asked the clerk, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think it quite likely — if you know some one out in that section.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But I don't know anyone.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know me,” said Stark, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think you could help me to a place, Mr. Stark?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I could. A month from now write to me Col. Philip Stark, at Denver, Colorado, and I will see if I can find an opening for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are very kind, Mr. — I mean Col. Stark,” said the clerk, gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, never mind about the title,” returned Stark, smiling good-naturedly. “I only gave it to you just now, because everybody in Denver knows me as a colonel, and I am afraid a letter otherwise addressed would not reach me. By the way, I am sorry that I shall probably have to leave you to-morrow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So soon?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; it's this tiresome business. I should not wonder if I might lose ten thousand dollars through the folly of my agent. I shall probably have to go out to right things.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I couldn't afford to lose ten thousand dollars,” said the young man, regarding the capitalist before him with deference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I expect not. At your age I wasn't worth ten thousand cents. Now — but that's neither here nor there. Give me a light, please, and I will go up to bed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He was about to say how much he is worth now,” soliloquized the clerk. “I wish he had not stopped short. If I can't be rich myself, I like to talk with a rich man. There's hope for me, surely. He says that at my age he was not worth ten thousand cents. That is only a hundred dollars, and I am worth that. I must keep it to pay my expenses to Colorado, if he should send for me in a few weeks.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man had noticed with some curiosity the rather oddly-shaped bundle which Stark carried under his arm, but could not see his way clear to asking any questions about it. It seemed queer that Stark should have it with him while walking. Come to think of it, he remembered seeing him go out in the early evening, and he was quite confident that at that time he had no bundle with him. However, he was influenced only by a spirit of idle curiosity. He had no idea that the bundle was of any importance or value. The next day he changed his opinion on that subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark went up to his chamber, and setting the lamp on the bureau, first carefully locked the door, and then removed the paper from the tin box. He eyed it lovingly, and tried one by one the keys he had in his pocket, but none exactly fitted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he was experimenting he thought with a smile of the night clerk from whom he had just parted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Stark,” he soliloquized, addressing himself, “you are an old humbug. You have cleverly duped that unsophisticated young man downstairs. He looks upon you as a man of unbounded wealth, evidently, while, as a matter of fact, you are almost strapped. Let me see how much I have got left.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took out his wallet, and counted out seven dollars and thirty-eight cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That can hardly be said to constitute wealth,” he reflected, “but it is all I have over and above the contents of this box. That makes all the difference. Gibbon is of opinion that there are four thousand dollars in bonds inside, and he expects me to give him half. Shall I do it? Not such a fool! I'll give him fifteen hundred and keep the balance myself. That'll pay him handsomely, and the rest will be a good nestegg for me. If Gibbon is only half shrewd he will pull the wool over the eyes of that midget of an employer, and retain his place and comfortable salary. There will be no evidence against him, and he can pose as an innocent man. Bah! what a lot of humbug there is in the world. Well, well, Stark, you have your share, no doubt. Otherwise how would you make a living? To-morrow I must clear out from Milford, and give it a wide berth in future. I suppose there will be a great hue-and-cry about the robbery of the safe. It will be just as well for me to be somewhere else. I have already given the clerk a good reason for my sudden departure. Confound it, it's a great nuisance that I can't open this box! I would like to know before I go to bed just how much boodle I have acquired. Then I can decide how much to give Gibbon. If I dared I'd keep the whole, but he might make trouble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark, or Col. Philip Stark, as he had given his name, had a large supply of keys, but none of them seemed to fit the tin box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid I shall excite suspicion if I sit up any longer,” thought Stark. “I will go to bed and get up early in the morning. Then I may succeed better in opening this plaguy box.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He removed his clothing and got into bed. The evening had been rather an exciting one, but the excitement was a pleasurable one, for he had succeeded in the plan which he and the bookkeeper had so ingeniously formed and carried out, and here within reach was the rich reward after which they had striven. Mr. Stark was not troubled with a conscience — that he had got rid of years ago — and he was filled with a comfortable consciousness of having retrieved his fortunes when they were on the wane. So, in a short time he fell asleep, and slept peacefully. Toward morning, however, he had a disquieting dream. It seemed to him that he awoke suddenly from slumber. and saw Gibbon leaving the room with the tin box under his arm. He awoke really with beads of perspiration upon his brow — awoke to see by the sun streaming in at his window that the morning was well advanced, and the tin box was still safe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank Heaven, it was but a dream!” he murmured. “I must get up and try once more to open the box.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The keys had all been tried, and had proved not to fit. Mr. Stark was equal to the emergency. He took from his pocket a button hook and bent it so as to make a pick, and after a little experimenting succeeded in turning the lock. He lifted the lid eagerly, and with distended eyes prepared to gloat upon the stolen bonds. But over his face there came a startling change. The ashy blue hue of disappointment succeeded the glowing, hopeful look. He snatched at one of the folded slips of paper and opened it. Alas! it was valueless, mere waste paper. He sank into a chair in a limp, hopeless posture, quite overwhelmed. Then he sprang up suddenly, and his expression changed to one of fury and menace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If Julius Gibbon has played this trick upon me,” he said, between his set teeth, “he shall repent it — bitterly!”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI. A DISAGREEABLE SURPRISE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHILIP STARK sat down to breakfast in a savage frame of mind. He wanted to be revenged upon Gibbon, whom he suspected of having deceived him by opening and appropriating the bonds, and then arranged to have him carry off the box filled with waste paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat at the table but five minutes, for he had little or no appetite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the breakfast room he went out on the piazza, and with corrugated brows smoked a cigar, but it failed to have the usual soothing effect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If he had known the truth he would have left Milford without delay, but he was far from suspecting that the deception practiced upon him had been arranged by the man whom he wanted to rob. While there seemed little inducement for him to stay in Milford, he was determined to seek the bookkeeper, and ascertain whether, as he suspected, his confederate had in his possession the bonds which he had been scheming for. If so, he would compel him by threats to disgorge the larger portion, and then leave town at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the problem was, how to see him. He felt that it would be venturesome to go round to the factory, as by this time the loss might have been discovered. If only the box had been left, the discovery might be deferred. Then a bright idea occurred to him. He must get the box out of his own possession, as its discovery would compromise him. Why could he not arrange to leave it somewhere on the premises of his confederate?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He resolved upon the instant to carry out the idea. He went up to his room, wrapped the tin box in a paper, and walked round to the house of the bookkeeper. The coast seemed to be clear, as he supposed it would be. He slipped into the yard, and swiftly entered an outhouse. There was a large wooden chest, or box, which had once been used to store grain. Stark lifted the cover, dropped the box inside, and then, with a feeling of relief, walked out of the yard. But he had been observed. Mrs. Gibbon chanced to be looking out of a side window and saw him. She recognized him as the stranger who had been in the habit of spending recent evenings with her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What can he want here at this time?” she asked herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She deliberated whether she should go to the door and speak to Stark, but decided not to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He will call at the door if he has anything to say,” she reflected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark walked on till he reached the factory. He felt that he must see Julius Gibbon, and satisfy himself as to the meaning of the mysterious substitution of waste paper for bonds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he reached a point where he could see into the office, he caught the eye of Leonard, who was sitting at the window. He beckoned for him to come out, and Leonard was glad to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where are you going?” asked the bookkeeper, observing the boy's movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Stark is just across the street, and he beckoned for me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julius Gibbon flushed painfully, and he trembled with nervous agitation, for he feared something had happened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, go out, but don't stay long.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard crossed the street and walked up to Stark, who awaited him, looking grim and stern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your uncle is inside?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell him I wish to see him at once — on business of importance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He's busy,” said Leonard. “'He doesn't leave the office in business hours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Tell him I must see him — do you hear? He'll come fast enough.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder what it's all about,” thought Leonard, whose curiosity was naturally excited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Wait a minute!” said Stark, as he turned to go. “Is Jennings in?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir, he has gone over to the next town.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Probably the box has not been missed, then,” thought Stark. “So much the better! I can find out how matters stand, and then leave town.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well!” he said, aloud, “let your uncle understand that I must see him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leonard carried in the message. Gibbon made no objection, but took his hat and went out, leaving Leonard in charge of the office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, what is it?” he asked, hurriedly, as he reached Stark. “Is — is the box all right?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here, Gibbon,” said Stark, harshly, “have you been playing any of your infernal tricks upon me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know what you mean,” responded Gibbon, bewildered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stark eyed him sharply, but the bookkeeper was evidently sincere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is there anything wrong?” continued the latter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you mean to tell me you didn't know that wretched box was filled with waste paper?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't mean it?” exclaimed Gibbon, in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I do. I didn't open it till this morning, and in place of government bonds, I found only folded slips of newspaper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time Gibbon was suspicious. Having no confidence in Stark, it occurred to him that it was a ruse to deprive him of his share of the bonds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't believe you,” he said. “You want to keep all the bonds for yourself, and cheat me out of my share.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish to Heaven you were right. If there had been any bonds, I would have acted on the square. But somebody had removed them, and substituted paper. I suspected you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am ready to swear that this has happened without my knowledge,” said Gibbon, earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How, then, could it have occurred?” asked Stark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know, upon my honor. Where is the box?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — have disposed of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You should have waited and opened it before me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I asked you if you had a key that would open it. I wanted to open it last evening in the office.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will see after a while that I was acting on the square. You can open it for yourself at your leisure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can I? I don't know where it is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I can enlighten you,” said Stark, maliciously. “When you go home, you will find it in a chest in your woodshed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon turned pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't mean to say you have carried it to my house?” he exclaimed, in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I do. I had no further use for it, and thought you had the best claim to it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But, good heavens! if it is found there I shall be suspected.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very probably,” answered Stark, coolly. “Take my advice and put it out of the way.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How could you be so inconsiderate?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Because I suspected you of playing me a trick.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I swear to you, I didn't.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then somebody has tricked both of us. Has Mr. Jennings discovered the disappearance of the box?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I told him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When he came to the office.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did he say?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He took the matter coolly. He didn't say much.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where is he?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Gone to Winchester on business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Look here! Do you think he suspects you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am quite sure not. That is why I told him about the robbery.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He might suspect me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He said nothing about suspecting anybody.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think he removed the bonds and substituted paper?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If this were the case we should both be in a serious plight. I think I had better get out of town. You will have to lend me ten dollars.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't see how I can, Stark.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must!” said Stark, sternly, “or I will reveal the whole thing. Remember, the box is on your premises.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Heavens! what a quandary I am in,” said the bookkeeper, miserably. “That must be attended to at once. Why couldn't you put it anywhere else?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I told you that I wanted to be revenged upon you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish you had never come to Milford,” groaned the bookkeeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I hadn't myself, as things have turned out.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They prepared to start for Gibbon's house, when Mr. Jennings drove up. With him were two tall muscular men, whom Stark and Gibbon eyed uneasily. The two strangers jumped out of the carriage and advanced toward the two confederates.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Arrest those men!” said Jennings, in a quiet tone. “I charge them with opening and robbing my safe last night about eleven o'clock.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII. BROUGHT TO BAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHIL STARK made an effort to get away, but the officer was too quick for him. In a trice he was handcuffed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the meaning of this outrage?” demanded Stark, boldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have already explained,” said the manufacturer, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are quite on the wrong tack,” continued Stark, brazenly. “Mr. Gibbon was just informing me that the safe had been opened and robbed. It is the first I knew of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Julius Gibbon seemed quite prostrated by his arrest. He felt it necessary to say something, and followed the lead of his companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will bear me witness, Mr. Jennings,” he said, “that I was the first to inform you of the robbery. If I had really committed the burglary, I should have taken care to escape during the night.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should be glad to believe in your innocence,” rejoined the manufacturer. “but I know more about this matter than you suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I won't answer for Mr. Gibbon,” said Stark, who cared nothing for his confederate, if he could contrive to effect his own escape. “Of course he had opportunities, as bookkeeper, which an outsider could not have.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon eyed his companion in crime distrustfully. He saw that Stark was intending to throw him over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am entirely willing to have my room at the hotel searched,” continued Stark, gathering confidence. “If you find any traces of the stolen property there, you are welcome to make the most of them. I have no doubt Mr. Gibbon will make you the same offer in regard to his house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gibbon saw at once the trap which had been so craftily prepared for him. He knew that any search of his premises would result in the discovery of the tin box, and had no doubt that Stark would he ready to testify to any falsehood likely to fasten the guilt upon him. His anger was roused and he forgot his prudence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You — scoundrel!” he hissed between his closed teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You seem excited,” sneered Stark. “Is it possible that you object to the search?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If the missing box is found on my premises,” said Gibbon, in a white heat, “it is because you have concealed it there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think, gentlemen,” he said, “that settles it. I am afraid Mr Gibbon is guilty. I shall be glad to assist you to recover the stolen property. Did the box contain much that was of value?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I must caution you both against saying anything that will compromise you,” said one of the officers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have nothing to conceal,” went on Stark, brazenly. “I am obliged to believe that this man committed the burglary. It is against me that I have been his companion for the last week or two, but I used to know him, and that will account for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The unhappy bookkeeper saw the coils closing around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you will see your way to release me,” said Stark, addressing himself to Mr. Jennings. “I have just received information that my poor mother is lying dangerously sick in Cleveland, and I am anxious to start for her bedside to-day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why did you come round here this morning?” asked Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To ask Mr. Gibbon to repay me ten dollars which he borrowed of me the other day,” returned Stark, glibly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You — liar!” exclaimed Gibbon, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am prepared for this man's abuse,” said Stark. “I don't mind admitting now that a few days since he invited me to join him in the robbery of the safe. I threatened to inform you of his plan, and he promised to give it up. I supposed he had done so, but it is clear to me now that he carried out his infamous scheme.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked amused. He admired Stark's brazen effrontery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What have you to say to this charge, Mr. Gibbon?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Only this, sir, that I was concerned in the burglary.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He admits it!” said Stark, triumphantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But this man forced me to it. He threatened to write you some particulars of my past history which would probably have lost me my position if I did not agree to join him in the conspiracy. I was weak, and yielded. Now he is ready to betray me to save himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Jennings,” said Stark, coldly, “you will know what importance to attach to the story of a self-confessed burglar. Gibbon, I hope you will see the error of your ways, and restore to your worthy employer the box of valuable property which you stole from his safe.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is insufferable!” cried the bookkeeper “You are a double-dyed traitor, Phil Stark. You were not only my accomplice, but you instigated the crime.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will find it hard to prove this,” sneered Stark. “Mr. Jennings, I demand my liberty. If you have any humanity you will not keep me from the bediside of my dying mother.” “I admire your audacity, Mr. Stark,” observed the manufacturer, quietly. “Don't suppose for a moment that I give the least credit to your statements.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir,” said Gibbon. “I'm ready to accept the consequences of my act, but I don't want that scoundrel and traitor to go free.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can't prove anything against me,” said Stark, doggedly, “unless you accept the word of a self-confessed burglar, who is angry with me because I would not join him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All these protestations it would be better for you to keep till your trial begins, Mr. Stark,” said the manufacturer. “However, I think it only fair to tell you that I am better informed about you and your conspiracy than you imagine. Will you tell me where you were at eleven o'clock last evening?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was in my room at the hotel — no, I was taking a walk. I had received news of my mother's illness, and I was so much disturbed and grieved that I could not remain indoors.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You were seen to enter the office of this factory with Mr. Gibbon, and after ten minutes came out with the tin box under your arm.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who saw me?” demanded Stark, uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl Crawford came forward and answered this question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I did!” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A likely story! You were in bed and asleep.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are mistaken. I was on watch behind the stone wall just opposite. If you want proof, I can repeat some of the conversation that passed between you and Mr. Gibbon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without waiting for the request, Carl rehearsed some of the talk already recorded in a previous chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil Stark began to see that things were getting serious for him, but he was game to the last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I deny it,” he said, in a loud voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you also deny it, Mr. Gibbon?” asked Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I admit it,” replied Gibbon, with a triumphant glance at his foiled confederate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is a conspiracy against an innocent man,” said Stark, scowling. “You want to screen your bookkeeper, if possible. No one has ever before charged me with crime.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then how does it happen, Mr. Stark, that you were confined at the Joliet penitentiary for a term of years?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did he tell you this?” snarled Stark, pointing to Gibbon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A customer of mine from Chicago. He saw you at the hotel, and informed Carl last evening of your character. Carl, of course, brought the news to me. It was in consequence of this information that I myself removed the bonds from the box, early in the evening, and substituted strips of paper. Your enterprise, therefore, would have availed you little even if you had succeeded in getting off scot-free.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see the game is up,” said Stark, throwing off the mask. “It's true that I have been in the Joliet penitentiary. It was there that I became acquainted with your bookkeeper,” he added, maliciously. “Let him deny it if he dare.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall not deny it. It is true,” said Gibbon. “But I had resolved to live an honest life in future, and would have done so if this man had not pressed me into crime by his threats.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I believe you, Mr. Gibbon,” said the manufacturer, gently, “and I will see that this is counted in your favor. And now, gentlemen, I think there is no occasion for further delay.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two men were carried to the lockup and in due time were tried. Stark was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, Gibbon to five. At the end of two years, at the intercession of Mr. Jennings, he was pardoned, and furnished with money enough to go to Australia, where, his past character unknown, he was able to make an honest living, and gain a creditable position.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII. AFTER A YEAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TWELVE months passed without any special incident. With Carl it was a period of steady and intelligent labor and progress. He had excellent mechanical talent, and made remarkable advancement. He was not content with attention to his own work, but was a careful observer of the work of others, so that in one year he learned as much of the business as most boys would have done in three.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the year was up, Mr. Jennings detained him after supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you remember what anniversary this is, Carl?” he asked, pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; it is the anniversary of my going into the factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Exactly. How are you satisfied with the year and its work?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have been contented and happy, Mr. Jennings; and I feel that I owe my happiness and content to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad you say so,” he said, “but it is only fair to add that your own industry and intelligence have much to do with the satisfactory results of the year.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The superintendent tells me that outside of your own work you have a general knowledge of the business which would make you a valuable assistant to himself in case he needed one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl's face glowed with pleasure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I believe in being thorough,” he said, “and I am interested in every department of the business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Before you went into the factory you had not done any work.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I had attended school.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was not a bad preparation for business, but in some cases it gives a boy disinclination for manual labor.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I wouldn't care to work with my hands all my life.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't blame you for that. You have qualified yourself for something better. How much do I pay you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I began on two dollars a week and my board. At the end of six months you kindly advanced me to four dollars.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I dare say you have found it none too much for your wants.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have saved forty dollars out of it,” he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings looked pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have done admirably,” he said, warmly. “Forty dollars is not a large sum, but in laying it by you have formed a habit that will be of great service to you in after years. I propose to raise you to ten dollars a week.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But, sir, shall I earn so much? You are very kind, but I am afraid you will be a loser by your liberality.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are partly right,” he said. “Your services at present are hardly worth the sum I have agreed to pay, that is, in the factory, but I shall probably impose upon you other duties of an important nature soon.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you do, sir, I will endeavor to meet your expectations.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How would you like to take a journey Carl?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very much, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think of sending you — to Chicago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl, who had thought perhaps of a fifty-mile trip, looked amazed, but his delight was equal to his surprise. He had always wished to see the West, though Chicago can hardly be called a Western city now, since between it and the Pacific there is a broad belt of land two thousand miles in extent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think I am competent?” he asked, modestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I cannot say positively, but I think so,” answered Mr. Jennings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I shall be delighted to go. Will it be very soon?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, very soon. I shall want you to start next Monday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will be ready, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And I may as well explain what are to be your duties. I am, as you know, manufacturing a special line of chairs which I am desirous of introducing to the trade. I shall give you the names of men in my line in Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland and Chicago, and it will be your duty to call upon them, explain the merits of the chair, and solicit orders. In other words, you will be a traveling salesman or drummer. I shall pay your traveling expenses, ten dollars a week, and, if your orders exceed a certain limit, I shall give you a commission on the surplus.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Suppose I don't reach that limit?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall at all events feel that you have done your best. I will instruct you a little in your duties between now and the time of your departure. I should myself like to go in your stead, but I am needed here. There are, of course, others in my employ, older than yourself, whom I might send, but I have an idea that you will prove to be a good salesman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will try to be, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Monday morning Carl left Milford, reached New York in two hours and a half and, in accordance with the directions of Mr. Jennings, engaged passage and a stateroom on one of the palatial night lines of Hudson River steamers to Albany. The boat was well filled with passengers, and a few persons were unable to procure staterooms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl, however, applied in time, and obtained an excellent room. He deposited his gripsack therein, and then took a seat on deck, meaning to enjoy as long as possible the delightful scenery for which the Hudson is celebrated. It was his first long journey, and for this reason Carl enjoyed it all the more. He could not but contrast his present position and prospects with those of a year ago, when, helpless and penniless, he left an unhappy home to make his own way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What a delightful evening!” said a voice at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning, Carl saw sitting by him a young man of about thirty, dressed in somewhat pretentious style and wearing eyeglasses. He was tall and thin, and had sandy side whiskers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, it is a beautiful evening,” replied Carl, politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And the scenery is quite charming. Have you ever been all the way up the river?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, but I hope some day to take a day trip.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just so. I am not sure but I prefer the Rhine, with its romantic castles and vineclad hills.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you visited Europe, then?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, yes, several times. I have a passion for traveling. Our family is wealthy, and I have been able to go where I pleased.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That must be very pleasant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is. My name is Stuyvesant — one of the old Dutch families.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was not so much impressed, perhaps, as he should have been by this announcement, for he knew very little of fashionable life in New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't look like a Dutchman,” he said, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose you expected a figure like a beer keg,” rejoined Stuyvesant, laughing. “Some of my forefathers may have answered that description, but I am not built that way. Are you traveling far?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I may go as far as Chicago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is anyone with you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps you have friends in Chicago?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not that I am aware of. I am traveling on business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed; you are rather young for a business man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sixteen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, that cannot exactly be called venerable.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I suppose not.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way, did you succeed in getting a stateroom?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I have a very good one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You're in luck, on my word. I was just too late. The man ahead of me took the last room.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can get a berth, I suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But that is so common. Really, I should not know how to travel without a stateroom. Have you anyone with you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you will take me in I will pay the entire expense.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl hesitated. He preferred to be alone, but he was of an obliging disposition, and he knew that there were two berths in the stateroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If it will be an accommodation,” he said, “I will let you occupy the room with me, Mr. Stuyvesant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you, indeed! I shall esteem it a very great favor. Where is your room?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will show you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl led the way to No. 17, followed by his new acquaintance. Mr. Stuyvesant seemed very much pleased, and insisted on paying for the room at once. Carl accepted half the regular charges, and so the bargain was made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At ten o'clock the two travelers retired to bed. Carl was tired and went to sleep at once. He slept through the night. When he awoke in the morning the boat was in dock. He heard voices in the cabin, and the noise of the transfer of baggage and freight to the wharf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have overslept myself,” he said, and jumped up, hurriedly. He looked into the upper berth, but his roommate was gone. Something else was gone, too — his valise, and a wallet which he had carried in the pocket of his trousers.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIX. THE LOST BANK BOOK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL was not long in concluding that he had been robbed by his roommate. It was hard to believe that a Stuyvesant — a representative of one of the old Dutch families of New Amsterdam — should have stooped to such a discreditable act. Carl was sharp enough, however, to doubt the genuineness of Mr. Stuyvesent's claims to aristocratic lineage. Meanwhile he blamed himself for being so easily duped by an artful adventurer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To be sure, it was not as bad as it might be. His pocketbook only contained ten dollars in small bills. The balance of his money he had deposited for safe keeping in the inside pocket of his vest. This he had placed under his pillow, and so it had escaped the notice of the thief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The satchel contained a supply of shirts, underclothing, etc., and he was sorry to lose it. The articles were not expensive, but it would cost him from a dozen to fifteen dollars to replace them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl stepped to the door of his stateroom and called a servant who was standing near.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long have we been at the pier?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“About twenty minutes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you see my roommate go out?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A tall young man in a light overcoat?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir. I saw him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you notice whether he carried a valise in his hand?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A gripsack? Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A small one?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was mine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't say so, sir! And such a respectable-lookin' gemman, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He may have looked respectable, but he was a thief all the same.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't say? Did he take anything else, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He took my pocketbook.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well! He was a rascal, sure! But maybe it dropped on the floor.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl turned his attention to the carpet, but saw nothing of the lost pocketbook. He did find, however, a small book in a brown cover, which Stuyvesant had probably dropped. Picking it up, he discovered that it was a bank book on the Sixpenny Savings Bank of Albany, standing in the name of Rachel Norris, and numbered 17,310.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This is stolen property, too,” thought Carl. “I wonder if there is much in it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Opening the book he saw that there were three entries, as follows: 1883. Jan. 23. Five hundred dollars. “ June 10. Two hundred dollars. " Oct. 21. One hundred dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was besides this interest credited to the amount of seventy-five dollars. The deposits, therefore, made a grand total of $875.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No doubt Mr. Stuyvesant had stolen this book, but had not as yet found an opportunity of utilizing it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's dat?” asked the colored servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A savings bank book. My roommate must have dropped it. It appears to belong to a lady named Rachel Norris. I wish I could get it to her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is she an Albany lady, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You might look in the directory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So I will. It is a good idea.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope the gemman didn't take all your money, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he didn't even take half of it. I only wish I had been awake when the boat got to the dock.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I would have called you, sir, if you had asked me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not much used to traveling. I shall know better next time what to do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The finding of the bank book partially consoled Carl for the loss of his pocketbook and gripsack. He was glad to be able to defeat Stuyvesant in one of his nefarious schemes, and to be the instrument of returning Miss Norris her savings bank book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he left the boat he walked along till he reached a modest-looking hotel, where he thought the charges would be reasonable. He entered, and, going to the desk, asked if he could have a room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Large or small?” inquired the clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Small.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No. 67. Will you go up now?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Any baggage?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I had it stolen on the boat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clerk looked a little suspicious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We must require pay in advance, then,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly,” answered Carl, pulling out a roll of bills. I suppose you make special terms to commercial travelers?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you a drummer?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. I represent Henry Jennings, of Milford, New York.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All right, sir. Our usual rates are two dollars a day. To you they will be a dollar and a quarter.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well; I will pay you for two days. Is breakfast ready?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is on the table, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I will go in at once. I will go to my room afterwards.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of his loss, Carl had a hearty appetite, and did justice to the comfortable breakfast provided. He bought a morning paper, and ran his eye over the advertising columns. He had never before read an Albany paper, and wished to get an idea of the city in its business aspect. It occurred to him that there might be an advertisement of the lost bank book. But no such notice met his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went up to his room, which was small and plainly furnished, but looked comfortable. Going down again to the office, he looked into the Albany directory to see if he could find the name of Rachel Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a Rebecca Norris, who was put down as a dressmaker, but that was as near as he came to Rachel Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he set himself to looking over the other members of the Norris family. Finally he picked out Norris &amp; Wade, furnishing goods, and decided to call at the store and inquire if they knew any lady named Rachel Norris. The prospect of gaining information in this way did not seem very promising, but no other course presented itself, and Carl determined to follow up the clew, slight as it was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though unacquainted with Albany streets, he had little difficulty in finding the store of Norris &amp; Wade. It was an establishment of good size, well supplied with attractive goods. A clerk came forward to wait upon Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What can I show you?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You may show me Mr. Norris, if you please,” responded Carl, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is in the office,” said the clerk, with an answering smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl entered the office and saw Mr. Norris, a man of middle age, partially bald, with a genial, business-like manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, young man?” he said, looking at Carl inquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You must excuse me for troubling you, sir,” said Carl, who was afraid Mr. Norris would laugh at him, “but I thought you might direct me to Rachel Norris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Norris looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you want of Rachel Norris?” he asked, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have a little business with her,” answered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of what nature?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Excuse me, but I don't care to mention it at present.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Humph! you are very cautious for a young man, or rather boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Isn't that a good trait, sir?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good, but unusual. Are you a schoolboy?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, sir; I am a drummer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Norris put on a pair of glasses and scrutinized Carl more closely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like to see — just out of curiosity — the man that you travel for,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will ask him to call whenever he visits Albany. There is his card.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Norris took it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “It is Henry Jennings, an old schoolmate of mine.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And a good business man, even if he has sent out such a young drummer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should say so. There must be something in you, or he wouldn't have trusted you. How is Jennings?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is well, sir — well and prosperous.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is good news. Are you in his employ?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir. This is the first time I have traveled for him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How far are you going?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“As far as Chicago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't see what you can have to do with Rachel Norris. However, I don't mind telling you that she is my aunt, and — well, upon my soul! Here she is now.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he ran hastily to greet a tall, thin lady, wearing a black shawl, who at that moment entered the office.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXX. AN ECCENTRIC WOMAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS NORRIS dropped into a chair as if she were fatigued.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, Aunt Rachel, how are you feeling this morning?” asked her nephew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Out of sorts,” was the laconic reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am very sorry for that. I suppose there is reason for it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I've been robbed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed!” said Mr. Norris. “Lost your purse? I wonder more ladies are not robbed, carrying their money as carelessly as they do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That isn't it. I am always careful, as careful as any man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Still you got robbed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, but of a bank book.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Carl became attentive. It was clear that he would not have to look any farther for the owner of the book he had found in his stateroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What kind of a bank book?” inquired Mr Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had nearly a thousand dollars deposited in the Sixpenny Savings Bank. I called at the bank to make some inquiries about interest, and when I came out I presume some rascal followed me and stole the book — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you any idea who took it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I got into the horse cars, near the bank; next to me sat a young man in a light overcoat. There was no one on the other side of me. I think he must have taken it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That was Stuyvesant,” said Carl to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When did this happen, Aunt Rachel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Three days since.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why didn't you do something about it before?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I did. I advertised a reward of twenty-five dollars to anyone who would restore it to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There was no occasion for that. By giving notice at the bank, they would give you a new book after a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I preferred to recover the old one. Besides, I thought I would like to know what became of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I can tell you, Miss Norris,” said Carl, who thought it time to speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hitherto Miss Norris had not seemed aware of Carl's presence. She turned abruptly and surveyed him through her glasses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who are you?” she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This might seem rude, but it was only Miss Rachel's way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My name is Carl Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do I know you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, Miss Norris, but I hope you will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Humph! that depends. You say you know what became of my bank book?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, Miss Norris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It was taken by the young man who sat next to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you know?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He robbed me last night on the way from New York in a Hudson River steamboat.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That doesn't prove that he robbed me. I was robbed here in this city.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you say to this?” asked Carl, displaying the bank book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Bless me! That is my book. Where did you get it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl told his story briefly, how, on discovering that he had been robbed, he explored the stateroom and found the bank book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, well, I am astonished! And how did you know Mr. Norris was my nephew?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't know. I didn't know anything about him or you, but finding his name in the directory, I came here to ask if he knew any such person.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You are a smart boy, and a good, honest one,” said Miss Norris. “You have earned the reward, and shall have it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't want any reward, Miss Norris,” rejoined Carl. “I have had very little trouble in finding you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is of no consequence. I offered the reward, and Rachel Norris is a woman of her word.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She thrust her hand into her pocket, and drew out a wallet, more suitable to a man's use. Openings this, she took out three bills, two tens and a five, and extended them toward Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think I ought to take this money, Miss Norris,” said Carl, reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did that rascal rob you, too?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Of how much?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Ten dollars in money and some underclothing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well! This money will go toward making up your loss. You are not rich, I take it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not yet.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am, and can afford to give you this money. There, take it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, Miss Norris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I want to ask one favor of you. If you ever come across that young man in the light overcoat, have him arrested, and let me know.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will, Miss Norris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you live in Albany?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl explained that he was traveling on business, and should leave the next day if he could get through.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How far are you going?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To Chicago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you attend to some business for me there?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, if it won't take too long a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good! Come round to my house to supper at six o'clock, and I will tell you about it. Henry, write my address on a piece of paper, and give it to this young man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry Norris smiled, and did as his aunt requested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have considerable confidence in this young man?” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You may be mistaken.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Rachel Norris is not often mistaken.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will accept your invitation with pleasure, Miss Norris,” said Carl, bowing politely. “Now, as I have some business to attend to, I will bid you both good-morning.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Carl went out, Miss Norris said: “Henry, that is a remarkable boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think favorably of him myself. He is in the employ of an old schoolmate of mine, Henry Jennings, of Milford. By the way, what business are you going to put into his hands?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A young man who has a shoe store on State Street has asked me for a loan of two thousand dollars to extend his business. His name is John French, and his mother was an old schoolmate of mine, though some years younger. Now I know nothing of him. If he is a sober, steady, industrious young man, I may comply with his request. This boy will investigate and report to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And you will be guided by his report?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Probably.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Aunt Rachel, you are certainly very eccentric.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I may be, but I am not often deceived.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, I hope you won't be this time. The boy seems to me a very good boy, but you can't put an old head on young shoulders.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Some boys have more sense than men twice their age.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't mean me, I hope, Aunt Rachel,” said Mr. Norris, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed, I don't. I shall not flatter you by speaking of you as only twice this boy's age.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see, Aunt Rachel, there is no getting the better of you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile Carl was making business calls. He obtained a map of the city, and located the different firms on which he proposed to call. He had been furnished with a list by Mr. Jennings. He was everywhere pleasantly received — in some places with an expression of surprise at his youth — but when he began to talk he proved to be so well informed upon the subject of his call that any prejudice excited by his age quickly vanished. He had the satisfaction of securing several unexpectedly large orders for the chair, and transmitting them to Mr. Jennings by the afternoon mail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He got through his business at four o'clock, and rested for an hour or more at his hotel. Then he arranged his toilet, and set out for the residence of Miss Rachel Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was rather a prim-looking, three-story house, such as might be supposed to belong to a maiden lady. He was ushered into a sitting-room on the second floor, where Miss Norris soon joined him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad to see you, my young friend,” she said, cordially. “You are in time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I always try to be, Miss Norris.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is a good way to begin.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here a bell rang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Supper is ready,” she said. “Follow me downstairs.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl followed the old lady to the rear room on the lower floor. A small table was set in the center of the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take a seat opposite me,” said Miss Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were two other chairs, one on each side — Carl wondered for whom they were set. No sooner were he and Miss Norris seated than two large cats approached the table, and jumped up, one into each chair. Carl looked to see them ordered away, but instead, Miss Norris nodded pleasantly, saying: “That's right, Jane and Molly, you are punctual at meals.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two cats eyed their mistress gravely, and began to purr contentedly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXI. CARL TAKES SUPPER WITH MISS NORRIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“THIS is my family,” said Miss Norris, pointing to the cats.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I like cats,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you?” returned Miss Norris, looking pleased. “Most boys tease them. Do you see poor Molly's ear? That wound came from a stone thrown by a bad boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Many boys are cruel,” said Carl, “but I remember that my mother was very fond of cats, and I have always protected them from abuse.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he spoke he stroked Molly, who purred an acknowledgment of his attention. This completed the conquest of Miss Norris, who inwardly decided that Carl was the finest boy she had ever met. After she had served Carl from the dishes on the table, she poured out two saucers of milk and set one before each cat, who, rising upon her hind legs, placed her forepaws on the table, and gravely partook of the refreshments provided. Jane and Molly were afterwards regaled with cold meat, and then, stretching themselves out on their chairs, closed their eyes in placid content.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During the meal Miss Norris questioned Carl closely as to his home experiences. Having no reason for concealment Carl frankly related his troubles with his stepmother, eliciting expressions of sympathy and approval from his hostess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your stepmother must be an ugly creature?” she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid I am prejudiced against her,” said Carl, “but that is my opinion.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your father must be very weak to be influenced against his own son by such a woman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl winced a little at this outspoken criticism, for he was attached to his father in spite of his unjust treatment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My father is an invalid,” he said, apologetically, “and I think he yielded for the sake of peace.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All the same, he ought not to do it,” said Miss Norris. “Do you ever expect to live at home again?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Not while my stepmother is there,” answered Carl. “But I don't know that I should care to do so under any circumstances, as I am now receiving a business training. I should like to make a little visit home,” he added, thoughtfully, “and perhaps I may do so after I return from Chicago. I shall have no favors to ask, and shall feel independent.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you ever need a home,” said Miss Norris, abruptly, “come here. You will be welcome.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you very much,” said Carl, gratefully. “It is all the more kind in you since you have known me so short a time.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have known you long enough to judge of you,” said the maiden lady. “And now if you won't have anything more we will go into the next room and talk business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl followed her into the adjoining room, and Miss Norris at once plunged into the subject. She handed him a business card bearing this inscription: JOHN FRENCH, BOOTS, SHOES AND RUBBER GOODS, 42a State Street, CHICAGO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“This young man wants me to lend him two thousand dollars to extend his business,” she said. “He is the son of an old school friend, and I am willing to oblige him if he is a sober, steady and economical business man. I want you to find out whether this is the case and report to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Won't that be difficult?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you afraid to undertake anything that is difficult?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” answered Carl, with a smile. “I was only afraid I might not do the work satisfactorily.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall give you no instructions,” said Miss Norris. “I shall trust to your good judgment. I will give you a letter to Mr. French, which you can use or not, as you think wise. Of course, I shall see that you are paid for your trouble.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you,” said Carl. “I hope my services may be worth compensation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know how you are situated as to money, but I can give you some in advance,” and the old lady opened her pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, thank you, Miss Norris; I shall not need it. I might have been short if you had not kindly paid me a reward for a slight service.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Slight, indeed! If you had lost a bank book like mine you would be glad to get it back at such a price. If you will catch the rascal who stole it I will gladly pay you as much more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I might for my own sake, but I am afraid it would be too late to recover my money and clothing.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At an early hour Carl left the house, promising to write to Miss Norris from Chicago.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXII. A STARTLING DISCOVERY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WELL,” thought Carl, as he left the house where he had been so hospitably entertained, “I shall not lack for business. Miss Norris seems to have a great deal of confidence in me, considering that I am a stranger. I will take care that she does not repent it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you give a poor man enough money to buy a cheap meal?” asked a plaintive voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl scanned the applicant for charity closely. He was a man of medium size, with a pair of small eyes, and a turnup nose. His dress was extremely shabby, and he had the appearance of one who was on bad terms with fortune. There was nothing striking about his appearance, yet Carl regarded him with surprise and wonder. Despite the difference in age, he bore a remarkable resemblance to his stepbrother, Peter Cook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I haven't eaten anything for twenty-four hours,” continued the tramp, as he may properly be called. “It's a hard world to such as me, boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should judge so from your looks,” answered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed you are right. I was born to ill luck.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl had some doubts about this. Those who represent themselves as born to ill luck can usually trace the ill luck to errors or shortcomings of their own. There are doubtless inequalities of fortune, but not as great as many like to represent. Of two boys who start alike one may succeed, and the other fail, but in nine cases out of ten the success or failure may be traced to a difference in the qualities of the boys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here is a quarter if that will do you any good,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man clutched at it with avidity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you. This will buy me a cup of coffee and a plate of meat, and will put new life into me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was about to hurry away, but Carl felt like questioning him further. The extraordinary resemblance between this man and his stepbrother led him to think it possible that there might be a relationship between them. Of his stepmother's family he knew little or nothing. His father had married her on short acquaintance, and she was very reticent about her former life. His father was indolent, and had not troubled himself to make inquiries. He took her on her own representation as the widow of a merchant who had failed in business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the impulse of the moment — an impulse which he could not explain — Carl asked abruptly — “Is your name Cook?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A look of surprise, almost of stupefaction, appeared on the man's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who told you my name?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then your name is Cook?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is your object in asking?” said the man, suspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I mean you no harm,” returned Carl, “but I have reasons for asking.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you ever see me before?” asked the man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then what makes you think my name is Cook? It is not written on my face, is it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then how — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl interrupted him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know a boy named Peter Cook,” he said, “who resembles you very strongly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know Peter Cook — little Peter?” exclaimed the tramp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes. Is he a relation of yours?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should think so!” responded Cook, emphatically. “He is my own son — that is, if he is a boy of about your age.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where is he? Is his mother alive?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your wife!” exclaimed Carl, overwhelmed at the thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She was my wife!” said Cook, “but while I was in California, some years since, she took possession of my small property, procured a divorce through an unprincipled lawyer, and I returned to find myself without wife, child or money. Wasn't that a mean trick?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think it was.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can you tell me where she is?” asked Cook, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I can.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where can I find my wife?” asked Cook, with much eagerness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl hesitated. He did not like his stepmother; he felt that she had treated him meanly, but he was not prepared to reveal her present residence till he knew what course Cook intended to pursue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She is married again,” he said, watching Cook to see what effect this announcement might have upon him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no objection, I am sure,” responded Cook, indifferently. “Did she marry well?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She married a man in good circumstances.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She would take good care of that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you don't intend to reclaim her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can I? She obtained a divorce, though by false representations. I am glad to be rid of her, but I want her to restore the two thousand dollars of which she robbed me. I left my property in her hands, but when she ceased to be my wife she had no right to take possession of it. I ought not to be surprised, however. It wasn't the first theft she had committed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Can this be true?” asked Carl, excited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I married her without knowing much of her antecedents. Two years after marriage I ascertained that she had served a year's term of imprisonment for a theft of jewelry from a lady with whom she was living as housekeeper.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you sure of this?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly. She was recognized by a friend of mine, who had been an official at the prison. When taxed with it by me she admitted it, but claimed that she was innocent. I succeeded in finding a narrative of the trial in an old file of papers, and came to the conclusion that she was justly convicted.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What did you do?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I proposed separation, but she begged me to keep the thing secret, and let ourselves remain the same as before. I agreed out of consideration for her, but had occasion to regret it. My business becoming slack, I decided to go to California in the hope of acquiring a competence. I was not fortunate there, and was barely able, after a year, to get home. I found that my wife had procured a divorce, and appropriated the little money I had left. Where she had gone, or where she had conveyed our son, I could not learn. You say you know where she is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I do.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Will you tell me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Cook,” said Carl, after a pause for reflection, “I will tell you, but not just at present. I am on my way to Chicago on business. On my return I will stop here, and take you with me to the present home of your former wife. You will understand my interest in the matter when I tell you that she is now married to a relative of my own.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I pity him whoever he is,” said Cook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I think he is to be pitied,” said Carl, gravely; “but the revelation you will be able to make will enable him to insist upon a separation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The best thing he can do! How long before you return to Albany?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“A week or ten days.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know how I am to live in the meantime,” said Cook, anxiously. “I am penniless, but for the money you have just given me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At what price can you obtain board?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know of a decent house where I can obtain board and a small room for five dollars a week.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Here are twelve dollars. This will pay for two weeks' board, and give you a small sum besides. What is the address?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cook mentioned a number on a street by the river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl took it down in a notebook with which he had provided himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“When I return to Albany,” he said, “I will call there at once.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't forget me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I shall be even more anxious to meet you than you will be to meet me. The one to whom your former wife is married is very near and dear to me, and I cannot bear to think that he has been so wronged and imposed upon!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, sir! I shall wait for you with confidence. If I can get back from my former wife the money she robbed me of, I can get on my feet again, and take a respectable position in society. It is very hard for a man dressed as I am to obtain any employment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Looking at his shabby and ragged suit, Carl could readily believe this statement. If he had wished to employ anyone he would hardly have been tempted to engage a man so discreditable in appearance. “Be of good courage, Mr. Cook,” he said, kindly. “If your story is correct, and I believe it is, there are better days in store for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you for those words,” said Cook, earnestly. “They give me new hope.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIII. FROM ALBANY TO NIAGARA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CARL took the afternoon train on the following day for Buffalo. His thoughts were busy with the startling discovery he had made in regard to his stepmother. Though he had never liked her, he had been far from imagining that she was under the ban of the law. It made him angry to think that his father had been drawn into a marriage with such a woman — that the place of his idolized mother had been taken by one who had served a term at Sing Sing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did Peter know of his mother's past disgrace? he asked himself. Probably not, for it had come before his birth. He only wondered that the secret had never got out before. There must be many persons who had known her as a prisoner, and could identify her now. She had certainly been fortunate with the fear of discovery always haunting her. Carl could not understand how she could carry her head so high, and attempt to tyrannize over his father and himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What the result would be when Dr. Crawford learned the antecedents of the woman whom he called wife Carl did not for a moment doubt. His father was a man of very strict ideas on the subject of honor, and good repute, and the discovery would lead him to turn from Mrs. Crawford in abhorrence. Moreover, he was strongly opposed to divorce, and Carl had heard him argue that a divorced person should not be permitted to remarry. Yet in ignorance he had married a divorced woman, who had been convicted of theft, and served a term of imprisonment. The discovery would be a great shock to him, and it would lead to a separation and restore the cordial relations between himself and his son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not long after his settlement in Milford; Carl had written as follows to his father:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“DEAR FATHER: — Though I felt obliged to leave home for reasons which we both understand, I am sure that you will feel interested to know how I am getting along. I did not realize till I had started out how difficult it is for a boy, brought up like myself, to support himself when thrown upon his own exertions. A newsboy can generally earn enough money to maintain himself in the style to which he is accustomed, but I have had a comfortable and even luxurious home, and could hardly bring myself to live in a tenement house, or a very cheap boarding place. Yet I would rather do either than stay in a home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of one member.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will not take up your time by relating the incidents of the first two days after I left home. I came near getting into serious trouble through no fault of my own, but happily escaped. When I was nearly penniless I fell in with a prosperous manufacturer of furniture who has taken me into his employment. He gives me a home in his own house, and pays me two dollars a week besides. This is enough to support me economically, and I shall after a while receive better pay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not in the office, but in the factory, and am learning the business practically, starting in at the bottom. I think I have a taste for it, and the superintendent tells me I am making remarkable progress. The time was when I would have hesitated to become a working boy, but I have quite got over such foolishness. Mr. Jennings, my employer, who is considered a rich man, began as I did, and I hope some day to occupy a position similar to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I trust you are quite well and happy, dear father. My only regret is, that I cannot see you occasionally. While my stepmother and Peter form part of your family, I feel that I can never live at home. They both dislike me, and I am afraid I return the feeling. If you are sick or need me, do not fail to send for me, for I can never forget that you are my father, as I am your affectionate son, CARL.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This letter was handed to Dr. Crawford at the breakfast table. He colored and looked agitated when he opened the envelope, and Mrs. Crawford, who had a large share of curiosity, did not fail to notice this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“From whom is your letter, my dear?” she asked, in the soft tone which was habitual with her when she addressed her husband</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The handwriting is Carl's,” answered Dr. Crawford, already devouring the letter eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh!” she answered, in a chilly tone. “I have been expecting you would hear from him. How much money does he send for?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have not finished the letter.” Dr. Crawford continued reading. When he had finished he laid it down beside his plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well?” said his wife, interrogatively. “What does he have to say? Does he ask leave to come home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he is quite content where he is.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And where is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At Milford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is not far away?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; not more than sixty miles.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does he ask for money?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he is employed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In a furniture factory.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, a factory boy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he is learning the business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He doesn't seem to be very ambitious,” sneered Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On the contrary, he is looking forward to being in business for himself some day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On your money — I understand.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Really, Mrs. Crawford, you do the boy injustice. He hints nothing of the kind. He evidently means to raise himself gradually as his employer did before him. By the way, he has a home in his employer's family. I think Mr. Jennings must have taken a fancy to Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope he will find him more agreeable than I did,” said Mrs. Crawford, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you quite sure that you always treated Carl considerately, my dear?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't flatter or fondle him, if that is what you mean. I treated him as well as he could expect.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you treat him as well as Peter, for example?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No. There is a great difference between the two boys. Peter is always respectful and obliging, and doesn't set up his will against mine. He never gives me a moment's uneasiness.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you will continue to find him a comfort, my dear,” said Dr. Crawford, meekly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked across the table at the fat, expressionless face of his stepson, and he blamed himself because he could not entertain a warmer regard for Peter. Somehow he had a slight feeling of antipathy, which he tried to overcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No doubt he is a good boy, since his mother says so,” reflected the doctor, “but I don't appreciate him. I will take care, however, that neither he nor his mother sees this.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Peter heard his mother's encomium upon him, he laughed in his sleeve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I'll remind ma of that when she scolds me,” he said to himself. “I'm glad Carl isn't coming back. He was always interferin' with me. Now, if ma and I play our cards right we'll get all his father's money. Ma thinks he won't live long, I heard her say so the other day. Won't it be jolly for ma and me to come into a fortune, and live just as we please! I hope ma will go to New York. It's stupid here, but I s'pose we'll have to stay for the present.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is Carl's letter private?” asked Mrs. Crawford, after a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I think he would rather I didn't show it ,” returned her husband, remembering the allusion made by Carl to his stepmother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, well, I am not curious,” said Mrs. Crawford, tossing her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">None the less, however, she resolved to see and read the letter, if she could get hold of it without her husband's knowledge. He was so careless that she did not doubt soon to find it laid down somewhere. In this she proved correct. Before the day was over, she found Carl's letter in her husband's desk. She opened and read it eagerly with a running fire of comment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ `Reasons which we both understand,' ” she repeated, scornfully. “That is a covert attack upon me. Of course, I ought to expect that. So he had a hard time. Well, it served him right for conducting himself as he did. Ah, here is another hit at me — `Yet I would rather do either than live in a home made unpleasant by the persistent hostility of one member.' He is trying to set his father against me. Well, he won't succeed. I can twist Dr. Paul Crawford round my finger, luckily, and neither his son nor anyone else can diminish my influence over him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She read on for some time till she reached this passage: “While my stepmother and Peter form a part of your family I can never live at home. They both dislike me, and I am afraid I return the feeling.” “Thanks for the information,” she muttered. “I knew it before. This letter doesn't make me feel any more friendly to you, Carl Crawford. I see that you are trying to ingratiate yourself with your father, and prejudice him against me and my poor Peter, but I think I can defeat your kind intentions.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She folded up the letter, and replaced it in her husband's desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wonder if my husband will answer Carl's artful epistle,” she said to herself. “He can if he pleases. He is weak as water, and I will see that he goes no farther than words.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford did answer Carl's letter. This is his reply:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“DEAR CARL: — I am glad to hear that you are comfortably situated. I regret that you were so headstrong and unreasonable. It seems to me that you might, with a little effort, have got on with your stepmother. You could hardly expect her to treat you in the same way as her own son. He seems to be a good boy, but I own that I have never been able to become attached to him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl read this part of the letter with satisfaction. He knew how mean and contemptible Peter was, and it would have gone to his heart to think that his father had transferred his affection to the boy he had so much reason to dislike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad you are pleased with your prospects. I think I could have done better for you had your relations with your stepmother been such as to make it pleasant for you to remain at home. You are right in thinking that I am interested in your welfare. I hope, my dear Carl, you will become a happy and prosperous man. I do not forget that you are my son, and I am still your affectionate father, “PAUL CRAWFORD.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was glad to receive this letter. It showed him that his stepmother had not yet succeeded in alienating from him his father's affection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But we must return to the point where we left Carl on his journey to Buffalo. He enjoyed his trip over the Central road during the hours of daylight. He determined on his return to make an all-day trip so that he might enjoy the scenery through which he now rode in the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At Buffalo he had no other business except that of Mr. Jennings, and immediately after breakfast he began to make a tour of the furniture establishments. He met with excellent success, and had the satisfaction of sending home some large orders. In the evening he took train for Niagara, wishing to see the falls in the early morning, and resume his journey in the afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He registered at the International Hotel on the American side. It was too late to do more than take an evening walk, and see the falls gleaming like silver through the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will go to bed early,” thought Carl, “and get up at six o'clock.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did go to bed early, but he was more fatigued than he supposed, and slept longer than he anticipated. It was eight o'clock before he came downstairs. Before going in to breakfast, he took a turn on the piazzas. Here he fell in with a sociable gentleman, much addicted to gossip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good-morning!” he said. “Have you seen the falls yet?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I caught a glimpse of them last evening I am going to visit them after breakfast.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There are a good many people staying here just now — some quite noted persons, too.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, what do you say to an English lord?” and Carl's new friend nodded with am important air, as if it reflected great credit on the hotel to have so important a guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Does he look different from anyone else?” asked Carl, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, to tell the truth, he isn't much to look at,” said the other. “The gentleman who is with him looks more stylish. I thought he was the lord at first, but I afterwards learned that he was an American named Stuyvesant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl started at the familiar name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he tall and slender, with side whiskers, and does he wear eyeglasses?” he asked, eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; you know him then?” said the other, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered Carl, with a smile, “I am slightly acquainted with him. I am very anxious to meet him again.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIV. CARL MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OF AN ENGLISH LORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“THERE they are now,” said the stranger, suddenly pointing out two persons walking slowly along the piazza. “The small man, in the rough suit, and mutton-chop whiskers, is Lord Bedford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl eyed the British nobleman with some curiosity. Evidently Lord Bedford was no dude. His suit was of rough cloth and ill-fitting. He was barely five feet six inches in height, with features decidedly plain, but with an absence of pretension that was creditable to him, considering that he was really what he purported to be. Stuyvesant walked by his side, nearly a head taller, and of more distinguished bearing, though of plebeian extraction. His manner was exceedingly deferential, and he was praising England and everything English in a fulsome manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, my lord,” Carl overheard him say, “I have often thought that society in England is far superior to our American society.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thanks, you are very kind,” drawled the nobleman, “but really I find things very decent in America, upon my word. I had been reading Dickens's `Notes' before I came over and I expected to find you very uncivilized, and — almost aboriginal; but I assure you I have met some very gentlemanly persons in America, some almost up to our English standard.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Really, my lord, such a tribute from a man in your position is most gratifying. May I state this on your authority?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I don't mind, but I would rather not get into the papers, don't you know. You are not a — reporter, I hope.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope not,” said Mr. Stuyvesant, in a lofty tone. “I am a scion of one of the oldest families in New York. Of course I know that social position is a very different thing here from what it is in England. It must be a gratifying thing to reflect that you are a lord.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I suppose so. I never thought much about it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like so much to be a lord. I care little for money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then, by Jove, you are a remarkable man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“In comparison with rank, I mean. I would rather be a lord with a thousand pounds a year than a rich merchant with ten times as much.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You'll find it very inconvenient being a lord on a thousand; you might as well be a beggar.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose, of course, high rank requires a large rent roll. In fact, a New York gentleman requires more than a trifle to support him. I can't dress on less than two hundred pounds a year.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your American tailors are high-priced, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Those that I employ; we have cheap tailors, of course, but I generally go to Bell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Stuyvesant was posing as a gentleman of fashion. Carl, who followed at a little distance behind the pair, was much amused by his remarks, knowing what he did about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think a little of going to England in a few months,” continued Stuyvesant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed! You must look me up,” said Bedford, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should, indeed, be delighted,” said Stuyvesant, effusively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That is, if I am in England. I may be on the Continent, but you can inquire for me at my club — the Piccadilly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall esteem it a great honor, my lord. I have a penchant for good society. The lower orders are not attractive to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“They are sometimes more interesting,” said the Englishman; “but do you know, I am surprised to hear an American speak in this way. I thought you were all on a level here in a republic.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, my lord!” expostulated Stuyvesant, deprecatingly. “You don't think I would associate with shopkeepers and common tradesmen?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. A cousin of mine is interested in a wine business in London. He is a younger son with a small fortune, and draws a very tidy income from his city business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But his name doesn't appear on the sign, I infer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I think not. Then you are not in business, Mr. Stuyvesant?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I inherited an income from my father. It isn't as large as I could wish, and I have abstained from marrying because I could not maintain the mode of living to which I have been accustomed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You should marry a rich girl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True! I may do so, since your lordship recommends it. In fact, I have in view a young lady whose father was once lord mayor I beg pardon, mayor) of New York. Her father is worth a million.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Pounds?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well, no, dollars. I should have said two hundred thousand pounds.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If the girl is willing, it may be a good plan.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, my lord. Your advice is very kind.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The young man seems on very good terms with Lord Bedford,” said Carl's companion, whose name was Atwood, with a shade of envy in his voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish he would introduce me,” went on Mr. Atwood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should prefer the introduction of a different man,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why? He seems to move in good society.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Without belonging to it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then you know him?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Better than I wish I did.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Atwood looked curious.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will explain later,” said Carl; “now I must go in to breakfast.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will go with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though Stuyvesant had glanced at Carl, he did not appear to recognize him, partly, no doubt, because he had no expectation of meeting the boy he had robbed, at Niagara. Besides, his time and attention were so much taken up by his aristocratic acquaintance that he had little notice for anyone else. Carl observed with mingled amusement and vexation that Mr. Stuyvesant wore a new necktie, which he had bought for himself in New York, and which had been in the stolen gripsack.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If I can find Lord Bedford alone I will put him on his guard,” thought Carl. “I shall spoil Mr. Stuyvesant's plans.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After breakfast Carl prepared to go down to the falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the way he overtook Lord Bedford walking in the same direction, and, as it happened, without a companion. Carl quickened his pace, and as he caught up with him, he raised his hat, and said: “Lord Bedford, I believe.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes,” answered the Englishman, inquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I must apologize for addressing a stranger, but I want to put you on your guard against a young man whom I saw walking with you on the piazza.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he — what do you know of him?” asked Lord Bedford, laying aside his air of indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I know that he is an adventurer and a thief. I made his acquaintance on a Hudson River steamer, and he walked off with my valise and a small sum of money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is this true?” asked the Englishman, in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Quite true. He is wearing one of my neckties at this moment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The confounded cad!” ejaculated the Englishman, angrily. “I suppose he intended to rob me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no doubt of it. That is why I ventured to put you on your guard.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am a thousand times obliged to you. Why, the fellow told me he belonged to one of the best families in New York.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If he does, he doesn't do much credit to the family.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Quite true! Why, he was praising everything English. He evidently wanted to gain my confidence.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“May I ask where you met him?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“On the train. He offered me a light. Before I knew it, he was chatting familiarly with me. But his game is spoiled. I will let him know that I see through him and his designs.” “Then my object is accomplished,” said Carl. “Please excuse my want of ceremony.” He turned to leave, but Bedford called him back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you are going to the falls, remain with me,” he said. “We shall enjoy it better in company.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“With pleasure. Let me introduce myself as Carl Crawford. I am traveling on business and don't belong to one of the first families.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see you will suit me,” said the Englishman, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then up came Stuyvesant, panting and breathless. “My lord,” he said, “I lost sight of you. If you will allow me I will join you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir!” said the Englishman, in a freezing voice, “I have not the honor of knowing you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stuyvesant was overwhelmed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I hope I have not offended you, my lord,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sir, I have learned your character from this young man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This called the attention of Stuyvesant to Carl. He flushed as he recognized him</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Stuyvesant,” said Carl, “I must trouble you to return the valise you took from my stateroom, and the pocketbook which you borrowed. My name is Carl Crawford, and my room is 71.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stuyvesant turned away abruptly. He left the valise at the desk, but Carl never recovered his money.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXV. WHAT CARL LEARNED IN CHICAGO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AS Carl walked back from the falls he met Mr. Atwood, who was surprised to find his young acquaintance on such intimate terms with Lord Bedford. He was about to pass with a bow, when Carl, who was good-natured, said: “Won't you join us, Mr. Atwood? If Lord Bedford will permit, I should like to introduce you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Glad to know any friend of yours, Mr. Crawford,” said the Englishman, affably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I feel honored by the introduction,” said Atwood, bowing profoundly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you are not a friend of Mr. — ah, Mr. Stuyvesant,” said the nobleman, “the person I was talking with this morning. Mr. Crawford tells me he is a — what do you call it? — a confidence man.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have no acquaintance with him, my lord. I saw him just now leaving the hotel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid he has gone away with my valise and money,” said Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“If you should be inconvenienced, Mr. Crawford,” said the nobleman, “my purse is at your disposal.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you very much, Lord Bedford,” said Carl, gratefully. “I am glad to say I am still fairly well provided with money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I was about to make you the same offer, Mr. Crawford,” said Atwood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you! I appreciate your kindness, even if I'm not obliged to avail myself of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Returning to the hotel, Lord Bedford ordered a carriage, and invited Atwood and Carl to accompany him on a drive. Mr. Atwood was in an ecstasy, and anticipated with proud satisfaction telling his family of his intimate friend, Lord Bedford, of England. The peer, though rather an ordinary-looking man, seemed to him a model of aristocratic beauty. It was a weakness on the part of Mr. Atwood, but an amiable one, and is shared by many who live under republican institutions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After dinner Carl felt obliged to resume his journey. He had found his visit to Niagara very agreeable, but his was a business and not a pleasure trip, and loyalty to his employer required him to cut it short. Lord Bedford shook his hand heartily at parting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope we shall meet again, Mr. Crawford,” he said. “I expect, myself, to reach Chicago on Saturday, and shall be glad to have you call on me at the Palmer House.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, my lord; I will certainly inquire for you there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is a very good fellow, even if he is a lord,” thought Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our young hero was a thorough American, and was disposed to think with Robert Burns, that “ The rank is but the guinea, stamp; The man's the gold for a' that! ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No incident worth recording befell Carl on his trip to Chicago. As as salesman he met with excellent success, and surprised Mr. Jennings by the size of his orders. He was led, on reaching Chicago, to register at the Sherman House, on Clark Street, one of the most reliable among the many houses for travelers offered by the great Western metropolis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the second day he made it a point to find out the store of John French, hoping to acquire the information desired by Miss Norris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a store of good size, and apparently well stocked. Feeling the need of new foot-gear, Carl entered and asked to be shown some shoes. He was waited upon by a young clerk named Gray, with whom he struck up a pleasant acquaintance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you live in Chicago?” asked Gray? sociably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I am from New York State. I am here on business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Staying at a hotel?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, at the Sherman. If you are at leisure this evening I shall be glad to have you call on me. I am a stranger here, and likely to find the time hang heavy on my hands.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall be free at six o'clock.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then come to supper with me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you, I shall be glad to do so,” answered Gray, with alacrity. Living as he did at a cheap boarding house, the prospect of a supper at a first-class hotel was very attractive. He was a pleasant-faced young man of twenty, who had drifted to Chicago from his country home in Indiana, and found it hard to make both ends meet on a salary of nine dollars a week. His habits were good, his manner was attractive and won him popularity with customer's, and with patience he was likely to succeed in the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I wish I could live like this every day,” he said, as he rose from a luxurious supper. “At present my finances won't allow me to board at the Sherman.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Nor would mine,” said Carl; “but I am allowed to spend money more freely when I am traveling.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you acquainted in New York?” asked Gray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have little or no acquaintance in the city,” answered Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should be glad to get a position there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you not satisfied with your present place?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am afraid I shall not long keep it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why not? Do you think you are in any danger of being discharged?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is not that. I am afraid Mr. French will be obliged to give up business.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why?” asked Carl, with keen interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have reason to think he is embarrassed. I know that he has a good many bills out, some of which have been running a long time. If any pressure is brought to bear upon him, he may have to suspend.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl felt that he was obtaining important information. If Mr. French were in such a condition Miss Norris would be pretty sure to lose her money if she advanced it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“To what do you attribute Mr. French's embarrassment?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He lives expensively in a handsome house near Lincoln Park, and draws heavily upon the business for his living expenses. I think that explains it. I only wonder that he has been able to hold out so long.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps if he were assisted he would be able to keep his head above water.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He would need a good deal of assistance. You see that my place isn't very secure, and I shall soon need to be looking up another.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't think I shall need to inquire any farther,” thought Carl. “It seems to me Miss Norris had better keep her money.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before he retired he indited the following letter to his Albany employer: MISS RACHEL NORRIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“DEAR MADAM: — I have attended to your commission, and have to report that Mr. French appears to be involved in business embarrassments, and in great danger to bankruptcy. The loan he asks of you would no doubt be of service, but probably would not long delay the crash. If you wish to assist him, it would be better to allow him to fail, and then advance him the money to put him on his feet. I am told that his troubles come from living beyond his means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yours respectfully,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"CARL CRAWFORD.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By return mail Carl received the following note:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND: — Your report confirms the confidence I reposed in you. It is just the information I desired. I shall take your advice and refuse the loan. What other action I may take hereafter I cannot tell. When you return, should you stop in Albany, please call on me. If unable to do this, write me from Milford. Your friend,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"RACH EL NORRIS.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl was detained for several days in Chicago. He chanced to meet his English friend, Lord Bedford, upon his arrival, and the nobleman, on learning where he was staying, also registered at the Sherman House. In his company Carl took a drive over the magnificent boulevard which is the pride of Chicago, and rose several degrees in the opinion of those guests who noticed his intimacy with the English guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl had just completed his Chicago business when, on entering the hotel, he was surprised to see a neighbor of his father's — Cyrus Robinson — a prominent business man of Edgewood Center. Carl was delighted, for he had not been home, or seen any home friends for over a year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am glad to see you, Mr. Robinson,” he said, offering his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What! Carl Crawford!” exclaimed Robinson, in amazement. “How came you in Chicago? Your father did not tell me you were here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He does not know it. I am only here on a business visit. Tell me, Mr. Robinson, how is my father?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think, Carl, that he is not at all well. I am quite sure he misses you, and I don't believe your stepmother's influence over him is beneficial. Just before I came away I heard a rumor that troubled me. It is believed in Edgewood that she is trying to induce your father to make a will leaving all, or nearly all his property to her and her son.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't care so much for that, Mr. Robinson, as for my father's health.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl,” said Robinson, significantly, “if such a will is made I don't believe your father will live long after it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You don't mean that?” said Carl, horror-struck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think Mrs. Crawford, by artful means will worry your father to death. He is of a nervous temperament, and an unscrupulous woman can shorten his life without laying herself open to the law.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl's face grew stern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will save my father,” he said, “and defeat my stepmother's wicked schemes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I pray Heaven you can. There is no time to be lost.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I shall lose no time, you may be sure. I shall be at Edgewood within a week.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVI. MAKING A WILL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN Edgewood Center events moved slowly. In Carl Crawford's home dullness reigned supreme. He had been the life of the house, and his absence, though welcome to his stepmother, was seriously felt by his father, who day by day became thinner and weaker, while his step grew listless and his face seldom brightened with a smile. He was anxious to have Carl at home again, and the desire became so strong that he finally broached the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear,” he said one day at the breakfast table, “I have been thinking of Carl considerably of late.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed!” said Mrs. Crawford, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think I should like to have him at home once more.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford smiled ominously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is better off where he is,” she said, softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But he is my only son, and I never see him,” pleaded her husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You know very well, Dr. Crawford,” rejoined his wife, “that your son only made trouble in the house while he was here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yet it seems hard that he should be driven from his father's home, and forced to take refuge among strangers.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know what you mean by his being driven from home,” said Mrs. Crawford, tossing her head. “He made himself disagreeable, and, not being able to have his own way, he took French leave.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“The house seems very lonely without him,” went on Dr. Crawford, who was too wise to get into an argument with his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It certainly is more quiet. As for company, Peter is still here, and would at any time stay with you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter did not relish this suggestion, and did not indorse it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should not care to confine him to the house,” said Dr. Crawford, as his glance rested on the plain and by no means agreeable face of his stepson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose I need not speak of myself. You know that you can always call upon me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If Dr. Crawford had been warmly attached to his second wife, this proposal would have cheered him, but the time had gone by when he found any pleasure in her society. There was a feeling of almost repulsion which he tried to conceal, and he was obliged to acknowledge to himself that the presence of his wife gave him rather uneasiness than comfort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl is very well off where he is,” resumed Mrs. Crawford. “He is filling a business position, humble, perhaps, but still one that gives him his living and keeps him out of mischief. Let well enough alone, doctor, and don't interrupt his plans.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I may be foolish,” said the doctor, hesitating, “but I have not been feeling as well as usual lately, and if anything should happen to me while Carl was absent I should die very unhappy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford regarded her husband with uneasiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you mean that you think you are in any danger?” she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't know. I am not an old man, but, on the other hand, I am an invalid. My father died when he was only a year older than I am at present.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford drew out her handkerchief, and proceeded to wipe her tearless eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You distress me beyond measure by your words, my dear husband. How can I think of your death without emotion? What should I do without you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear, you must expect to survive me. You are younger than I, and much stronger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Besides,” and Mrs. Crawford made an artful pause, “I hardly like to mention it, but Peter and I are poor, and by your death might be left to the cold mercies of the world.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Surely I would not fail to provide for you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sure of your kind intentions, my husband,” she said, “but they will not avail unless you provide for me in your will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, it's only right that I should do so. As soon as I feel equal to the effort I will draw up a will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I hope you will, for I should not care to be dependent on Carl, who does not like me. I hope you will not think me mercenary, but to Peter and myself this is of vital importance.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No, I don't misjudge you. I ought to have thought of it before.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't care so much about myself,” said Mrs. Crawford, in a tone of self-sacrifice, “but I should not like to have Peter thrown upon the world without means.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“All that you say is wise and reasonable,” answered her husband, wearily. “I will attend to the matter to-morrow.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day Mrs. Crawford came into her husband's presence with a sheet of legal cap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My dear husband,” she said, in a soft, insinuating tone, “I wished to spare you trouble, and I have accordingly drawn up a will to submit to you, and receive your signature, if you approve it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you learn to write a will?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I used in my days of poverty to copy documents for a lawyer,” she replied. “In this way I became something of a lawyer myself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see. Will you read what you have prepared?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford read the document in her hand. It provided in the proper legal phraseology for an equal division of the testator's estate between the widow and Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I didn't know, of course, what provision you intended to make for me,” she said, meekly. “Perhaps you do not care to leave me half the estate.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that seems only fair. You do not mention Peter. I ought to do something for him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your kindness touches me, my dear husband, but I shall be able to provide for him out of my liberal bequest. I do not wish to rob your son, Carl. I admit that I do not like him, but that shall not hinder me from being just.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford was pleased with this unexpected concession from his wife. He felt that he should be more at ease if Carl's future was assured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Very well, my dear,” he said, cheerfully. “I approve of the will as you have drawn it up, and I will affix my signature at once.” “Then, shall I send for two of the neighbors to witness it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It will be well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two near neighbors were sent for and witnessed Dr. Crawford's signature to the will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a strangely triumphant look in Mrs. Crawford's eyes as she took the document after it had been duly executed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You will let me keep this, doctor?” she asked. “It will be important for your son as well as myself, that it should be in safe hands.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; I shall be glad to have you do so. I rejoice that it is off my mind.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You won't think me mercenary, my dear husband, or indifferent to your life?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; why should I?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Then I am satisfied.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford took the will, and carrying it upstairs, opened her trunk, removed the false bottom, and deposited under it the last will and testament of Dr. Paul Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“At last!” she said to herself. “I am secure, and have compassed what I have labored for so long.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford had not noticed that the will to which he affixed his signature was not the same that had been read to him. Mrs. Crawford had artfully substituted another paper of quite different tenor. By the will actually executed, the entire estate was left to Mrs. Crawford, who was left guardian of her son and Carl, and authorized to make such provision for each as she might deem suitable. This, of course, made Carl entirely dependent on a woman who hated him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, Dr. Paul Crawford,” said Mrs. Crawford to herself, with a cold smile, “you may die as soon as you please. Peter and I are provided for. Your father died when a year older than you are now, you tell me. It is hardly likely that you will live to a greater age than he.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She called the next day on the family physician, and with apparent solicitude asked his opinion of Dr. Crawford's health.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He is all I have,” she said, pathetically, “all except my dear Peter. Tell me what you think of his chances of continued life.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your husband,” replied the physician, “has one weak organ. It is his heart. He may live for fifteen or twenty years, but a sudden excitement might carry him off in a moment. The best thing you can do for him is to keep him tranquil and free from any sudden shock.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford listened attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will do my best,” she said, “since so much depends on it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she returned home it was with a settled purpose in her heart.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVII. PETER LETS OUT A SECRET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“CAN you direct me to the house of Dr. Crawford?” asked a stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The inquiry was addressed to Peter Cook in front of the hotel in Edgewood Center.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir; he is my stepfather!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed! I did not know that my old friend was married again. You say you are his stepson?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, sir.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He has an own son, about your age, I should judge.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That's Carl! he is a little older than me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he at home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No,” answered Peter, pursing up his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is he absent at boarding school?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he's left home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Indeed!” ejaculated the stranger, in surprise. “How is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He was awfully hard to get along with, and didn't treat mother with any respect. He wanted to have his own way, and, of course, ma couldn't stand that.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I see,” returned the stranger, and he eyed Peter curiously. “What did his father say to his leaving home?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, he always does as ma wishes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Was Carl willing to leave home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he said he would rather go than obey ma.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose he receives an allowance from his father?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; he wanted one, but ma put her foot down and said he shouldn't have one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your mother seems to be a woman of considerable firmness.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You bet, she's firm. She don't allow no boy to boss her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Really, this boy is a curiosity,” said Reuben Ashcroft to himself. “He doesn't excel in the amiable and attractive qualities. He has a sort of brutal frankness which can't keep a secret.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How did you and Carl get along together?” he asked, aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We didn't get along at all. He wanted to boss me, and ma and I wouldn't have it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“So the upshot was that he had to leave the house and you remained?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that's the way of it,” said Peter, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And Carl was actually sent out to earn his own living without help of any kind from his father?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is he doing?” asked Ashcroft, in some excitement. “Good heavens! he may have suffered from hunger.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you a friend of his?” asked Peter, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am a friend of anyone who requires a friend.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl is getting along well enough. He is at work in some factory in Milford, and gets a living.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Hasn't he been back since he first left home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How long ago is that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, 'bout a year,” answered Peter, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How is Dr. Crawford? Is he in good health?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He ain't very well. Ma told me the other day she didn't think he would live long. She got him to make a will the other day.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why, this seems to be a conspiracy!” thought Ashcroft. “I'd give something to see that will.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I suppose he will provide for you and your mother handsomely?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; ma said she was to have control of the property. I guess Carl will have to stand round if he expects any favors.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is evident this boy can't keep a secret,” thought Ashcroft. “All the better for me. I hope I am in time to defeat this woman's schemes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There's the house,” said Peter, pointing it out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you think Dr. Crawford is at home?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, yes, he doesn't go out much. Ma is away this afternoon. She's at the sewing circle, I think.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank you for serving as my guide,” said Ashcroft. “There's a little acknowledgment which I hope will be of service to you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He offered a half dollar to Peter, who accepted it joyfully and was profuse in his thanks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, if you will be kind enough to tell the doctor that an old friend wishes to see him, I shall be still further obliged.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Just follow me, then,” said Peter, and he led the way into the sitting-room.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXVIII. DR. CRAWFORD IS TAKEN TO TASK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AFTER the first greetings, Reuben Ashcroft noticed with pain the fragile look of his friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you well?” he asked</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not very strong,” said Dr. Crawford, smiling faintly, “but Mrs. Crawford takes good care of me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And Carl, too — he is no doubt a comfort to you?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford flushed painfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl has been away from home for a year, he said, with an effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is strange your own son, too! Is there anything unpleasant? You may confide in me, as I am the cousin of Carl's mother. '</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The fact is, Carl and Mrs. Crawford didn't hit it off very well.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And you took sides against your own son, said Ashcroft, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I begin to think I was wrong, Reuben. You don't know how I have missed the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yet you sent him out into the world without a penny.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you know that?” asked Dr. Crawford quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had a little conversation with your stepson as I came to the house. He spoke very frankly and unreservedly about family affairs; He says you do whatever his mother tells you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford looked annoyed and blushed with shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he say that?” he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; he said his mother would not allow you to help Carl.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He — misunderstood ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Paul, I fear he understands the case only too well. I don't want to pain you, but your wife is counting on your speedy death.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I told her I didn't think I should live long.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And she got you to make a will?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes; did Peter tell you that?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“He said his mother was to have control of the property, and Carl would get nothing if he didn't act so as to please her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“There is some mistake here. By my will — made yesterday — Carl is to have an equal share, and nothing is said about his being dependent on anyone.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Who drew up the will?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did you read it?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ashcroft looked puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I should like to read the will myself,” he said, after a pause. “Where is it now?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford has charge of it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reuben Ashcroft remained silent, but his mind was busy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That woman is a genuis of craft,” he said to himself. “My poor friend is but a child in her hands. I did not know Paul would be so pitiably weak.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How do you happen to be here in Edgewood, Reuben?” asked the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I had a little errand in the next town, and could not resist the temptation of visiting you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You can stay a day or two, can you not?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will, though I had not expected to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford is away this afternoon. She will be back presently, and then I will introduce you.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At five o'clock Mrs. Crawford returned, and her husband introduced her to his friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ashcroft fixed his eyes upon her searchingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Her face looks strangely familiar,” he said to himself. “Where can I have seen her?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford, like all persons who have a secret to conceal, was distrustful of strangers. She took an instant dislike to Reuben Ashcroft, and her greeting was exceedingly cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I have invited Mr. Ashcroft to make me a visit of two or three days, my dear,” said her husband. “He is a cousin to Carl's mother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford made no response, but kept her eyes fixed upon the carpet. She could not have shown more plainly that the invitation was not approved by her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Madam does not want me here,” thought Ashcroft, as he fixed his gaze once more upon his friend's wife. Again the face looked familiar, but he could not place it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have I not seen you before, Mrs. Crawford?” he asked, abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't remember you,” she answered, slowly. “Probably I resemble some one you have met.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Perhaps so,” answered Ashcroft, but he could not get rid of the conviction that somewhere and some time in the past he had met Mrs. Crawford, and under circumstances that had fixed her countenance in his memory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After supper Dr. Crawford said: “My dear, I have told our guest that I had, as a prudential measure, made my will. I wish you would get it, and let me read it to him.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford looked startled and annoyed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Couldn't you tell him the provisions of it?” she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, but I should like to show him the document.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned and went upstairs. She was absent at least ten minutes. When she returned she was empty-handed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am sorry to say,” she remarked, with a forced laugh, “that I have laid away the will so carefully that I can't find it.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ashcroft fixed a searching look upon her, that evidently annoyed her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I may be able to find it to-morrow,” she resumed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think you told me, Paul,” said Ashcroft, turning to Dr. Crawford, “that by the will your estate is divided equally between Carl and Mrs. Crawford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And nothing is said of any guardianship on the part of Mrs. Crawford?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; I think it would be better, Ashcroft, that you should be Carl's guardian. A man can study his interests and control him better.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will accept the trust,” said Ashcroft, “though I hope it may be many years before the necessity arises.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford bit her lips, and darted an angry glance at the two friends. She foresaw that her plans were threatened with failure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two men chatted throughout the evening, and Dr. Crawford had never of late seemed happier. It gave him new life and raised his spirits to chat over old times with his early friend.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXIX. A MAN OF ENERGY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE next morning Ashcroft said to his host: “Paul, let us take a walk to the village.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford put on his hat, and went out with his friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Now, Paul,” said Ashcroft, when they were some rods distant from the house, “is there a lawyer in Edgewood?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, and a good one.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did he indite your will?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No; Mrs. Crawford wrote it out. She was at one time copyist for a lawyer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Take my advice and have another drawn up to-day without mentioning the matter to her. She admits having mislaid the one made yesterday.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It may be a good idea.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly, it is a prudent precaution. Then you will be sure that all is safe. I have, myself, executed a duplicate will. One I keep, the other I have deposited with my lawyer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ashcroft was a man of energy. He saw that Dr. Crawford, who was of a weak, vacillating temper, executed the will. He and another witnessed it, and the document was left with the lawyer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You think I had better not mention the matter to Mrs. Crawford?” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By no means — she might think it was a reflection upon her for carelessly mislaying the first.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“True,” and the doctor, who was fond of peace, consented to his friend's plan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“By the way,” asked Ashcroft, “who was your wife what was her name, I mean — before her second marriage?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“She was a Mrs. Cook.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, I see,” said Ashcroft, and his face lighted up with surprise and intelligence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you see?” inquired Dr. Crawford. “I thought your wife's face was familiar. I met her once when she was Mrs. Cook.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You knew her, then?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“:No, I never exchanged a word with her till I met her under this roof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“How can I tell him that I first saw her when a visitor to the penitentiary among the female prisoners?” Ashcroft asked himself. “My poor friend would sink with mortification.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were sitting in friendly chat after their return from their walk, when Mrs. Crawford burst into the room in evident excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Husband,” she cried, “Peter has brought home a terrible report. He has heard from a person who has just come from Milford that Carl has been run over on the railroad and instantly killed!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Crawford turned pale, his features worked convulsively, and he put his hand to his heart, as he sank back in his chair, his face as pale as the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Woman!” said Ashcroft, sternly, “I believe you have killed your husband!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Oh, don't say that! How could I be so imprudent?” said Mrs. Crawford, clasping her hands, and counterfeiting distress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ashcroft set himself at once to save his friend from the result of the shock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leave the room!” he said, sternly, to Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why should I? I am his wife.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“And have sought to be his murderer. You know that he has heart disease. Mrs. — Cook, I know more about you than you suppose.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford's color receded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I don't understand you,” she said. She had scarcely reached the door, when there was a sound of footsteps outside and Carl dashed into the room, nearly upsetting his stepmother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You here?” she said, frigidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is the matter with my father?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you Carl?” said Ashcroft, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your father has had a shock. I think I can soon bring him to.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A few minutes later Dr. Crawford opened his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you feeling better, Paul?” asked Ashcroft, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Didn't I hear something about Carl — something terrible?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Carl is alive and well,” said he, soothingly;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Are you sure of that?” asked Dr. Crawford, in excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, I have the best evidence of it. Here is Carl himself.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl came forward and was clasped in his father's arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Thank Heaven, you are alive,” he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Why should I not be?” asked Carl, bewildered, turning to Ashcroft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Your stepmother had the — let me say imprudence, to tell your father that you had been killed on the railroad.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where could she have heard such a report?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I am not sure that she heard it at all,” said Ashcroft, in a low voice. “She knew that your father had heart disease.”</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XL. CONCLUSION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT this moment Mrs. Crawford re-entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What brings you here?” she demanded, coolly, of Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I came here because this is my father's house, madam.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have behaved badly to me,” said Mrs. Crawford. “You have defied my authority, and brought sorrow and distress to your good father. I thought you would have the good sense to stay away.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you indorse this, father?” asked Carl, turning to Dr. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No!” answered his father, with unwonted energy. “My house will always be your home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You seem to have changed your mind, Dr. Crawford,” sneered his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Where did you pick up the report of Carl's being killed on the railroad?” asked the doctor, sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Peter heard it in the village,” said Mrs. Crawford, carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Did it occur to you that the sudden news might injure your husband?” asked Ashcroft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I spoke too impulsively. I realize too late my imprudence,” said Mrs. Crawford, coolly. “Have you lost your place?” she asked, addressing Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“No. I have just returned from Chicago.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His stepmother looked surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“We have had a quiet time since you left us,” she said. “If you value your father's health and peace of mind, you will not remain here.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Is my presence also unwelcome?” asked Ashcroft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“You have not treated me with respect,” replied Mrs. Crawford. “If you are a gentleman, you will understand that under the circumstances it will be wise for you to take your, departure.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Leaving my old friend to your care?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Yes, that will be best.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Ashcroft, can I have a few minutes' conversation with you?” asked Carl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Certainly.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They left the room together, followed by an uneasy and suspicious glance from Mrs. Crawford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl hurriedly communicated to his father's friend what he had learned about his stepmother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mr. Cook, Peter's father, is just outside,” he said. “Shall I call him in?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I think we had better do so, but arrange that the interview shall take place without your father's knowledge. He must not be excited. Call him in, and then summon your stepmother.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford,” said Carl, re-entering his father's room, “Mr. Ashcroft would like to have a few words with you. Can you come out?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She followed Carl uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What is it you want with me, sir?” she asked, frigidly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Let me introduce an old acquaintance of yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Cook, whom Mrs. Crawford had not at first observed, came forward. She drew back in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is some time since we met, Lucy,” said Cook, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Do you come here to make trouble?” she muttered, hoarsely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I come to ask for the property you took during my absence in California,” he said. “I don't care to have you return to me — — ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I obtained a divorce.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Precisely; I don't care to annul it. I am thankful that you are no longer my wife.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I — I will see what I can do for you. Don't go near my present husband. He is in poor health, and cannot bear a shock.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mrs. Crawford,” said Ashcroft, gravely, “if you have any idea of remaining here, in this house, give it up. I shall see that your husband's eyes are opened to your real character.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Sir, you heard this man say that he has no claim upon me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“That may be, but I cannot permit my friend to harbor a woman whose record is as bad as yours.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“What do you mean?” she demanded, defiantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I mean that you have served a term in prison for larceny.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is false,” she said, with trembling lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“It is true. I visited the prison during your term of confinement, and saw you there.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I, too, can certify to it,” said Cook. “I learned it two years after my marriage. You will understand why I am glad of the divorce.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Crawford was silent for a moment. She realized that the battle was lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Well,” she said, after a pause, “I am defeated. I thought my secret was safe, but I was mistaken. What do you propose to do with me?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I will tell you this evening,” said Ashcroft. “One thing I can say now — you must not expect to remain in this house.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“I no longer care to do so.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A conference was held during the afternoon, Dr Crawford being told as much as was essential. It was arranged that Mrs. Crawford should have an allowance of four hundred dollars for herself and Peter if she would leave the house quietly, and never again annoy her husband. Mr. Cook offered to take Peter, but the latter preferred to remain with his mother. A private arrangement was made by which Dr. Crawford made up to Mr. Cook one-half of the sum stolen from him by his wife, and through the influence of Ashcroft, employment was found for him. He is no longer a tramp, but a man held in respect, and moderately prosperous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carl is still in the employ of Mr. Jennings, and his father has removed to Milford, where he and his son can live together. Next September, on his twenty-first birthday, Carl will be admitted to a junior partnership in the business, his father furnishing the necessary capital. Carl's stepmother is in Chicago, and her allowance is paid to her quarterly through a Chicago bank. She has considerable trouble with Peter, who has become less submissive as he grows older, and is unwilling to settle down to steady work. His prospects do not look very bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jennings and Hannah are as much attached as ever to Carl, and it is quite likely the manufacturer will make him his heir. Happy in the society of his son, Dr. Crawford is likely to live to a good old age, in spite of his weakness and tendency to heart disease, for happiness is a great aid to longevity.</field>
