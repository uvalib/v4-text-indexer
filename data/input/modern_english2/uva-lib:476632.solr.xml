      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I. THE FARMER'S HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit up to the table, children; breakfast's ready.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The speaker was a woman of middle age, not good looking, but nevertheless she looked good. She was dressed with extreme plainness, in a cheap calico; but though cheap, the dress was neat. The children she addressed were six in number, varying in age from fourteen to four. The oldest, Harry, the hero of the present story, was a broad-shouldered, sturdy boy, with a frank, open face, resolute, though good-natured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Father isn't here,'' said Fanny, the second child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll be in directly. He went to the store, and he may stop as he comes back to milk.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The table was set in the center of the room, covered with a coarse tablecloth. The breakfast provided was hardly of a kind to tempt an epicure. There was a loaf of bread cut into slices, and a dish of boiled potatoes. There was no butter and no meat, for the family were very poor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The children sat up to the table and began to eat. They were blessed with good appetites, and did not grumble at the scanty fare. They had not been accustomed to anything better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had scarcely commenced the meal when the father entered. Like his wife he was coarsely dressed. His wife looking up perceived that he looked troubled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the matter, Hiram?'' she asked. "You look as if something had happened.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing has happened yet,'' he answered; "but I am afraid we are going to lose the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to lose the cow!'' repeated Mrs. Walton, in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is sick. I don't know what's the matter with her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it is only a trifle. She may get over it during the day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She may, but I'm afraid she won't.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you going to do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been to Elihu Perkins, and he's coming over to see what he can do for her. He can save her if anybody can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The children listened, and, young as they were, the elder ones understood the calamity involved in the possible loss of the cow. They had but one, and that was relied upon to furnish milk for the family, and, besides, a small amount of butter and cheese, not for home consumption, but for sale at the store in exchange for necessary groceries. The Waltons were too poor to indulge in these luxuries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After breakfast Elihu Perkins, the "cow doctor,'' came. He was an old man with iron-gray hair, and always wore steel bowed spectacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, neighbor Walton, so the cow's sick?'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Elihu, she looks down in the mouth. I hope you can save her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I kin tell better when I've seen the critter. When you've got through breakfast, we'll go out to the barn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got through now,'' said Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"May I go, too, father?'' asked Harry, rising from the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, if you want to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three went out to the small, weather-beaten building which served as a barn. It was small, but still large enough to contain all the crops which Mr. Walton could raise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They opened the small barn door, which led to the part occupied by the cow's stall. The cow was lying down, breathing with difficulty. Elihu Perkins looked at her sharply through his "specs.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think of her, neighbor Perkins?'' asked the owner, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think the critter's nigh her end,'' he said, at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She looks like Farmer Henderson's that died a while ago: I couldn't save her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Save my cow if you can. I don't know what I should do without her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll do my best, but you mustn't blame me if I can't bring her round.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know you can save her if anyone can, Elihu,'' said Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I guess I know about as much about them critters as anybody,'' said the old man. "Have you got any hot water in the house?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go in and see.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go, father,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, come right back. We have no time to lose.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry reappeared with a pail of hot water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's right, Harry,'' said his father. "Now you'd better go into the house and do your chores, so as not to be late for school.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry would have liked to remain and watch the steps which were being taken for the recovery of the cow; but he knew he had barely time to do the "chores'' referred to before school, and he was far from wishing to be late there. He had an ardent thirst for learning, and, young as he was, ranked first in the district school which he attended. Since he was nine years of age, his schooling had been for the most part limited to eleven weeks in the year. So it happened that Harry, though a tolerably good scholar, was deficient in many respects, on account of the limited nature of his opportunities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He set to work at once at the chores. First he went to the woodpile and sawed and split a quantity of wood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After sawing and splitting what he thought to be sufficient, he carried it into the house by armfuls, and piled it up near the kitchen stove. He next drew several buckets of water from the well, for it was washing day, brought up some vegetables from the cellar to boil for dinner, and then got ready for school.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. A CALAMITY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The critter's gone,'' Elihu Perkins said. " 'Tain't no use doin' anything more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The cow's dead!'' repeated Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, the critter's dead!'' said Elihu. "It was so to be, and there wa'n't no help for it. That's what I thought from the fust, but I was willin' to try.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wasn't there anything that could have saved her?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If she could a-been saved, I could 'ave done it,'' he said. "What I don't know about cow diseases ain't wuth knowin'.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I s'pose you're right, Elihu,'' he said; "but it's hard on me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, neighbor, it's hard on you, that's a fact.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What was she wuth?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't have taken forty dollars for her yesterday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forty dollars is a good sum.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is to me. I haven't got five dollars in the world outside of my farm. Somehow it don't seem fair that my only cow should be taken, when Squire Green has got ten, and they're all alive and well. If all his cows should die, he could buy as many more and not feel the loss.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Squire Green's a close man. He could give you a cow just as well as not. If I was as rich as he, I'd do it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe you would, Elihu; but there's some difference between you and him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe the squire would lend you money to buy a cow. He always keeps money to lend on high interest.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Walton said: "I must have a cow, and I don't know of any other way, but I hate to go to him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's the only man that's likely to have money to lend in town.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll go.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good luck to you, neighbor Walton. Well, I'll be goin', as I can't do no more good.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hiram Walton went into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is she dead, Hiram?'' asked his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, the cow's dead. Forty dollars clean gone,'' he said, rather bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be discouraged, Hiram. It's bad luck, but worse things might happen. The house might burn down, or—or some of us might fall sick and die. It's better that it should be the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're right there; but though it's pleasant to have so many children round, we shan't like to see them starving.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are not starving yet, and, please God, they won't yet a while. Some help will come to us. Where are you going, Hiram?'' she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to see if Squire Green will lend me money enough to buy another cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Squire Green was the rich man of the town. He had inherited from his father, just as he came of age, a farm of a hundred and fifty acres, and a few hundred dollars. The land was not good, and far from productive; but he had scrimped and saved, spending almost nothing, till the little money which the farm annually yielded him had accumulated to a considerable sum. Then, too, the squire used to lend money to his poorer neighbors. He took care not to exact more than six per cent openly, but it was generally understood that the borrower must pay a bonus besides to secure the loan, which, added to the legal interest, gave him a very handsome consideration for the use of his spare funds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The squire had one son, now in the neighborhood of thirty, but he had not been at home for several years. As soon as he attained his majority he left the homestead, and set out to seek his fortune elsewhere. So the old man was left alone, but he did not feel the solitude. He had his gold, and that was company enough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is the squire at home?'' Hiram asked, at the back door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's out to the barn,'' said Hannah Green, a niece of the old man, who acted as maid of all work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go out there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Entering, he found the old man engaged in some light work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Squire Green.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Mr. Walton,'' returned the squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you gettin' on?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've met with a loss,'' answered Hiram Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say so,'' returned the squire, with instant attention. "What's happened?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My cow is dead.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope it isn't any disease that's catchin','' said the squire in alarm, thinking of his ten. "It would be a bad job if it should get among mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a bad job for me, squire. I hadn't but one cow, and she's gone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just so, just so. I s'pose you'll buy another.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I must have a cow. My children live on bread and milk mostly. Then there's the butter and cheese, that I trade off at the store for groceries.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just so, just so. Come into the house, neighbor Walton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The squire guessed his visitor's business in advance, and wanted to take time to talk it over. He would first find out how great his neighbor's necessity was, and then, if he accommodated him, would charge him accordingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a little room just off the kitchen, where the squire had an old-fashioned desk. Here it was that he transacted his business, and in the desk he kept his papers. It was into this room he ushered Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The squire always felt at home in this office, for it was where he derived most of his pleasure, either by putting through a shrewd deal with one of his neighbors, by gloating over his distorted ideas of success, or by going over his notes and mortgages to determine how soon he would reach another goal in his race for riches.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While the squire usually felt at ease, his victim would be very much perturbed, for he generally knew the reputation of the old man, and expected no mercy from him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But to return to the deal which now occupied the mind of the squire.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III. HIRAM'S MOTTO.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Set down, set down, neighbor Walton,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll talk this thing over. So you've got to have a cow?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I must have one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Goin' to buy one in town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know of any that's for sale.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you calc-late to pay?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I'll have to pay thirty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"More'n that, neighbor Walton. You can't get a decent cow for thirty dollars. I hain't got one that isn't wuth more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty dollars is all I can afford to pay, squire.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take my advice, and get a good cow while you're about it. It don't pay to get a poor one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm a poor man, squire. I must take what I can get.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't sure but I've got a cow that will suit you, a red with white spots. She's a fust-rate milker.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old is she?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's turned of five.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you ask for her?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to pay cash down?'' asked the squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't do that. I'm very short of money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I,'' chimed in the squire. "Money's tight, neighbor.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Money's always tight with me, squire,'' returned Hiram Walton, with a sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was you a-meanin' to pay anything down?'' inquired the squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That alters the case, you know. I might as well keep the cow as to sell her without the money down.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am willing to pay interest on the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, that's fair. Wall, neighbor, what do you say to goin' out to see the cow?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go along with you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the critter,'' he said, pointing out one of the cows who was grazing nearby. "Ain't she a beauty?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She looks pretty well,'' said Mr. Walton. "What do you ask for her, squire?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's wuth all of forty dollars,'' answered the squire, who knew perfectly well that a fair price would be about thirty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That seems high,'' said Hiram.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's wuth every cent of it; but I ain't nowise partic'lar about sellin' her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Couldn't you say thirty-seven?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I'd take thirty-eight cash down.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hiram Walton shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no cash,'' he said. "I must buy on credit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wall, then, there's a bargain for you. I'll let you have her for forty dollars, giving you six months to pay it, at reg'lar interest, six per cent. Of course, I expect a little bonus for the accommodation. All I want is a fair price for my time and trouble. We'll say three dollars extra for the accommodation —three dollars down.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hiram Walton felt that it was a hard bargain the squire was driving with him, but there seemed no help for it. There was no one else to whom he could look for help on any terms. As to the three dollars, his whole available cash amounted to but four dollars. But the sacrifice must be made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Squire Green, if that is your lowest price, I suppose I must come to it,'' he answered, at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If so be as you've made up your mind, we'll make out the papers. When do you want to take the cow?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll drive her along now, if you are willing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you see,'' said the squire, "she's been feedin' in my pastur' all mornin', and I calc'late I'm entitled to the next milkin'. You'd better come around to-night just after milkin', and then you can take her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just as you say,'' he answered. "I'll come round to-night, or send Harry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old is Harry, now?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About fourteen.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does he go to school?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he's been going to school all the term.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's old enough to give up larnin' altogether. Don't he know how to read and write and cipher?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he's about the best scholar in school.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then, neighbor Walton, take my advice and don't send him any more. You need him at home, and he knows enough to get along in the world.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want him to learn as much as he can. I'd like to send him to school till he is sixteen.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's had as much schoolin' now as ever I had,'' said the squire, "and I've got along pooty well. I've been seleckman, and school committy, and filled about every town office, and I never wanted no more schoolin'. My father took me away from school when I was thirteen.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry's time is too valuable to spend in the school-room,'' said the squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't agree with you, squire. I think no time is better spent than the time that's spent in learning. I wish I could afford to send my boy to college.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would cost a mint of money, and wouldn't pay. Better put him to some good business.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That was the way he treated his own son, and for this and other reasons, as soon as he arrived at man's estate, he left home, which had never had any pleasant associations with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No wonder he's a poor man,'' thought the squire, after his visitor returned home. "He ain't got no practical idees. Live and learn! that's all nonsense. His boy looks strong and able to work, and it's foolish sendin' him to school any longer. That wa'n't my way, and see where I am,'' he concluded, with complacent remembrance of his bonds and mortgages and money out at interest. "That was a pooty good cow trade,'' he concluded. "I didn't calc'late for to get more'n thirty-five dollars for the critter; but then neighbor Walton had to have a cow, and had to pay my price.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now for Hiram Walton's reflections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm a poor man, but I wouldn't be as mean as Tom Green for all the money he's worth. He's made a hard bargain with me, but there was no help for it.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV. THE PRIZE WINNER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to the examination to-day, mother?'' asked Harry, at breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to go,'' said Mrs. Walton, "but I don't see how I can. To-day's my bakin' day.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think Harry'll get the prize,'' said Tom, a boy of ten. He also attended the school, but was not as promising as his oldest brother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What prize?'' asked Mrs. Walton, looking up with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The master offered a prize to the scholar that was most faithful to his studies.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is the prize?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A book.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When will it be given?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Toward the close of the afternoon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I can get time to come in then; I'll try.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would come, mother,'' said Harry, earnestly. "Only don't be disappointed if I don't get it. I've been trying, but there are some other good scholars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're the best, Harry,'' said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know about that. I shan't count my chickens before they are hatched. Only if I am to get the prize I should like to have mother there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know you're a good scholar, and have improved your time,'' said Mrs. Walton. "I wish your father was rich enough to send you to college.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like that very much,'' said Harry, his eyes sparkling at merely the suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then Mr. Walton came in from the barn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you like the new cow, father?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She isn't equal to our old one. She doesn't give as much milk within two quarts, if this morning's milking is a fair sample.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You paid enough for her,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I paid too much for her,'' answered her husband, "but it was the best I could do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forty-three dollars is a great deal of money to pay for a cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not for some cows. Some are worth more; but this one isn't.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think she is really worth?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty-three dollars is the most I would give if I had the cash to pay.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it's mean in Squire Green to take such advantage of you,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mustn't say so, Harry, for it won't do for me to get the squire's ill will. I am owing him money. I've agreed to pay for the cow in six months.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you do it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how; but the money's on interest, and maybe the squire'll let it stay. I forgot to say, though, that last evening when I went to get the cow he made me agree to forfeit ten dollars if I was not ready with the money and interest in six months.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will be better for you to pay and have done with it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course. I shall try to do that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meantime Harry was busy thinking. "Wouldn't it be possible for me to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months? I wish I could do it and relieve father.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry knew that if he should hire out to a farmer for six months the utmost he could expect would be a dollar a week, and it was not certain he could earn that. Besides, he would probably be worth as much to his father as any one, and his labor in neither case provided money enough to pay for the cow. Obviously that would not answer. He must think of some other way, but at present none seemed open. He sensibly deferred thinking till after the examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to the school examination, father?'' asked our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't spare time, Harry. I should like to go, for I want to know how far you have progressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Live and learn,' my boy. That's a good motto, though Squire Green thinks that `Live and earn' is better. "No,'' said Mr. Walton; "I am afraid I can't spare time to come to the examination. Are you going, mother?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall try to go in the last of the afternoon,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you will come, mother,'' said Harry, "we'll all help you afterward, so you won't lose anything by it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I will contrive to come.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The examination took place in the afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon there was quite a fair attendance of parents and friends of the scholars, though some did not come in till late, like Mrs. Walton. Harry eclipsed himself. His ambition had been stirred by the offer of a prize, and he was resolved to deserve it. His recitations were prompt and correct, and his answers were given with confidence. He had selected an extract from Webster—the reply to Hayne— and this was the showpiece of the afternoon. The rest of the declamation was crude enough, but Harry's impressed even the most ignorant of his listeners as superior for a boy of his age. When he uttered his last sentence and made a parting bow there was subdued applause, and it brought a flush of gratification to the cheek of our young hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is the last exercise,'' said the teacher, "except one. At the commencement of the term I offered a prize to the scholar that would do the best from that time till the close of the school. I will now award the prize. Harry Walton, come forward.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry rose from his seat and advanced to where the teacher was standing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry,'' said Mr. Burbank, "I have no hesitation in giving you the prize. You have excelled all the other scholars, and it is fairly yours. The book is not of much value, but I think you will find it interesting and instructive. It is the life of the great American philosopher and statesman, Benjamin Franklin. I hope you will read and profit by it, and try, like him, to make your life a credit to yourself and a blessing to mankind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir,'' said Harry, bowing low. "I will try to do so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry received the congratulations of his classmates and others with modest satisfaction, but he was most pleased by the evident pride and pleasure which his mother exhibited, when she, too, was congratulated on his success. His worldly prospects were very uncertain, but he had achieved the success for which he had been laboring, and he was happy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V. LOOKING OUT ON THE WORLD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not until evening that Harry had a chance to look at his prize. It was a cheap book, costing probably not over a dollar; but except his school-books, and a ragged copy of "Robinson Crusoe,'' it was the only book that our hero possessed. So our young hero looked forward with great joy to the pleasure of reading his new book. He did not know much about Benjamin Franklin, but had a vague idea that he was a great man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After his evening "chores'' were done, he sat down by the table on which was burning a solitary tallow candle, and began to read. His mother was darning stockings, and his father had gone to the village store on an errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So he began the story, and the more he read the more interesting he found it. Great as he afterward became, he was surprised to find that Franklin was a poor boy, and had to work for a living. He started out in life on his own account, and through industry, frugality, perseverance and a fixed determination to rise in life, he became a distinguished man in the end, and a wise man also, though his early opportunities were very limited. It seemed to Harry that there was a great similarity between his own circumstances and position in life and those of the great man about whom he was reading, and this made the biography the more fascinating. The hope came to him that, by following Franklin's example, he, too, might become a successful man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His mother, looking up at intervals from her work, noticed how absorbed he was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is your book interesting, Harry?'' she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the most interesting book I ever read,'' said Harry, with a sigh of intense enjoyment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's about Benjamin Franklin, isn't it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Do you know, mother, he was a poor boy, and he worked his way up?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I have heard so, but I never read his life.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better read this when I have finished it. I've been thinking that there's a chance for me, mother.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A chance to do what?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A chance to be somebody when I get bigger. I'm poor now, but so was Franklin. He worked hard, and tried to learn all he could. That's the way he succeeded. I'm going to do the same.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can't all be Franklins, my son,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that, mother, and I don't expect to be a great man like him. But if I try hard I think I can rise in the world, and be worth a little money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you won't be as poor as your father, Harry,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not,'' said Harry. "If I ever get rich, you shan't have to work any more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sure you won't let your father and mother want, if you have the means to prevent it,'' she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I read in the country paper the other day that many of the richest men in Boston and New York were once poor boys,'' said Harry, in a hopeful tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I have heard,'' said his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If they succeeded, I don't see why I can't.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must try to be something more than a rich man. I shouldn't want you to be like Squire Green.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is rich, but he is mean and ignorant. I don't think I shall be like him. He has cheated father about the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he drove a sharp trade with him, taking advantage of his necessities. I am afraid your father won't be able to pay for the cow six months from now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid so, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how he can possibly save up forty dollars. We are as economical now as we can be.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I have been thinking of, mother. There is no chance of father paying the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it won't be paid, and we shall be worse off when the note comes due than now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think,'' said Harry, laying down the book on the table, and looking up earnestly, "do you think, mother, I could in any way earn the forty dollars before it is to be paid?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what you can do, except to hire out to a farmer, and they pay very little.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wasn't thinking of that,'' said Harry. "There isn't much chance there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know of any work to do here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor I, mother. But I wasn't thinking of staying in town.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not thinking of staying in town!'' repeated Mrs. Walton, in surprise. "You don't want to leave home, do you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, mother, I don't want to leave home, or I wouldn't want to, if there was anything to do here. But you know there isn't. Farm work won't help me along, and I don't like it as well as some other kinds of work. I must leave home if I want to rise in the world.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you are too young, Harry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going on fifteen, and I don't call that very young. And I am strong for my age, too, mother. I am sure I am old enough to take care of myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you are young to go out into the world.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe Franklin was much older than I, and he got along.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you are sick, Harry?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I am I'll come home. But you know I am very healthy, mother, and if I am away from home I shall be very careful.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you would not be sure of getting anything to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll risk that, mother,'' said Harry, in a confident tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you think of this before you read that book?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes I've been thinking of it for about a month; but the book put it into my head to-night. I seem to see my way clearer than I did. I want, most of all, to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months. You know yourself, mother, there isn't any chance of father doing it himself, and I can't earn anything if I stay at home.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you mentioned the matter to your father yet, Harry?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I haven't. I wish you would speak about it to-night, mother. You can tell him first what makes me want to go. Just mention it, mother, and then I'll talk with him about it to-morrow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To this Mrs. Walton agreed, and Harry, after reading a few pages more in the "Life of Franklin,'' went up to bed; but it was some time before he slept.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI. IN FRANKLIN'S FOOTSTEPS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Father,'' said Harry, the next morning, as Mr. Walton was about to leave the house, "there's something I want to say to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?'' asked his father, imagining it was some trifle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to go away from home.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Away from home! Where?'' asked Mr. Walton, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know where; but somewhere where I can earn my own living. This isn't a very good farm, and it's all you can do to make a living for the rest of us out of it. If I could go somewhere, where I could work at something else, I could send you home my wages.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid a boy like you couldn't earn very large wages. People don't give much for boys' work.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't expect much; but I know I can get something, and by and by it will lead to more. I want to help you to pay for that cow you've just bought of Squire Green.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how I'm going to pay for it,'' said Mr. Walton, with a sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what I'm saying, father. There isn't much money to be got in farming. That's why I want to try something else.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What put this plan into your head?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That book I got as a prize.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is the life of Franklin, isn't it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he go away from home when he was a boy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and he succeeded, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know he did. He became a famous man. But it isn't every boy that is like Franklin.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that. I never expect to become a great man like him; but I can make something.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's another thing, Harry. It takes money to travel round, and I haven't got any means to give you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want any, father. I mean to work my way. I've got twenty-five cents to start with. Now, father, what do you say?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll speak to your mother about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this Harry was content. He had a good deal of confidence that he could carry his point with both parents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went into the house, and said to his mother:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mother, father's going to speak to you about my going away from home. Now don't you oppose it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't oppose your notion, though I ain't clear about it's being wise.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll talk about that in a few months, mother.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has Harry spoken to you about his plan of going away from home?'' asked the farmer, when he reentered the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps we'd better let the lad have his way. He's promised to come home if he's taken sick.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So let it be, then, Harry. When do you want to go?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As soon as I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to wait till Monday. It'll take a day or two to fix up your clothes,'' said his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, mother.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you think of going, Harry? Have you any idea?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, mother. I'm going to trust to luck. I shan't go very far. When I've got fixed anywhere I'll write and let you know.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the evening Harry resumed the "Life of Franklin,'' and before he was ready to go to bed he had got two thirds through with it. To Harry it was not alone the "Life of Benjamin Franklin.'' It was the chart by which he meant to steer in the unknown career which stretched before him. He knew so little of the world that he trusted implicitly to that as a guide, and he silently stored away the wise precepts in conformity with which the great practical philosopher had shaped and molded his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the family were sitting around the kitchen table there was heard a scraping at the door, and presently a knock. Mr. Walton answered it in person, and admitted Squire Green.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, neighbor?'' he said. "I thought I'd just run in a minute to see you as I was goin' by.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit down, Squire Green. Take the rocking chair.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, neighbor. How's the cow a-doin'?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Middling well. She don't give as much milk as the one I lost.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She'll do better bymeby. She's a good bargain to you, neighbor, and you're lucky to get her so cheap, buyin' on time. What are you doin' there, Harry? School through, ain't it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hear you're a good scholar. Got the prize, didn't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' said Mr. Walton; "Harry was always good at his books.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess he knows enough now. You'd ought to set him to work.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is ready enough to work,'' said Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He never was lazy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's good. I've been a-thinkin', neighbor Walton, that you'll find it hard to pay for that cow in six months.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid I shall,'' said the farmer, thinking in surprise, "Can he be going to reduce the price?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I thought mebbe we might make an arrangement to make it easier.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should be glad to have it made easier, squire. It was hard on me, losing that cow by disease.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course. Well, what I was thinkin' was, you might hire out your boy to work for me. I'd allow him two dollars a month and board, and the wages would help pay for the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry looked up in dismay at this proposition. Were all his bright dreams of future success to terminate in this?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII. HARRY'S DECISION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Walton paused before replying to his pro posal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a little too late,'' he said, at last, to Harry's great relief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Too late,'' repeated the squire, hastily. "Why, you hain't hired out your boy to anybody else, have you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but he has asked me to let him leave home, and I've agreed to it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leave home? Where's he goin'?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has not fully decided. He wants to go out and seek his fortune.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll fetch up at the poorhouse,'' growled the squire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he does not succeed, he will come home again.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a foolish plan, neighbor Walton. Take my word for't. You'd better keep him here, and let him work for me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he stayed at home, I should find work for him on my farm.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wanted to help you pay for that cow,'' said the squire, crossly. "If you can't pay for't when the time comes you mustn't blame me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall blame no one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mustn't ask for more time. Six months is a long time to give.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I haven't said anything about more time yet,'' said Hiram Walton, stiffly. "I don't see that you need warn me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought we might as well have an understanding about it,'' said the squire. "So you won't hire out the boy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I cannot, under the circumstances. If I did I should consider his services worth more than two dollars a month.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might give him two'n a half,'' said the squire, fancying it was merely a question of money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you pay Abner Kimball?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, rather more than that,'' answered the squire, slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You pay him ten dollars a month, don't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, somewheres about that; but it's more'n he earns.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he is worth ten dollars, Harry would be worth four or six.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll give three,'' said the squire, who reflected that even at that rate he would be saving considerable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will leave it to Harry himself,'' said his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry, you hear Squire Green's offer. What do you say? Will you go to work for him at three dollars a month?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd rather go away, as you told me I might, father.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You hear the boy's decision, squire.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, wal,'' said the squire; "I hope you won't neither on yer regret it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His tone clearly indicated that he really hoped and expected they would. "I bid you good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry breathed a deep sigh of relief after Squire Green left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was afraid you were going to hire me out to the squire, father,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't enjoy the prospect, did you?'' said his father, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The squire didn't seem to like it very well,'' said Mrs. Walton, looking up from her mending.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, he fully expected to get Harry for little or nothing. It was ridiculous to offer two dollars a month for a boy of his age.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid he will be more disposed to be hard on you when the time comes to pay for the cow. He told you he wouldn't extend the time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is not likely to after this; but, wife, we won't borrow trouble. Something may turn up to help us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sure I shall be able to help you about it, father,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so, my son, but don't feel too certain. You may not succeed as well as you anticipate.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that, but I mean to try at any rate.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII. LEAVING HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday morning came, and the whole family stood on the grass plot in front of the house, ready to bid Harry good-by. He was encumbered by no trunk, but carried his scanty supply of clothing wrapped in a red cotton handkerchief, and not a very heavy bundle at that. He had cut a stout stick in the woods nearby, and from the end of this suspended over his back bore the bundle which contained all his worldly fortune except the twenty-five cents which was in his vest pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like to have you go,'' said his mother, anxiously. "Suppose you don't get work?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't worry about me, mother,'' said Harry, brightly. "I'll get along somehow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Remember you've got a home here, Harry, whatever happens,'' said his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shan't forget, father.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, mother,'' said Harry, feeling an unwonted moistening of the eyes, as he reflected that he was about to leave the house in which he had lived since infancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, my dear child,'' said his mother, kissing him. "Be sure to write.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I will.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So with farewell greetings Harry walked out into the world. He had all at once assumed a man's responsibilities, and his face grew serious, as he began to realize that he must now look out for himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked five miles without stopping. He felt tired, and sat down by the roadside to rest before going further.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry walked six miles farther, and then decided that it was time to rest again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat down again beside the road, and untying the handkerchief which contained his worldly possessions, he drew therefrom a large slice of bread and began to eat with evident relish. There was a slice of cold meat also, which he found tasted particularly good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder whether they are thinking of me at home,'' he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry rested for a couple of hours, sheltered from the sun by the foliage of the oak beneath which he had stretched himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He resumed walking, but we will not dwell upon the details of his journey. At six o'clock he was twenty-five miles from home. He was alarmed by the darkening of the sky. It was evident that a storm was approaching. He looked about him for shelter from the shower, and a place where he could pass the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clouds were darkening, and the shower was evidently not far off. It was a solitary place, and no houses were to be seen nearby. But nearly a quarter of a mile back Harry caught sight of a small house, and jumping over the fence directed his steps toward it. It was not upon a public road, but there was a narrow lane leading to it from the highway. Probably it was occupied by a poor family, Harry thought. Still it would shelter him from the storm which had even now commenced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He knocked at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Immediately it was opened and a face peered out— the face of a man advanced in years. It was thin, wrinkled and haggard. He demanded, "Who are you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Harry Walton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shelter from the storm. It is going to rain.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in,'' said the old man, and opening the door wider, he admitted our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man sat down opposite Harry, and stared at him, till our hero felt somewhat embarrassed and uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry knew that the old man must be crazy, or at least a monomaniac, and, though he seemed harmless enough, it was of course possible that he might be dangerous. He was almost sorry that he had sought shelter here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man had risen, and, taking a teakettle, suspended it over the fire. A monomaniac though he was, he knew how to make tea. Presently he took from the cupboard a baker's roll and some cold meat, and when the tea was ready invited Harry to be seated at the table. Our hero did so willingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What if mother could see me now?'' he thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still the rain poured down. It showed no signs of slackening. He saw that it would be necessary to remain where he was through the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you accommodate me till morning?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly,'' said the old man. "I shall be glad to have you stay here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The supper was plain enough, but it was relished by our young traveler, whose long walk had stimulated a naturally good appetite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At nine o'clock he began to feel drowsy, and intimated as much to his host. The old man conducted him to an upper chamber, where there was a bed upon the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can sleep there,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you sleep?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down below but I shall not go to bed until late.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well,'' said Harry. "Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad he is not in the room with me,'' thought Harry. "I don't think there is any danger, but it isn't comfortable to be too near a crazy man.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX. IN SEARCH OF WORK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Harry awoke the next morning, after a sound and refreshing sleep, the sun was shining brightly in at the window. He rubbed his eyes, and stared about him, not at first remembering where he was. But almost immediately recollection came to his aid, and he smiled as he thought of the eccentric old man whose guest he was. He leaped out of bed, and, quickly dressing himself, went downstairs. The fire was burning and breakfast was already on the table. It was precisely similar to the supper of the night previous. The old man sat at the fireside smoking a pipe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning,'' said Harry. "I am up late.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is no matter. You have a long journey before you, and it is well to rest before starting.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Breakfast is ready,'' said the old man, hospitably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry made a hearty breakfast. When it was over he rose to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must be going,'' he said. "Thank you for your kind entertainment. If you would allow me to pay you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not keep an inn,'' said the old man, with dignity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shaking the old man by the hand, he made his way across the fields to the main road. Looking back from time to time, he saw the old man watching him from his place in the doorway, his eyes shaded by his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is the strangest man I ever saw,'' thought Harry. "Still he treated me kindly.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he reached the road he saw, just in front of him, a boy of about his own age driving half a dozen cows before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello!'' he cried, by way of salutation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello!'' returned the country boy. "Where are you going?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. Wherever I can find work,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy laughed. "Dad finds enough for me to do. I don't have to go after it. Haven't you got a father?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you work for him?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to work for pay.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On a farm?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I'll work in a shoeshop if I get a chance or in a printing office.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you understand the shoe business?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but I can learn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you come from?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Granton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the boy reached the pasture to which he was driving the cows, and Harry, bidding him good-by, went on his way. He felt fresh and vigorous, and walked ten miles before he felt the need of rest. He felt hungry, and the provision which he brought from home was nearly gone. There was a grocery store close at hand, and he went in, thinking that he would find something to help his meal. On the counter he saw some rolls, and there was an open barrel of apples not far off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For four cents Harry made quite a substantial addition to his meal. As he left the store and walked up the road, with a roll in his hand, and eating an apple, he called to mind Benjamin Franklin's entrance of Philadelphia with a roll under each arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope I shall have as good luck as Franklin had,'' he thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Walking slowly, he saw, on a small building which he had just reached, the sign, "Post Office.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps the postmaster will know if anybody about here wants a boy,'' Harry said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered, finding himself in a small room, with one part partitioned off as a repository for mail matter. He stepped up to a little window, and presently the postmaster, an elderly man, presented himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What name?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't come for a letter,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want, then?'' asked the official.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know of anyone that wants to hire a boy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who's the boy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am. I want to get a chance to work.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What kind of work?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Any kind that'll pay my board and a little over.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know of any place,'' said the postmaster, after a little thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't there any shoeshop where I could get in?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That reminds me—James Leavitt told me this morning that his boy was going to Boston to go into a store in a couple of months. He's been pegging for his father, and I guess they'll have to get somebody in his place.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry's face brightened at this intelligence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just the kind of place I'd like to get,'' he said. "Where does Mr. Leavitt live?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A quarter of a mile from here—over the bridge. You'll know it well enough. It's a cottage house, with a shoeshop in the back yard.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir,'' said Harry. "I'll go there and try my luck.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a minute,'' said the postmaster. "There's a letter here for Mr. Leavitt. If you're going there, you may as well carry it along. It's from Boston. I shouldn't wonder if it's about the place Bob Leavitt wants.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll take it with pleasure,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It occurred to him that it would be a good introduction for him, and pave the way for his application.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked up the street, crossing the bridge referred to by the postmaster, and looked carefully on each side of him for the cottage and shop. As he neared the shop he heard a noise which indicated that work was going on inside. He opened the door and entered.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X. THE NEW BOARDER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry found himself in a room about twenty-five feet by twenty. There were three persons present. One, a man of middle age, was Mr. James Leavitt, the proprietor of the shop. His son Robert, about seventeen, worked at an adjoining bench. Tom Gavitt, a journeyman, a short, thick-set man of thirty, employed by Mr. Leavitt, was the third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three looked up as Harry entered the shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a letter for Mr. Leavitt,'' said our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's my name,'' said the eldest of the party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry advanced and placed it in his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you get this letter?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At the post office.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't call you by name. Do you live about here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I came from Granton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's from your Uncle Benjamin,'' he said, addressing Robert. "Let us see what he has to say.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He says he shall be ready to take you the first of September. That's in six weeks—a little sooner than we calculated. I wish it were a little later, as work is brisk, and I may find it difficult to fill your place without paying more than I want to.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you hire me?'' asked Harry, who felt that the time had come for him to announce his business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Leavitt looked at him more attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you ever worked in a shop?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will take you some time to learn pegging.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll work for my board till I've learned.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you won't be able to do all I want at first.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose I begin now,'' said Harry, "and work for my board till your son goes away. By that time I can do considerable.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">''Better take him, father,'' said Robert, who felt that it would facilitate his own plans.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much would you want after you have learned?'' asked the father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know; what would be a fair price?'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll give you three dollars a week and board,'' said Mr. Leavitt, after a little consideration—"that is, if I am satisfied with you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll come,'' said Harry, promptly. He rapidly calculated that there would be about twenty weeks for which he would receive pay before the six months expired. This would give him sixty dollars, of which he thought he should be able to save forty to send or carry to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you happen to come to me?'' asked Mr. Leavitt, with some curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I heard at the post office that your son was going to the city to work, and I thought I could get in here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we will try you at shoemaking. Robert, you can teach him what you know about pegging.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come here,'' said Robert. "What is your name?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry Walton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifteen.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you ever work much?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, on a farm.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think you'll like shoemaking better?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know yet, but I think I shall. I like almost anything better than farming.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robert,'' said his father, "go in and tell mother to put an extra seat at the table. She doesn't know that we've got a new boarder.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robert went in and informed his mother of the new boarder. It made no difference, for the table was always well supplied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is Harry Walton, mother,'' said Mr. Leavitt, "our new apprentice. He will take Bob's place when he goes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to see you,'' said Mrs. Leavitt, hospitably. "You may sit here, next to Robert.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accustomed to the painful frugality of the table at home, he regarded this as a splendid dinner, and did full justice to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon he resumed work in the shop under Robert's guidance. He was in excellent spirits. He felt that he was very fortunate to have gained a place so soon, and determined to write home that same evening.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI. AN INVITATION DECLINED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The summer passed quickly and the time arrived for Robert Leavitt to go to the city. By this time Harry was well qualified to take his place. Harry proved to be quicker, if anything, than Robert, though the latter had been accustomed to the work for several years. Mr. Leavitt was well satisfied with his new apprentice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, Harry,'' said Robert, as he saw the coach coming up the road to take him to the railroad station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by, and good luck!'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Saturday evening, after he had received his week's pay, Luke Harrison, who worked in a shop nearby, met him at the post office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come along, Harry,'' he said. "Let us play a game of billiards.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must excuse me,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, come along,'' said Luke, taking him by the arm; "it's only twenty-five cents.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't afford it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the use of being stingy, Harry? Try one game.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can get somebody else to play with you, Luke.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, hang it, if you care so much for a quarter, I'll pay for the game myself. Only come and play.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want to amuse myself at your expense.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a miser,'' said Luke, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told you once that I had another use for the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He knew he was right, but it was disagreeable to be called a miser. He was too proud to justify himself to Luke, who spent all his money foolishly, though earning considerably larger wages than he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The day previous he had heard, for the first time, that there was a public library in another part of the town, which was open evenings. Though it was two miles distant, and he had been at work all day, he determined to walk up there and get a book. He felt that he was very ignorant, and that his advance in the world depended upon his improving all opportunities that might present themselves for extending his limited knowledge. This was evidently one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After his unsatisfactory interview with Luke, he set out for the upper village, as it was called. Forty minutes' walk brought him to the building in which the library was kept. An elderly man had charge of it—a Mr. Parmenter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I take out a book?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you live in town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your name?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry Walton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't remember any Walton family.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father lives in Granton. I am working for Mr. James Leavitt.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no doubt this is quite correct, but I shall have to have Mr. Leavitt's certificate to that effect before I can put your name down, and trust you with books.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So it seemed his two-mile walk was for nothing. He must retrace his steps and come again Monday night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was turning away disappointed when Dr. Townley, of the lower village, who lived near Mr. Leavitt, entered the library.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My wife wants a book in exchange for this, Mr. Parmenter,'' he said. "Have you got anything new in? Ah, Harry Walton, how came you here? Do you take books out of the library?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I came up for, but the librarian says I must bring a line from Mr. Leavitt, telling who I am.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Dr. Townley knows you, that is sufficient,'' said the librarian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is all right, Mr. Parmenter. He is a young neighbor of mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is enough. He can select a book.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry, after a little reflection, selected the first volume of "Rollin's Universal History.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good, solid book, Harry,'' said the doctor. "Most of our young people select stories.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like stories very much,'' said Harry; "but I have only a little time to read, and I must try to learn something.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are a sensible boy,'' said the doctor, emphatically. "Most care only for present enjoyment.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have got my own way to make,'' said Harry, "and I suppose that is what influences me. My father cannot help me, and I want to rise in the world.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are going the right way to work. Do you intend to take out books often from the library?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will be a long walk from the lower village.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would walk farther rather than do without the books,''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can save you at any rate from walking back. My chaise is outside, and, if you will jump in, I will carry you home.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, doctor. I shall be very glad to ride.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the way, Dr. Townley said: "I have a few miscellaneous books which I will lend to you, if you will come in.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry thanked him, and not long afterward availed himself of this considerate proposal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once a week regularly Harry wrote home. He knew that his letters would give pleasure to the family, and he never allowed anything to interfere with his duty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His father wrote: "We are getting on about as usual. The cow does tolerably well, but is not as good as the one I lost. I have not yet succeeded in laying up anything toward paying for her.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry wrote in reply: "Don't trouble yourself, father, about your debt to Squire Green. If I have steady work, and keep my health, I shall have enough to pay it by the time it comes due.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII. THE TAILOR'S CUSTOMER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the end of six weeks from the date of Robert's departure, Harry had been paid eighteen dollars. Of this sum he had spent but one dollar, and kept the balance in his pocketbook. He did not care to send it home until ho had enough to meet Squire Green's demand, knowing that his father would be able to meet his ordinary expenses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See how the fellow dresses,'' said Luke Harrison to two of his companions. "His clothes are shabby enough, and he hasn't got an overcoat at all. He hoards his money, and is too stingy to buy one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd rather get trusted for your clothes than do without them,'' said Frank Heath, slyly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What if I do,'' said Luke sharply, "as long as I am going to pay for them?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, nothing,'' said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time Harry had come up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where are you going, Walton?'' asked Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Left your overcoat at home, didn't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry colored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did not leave it at home, for I have none to leave.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tailor, Merrill by name, had a shop over the dry goods store, and thither Harry directed his steps. There was one other person in the shop, a young fellow but little larger than Harry, though two years older, who was on a visit to an aunt in the neighborhood, but lived in Boston. His name was Maurice Tudor. He had gone into the shop to leave a coat to be repaired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Walton?'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well, thank you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's pretty cold for October.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, unusually so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Merrill,'' said Harry, "I should like to inquire the price of an overcoat.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is the cheapest goods I have,'' said the tailor, pointing to some coarse cloth nearby. "I can make you up a coat from that for eighteen dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eighteen dollars!'' exclaimed Harry. "Is that the cheapest you have?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The very cheapest. I might take off a dollar for cash. I've got enough of running up bills. There's Luke Harrison owes me over thirty dollars, and I don't believe he means to pay it at all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I buy, I shall pay cash,'' said Harry, quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Tudor was a silent listener to this dialogue. He lingered after Harry went out, and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good fellow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry Walton?'' repeated the tailor. "Yes, he's worth a dozen like Luke Harrison.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is rather poor, I suppose.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. The boys call him mean; but Leavitt tells me he is saving up every cent to send to his father, who is a poor farmer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good thing in him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I wish I could afford to give him an overcoat. He needs one, but I suppose seventeen dollars will come rather hard on him to pay. If young Walton wants to get an overcoat on credit, I shan't object. I judge something by looks, and I am sure he is honest.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, good-night, Mr. Merrill. You'll have my coat done soon?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Mr. Tudor. It shall be ready for you tomorrow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Maurice Tudor left the tailor's shop, revolving a new idea which had just entered his mind. Now he remembered that he had at his home in the city an excellent overcoat which he had worn the previous winter, but which was now too small for him. As well as he could judge by observing Harry's figure, it would be an excellent fit for him. Why should he not give it to him?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On his way home he overtook our hero, walking slowly, plunged in thought. In fact, he was still occupied with the problem of the needed overcoat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening, Harry,'' said young Tudor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening, Mr. Tudor,'' answered Harry; "are you going back to the city soon?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the course of a week or two. Mr. Leavitt's son is in a store in Boston, is he not?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I have taken his place in the shop.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I hear. How do you like your new business?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well. I think I should like better to be in a printing office, but I am glad to get a chance in a shoeshop.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw you at Merrill's this evening.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I was pricing an overcoat.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I bought this one in Boston just before I came away. I have a very good one left from last winter, but it is too small for me. It is of no use to me. If I thought you would accept it, I would offer it to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry's heart gave a joyful bound. Here was his great need supplied, and without expense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Accept it!'' he repeated. "Indeed I will, and thank you for your great kindness.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I will write home at once to have it sent to me. I also have a suit which I have outgrown; if you wouldn't be too proud to take it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am not so foolish,'' said Harry. "It will be a great favor to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you would take it right,'' said Maurice. "I will also send for the suit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days later a large bundle, wrapped in brown paper, was brought by the village expressman to Mr. Leavitt's door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A bundle for you, Walton,'' said the expressman, seeing Harry in the yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry ran forward and received it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is there to pay?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing,'' was the answer. "It was prepaid in the city.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry took it up to his room, and opened it eagerly. First came the promised overcoat. It was of very handsome French cloth, with a velvet collar, and rich silk facings, far higher in cost than any Mr. Merrill would have made for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would it fit? That was a question he tested immediately by trying it on. It fitted as if it had been made for him. Next came, not one, but two complete suits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After supper Harry, arrayed in his best suit, and wearing the overcoat, walked down to the center of the village.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. THE NIGHT SCHOLARS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Immediately after Thanksgiving Day, the winter schools commenced. That in the center district was kept by a student of Dartmouth College, who had leave of absence from the college authorities for twelve weeks, in order by teaching to earn something to help defray his college expenses. Leonard Morgan, now a junior, was a tall, strongly made young man of twenty-two, whose stalwart frame had not been reduced by his diligent study.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had scarcely commenced his school when a happy idea struck him. There were several shoe-shops in the village, each employing from one to three boys, varying in age from fifteen to nineteen. Why could he not form a private class, to meet in the evenings, say for an hour and a half or two hours, to be instructed in advanced arithmetic, or, if desired, in Latin and Greek. He broached the idea to Stephen Bates, the prudential committeeman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know,'' said Mr. Bates, "what our boys will think of it. I've got a boy that I'll send, but whether you'll get enough to make it pay I don't know.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I can have the schoolhouse, Mr. Bates?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, there won't be no objection to that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll begin if I can get eight names,'' said the young man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you'd better draw up a notice and put it up in the store and the tavern,'' suggested the committeeman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In accordance with this advice, the young teacher posted up in the two places the following notice: "EVENING SCHOOL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I propose to start an evening school for those who are occupied during the day, and unable to attend the district school. Instruction will be given in such English branches as may be desired, and also in Latin and Greek, if any are desirous of pursuing a classical course. The school will commence next Monday evening at the school house, beginning at seven o'clock. Terms: Seventy cents a week, or five dollars for the term of ten weeks. "LEONARD MORGAN.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Among those who read this notice with interest was Harry Walton. He had not forgotten his motto, "Live and learn,'' and here seemed to be a good opportunity of putting it into practice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to join the class, Walton?'' asked Frank Heath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' said Harry, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where'll you get the money?'' asked Luke Harrison, in a jeering tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shan't have to go far for it. I don't know enough yet, and never expect to,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to go to school when you're a gray-headed old veteran?'' asked Frank, jocosely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I may not go to school then, but I shan't give up learning then,'' said Harry, smiling. "One can learn without going to school. But while I'm young, I mean to go to school as much as I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Monday evening arrived ten pupils presented themselves, of whom six were boys, or young men, and four were girls. Leonard Morgan felt encouraged. A class of ten, though paying but five dollars each, would give him fifty dollars, which, added to the pay he received for his services during the day, would be quite an acceptable addition to his scanty means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to see so many,'' he said. "I think our evening class will be a success. I will go among you, take your names, and ascertain what studies you wish to pursue.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he came to Harry he asked, "What do you propose to study?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to take up algebra and Latin, if you are willing,'' answered our hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you studied either at all?'' inquired the young teacher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; I have not had an opportunity.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far have you been in arithmetic?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Through the square and cube root.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think you understand those?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe so. If you will give me an example I will try.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you have been so far, you will have no difficulty with algebra. As to Latin, one of the girls wishes to take up that, and I will put you in the class with her. Have you any book?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir. Where can I get one?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will send for one for you, and also an algebra.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later, Leonard Morgan came round to the desk at which Harry was sitting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I brought a Latin grammar with me,'' he said, "thinking it probable someone might like to begin that language. You can use it until yours comes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you,'' said Harry; and he eagerly took the book, and asked to have a lesson set, which was done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can get more than that,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much more?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Twice as much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If that is the case, I will let you be in a class by yourself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you,'' said Harry. "I should like company; but I want to get on fast.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still later he recited the double lesson, and so correctly that the teacher's attention was drawn to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a smart boy,'' he said to himself. "I mean to take pains with him. What a pity he can't go to college!''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV. LOST, OR STOLEN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry learned rapidly. At the end of four weeks he had completed the Latin grammar, or that part of it which his teacher thought necessary for a beginner to be familiar with, and commenced translating the easy sentences in "Andrew's Latin Reader.'' He didn't confine his studying to the two hours that he passed in school, but devoted his spare min utes during the day to preparing himself for recitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are getting on famously, Harry,'' said his teacher. "I never had a scholar who advanced so rapidly before.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry brightened up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is because I like it,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young man smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to be an editor,'' said Harry; "but I don't see much prospect of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An editor must know a good deal.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There are some who don't,'' said Leonard Morgan, with a smile. "However, you would like to do credit to the profession, and it is certainly in these modern days a very important profession. There is nothing to prevent your becoming an editor some day, if you strongly desire it. The sooner you begin to prepare yourself for it the better.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can I prepare myself?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To begin with, by doing your best to acquire a good education; not only by studying lessons, but by reading as extensively as you are able. An editor should be a man of large information. Have you ever practiced writing compositions?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little; not much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you get time to write anything, and will submit it to me, I will point out such faults as I may notice.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose I take my motto.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Live and learn.' ''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do so, by all means. That is a subject upon which you may be fairly said to have some ideas of your own.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In due time Harry presented a composition on this subject. I do not propose to place it on record here. He sent a copy home, and received in reply a letter from his father, expressing surprise and gratification at the excellence of his essay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But while intent upon cultivating his mind, Harry had not lost sight of the great object which had sent him from home to seek employment among strangers. He had undertaken to meet the note which his father had given Squire Green in payment for the cow, and he felt confident that he could do it, if his health and business continued good. By the first of December he had saved up thirty-three dollars toward this object. By the middle of January the note would come due. So he had every reason to believe that he could carry out his scheme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was waited upon by Luke Harrison on the first day of December, and asked to join in a grand sleighing excursion to a town ten miles distant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's no use talking, Luke; I can't go.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This conversation took place as they were walking home from the store in the evening. Harry pulled out his handkerchief suddenly from his pocket, and with it came his pocketbook, containing all his savings. He didn't hear it fall; but Luke did, and the later, moreover, suspected what it was. He did not call Harry's attention to it, but, falling back, said: "I've got to go back to the store. I forgot something. Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night!'' said Harry, unsuspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke stooped swiftly while our hero's back was turned, and picked up the pocketbook. He slipped it into his own pocket, and, instead of going back to the store, went to his own room, locked the door, and then eagerly pulled out the pocketbook and counted the contents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty-three dollars!'' he said to himself, in exultation. "What a miser that fellow is! It serves him right to lose his money.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV. AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What I find is mine,'' he said to himself. "Of course it is. Harry Walton deserves to lose his money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How should he dispose of it?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has already been said that Luke was fond of new clothes. He wanted to re-establish his credit with Merrill, for he was in want of a new coat, and knew that it would be useless to order one unless he had some money to pay on account. He decided to use a part of Harrys' money for this purpose. He therefore put the pocketbook into his trunk, and carefully locked it. Then he went to bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, Harry reached Mr. Leavitt's, unconscious of the serious misfortune which had befallen him, and at ten o'clock took his lamp and went up to bed. While he was undressing he felt in his pocket for his money, intending to lock it up in his trunk as usual. His dismay may be conceived when he could not find it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor Harry sank into a chair with that sudden sinking of the heart which unlooked-for misfortune brings, and tried to think where he could have left the pocketbook, or how he could have lost it. He did not generally carry it round with him, but that evening he found himself under the necessity of buying a necktie at the store, and so had taken it from his trunk. Could he have left it on the counter? No; he distinctly remembered replacing it in his pocket. What could have become of it? He felt the need of consulting with somebody, and with his lamp in his hand went downstairs again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sick, Harry?'' asked Mrs. Leavitt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're looking dreadfully pale.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've lost my pocketbook,'' said Harry. "That is, I can't find it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much was there in it?'' asked his employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty-three dollars,'' answered Harry. "It was all the money I had.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whew! that's a good deal of money to lose. I shouldn't want to lose so much myself. When did you have it last?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry told his story, Mr. Leavitt listening attentively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are sure you didn't leave it at the store, on the counter? I left my wallet there one night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am certain I put it in my pocket.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you came right home?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Alone?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; Luke Harrison came with me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was he talking about?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wanted me to join in a sleighing party of young folks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you say?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I said I couldn't afford it. Then he charged me with being a miser, as he often does. He left me at Deacon Brewster's. He said he must go back to the store that he had forgotten something.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's something queer about this,'' said Mr. Leavitt, shrewdly. "Do you want my advice?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I wish you would advise me, for I don't know what to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then go to the store at once. Ask, but without attracting any attention, if Luke came back there after leaving you. If you find that Luke's excuse was false, and that he did not go back, go at once to his boarding place, and ask him whether he saw you drop the pocketbook. You might have dropped it, and he picked it up. That will give him a chance to restore it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose he says no?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we must watch whether he seems flush of money for the next few days. But there will be time for that to-morrow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This seemed to Harry good advice. He put on his hat and coat, and retraced his steps to the store, carefully looking along the road to see if he could descry anything of the lost pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you went home, Harry,'' said Frank Heath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see I am here again,'' said our hero, evading a reply. "Is it late?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank Heath took out his watch, for which he had recently traded, and announced that it was ten o'clock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Time to shut up shop,'' said Mr. Meade, the store keeper. "You boys will have to adjourn till tomorrow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's Luke Harrison?'' asked Frank Heath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't he go out with you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; but he left me some time ago. He came back here, didn't he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; he hasn't been here since.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He spoke of coming,'' said Harry. "He wanted me to join that sleighing party.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't afford it, Frank.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I ought not to spend the money,'' said Frank Heath; "but I'm always in for a good time. I guess I'll have to go.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night, boys,'' said the storekeeper, significantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They took the hint and went out. Their way lay in different directions, and they parted company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke Harrison boarded with a Mr. Glenham, a carpenter, and it was at his door that Harry knocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is Luke Harrison at home?'' he inquired of Mrs. Glenham, who opened the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At home and abed, I reckon,'' she replied, looking surprised at his late call.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would like to see him,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you wait till to-morrow morning? I was just going to lock up for the night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it's late, Mrs. Glenham, but it is about a matter of importance that I wish to see Luke. I won't stay but a minute.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I suppose you can go up. His room is at the head of the stairs.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry went upstairs and knocked. Ordinarily, Luke would have been asleep, for generally he sank to sleep five minutes after his head touched the pillow; but to-night the excitement of his dishonest intention kept him awake, and he started uneasily when he heard the knock at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who's there?'' he called out from his bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's I—Harry Walton.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm in bed,'' he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to see you a minute, on a matter if importance,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come to-morrow morning.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must see you now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, well, come in, if you must,'' said Luke, getting out of bed reluctantly, and admitting his unwelcome visitor.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI. A DENIAL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You seem to be in an awful hurry to see me,'' said Luke, grumbling. "I was just getting to sleep.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've lost my pocketbook,'' said Harry. "Have you seen it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to charge me with taking it?'' demanded Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't said anything of the sort,'' said Harry; "but you were with me, and I thought you might have seen it drop out of my pocket.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I haven't seen it. Was that all you woke me up about?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that all? You talk as if it was a little thing losing thirty-three dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thirty-three dollars!'' repeated Luke, pretending to be surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better look in the road, or you might have left it in the store.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I didn't. I bought something there, but I remember distinctly putting back my pocketbook before I went out.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well,'' said Luke, yawning, "I wish I could help you; but I can't. Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What success, Harry?'' inquired Mr. Leavitt, who had deferred going to bed in order to hear his report.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None at all,'' answered Harry, and related his interview with Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is there anything by which you can identify any of the bills?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' answered Harry, with sudden recollection,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dropped a penful of ink on one of the bills—a two-dollar note—just in the center. I had been writing a letter, and the bill lay on the table nearby.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good!'' said Mr. Leavitt. "Now, supposing Luke has taken this money, how is he likely to spend it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At the tailor's, most likely. He is always talking about new clothes; but lately he hasn't had any because Merrill shut down on him on account of an unpaid bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you had better see Merrill privately, and ask him to take particular notice of any bills that Luke pays him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If Luke is innocent, I shall feel ashamed of having suspected him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Innocence must often be suspected, or guilt would never be detected. It is the only way to get on the track of the missing bills.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry saw that this was reasonable, and decided to call on Merrill the next day. In a few words he communicated his loss, and the fact that the only person with him at the time was Luke Harrison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't much opinion of Luke. He owes me a considerable bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He prefers your clothes to Hayden's, and if he has the money, he will probably come here and spend some of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose he does, what do you want me to do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To examine the bills he pays you, and if you find an ink spot in the center of one, let me know.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand. I think I can manage it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My money was mostly in ones and twos.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That may help you a little. I will bear it in mind.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two days later Luke Harrison met Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you found your money, Walton?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, and I am afraid I never shall,'' said our hero, shaking his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you think has become of it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what I would like to find out,'' said Harry. "I suppose that I must have been very careless.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you were. I never lose any money. Are you going to do anything about it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can I do about it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's given it up,'' said Luke to himself. "I think I can venture to use some of it now. I'll go round to Merrill's this evening, and see what he's got in the way of pants.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accordingly he strolled into Merrill's that evening</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got any new cloths in, Merrill?'' asked Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're owing me a bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much is it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some over thirty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't pay it all, but I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll pay you fifteen dollars on account, and you can make me a new pair of pants. Will that answer?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Of course, I'd rather you'd pay the whole bill. Still I want to be accommodating.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me look at your cloths.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tailor displayed a variety of cloths, one of which suited Luke's fancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like that,'' he said. "Make me a pair off of that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke gave directions, and then took a roll of bills from his pocket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's fifteen dollars,'' he said. "Just credit me with that on the bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Merrill proceeded to count the money, which consisted of ones and twos, and instantly came to the conclusion that it was from Harry's missing pocketbook, particularly as he came upon the identical note with the blot in the center.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When will you have the pants done?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may call round in two or three days.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just make 'em in style, Merrill, and I'll send all my friends here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My young friend,'' soliloquized the tailor, watching his exit, "you have walked into my trap neatly. Coleman''—turning to a young man present at the time—"did you see Luke Harrison pay me this money?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; to be sure.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you see this blot on one of the bills a two?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see what there is strange about that. Anybody might get ink on a bill, mightn't he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The bill's just as good, isn't it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course it is.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Coleman was puzzled. He could not understand why he should have been called upon to notice such a trifle; but the tailor had his reasons, though he did not choose to divulge them just at present.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII. IN THE TAILOR'S POWER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that the bill you spoke of, Walton?'' asked the tailor, on Harry's next visit to the shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' said Harry, eagerly. "Where did you get it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can guess.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"From Luke Harrison?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; he paid me, last evening, fifteen dollars on account of his bill. This note was among those he paid me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is mine. I can swear to it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The rest of the money was yours, no doubt. It is in ones and twos. Luke has been caught in a trap.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What shall I do, Mr. Merrill?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The money is yours, and I will restore it to you after seeing Luke. I will send for him to be here at seven o'clock this evening.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose he denies giving you the bill?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am prepared for that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Luke was at work in his shop that day, the tailor's boy came in with a note.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is for you, Luke,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke opened it, and read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you call at my shop at seven this evening, about the pants you ordered? HENRY MERRILL.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell your father I'll come,'' said Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose,'' he thought, "Merrill wants to consult me about something. I hope he'll hurry them up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At seven o'clock he entered the tailor's shop once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Merrill, what do you want to see me about?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Luke,'' said Mr. Merrill, looking him steadily in the eye, "where did you get that money you paid me on account?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did I get the money?'' repeated Luke, flushing. "From the man I work for, to be sure.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you swear to that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you take my word?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I may as well tell you that Harry Walton recognizes one of the bills as part of the money he lost the other evening.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He does, does he?'' said Luke, boldly. "That's all nonsense. Bills all look alike.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This one has a drop of ink just in the center. He remembered having dropped a blot upon it one evening when he was writing a letter.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean to say I stole 'em?'' demanded Luke, angry, but also secretly frightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It looks like it, unless you can explain how you came by the blotted bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe I paid you the bill. Very likely it was someone else.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you would say that, so I called Coleman's attention to it as soon as you were gone. However, if your employer admits paying you the bills, of course you are all right.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke remembered very well he was paid in fives, and that such an appeal would do him no good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does Walton know this?'' he asked, sinking into a chair, and wiping the perspiration from his brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; he suspected you, and asked me to look out for a blotted two.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to choke him!'' said Luke, fiercely. "The miserly scoundrel!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems to me that he is quite justified in trying to recover his money. What have you done with the rest of it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me what will be done to me,'' said Luke, sullenly. "I only picked it up when he dropped it in the road.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why didn't you tell him you found it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I meant to give it to him after a while. I only wanted to keep it long enough to frighten him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was dangerous, particularly as you used it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean to give him back other money. I was hard up, and so I used it for a short time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think that excuse will avail you in a court of justice.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Court of justice!'' repeated Luke, turning pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't have me taken up, will he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He will unless you arrange to restore all the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've paid you part of it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That I shall hand over to him. Have you the rest?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've spent a few dollars. I've got eight dollars left.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better give it to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reluctantly, Luke drew out his pocketbook, and passed over the eight dollars to Mr. Merrill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So far, so good,'' said the tailor. "Now when will you pay the rest?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In a few weeks,'' said Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That won't do. How much do you earn a week?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifteen dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you pay for board?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Four dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you will be able to pay eleven dollars at the end of this week.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't get along without money,'' said Luke, doggedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will have to till you pay back the money, unless you prefer appearing before a court of justice. I believe you owe me over thirty dollars. When are you going to pay it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a significance in his tone, which arrested Luke's attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll pay you as soon as I can,'' he said. "I haven't got any money now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are fully able to pay for your clothes promptly, and I advise you to do it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll pay you as soon as I can.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you neglect to do it, I may as well tell you that I shall let it be known that you stole Walton's pocketbook. The whole story would be told, and people might think as they pleased. But it is much better for you to avoid all this by paying your bills.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke Harrison left the tailor's shop in a very unhappy and disgusted frame of mind. The prospect of paying his debts under compulsion was far from agreeable, and he cursed his folly in so soon making use of Harry Walton's money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I had only had the sense to wait till it blew over,'' he said to himself, "I should have escaped all this. I didn't think Merrill would act so mean.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That was his way of looking at it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I'm in for paying his infernal bill besides,'' he continued. "It's too bad.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just then he came upon Frank Heath, who hailed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Luke, I was just looking for you. Come and play a game of billiards.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you'll promise not to beat me. I haven't got a cent of money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't? What have you done with those bills you had this afternoon?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've paid 'em over to Merrill,'' said Luke, hesitating. "He was in a deuced stew about his bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you owe him any more? Have you paid all up?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When are your new pants going to be ready— those you told me about?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know,'' said Luke, with a pang of disappointment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Merrill's making them, isn't he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He agreed to; but now he says he won't, till I have paid the whole bill.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seems to me your credit ain't very good, Luke.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's good enough, but he's hard up for money. I guess he's going to fail. If you'll lend me a couple of dollars, I'll go around and have a game.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Frank Heath laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to go to someone else, Luke,'' he said. "Perhaps you're going to fail, too.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke passed a disagreeable evening, feeling that he was a victim of ill luck. It did not occur to him that the ill luck was of his own bringing on.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII. THE COMING OF THE MAGICIAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry was not a little rejoiced at the recovery of so large a portion of his lost money, and the prospect of getting back the rest. He foresaw that there would be some embarrassment in meeting him, but he resolved, not by look or word, to suggest what had happened. Accordingly when, the day afterward, he met Luke on the bridge, he said, pleasantly,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning, Luke.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning,'' said Luke stiffly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll get over it when he finds I don't speak of it,'' thought Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Saturday evening, according to his arrangement, Luke was to have paid the surplus of his wages, after meeting his board bill, to Mr. Merrill, for Harry. But he did not go near him. On Mon day the tailor, meeting him, inquired why he had not kept his agreement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had my wages loose in my pocket, and managed to lose them somehow. I've looked everywhere, and can't find the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is very singular,'' said the tailor, suspiciously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why is it singular?'' asked Luke. "Didn't Harry Walton lose his money?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you think you lost the money?'' asked Merrill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sure I don't know,'' said Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well,'' said Merrill, dryly, "I hope you will take better care of your wages next Saturday evening.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe a word of what he says about losing his money,'' said the tailor, privately, to Harry. "I think it's only a trick to get rid of paying you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you think he'll pay me?'' asked Harry, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't if he can help it,'' was the answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a slippery customer. I believe his money is in his pocket at this moment.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He intended to run away, leaving all his creditors in the lurch. This was the "new way to pay old debts,'' which occurred to Luke as much the easiest. Besides, he would have the satisfaction of leaving the tailor and Harry, both of whom he hated, to whistle for their money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next Saturday evening, Mr. Merrill waited in vain for a call from his debtor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Monday morning he learned that Luke had left town without acquainting any one with his destination. It transpired, also, that he was owing at his boarding house for two weeks' board. He was thus enabled to depart with nearly thirty dollars, for parts unknown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has evidently been saving up money to help him out of town. Probably he has gone to some other place where there are shoeshops; but I am afraid that won't give us a very definite clew. Some time we may get upon his track, and compel him to pay up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That won't do me much good,'' said Harry, despondently. And then he told the tailor why he wanted the money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have most of it ready, won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I will.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No doubt this man that sold your father the cow will wait for the balance.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know about that,'' said Harry, doubtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would lend you the money myself,'' said the tailor, "but I've got a heavy payment to meet, and some of my customers are slow pay, though I have not many as bad as Luke Harrison.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, Mr. Merrill,'' said Harry. "I am as much obliged to you as if you could lend me the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The very next day Mr. Leavitt received a message from the wholesale dealer to whom he sold his shoes that the market was glutted and sales slow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall not want any more goods for a month or two,'' the letter concluded. "I will let you know when I need more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Leavitt read this letter aloud in the shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So it seems we are to have a vacation,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was a catastrophe for which Harry was not prepared. Twenty-three dollars were all that he had saved from the money lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think I can get into any other shop in town?'' he inquired anxiously of Mr. Leavitt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can try, Harry; but I guess you'll find others no better off than I.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He devoted the next day to going round among the shops; but everywhere he met with unfavorable answers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems as if all my money must go,'' thought Harry. "First the ten dollars Luke Harrison stole. Then work stopped. I don't know but it would be better for me to go home.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't give up yet,'' said Harry, pluckily. "I must expect to meet with some bad luck. I suppose everybody does, first or last. Something'll turn up for me, if I try to make it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During his first idle day, Harry's attention was drawn to a handbill which had been posted up in the store, the post the tavern, and other public places in the village. It was to this effect: PROFESSOR HENDERSON, THE CELEBRATED MAGICIAN, Will exhibit his wonderful feats of Magic and Sleight-of-Hand in the Town Hall this evening, commencing at eight o'clock. In the course of the entertainment he will amuse the audience by his wonderful exhibition of Ventriloquism, in which he is unsurpassed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tickets 25 Cents. Children under twelve, 15 cents.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such was the notice which attracted Harry's attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to the exhibition, Walton?'' asked Frank Heath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better come. It'll be worth seeing. The professor's stopping at the tavern. Come over and we may see him,'' said Frank.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry felt some curiosity to see the magician, and accompanied his companion thither.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX. THE VENTRILOQUIST.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boys went into the public room of the tavern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The magician isn't here,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush, he is here!'' said Frank, in a low voice, as the door opened, and a tall, portly man entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Professor Henderson—for it was he walked up to the bar. Then he glanced leisurely round the apartment. Finally his eyes rested on Harry and his companion. Apparently his attention was fixed by our hero, for he walked up to him, and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Young man, I would like to speak to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sir,'' said Harry, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are not otherwise occupied, will you accompany me to my room?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, sir,'' returned Harry, in fresh wonder, which, it is needless to say, was shared by Frank Heath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit down,'' said the magician; and he seated himself in a chair, waving Harry to another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you at once what I want of you. If you are not occupied, I want you to take tickets at the door of the hall tonight. Can you do it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir,'' said Harry, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems easy enough,'' said the professor; "but not every one can do it rapidly without making mistakes. Are you quick at figures?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am usually considered so,'' said our hero. "I always liked arithmetic.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't ask you whether you are honest, for you would say so, of course. I judge from your face, which is an honest one. I have traveled a good deal, and I am a good judge of faces, I flatter myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You shall not be disappointed, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know that, in advance. Now, tell me if you are at work, or do you attend school?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been at work in a shoeshop in this village, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll take you in my employ if you have no objection to travel.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Objection to travel. Who ever heard of a boy of fifteen who had an objection to travel?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But will your parents consent? That is the next question.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father consented to have me leave home, as there was nothing to do there, and he will have no objection to my earning my living in any honest way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my young friend, I can assure you that my way is an honest one, though I frankly confess I do my best to deceive the people who come to my entertainments.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it you want me to do, sir?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Partly what you are going to do to-night—take tickets at the door; but that is not all. I have to carry about considerable apparatus, and I need help about arranging it. Sometimes, also, I need help in my experiments.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think I am old enough, sir?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old are you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifteen.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry's fifteenth birthday had recently passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no doubt you will answer my purpose. There is nothing very hard to do.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much pay do you give, sir?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A practical question,'' said the professor, smiling. "To begin with, of course I pay traveling expenses, and I can offer you five dollars a week besides. Will that be satisfactory?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir,'' said Harry, his heart giving a great throb of exultation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you get ready to start with me to-morrow morning?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it is settled. Be here at ten o'clock. But it is time you were at the hall. I will give you a supply of small bills and change, as you may have to change some bills.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This wallet contains twenty dollars,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you will bring me back that amount, in addition to what you take at the door this evening.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Frank Heath and his companion went over to the Town Hall they found Harry busily engaged in making change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, Walton!'' said Frank. "Are you treasurer of this concern?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems so,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll let in your friends for nothing, won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much,'' said Harry. "I charge them double price.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, here's your money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry was kept busy till ten minutes after eight. By that time about all who intended to be present were in the hall, and the magician was gratified by seeing that it was crowded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ladies and gentlemen,'' he began, "let me thank you before I commence for your large attendance this evening. I assure you, apart from its effect upon my purse, I am truly gratified to find my efforts to amuse you so kindly welcomed. Without further preface, I will proceed to the business of the evening.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX. HARRY'S LETTER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">During Harry's absence, the little household at Granton had got along about as usual. They lived, as it were, from hand to mouth, never having a dollar to spare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one neighbor who watched their progress sharply, and this was Squire Green. It will be remembered that he had bound Mr. Walton to for feit ten dollars, if, at the end of six months, he was not prepared to pay the forty dollars and interest which he had agreed to pay for the cow. As a bonus of three dollars had already been paid, this would give him thirteen dollars for the use of the cow for six months, which, considering the value of the animal, was exorbitant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One morning Squire Green accosted Mr. Walton as he was passing his house, the squire being at work in his own front yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How is that cow a-doin'?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty well.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's a good cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not so good as the one I lost.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're jokin', now, neighbor. It was my best cow. I wouldn't have sold her except to obleege. Le' me see, how long is it since I sold her to ye?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though the squire apparently asked for information, he knew the time, to a day, and was not very likely to forget when it expired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's between four and five months, I believe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd better be a-savin' up for it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There isn't much chance of my saving. It's all I can do to make both ends meet.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you work out, don't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I get a chance. You don't want any help, do you, squire? I might work off part of the debt that way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't want nothin' done now. Mebbe next spring I'd like some help. What do you hear from that boy of yours? Is he doin' well?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's at work in a shoeshop.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'd better have gone to work for me,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I think he will do better away from home. He will get a good trade that he can fall back upon hereafter, even if he follows some other business.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wal, I never learned no trade, but I've got along middlin' well,'' said the squire, in a complacent tone. "Farmin's good enough for me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I must be going on to the store. Good-morning.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-mornin'.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He evidently intends to keep me to my agreement, and will exact the ten dollars in case I can't pay for the cow at the appointed time. I hope Harry will succeed better in life than I have. I'm not without things to be thankful for; but it's hard to be so pinched for money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This was not the day for a letter from Harry, but it occurred to Mr. Walton to call at the post office. Contrary to his anticipations, a letter was handed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't open it till I get home,'' he said to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got a letter from Harry,'' he said, as he entered the house. "I haven't opened the letter yet. Here, Tom, open and read it aloud.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom opened the letter and read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear Father:—I must tell you, to begin with, that I have been compelled to stop work in the shoeshop. The market is overstocked, and so the trade has become very dull.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, I felt quite bad when Mr. Leavitt told me this, for I feared it would prevent my helping you pay for the cow, as I want so much to do. I went round to several other shops, hoping to get in elsewhere; but I found it impossible. Still, I have succeeded in getting something to do that will pay me better than work in the shop. You will be surprised when you find out what it is. So, to relieve your suspense, I will tell you that I have engaged as assistant to Professor Henderson, the famous magician and ventriloquist, and am to start to-morrow morning on a traveling tour with him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Assistant to a magician!'' exclaimed Mrs. Walton. "Well, of all things! What does the boy know about magic?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom proceeded: "I am to take money at the door in the different places where the professor gives his entertainments. Besides, I am to help him arrange his apparatus, and so on. You know I've never been round any, and I shall like traveling and seeing new places. Professor Henderson is very kind, and I think I shall like him. He pays my traveling expenses and five dollars a week, which is nearly twice as much money as I got from Mr. Leavitt. I hope, yet, to be able to pay for the cow when the money comes due. Love to all at home. HARRY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"P. S.—You may direct your next letter to me at Concord, as we shall be there in a few days. I will write as often as I get a chance, and let you know how I am getting along.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is fortunate to find employment at once,'' said his father; "though, of course, something which he can follow steadily is better. But the pay is good, and I am glad he has got it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long it seems since Harry was at home,'' said his mother. "I wish I could see him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom reported to his boy companions that Harry was traveling with a magician, and so excited their envy and admiration.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI. A STRANGE COMPANION.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At ten o'clock the next day Harry presented himself at the hotel. He carried in his hand a carpetbag lent him by Mr. Leavitt, which contained his small stock of under-clothing. His outside suits he left at Mr. Leavitt's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see you are on time,'' said the professor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir; I always mean to be.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's well; now if you'll jump into my buggy with me, we will ride round to the Town Hall, and take in my apparatus. I have to keep a carriage,'' said the magician, as they rode along. "As a general thing, the places at which I give entertainments are near together, and my horse answers my purpose.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They drew up in front of the Town Hall, and in a short time the apparatus was transferred to a trunk in the back part of the buggy, and securely locked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you like to drive?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir,'' answered Harry, with alacrity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to give an entertainment in Holston this evening,'' said his new employer. "Were you ever there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a smart little place, and, although the population is not large, I always draw a full house.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His companion leaned back at his ease, and talked socially on various subjects. He paused a moment, and Harry was startled by hearing a stifled child's voice just behind him: "Oh, let me out! Don't keep me locked up here!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The reins nearly fell from his hands. He turned, and heard the voice apparently proceeding from the trunk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The truth flashed upon Harry. His companion was exerting some of his powers as a ventriloquist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it is you, sir,'' he said, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His companion smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are right,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how you can do it,'' said Harry, in admiration. "It was perfectly natural.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Practice, my boy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A week later, Harry reached a brisk manufacturing place which I will call Centreville. In company with his employer he drove over from a neighboring town, and, according to custom, put up at the village hotel. He assisted the professor during the afternoon to get ready the hall for his evening performance, and, at half-past five, took his seat at the supper table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just as Harry began to eat he lifted his eyes and started in surprise as he recognized, in his opposite neighbor, Luke Harrison. Precisely at the same moment, Luke also looked up, and the recognition was mutual. Luke was disagreeably startled at Harry's sudden appearance. Not knowing his connection with Professor Henderson, he fancied that our hero was in quest of him, and not being skilled in the law, felt a little apprehension as to what course he might take.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, Walton?'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am well,'' said Harry, coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you happen to be in this neighborhood?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On business,'' said Harry, briefly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke jumped to the conclusion that the business related to him, and, conscious of wrong-doing, felt disturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You left us rather suddenly,'' said Harry. "No one knew where you had gone.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes,'' said Luke, hesitating. "I had reasons. I'll tell you about it after supper.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Harry rose from the table Luke rose, also, and joined him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come upstairs to my room, Walton,'' he said, "and have a cigar.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll go upstairs with you, but I don't smoke.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led the way into a small apartment on the top floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is my den,'' he said. "There isn't but one chair; but I'll sit on the bed. When did you reach town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About noon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you going to stop long?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall stay here till I get through with my errand,'' answered Harry, shrewdly; for he saw what Luke thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Luke looked a little uneasy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the way, Walton,'' he said, "I believe I owe you a little money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I believe so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here are five dollars,'' he said; "I'll pay you the rest as soon as I can—in a week or two.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry took the bank note with secret self-con gratulation, for he had given up the debt as bad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad to get it,'' he said. "I have a use for all my money. Are you working in this town?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. The shoe business is carried on here considerably. Are you still working for Mr. Leavitt?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I have left him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you doing?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm traveling with Professor Henderson.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, the magician?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And is that what brought you to Centreville?'' asked Luke, quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought,'' answered Luke, evasively, "that you might be looking for work in some of the shoeshops here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is there any chance, do you think?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't think there is,'' said Luke, hastily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I shall probably stay with the professor for the present.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you do?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take tickets at the door and help him before-hand with his apparatus.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll let me in free, to-night, won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That isn't for me to decide. It isn't my entertainment.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a fool I was to pay him that five dollars!'' thought Luke, regretfully. "If I hadn't been such a simpleton, I should have found out what brought him here, before throwing away nearly all I had.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This was the view Luke took of paying his debts. He regarded it as money thrown away. Apparently, a good many young men are of a similar opinion. This was not, however, according to Harry's code, and was never likely to be. He believed in honesty and integrity. If he hadn't I should feel far less confidence in his ultimate success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think I must leave you,'' said Harry, rising.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The professor may need me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does it pay as much as Leavitt did?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rather more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't mind trying it myself. Do you handle all the money?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I take the money at the door.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you might keep back a dollar or so every night, and he'd never know the difference.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. I never thought about that,'' said Harry, dryly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I remember, you're one of the pious boys,'' sneered Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm too pious to take money that doesn't belong to me, if that's what you mean,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean that for me?'' Luke demanded, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mean what for you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That about keeping other people's money,'' blustered Luke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wasn't talking about you at all. I was talking about myself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe in people that set themselves up to be so much better than anybody else.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean that for me?'' asked Harry, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I do. What are you going to do about it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing,'' said Harry, quietly, "except to deny that I make any such claims. Shall you come around to the hall to-night?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I shall see you. I must be going now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He went out, leaving Luke vainly deploring the loss of the five dollars which he had so foolishly squandered in paying his debt.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII. IN THE PRINTING OFFICE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry,'' said the professor after breakfast the next morning, "I find we must get some more bills printed. You may go around to the office of the Centreville Gazette and ask them how soon they can print me a hundred large bills and a thousand small ones.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sir. Suppose they can't have them done by the time we are ready to start?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They can send them to me by express to the next place.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry was rather glad to do this errand. He had never been into a printing office; but he had a great curiosity to do so ever since he had read the "Life of Benjamin Franklin.'' If there was any one in whose steps he thought he should like to follow it was Franklin, and Franklin was a printer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had no difficulty in finding the office. It was in the second story of a building just at the junction of two roads near the center of the town. He ascended a staircase and saw on the door, at the head of the stairs:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"CENTREVILLE GAZETTE.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the door and entered. He saw a large room, containing a press at one end, while two young men, with paper caps on their heads, were standing in their shirt sleeves at upright cases, setting type. On one side there was a very small office partitioned off. Within, a man was seen seated at a desk, with a pile of exchange papers on the floor, writing busily. This was Mr. Jotham Anderson, publisher and editor of the Gazette , and foreman of the printing office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to get some printing done,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For yourself?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; for Professor Henderson.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've done jobs for him before. What does he want?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero explained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; we will do it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you have it done before two o'clock?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Impossible. I am just bringing out my paper. It is published to-morrow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When can you have the job finished?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow noon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that will do. We perform to-morrow at Berlin, and they can be sent over to the hotel there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You say `we,' '' commented the editor, slightly smiling. "Are you and Professor Henderson business partners?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly,'' answered Harry, amused, "I take tickets and assist him generally.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you like the business?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; but I should like your business better.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What makes you think so?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have been reading the `Life of Benjamin Franklin.' He was a printer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's true; but I'm sorry to say Franklins are scarce in our printing offices. I never met one yet.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't expect to turn out a Franklin; but I think one couldn't help being improved by following the business.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did you do before; or was that your first situation?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was pegger in a shoeshop.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you like that?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well enough; but I don't think I should like to be a shoemaker all my life. It doesn't give any chance to learn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you like learning?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. `Live and Learn'—that is my motto.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is a very good one. Do you ever mean to be a printer?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I get a chance.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may come into my office on the first of April, if you like. One of my men will leave me by the first of May. If you are a smart boy and really wish to learn the business, you can break in so as to be useful in four weeks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like that,'' said Harry; "but,'' he added, with hesitation, "I am poor, and could not afford to work for nothing while I was learning.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you what I'll do, then,'' said the editor</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll give you your board for the first month, on condition that you'll work for six months afterward for two dollars a week and board. That's a fair offer. I wouldn't make it if I didn't feel assured that you were smart, and would in time be valuable to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry stopped to consider.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll come,'' said he, at length; "that is, if my father does not object.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite right. I should not like to have you act contrary to his wishes. I suppose, for the present, you will remain with Professor Henderson.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well. Let me hear from you when you have communicated with your father.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry left the office plunged in thought. It came upon him with surprise, that he had engaged himself to learn a new business, and that the one which he had longed to follow ever since he had become acquainted with Franklin's life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he returned to the hotel he told the professor what he had done.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am glad you are not going at once,'' said his employer, "for I should be sorry to lose you. I generally give up traveling for the season about the first of April, so that I shall then be ready to release you. I commend your choice of a trade. Many of our best editors have been practical printers in their youth.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to be an editor, but I don't know enough.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at present, but you can qualify yourself to become one—that is, if you devote your spare time to reading and studying.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean to do that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you will have a fair chance of becoming what you desire. To a certain extent, a boy, or young man, holds the future in his own hands.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry wrote to his father at once in regard to the plan which he had in view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you desire to be a printer, Harry, I shall not object,'' replied his father. "I do not suppose it will ever make you rich. If you determine to win success you probably will. If you should leave your present place before the first of April, we shall be very glad to have you come home, if only for a day or two. We all miss you very much—your mother, particularly. Tom doesn't say much about it, but I know he will be as glad to see you as the rest of us.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry read this letter with great pleasure, partly because it brought him permission to do as he desired, and partly because it was gratifying to him to feel that he was missed at home.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII. THE YOUNG TREASURER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the morning after receiving the letter from his father, Harry came down to breakfast, but looked in vain for the professor. When he had nearly finished eating, a boy employed about the hotel came to his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That gentleman you're with is sick. He wants you to come to his room as soon as you are through breakfast.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry did not wait to finish, but at once went up to his employer's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you sick, sir?'' he inquired, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The professor's face was flushed, and he was tossing about in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes,'' he answered. "I am afraid I am threatened with a fever.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am subject to fevers; but I hoped I might not have another for some time to come.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can I do for you, sir?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to have you go for the doctor. Inquire of the landlord who is the best in the village.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will go at once.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On inquiry our hero was informed that Dr. Parker was the most trusted physician in the neighborhood, and he proceeded to his house at once. The doctor was, fortunately, still at home, and answered the summons immediately. He felt the sick man's pulse, and asked him a variety of questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think I shall be long sick?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is uncertain. I suppose you will be likely to be detained here a fortnight, at least.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish I could go home.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would not be safe for you to travel, under present circumstances.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I were at home I could be under my wife's care.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't she come here?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She has three young children. It would be difficult for her to leave them.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is the boy that called at my house?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry Walton. He is my assistant—takes money at the door and helps me in other ways.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he trustworthy?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have always found him so.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why can't he attend upon you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mean to retain him with me that is, if he will stay. It will be dull work for a boy of his age.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can obtain a nurse, besides, if needful.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had better engage one for me, as I cannot confine him here all the time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will do so. I know of one, skillful, experienced, who is just now at leisure. I will send her round here this morning.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is her name?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a very romantic one Betsy Chase.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose that doesn't prevent her being a good nurse,'' said the professor, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here Harry entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry,'' said the professor, "the doctor tells me I am going to be sick.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very sorry, sir,'' said our hero, with an air of concern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall probably be detained here at least a fort-night. Are you willing to remain with me?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, sir. I should not think of leaving you, sick and alone, if you desired me to stay. I hope I can make myself useful to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can. I shall need you to do errands for me, and to sit with me a part of the time.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A nurse will be here this afternoon,'' said the doctor. "Until she comes you will be in attendance here.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will direct you what to do and how often to administer the medicines. Can you remember?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir; I shall not forget.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the doctor was gone Professor Henderson said: "As soon as the nurse comes I shall want you to ride over to the next town, Carmansville, and countermand the notices for an exhibition to-night. I shall not be able to give entertainments for some time to come. Indeed, I am not sure but I must wait till next season.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How shall I go over?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may get a horse and buggy at the stable and drive over there. The road is a little winding, but I think you won't lose your way.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'll find it,'' said Harry, confidently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not till three o'clock that the nurse made her appearance, and it was half-past three before Harry started on his way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You need not hurry home,'' said the professor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In fact, you had better take supper at the hotel in Carmansville.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry left the room, and was soon on his way to Carmansville. Once he got off the road, which was rather a perplexing one, but he soon found it again. However, it was half-past five before he reached the village, and nearly an hour later before he had done the errand which brought him over. Finally, he came back to the tavern, and, being by this time hungry, went in at once to supper. He did full justice to the meal which was set before him. The day was cold, and his cold ride had stimulated his appetite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he sat down to the table he was alone; but a minute afterward a small, dark-complexioned man, with heavy black whiskers, came in, and sat down beside him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a pretty cold day,'' he remarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very cold,'' said Harry. "I am dreading my ride back to Pentland.;'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you live over there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I am there for a short time only,'' Harry replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am in the employ of Professor Henderson, the ventriloquist.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Professor Henderson! Why, he is going to give an entertainment here to-night, isn't he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was; but I have come over to countermand the notice.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is that for?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is taken sick at Pentland, and won't be able to come.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's it. Well, I'm sorry, for I should like to have gone to hear him. So you are his assistant, are you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I take money at the door, and help him with his apparatus.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you been with him long?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only a few weeks.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you are his treasurer, are you?'' asked the stranger, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ye-es,'' said Harry, slowly, for it brought to his mind that he had one hundred-and fifty dollars of the professor's money in his pocket, besides the pocketbook containing his own. He intended to have left it with his employer, but in the hurry of leaving he had forgotten to do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"However,'' he said, reassuring himself, "there is nothing to be afraid of. Country people are not robbers. Burglars stay in the cities. I have nothing to fear.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rose from the table, followed by the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well,'' said the latter, "I must be going. How soon do you start?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In a few minutes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He seems inclined to be social,'' thought Harry,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"but I don't fancy him much.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV. "HELD UP.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry was soon on his way home. It was already getting dark, and he felt a little anxious lest he should lose his way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He had gone about two miles, when he came to a place where two roads met. There was no guide-board, and he could not remember by which he had come. Luckily, as he thought, he descried a man a little ahead. He stopped the horse and hailed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you tell me which road to take to Pentland?'' he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man addressed turned his head, and, to his surprise, our hero, recognized his table companion at the inn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it's you, my young friend!'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. Can you tell me the right road to Pentland? I have never been this way before today, and I have forgotten how I came.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm thinking of going to Pentland myself,'' said the other. "My sister lives there. If you don't mind giving me a lift, I will jump in with you, and guide you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jump in, sir,'' he said. "There is plenty of room.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stranger was speedily seated at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take the left-hand road,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry turned to the left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's rather a blind road,'' observed the stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't remember this road,'' said Harry, anxiously. "Are you sure we are right?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes, we are right. Don't trouble yourself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The road didn't seem so lonely when I came over it this afternoon.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's the effect of sunshine. Nothing seems lonely in the daytime. Turn down that lane.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?'' asked Harry, in surprise. "That can't be the road to Pentland.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind that. Turn, I tell you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His companion spoke fiercely, and Harry's mind began to conceive alarming suspicions as to his character. But he was brave, and not easily daunted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The horse and carriage are mine, or, at least, are under my direction,'' he said, firmly, "and you have no control over them. I shall not turn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you?'' retorted the stranger, with an oath, and drew from his pocket a pistol. "Won't you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will not,'' said Harry, pale, but determined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I will save you the trouble,'' and his companion snatched the reins from him, and turned the horse himself. Resistance was, of course, useless, and our hero was compelled to submit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Produce your pocketbook.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry had two pocketbooks. The one contained his own money—about forty dollars the other the money of his employer. The first was in the side pocket of his coat, the second in the pocket of his pants. The latter, as was stated in the preceding chapter, contained one hundred and fifty dollars. Harry heartily repented not having left it behind, but it was too late for repentance. He could only hope that the robber would be satisfied with one pocketbook, and not suspect the existence of the other. There seemed but little hope of saving his own money. However, he detrmined{sic} to do it, if possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurry up,'' said the stranger, impatiently. "You needn't pretend you have no money. I know better than that. I saw you pay the landlord.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then he saw the professor's pocketbook,'' thought Harry, uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you will leave me some of the money,'' said Harry, producing the pocketbook. "It is all I have.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much is there?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About forty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! that isn't much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't you leave me five dollars?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I can't. Forty dollars are little enough to serve my turn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So saying, he coolly deposited the pocketbook in the pocket of his pants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you let me go now, sir?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have not got through my business yet. That's a nice overcoat of yours.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am a small person,'' proceeded the man with black whiskers, "scarcely any larger than you. I think it'll be a good fit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've got an overcoat of your own, sir,'' he said. "You don't need mine.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I wouldn't rob you of yours, on any account. A fair exchange is no robbery. I am going to give mine in exchange for yours.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stranger's coat was rough and well worn, and, at its best, had been inferior to Harry's coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think you might be satisfied with the pocketbook,'' he said. "I hope you will leave me my coat.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Off with the coat, youngster!'' was the sole reply. "First get out of the buggy. We can make the exchange better outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As opposition would be unavailing, Harry obeyed. The robber took from him the handsome overcoat, the possession of which had afforded him so much satisfaction, and handed him his own</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fit you as if it was made for you,'' said the stranger, with a short laugh. "Yours is a trifle slow for me, but I can make it go. No, don't be in such a hurry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized Harry by the arm as he was about to jump into the carriage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He produced a ball of cord from a pocket of his inside coat, and with a knife severed a portion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know what this is for?'' he asked, jeeringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say `No, sir.' It's more respectful. Well, I'll gratify your laudable curiosity. It's to tie your hands and feet.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't submit to it,'' said Harry, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you?'' asked the other, coolly. "This is a very pretty pistol, isn't it? I hope I shan't have to use it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want to tie my hands for?'' asked Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For obvious reasons, my young friend.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't drive if my hands are tied.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Correct, my son. I don't intend you to drive tonight. Give me your hands.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry considered whether it would be advisable to resist. The stranger was not much larger than himself. He was a man, however, and naturally stronger. Besides, he had a pistol. He decided that it was necessary to submit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now,'' said the stranger, setting him up against the stone wall, which bordered the lane, "I will bid you good-night. I might take your horse, but, on the whole, I don't want it. I will fasten it to this tree, where it will be all ready for you in the morning. That's considerate in me. Good-night. I hope you are comfortable.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He disappeared in the darkness, and Harry was left alone.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV. THE GOOD SAMARITAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry's reflections, as he lay on the ground, were not the most cheerful. He was sitting in a constrained posture, his hands and feet being tied, and, moreover, the cold air chilled him. The cold was not intense, but as he was unable to move his limbs he, of course, felt it the more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horse evidently began to feel impatient, for he turned round and looked at our hero, as much as to say, "Why are we stopping here? Why don't you keep on?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish somebody would come this way,'' thought Harry, and he looked up and down the lane as well as he could, but could see no one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The horse whinnied again, and again looked inquiringly at his young driver, but the latter was not master of the situation, and was obliged to disregard the mute appeal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder the robber didn't carry off the horse,'' thought Harry. "I suppose he had his reasons. It isn't likely he left it out of regard for me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two hours passed, and Harry still found himself a prisoner. No person had passed, nor had he heard any sound as he lay there, except the occasional whinny of the horse, which was tied as well as himself, and did not appear to enjoy his confinement any better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was at this moment that Harry's heart leaped with sudden hope, as he heard in the distance the sound of a whistle. It might be a boy, or it might be a man; but, as he listened intently, he perceived that it was coming nearer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope I can make him hear,'' thought Harry, earnestly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a boy of about his own age, who was advancing along the road from which he had turned into the lane. The boy was not alone, as it appeared, for a large dog ran before him. The dog first noticed the horse and buggy, and next our hero, lying on the ground, and, concluding that something was wrong, began to bark violently, circling uncomfortably near Harry, against whom he seemed to cherish hostile designs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter, Cæsar?'' shouted his young master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was another volley of barks, which seemed liked to be followed by an attack. Just at this moment, however, luckily for our hero, the dog's master came up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Cæsar,'' he called, "what is the matter with you?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please take your dog away;'' said Harry. "I am afraid he will bite me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are you?'' inquired the boy, in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come and untie these cords, and I will tell you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! are you tied?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, hand and foot.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who did it?'' asked the boy, in increasing surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know his name, but he robbed me of my pocketbook before doing it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, a robber around here!'' exclaimed the boy, incredulous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I met him first over in Carmansville. Thank you; now my feet, if you please. It seems good to be free again''; and Harry swung his arms, and jumped up and down to bring back the sense of warmth to his chilled limbs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much money did he take from you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's a good deal,'' said the country boy. "Was it yours?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never had so much money in my life.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It has taken me almost six months to earn it. But I had more money with me, only he didn't know it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A hundred and fifty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was it yours?'' asked the boy, surprised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; it belonged to my employer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Professor Henderson, the ventriloquist.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is he stopping?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over at Pentland. He is sick at the hotel there.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's lucky for you I was out to-night. I ain't often out so late, but I went to see a friend of mine, and stayed later than I meant to. Come home with me. The folks will take you in, and the horse can be put up in the barn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose they will feel anxious about me over at Pentland. They won't know what has become of me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can start early in the morning—as early as you like.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps it will be better,'' said Harry, after a pause. "It won't trouble your family too much, will it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit,'' answered the boy, heartily. "Very likely they won't know till morning,'' he added, laughing. "They go to bed early, and I told them they needn't wait up for me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very much obliged to you,'' said Harry. "I will accept your kind invitation. As I've got a horse, we may as well ride. I'll untie him, and you jump into the buggy.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right,'' said the boy, well pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may drive, for you know the way better than I.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did this horse come from?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"From the stable in Pentland.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps they will think you have run away with it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is your name?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry Walton. What is yours?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jefferson Selden. The boys usually call me Jeff.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is that your dog?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yea. He's a fine fellow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't think so when he was threatening to bite me,'' said Harry, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I used to be afraid of dogs,'' said Jeff; "but I got cured of it after a while. When I go out at night, I generally take Cæsar with me. If you had had him, you would have been a match for the robber.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had a pistol.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cæsar would have had him down before he could use it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish he had been with me, then.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had, by this time come in sight of Jeff's house. It was a square farmhouse, with a barn in the rear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll go right out to the barn,'' said Jeff, "and put up the horse. Then we'll come back to the house and go to bed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He entered by the back shed door, and Harry followed him. They went into the broad, low kitchen, with its ample fireplace, in which a few embers were glowing. By these Jeff lighted a candle, and asked Harry if he would have anything to eat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, thank you,'' said Harry. "I ate a hearty supper at Carmansville.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then we'll go upstairs to bed. I sleep in a small room over the shed. You won't mind sleeping with me?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like your company,'' said Harry, who was attracted to his good-natured companion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then come up. I guess we'll find the bed wide enough.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led the way up a narrow staircase, into a room low studded, and very plainly, but comfortably, furnished.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The folks will be surprised to see you here in the morning,'' said Jeff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I may be gone before they are up.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess not. Father'll be up by five o'clock, and I think that'll be as early as you'll want to be stirring.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI. THE REWARD OF FIDELITY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where am I?'' asked Harry, the next morning, as he sat up in bed, and stared around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you remember?'' asked Jeff, smiling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I remember now,'' said Harry, slowly. "What time is it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven o'clock.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven o'clock! I meant to be dressed at six.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is the time I got up,'' said Jeff. "You looked so comfortable that I thought it was a pity to wake you. You must have felt tired.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it was the cold that made me sleepy. I got chilled through when I lay on the ground there, tied hand and foot. But I must get up in a hurry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now,'' said Jeff, "come down into the kitchen, and mother'll give you some breakfast. I've been up an hour, and feel as hungry as a wolf. So come down, and we'll see who'll eat the most.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can do my part,'' said Harry. "I've got a good appetite, though I've been up a good deal less than an hour.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take your overcoat along,'' said Jeff; "or will you come up and get it after breakfast?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll take it down with me. It isn't my coat, you know. Mine was a much better one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jeff meanwhile had taken up the coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's something in the pocket,'' he said. "What is it?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry thrust his hand into the side pocket for the first time, and drew out a shabby leather wallet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hastily opened it, and his eyes opened wide with astonishment as he drew out a thick roll of bills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By hokey!'' said Jeff, "you're in luck. The robber took your pocketbook, and left his own.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Three—eight—eleven—thirteen—eighteen —twenty,'' Harry counted aloud. He continued his count, which resulted in showing that the wallet contained ninety-seven dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ninety-seven dollars!'' exclaimed Jeff. "How much did you lose?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forty dollars.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you've made just fifty-seven dollars. Bully for you!''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I've exchanged a good overcoat for a poor one.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There can't be more than seventeen dollars difference.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not so much.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you're forty dollars better off, at any rate.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I don't know as I can claim this money,'' said Harry, doubtfully. "It isn't mine. I will ask Professor Henderson about that. At any rate, I've got my money back, that's one good thing.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This timely discovery made Harry decidedly cheerful, and, if anything, sharpened his appetite for breakfast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall take care how I carry much money about with me, after this,'' said Harry. "That was what got me into a scrape yesterday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wouldn't make out much if he tried to rob me,'' said Jeff. "I haven't got enough money about me to pay the board of a full-grown fly for twenty-four hours.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't look as if your poverty troubled you much,'' said his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't have any board bills to pay,'' said Jeff, "so I can get along.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think you would feel nervous about riding to Pentland alone,'' said Mrs. Selden, "for fear of meeting the man who robbed you yesterday.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do dread it a little,'' said Harry, "having so much money about me. Besides this ninety-seven dollars, I've got a hundred and fifty dollars belonging to my employer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose I go with you to protect you,'' said Jeff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish you would.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you would like to ride over with your friend, you may do so,'' said his mother. "But how will you get back?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Major Pinkham will be up there this afternoon. I can wait, and ride home with him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; I have no objection.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two boys rode off together. Harry was glad to have a companion who knew the road well, for he did not care to be lost again till he had delivered up the money which he had in charge. There was no opportunity to test Jeff's courage, for the highwayman did not make his appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Harry arrived at Pentland, he found that no little anxiety had been felt about him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has Harry come yet?'' asked the sick man, at ten o'clock the evening previous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, he hasn't,'' answered the nurse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's strange what keeps him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he have any money of yours with him?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I believe: he had.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much did he have?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't say exactly. Over a hundred dollars, I believe.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then he won't come back,'' said Mrs. Chase, decidedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the conference closed, as it was necessary for Mr. Henderson to take medicine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has the boy returned?'' asked the professor, the next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't expect him, do you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly I expect him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he ain't come, and I guess he won't come.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sure that boy is honest,'' said Professor Henderson to himself. "If he isn't, I'll never trust a boy again.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Chase was going downstairs with her patient's breakfast dishes, when she was nearly run into by our hero, who had just returned, and was eager to report to his employer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Chase was so curious that she returned, with the dishes, to hear Harry's statement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-morning,'' said Harry, entering the chamber. "I'm sorry to have been so long away, but I couldn't help it. I hope you haven't worried much about my absence.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knew you would come back, but Mrs. Chase had her doubts,'' said Professor Henderson, pleasantly. "Now tell me what was it that detained you?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A highwayman,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A highwayman!'' exclaimed both, in concert.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I'll tell you all about it. But, first, I'll say that he only stole my money, and didn't suspect that I had a hundred and fifty dollars of yours with me. That's all safe. Here it is. I think you had better take care of that yourself, sir, hereafter.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The professor glanced significantly at Mrs. Chase, as much as to say, "You see how unjust your suspicions were. I am right, after all.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell us all about it, Harry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our hero obeyed instructions; but it is not necessary to repeat a familiar tale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Massy sakes!'' ejaculated Betsy Chase. "Who ever heered the like?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I congratulate you, Harry, on coming of with such flying colors. I will, at my own expense, provide you with a new overcoat, as a reward for bringing home my money safe. You shall not lose anything by your fidelity.''</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII. IN DIFFICULTY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We must now transfer the scene to the Walton homestead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It looked very much the same as on the day when the reader was first introduced to it. Poverty reigns with undisputed sway. Mr. Walton is reading a borrowed newspaper by the light of a candle for it is evening—while Mrs. Walton is engaged in her never-ending task of mending old clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems strange we don't hear from Harry,'' said Mrs. Walton, looking up from her work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When was the last letter received?'' asked Mr. Walton, laying down the paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over a week ago. He wrote that the professor was sick, and he was stopping at the hotel to take care of him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps his employer is recovered, and he is going about with him.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps so; but I should think he would write. I am afraid he is sick himself. He may have caught the same fever.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is possible; but I think Harry would let us know in some way. At any rate, it isn't best to worry ourselves about uncertainties.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if Harry's grown?'' said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course he's grown,'' said Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if he's grown as much as I have?'' said Tom, complacently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe you've grown a bit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I have; if you don't believe it, see how short my pants are.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ought to have some new pants,'' said his mother, sighing; "but I don't see where the money is to come from.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nor I,'' said Mr. Walton, soberly. "Somehow I don't seem to get ahead at all. To-morrow my note for the cow comes due; and I haven't but two dollars to meet it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How large is the note?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With six months' interest, it amounts to forty-one dollars and twenty cents.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You say you won't be able to meet the payment. What will be the consequence?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose Squire Green will take back the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps you can get another somewhere else, on better terms.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid my credit won't be very good. I agreed to forfeit ten dollars to Squire Green if I couldn't pay at the end of six months.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will he insist on that condition?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid he will. He is a hard man.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then,'' said Mrs. Walton, indignantly, "he deserve to prosper.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wordly{sic} prosperity doesn't always go by merit. Plenty of mean men prosper.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before Mrs. Walton had time to reply, a knock was heard at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go to the door, Tom,'' said his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom obeyed, and shortly reappeared, followed by a small man with a thin figure and wrinkled face, those deep-set, craw eyes peered about him curiously as he entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evening, Squire Green,'' said Mr. Walton, politely, guessing his errand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-evenin', Mrs. Walton. The air's kinder frosty. I ain't so young as I was once, and it chills my blood.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man sat down and spread his hands before the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was lookin' over my papers to-night, neighbor, and I come across that note you give for the cow. Forty dollars with interest, which makes the whole come to forty-one dollars and twenty cents. To-morrow's the day for payin'. I suppose you'll be ready?'' and the old man peered at Hiram Walton with his little keen eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now for it,'' thought Hiram. 'I'm sorry to say, Squire Green,'' he answered, "that I can't pay the note. Times have been hard, and my family expenses have taken all I could earn.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The squire was not much disappointed, for now he was entitled to exact the forfeit of ten dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The contrack provides that if you can't meet the note you shall pay ten dollars,'' he said. "I s'pose you can do that.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Squire Green, I haven't got but two dollars laid by.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two dollars!'' repeated the squire, frowning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That ain't honest. You knew the note was comin' due, and you'd oughter have provided ten dollars, at least.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've done as much as I could. I've wanted to meet the note, but I couldn't make money, and I earned all I could.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You ain't been equinomical,'' said the squire, testily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should like to have you tell us how we can economize any more than we have,'' said Mrs. Walton, with spirit. "Just look around you, and see if you think we have been extravagant in buying clothes. I am sure I have to darn and mend till I am actually ashamed.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" 'Tain't none of my business, as long as you pay me what you owe me,'' said the squire. "All I want is my money, and I'd orter have it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It doesn't seem right that my husband should forfeit ten dollars and lose the cow.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was the contrack, Mrs. Walton. Your husband agreed to it, and—''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That doesn't make it just.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" 'Tain't no more'n a fair price for the use of the cow for six months. Ef you'll pay the ten dollars to-morrow, I'll let you have the cow six months longer on the same contrack.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see any possibility of my paying you the money, Squire Green. I haven't got it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you borrer somewhere?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might as well owe you as another man. Besides, I don't know anybody that would lend me the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll come round to-morrow night, and I hope you'll be ready. Good-night.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No very cordial good-night followed Squire Green as he hobbled out of the cottage. He was a mean, miserly, grasping man, who had no regard for the feelings or comfort of anyone else; whose master passion was a selfish love of accumulating money. His money did him little good, however, for he was as mean with himself as with others, and grudged himself even the necessaries of life, because, if purchased, it must be at the expense of his hoards. The time must come when he and his money must part, but he did not think of that.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII. SETTLED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a general silence after Squire Green's departure. Hiram Walton looked gloomy, and the rest of the family, also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What an awful mean man the squire is!'' Tom broke out, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're right, for once,'' said Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In general, such remarks were rebuked by the father or mother; but the truth of Tom's observation was so clear, that for once he was not reproved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Squire Green's money does him very little good,'' said Hiram Walton. "Rich as he is, and poor as I am, I would rather stand in my shoes than his.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think so,'' said his wife. "Money isn't everything.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but it is a good deal. I have suffered too much from the want of it to despise it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Hiram,'' said Mrs. Walton, "you know that the song says, `There's a good time coming.' ''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've waited for it a long time, wife,'' said the farmer, soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait a little longer,'' said Mrs. Walton, quoting the refrain of the song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He smiled faintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Children, it's time to go to bed,'' said Mrs. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mayn't I sit up a little longer?'' pleaded Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" `Wait a little longer,' mother,'' said Tom laughing, as he quoted his mother's words against her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten minutes only, then.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before ten minutes were over, there was great and unexpected joy in the little house. Suddenly the outer door opened, and, without the slightest warning to any one, Harry walked in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you come from, Harry?'' asked Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dropped down from the sky,'' said Harry, laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Has the professor been giving exhibitions up there?'' asked Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've discharged the professor,'' said Harry, gayly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm my own man now.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you've come home to stay, I hope,'' said his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not long, mother,'' said Harry. "I can only stay a few days.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a bully overcoat you've got on!'' said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The professor gave it to me.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hasn't he got one for me, too?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry took off his overcoat, and Tom was struck with fresh admiration as he surveyed his brother's inside suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you spent all your money on clothes,'' he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not,'' said Mrs. Walton, whom experience had made prudent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite all,'' said Harry, cheerfully. "How much money do you think I have brought home?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten dollars,'' said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Twenty,'' said Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you say to fifty dollars?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, what a lot of money!'' said Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have done well, my son,'' said Mr. Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must have been very economical.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tried to be, father. But I didn't say fifty dollars was all I had.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't got more?'' said his mother, incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got a hundred dollars, mother,'' said Harry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here are fifty dollars for you, father. It'll pay your note to Squire Green, and a little over. Here are thirty dollars, mother, of which you must use ten for yourself, ten for Mary, and ten for Tom. I want you all to have some new clothes, to remember me by.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Harry, you will have nothing left for yourself.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I shall. I have kept twenty dollars, which will be enough till I can earn some more.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how you could save so much money, Harry,'' said his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was partly luck, father, and partly hard work. I'll tell you all about it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat down before the fire, and they listened to his narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cloud that Squire Green had brought with him had vanished, and all was sunshine and happiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was agreed that no hint should be given to Squire Green that his note was to be paid. He did not even hear of Harry's arrival, and was quite unconscious of any change in the circumstances of the family, when he entered the cottage the next evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, neighbor,'' he said, "I've brought along that 'ere note. I hope you've raised the money to pay it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you think I could raise money, squire?'' asked Hiram Walton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought mebbe some of the neighbors would lend it to you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Money isn't very plenty with any of them, squire, except with you.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I calc'late better than they. Hev you got the ten dollars that you agreed to pay ef you couldn't meet the note?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you think, squire, it's rather hard on a poor man, to make him forfeit ten dollars because he can't meet his note?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A contrack's a contrack,'' said the squire. "It's the only way to do business.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think you are taking advantage of me, squire.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I ain't. You needn't hev come to me ef you didn't want to. I didn't ask you to buy the cow. I'll trouble you for that ten dollars, neighbor, as I'm in a hurry.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On the whole, squire, I think I'll settle up the note. That'll be cheaper than paying the forfeit.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What! pay forty-one dollars and twenty cents!'' ejaculated the squire, incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; it's more than the cow's worth, but as I agreed to pay it, I suppose I must.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you didn't hev the money,'' said the squire, his lower jaw falling; for he would have preferred the ten dollars forfeit and a renewal of the usurious contract.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't have it when you were in last night; but I've raised it since.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You said you couldn't borrow it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't borrow it.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then where did it come from?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My son Harry has got home, squire. He has supplied me with the money.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say! Where is he? Been a-doin' well, has he?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry entered the room and nodded rather coldly to the squire, who was disposed to patronize him, now that he was well dressed, and appeared to be doing well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad to see ye, Harry. So you've made money, hev ye?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hev you come home to stay?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; I shall only stay a few days.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What hev ye been doin'?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am going to be a printer.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't say! Is it a good business?''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it will be,'' said Harry. "I can tell better by and by.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm glad you're doin' so well. Neighbor Walton, when you want another cow I'll do as well by you as anybody. I'll give you credit for another on the same terms.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I conclude to buy any, squire, I may come round.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, good-night, all. Harry, you must come round and see me before you go back.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harry thanked him, but did not propose to accept the invitation. It was not in his nature to be hypocritical, and he expressed no pleasure at the squire's affability and politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus has been detailed a few of Harry's early experiences. He has neither lived long nor learned much as yet, nor has he risen very high in the world. In fact, he is still at the bottom of the ladder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We leave him with the hope that he may continue in the path he seems to have chosen, for it leads to Success, while we would impress on the reader that though the opposite course may appear for a time to be fruitful, it will ultimately lead to failure.</field>
