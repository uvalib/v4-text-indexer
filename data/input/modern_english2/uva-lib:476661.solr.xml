      <field name="heading_text">STEPHEN CRANE: A "WONDERFUL BOY."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE death of Mr. Stephen Crane, while yet barely thirty, is widely regarded as a serious loss to American literature, one which it can ill afford. Mr. Crane, who had for some time past resided in Surrey, England, had been critically ill for some months previous to his death and had lately been taken to Baden to obtain the benefit of the waters. His best known works are: "Maggie: A Girl of the Streets"; "The Red Badge of Courage"; "The Little Regiment"'; "The Black Riders"; "War Is Kind"; "The Open Boat"; "The Third Violet"; "George's Mother"; and "Active Service." The Late Stephen Crane. Newspaper photo. Portrait of Stephen Crane. Photographer unknown. In three somewhat widely separated lines of fiction—stories of slum-life (especially of the demi-monde), war stories, and tales about boy-life—Mr. Crane attained notable success. By many critics it is doubted whether any one has ever got nearer the spirit of the boy of today than has Stephen Crane in these latter tales, altho' his fame has been founded more upon his stories of low-life and of war. Whether his fame would ever have reached a higher level is open to doubt, and perhaps critical opinion largely leans to the judgment that his artistic attainment would never have been able to go beyond the extremely clever but impressionistic word-painting of the work already produced by him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Crane came honestly by his love of military life. One paternal grandfather was colonel of the Sixth New Jersey Infantry during the Revolution, and ranking major-general of the regular army at the time of his death; while a younger brother of this officer was ranking commodore of the navy—at that time the highest American naval rank. Mr. Crane, in a letter written to the editor of the Rochester Post-Express a few weeks ago, gives the following account of his boyhood and early journalistic career:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father was a Methodist minister, author of numerous works of theology, and an editor of various periodicals of the church. He was a graduate of Princeton, and he was a great, fine, simple mind. As for myself, I went to Lafayette College, but did not graduate. I found mining-engineering not at all to my taste. I preferred baseball. Later I attended Syracuse University, where I attempted to study literature, but found baseball again much more to my taste. My first work in fiction was for the New York Tribune , when I was about eighteen years old. During this time, one story of the series went into The Cosmopolitan . At the age of twenty I wrote my first novel—'Maggie.' It never really got on the market, but it made for me the friendship of William Dean Howells and Hamlin Garland, and since that time I have never been conscious for an instant that those friendships have at all diminished. After completing 'Maggie,' I wrote mainly for the New York Press and for The Arena . In the latter part of my twenty-first year I began 'The Red Badge of Courage,' and completed it early in my twenty-second year. The year following I wrote the poems contained in the volume known as 'The Black Riders.' On the first day of last November I was precisely twenty-nine years old and had finished my fifth novel, 'Active Service.' I have only one pride, and that is that the English edition of 'The Red Badge of Courage' has been received with great praise by the English reviewers. I am proud of this simply because the remoter people would seem more just and harder to win."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In another letter to the same gentleman Mr. Crane touches on his literary philosophy. He writes: "The one thing that deeply pleases me is the fact that men of sense invariably believe me to be sincere. I know that my work does not amount to a string of dried beans—I always calmly admit it—but I also know that I do the best that is in me without regard to praise or blame. When I was the mark for every humorist in the country, I went ahead; and now when I am the mark for only fifty per cent. of the humorists of the country, I go ahead; for I understand that a man is born into the world with his own pair of eyes, and he is not at all responsible for his vision—he is merely responsible for his quality of personal honesty. To keep close to this personal honesty is my supreme ambition. There is a sublime egotism in talking of honesty. I, however, do not say that I am honest. I merely say that I am as nearly honest as a weak mental machinery will allow. This aim in life struck me as being the only thing worth while. A man is sure to fail at it, but there is something in the failure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The New York Evening Post says: "Mr. Crane's mental attitude was that of one for whom there were to be no surprises. His confidence in himself was thorough. His belief in the excellence of his work was complete, but not often expressed; and toward the last he frequently made light of the early style in which he placed too much dependence upon adjectives of color, and in some stories of child life (commenced on board a despatch-boat in the Santiago blockade) he was trying for that finish and nicer use of language which his critics had said he lacked. Notwithstanding a kind of shyness of manner, he was always self-possessed. In the matter of social conduct, few conventions were permitted to interfere with what he felt inclined to do; and as war correspondent, on the top of the encircled hill at Guantanamo and in the field before Santiago, he showed absolute fearlessness of danger." The Rochester Democrat and Chronicle draws some interesting lessons for literary aspirants from Mr. Crane's career: "In seeking to gather from what Stephen Crane has done indications of what he might have done, had he lived, it is necessary to take into account his youth and his handicaps. He was only a boy when he began to write. He undertook 'The Red Badge of Courage' before he was twenty-one. He was little more than a boy when death stopped his writing forever. He started upon his literary career with no equipment but such literary powers as nature had given him. He had not even the technical equipment that common scholarship gives to a writer. 'The Red Badge of Courage' shows that, at the age of twenty-one, he could never be sure whether or not he was writing commonly correct English. It also shows that he then lacked literary good taste and discrimination. He had to learn as he went along. During all his literary career he seems never to have been free from the necessity of doing a great deal of hack work. For months past he had been suffering from a lingering and enervating disease. His working days were few and far from free of distractions. And yet he wrote 'The Open Boat' and 'The Monster.'"</field>
