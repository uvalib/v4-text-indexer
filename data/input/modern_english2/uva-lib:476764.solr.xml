      <field name="heading_text">BONES IN LOVE. BY J. HARRY CARLETON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. I say, Bones, were you ever in love?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. I wasn't nothin' else, old hoss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. What kind of a girl was she?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. She was highly polished; yes, indeed. Her fadder was a varnish-maker, and, what's better still, she was devoted to her own sweet Pomp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. What do you mean by that? She must have been a spicy girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, dat's de reason she was so fond of me. She was a poickess, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. A poetess, you mean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, she used to write verses for de newspapers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. Is that so, Bones?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, saw. De day I went to de house, I — golly! — I dressed myself to kill, and my ole trunk was empty. Well, just as de gal seed me, she cove right in — she was a gone coon. When I left, she edged up to me and whispered, "you're too sweet to live." Next day I got a billy-doo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. How do you know it was a billet-doux?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. 'Cause Billy Doo was de name of de boy dat brought it. It smelt all over like a doctor's shop. I opened it, and found dese words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What lub is, if you must be taught, Thy heart must teach alone! Two cabbages wid a single stalk, Two beets that are as one!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. Well, Bones, you responded?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, sir.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. What did you say?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. You see, her fadder was a gardener, so I wrote what I call very appropriate lines:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O you sweet and lubly Dinah! Dare are nofin any finer; Your tongue is sweeter than a parrot's. Your hair hangs like a bunch of carrots, And though of flattery I'm a hater, I lubs you like a sweet potater!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. That was very nice, Bones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, I thought so. So delicate was her constitution, dat it nearly killed her. So terrible was de concussion, dat de next time I went to see her was was dissolved in tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. What! weeping?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes, wid tears in her eyes and a big knife in the other. She raised it as I approached.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. Rash girl!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. Yes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Interlocutor. What was she about to do? Commit suicide?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bones. No; she was peeling onions to stuff a goose wid!</field>
