      <field name="heading_text">What the Pug Knew BY FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHEN SHE DROPPED HER EYES WITH GENTLE SIGHS Black and white illustration of a man and woman having tea, with the porcelain pug figurine in the background</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE Pug sat up on the cabinet With his short nose in the air; He was only a pug of porcelain With goggle eyes and a stare. His legs were short with a strong incline To be bandy at the knees, But he wore the lofty air of a pug Who took the world at his ease And that Porcelain Pug on the cabinet had a look which your soul might freeze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked to neither the right nor left, That being his scornful way, But his goggle eyes were never closed Either by night or day. And what he saw, he saw, 'twas said, And what he knew, he knew, And what he might have said if he chose Might please neither me nor you, For that Porcelain Pug on the cabinet had an eye to pierce you through.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His mistress — (and he often gave A porcelain sniff at that, As on his Chinese pedestal Unflinchingly he sat) — His mistress he'd known far too long To be the least deceived By the tricks and airs and graces In which some folks believed, For he could have told — that Porcelain Pug — what their spirits might have grieved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And he knew stern duty called on him, With his bandy legs and stare, To lead her in the path of Right, And try to keep her there. Which was quite as much as any one From a porcelain pug could ask, And, if the simple truth were told, Was rather a thankless task. "Don't ogle me," said the Porcelain Pug. "I could your tricks unmask."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was neither moved by smiles nor tears, And he did not care a rush, When she dropped her eyes with gentle sighs And even got up a blush. "Let those take that who like," he said, "It doesn't work with me." Which was really disappointing, Besides being bold and free, But that Porcelain Pug on the cabinet had no sentiment — not he.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when she appeared most sweetly meek And innocent of guile, And wore a simple artless gown And a soft engaging smile, He glared with both his goggle eyes And his bandy legs outspread, And sniffed his fiercest porcelain sniff, Though never a word he said, And before that Pug on the cabinet her air ingenuous fled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For his glance insinuated that She was not so wise or fair As she would have the world believe, Which was a statement bare, And one to which she did object, Although she felt it true, And loathed that Pug on the cabinet, In that so much he knew, And what was worse, that he did insist that he knew she knew it too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And many a silent tiff they had, While he held aloft his head; "Leave me alone," said she to him. "Behave yourself," he said. And when, her best effects prepared, She tried her nicest scenes, This porcelain scorn seemed erst to say "Tell that to the Marines" — If a Porcelain Pug on a cabinet looks only what he means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"POOH, YOU'RE ONLY A PORCELAIN PUG," SHE SAID Black and white illustration of a woman looking over her shoulder at a porcelain figurine of a pug dog</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm mistress here," she would oft remark; But, his short nose in the air, The sole response he deigned to give Was his usual goggle stare. And when she strove to jeer him down And pretended she did not care That he'd found her out with her flimsy ways, And had bid the world beware, "Pooh, you're only a Porcelain Pug," she said, "with goggle eyes and a stare."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But in the midst of her flippant scoff, She'd falter 'neath his gaze, And now and then — at intervals — Resolved to mend her ways. But why she should care for a staring pug, Short-nosed, short-legged, and fat, Is a problem the solution Of which one can't get at, And as to a guilty conscience — what have pugs to do with that — Even the sharpest Porcelain Pug that e'er on a cabinet sat?</field>
