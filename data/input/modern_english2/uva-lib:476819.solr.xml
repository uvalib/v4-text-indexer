      <field name="fulltext">"WHILOMVILLE STORIES BY STEPHEN CRANE" A street lined with trees. Illustration by Edward B. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AFTER the brief encounters between the Hedge boy and Jimmie Trescott and the Hedge boy and Willie Dalzel, the neighborhood which contained the homes of the boys was, as far as child life is concerned, in a state resembling anarchy. This was owing to the signal overthrow and shameful retreat of the boy who had for several years led a certain little clan by the nose. The adherence of the little community did not go necessarily to the boy who could whip all the others, but it certainly could not go to a boy who had run away in a manner that made his shame patent to the whole world. Willie Dalzel found himself in a painful position. This tiny tribe which had followed him with such unwavering faith was now largely engaged in whistling and catcalling and hooting. He chased a number of them into the sanctity of their own yards, but from these coigns they continued to ridicule him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it must not be supposed that the fickle tribe went over in a body to the new light. They did nothing of the sort. They occupied themselves with avenging all which they had endured — gladly enough, too — for many months. As for the Hedge boy, he maintained a curious timid reserve, minding his own business with extreme care, and going to school with that deadly punctuality of which his mother was the genius. Jimmie Trescott suffered no adverse criticism from his fellows. He was entitled to be beaten by a boy who had made Willie Dalzel bellow like a bull-calf and run away. Indeed, he received some honors. He had confronted a very superior boy and received a bang in the eye which for a time was the wonder of the children, and he had not bellowed like a bull-calf. As a matter of fact, he was often invited to tell how it had felt, and this he did with some pride, claiming arrogantly that he had been superior to any particular pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WHO HURT HIM?" HE SAID, FEROCIOUSLY An angry boy with fists raised coming out of the bushes toward four boys in the left foreground. Illustration by Peter Newell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Early in the episode he and the Hedge boy had patched up a treaty. Living next door to each other, they could not fail to have each other often in sight. One afternoon they wandered together in the strange indefinite diplomacy of boyhood. As they drew close the new boy suddenly said, "Napple?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," said Jimmie, and the new boy bestowed upon him an apple. It was one of those green-coated winter-apples which lie for many months in safe and dry places, and can at any time be brought forth for the persecution of the unwary and inexperienced. An older age would have fled from this apple, but to the unguided youth of Jimmie Trescott it was a thing to be possessed and cherished. Wherefore this apple was the emblem of something more than a truce, despite the fact that it tasted like wet Indian meal; and Jimmie looked at the Hedge boy out of one good eye and one bunged eye. The long-drawn animosities of men have no place in the life of a boy. The boy's mind is flexible; he readjusts his position with an ease which is derived from the fact — simply — that he is not yet a man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But there were other and more important matters. Johnnie Hedge's exploits had brought him into such prominence among the schoolboys that it was necessary to settle a number of points once and for all. There was the usual number of boys in the school who were popularly known to be champions in their various classes. Among these Johnnie Hedge now had to thread his way, every boy taking it upon himself to feel anxious that Johnnie's exact position should be soon established. His fame as a fighter had gone forth to the world, but there were other boys who had fame as fighters, and the world was extremely anxious to know where to place the new-comer. Various heroes were urged to attempt this classification. Usually it is not accounted a matter of supreme importance, but in this boy life it was essential.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In all cases the heroes were backward enough. It was their followings who agitated the question. And so Johnnie Hedge was more or less beset.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He maintained his bashfulness. He backed away from altercation. It was plain that to bring matters to a point he must be forced into a quarrel. It was also plain that the proper person for the business was some boy who could whip Willie Dalzel, and these formidable warriors were distinctly averse to undertaking the new contract. It is a kind of a law in boy life that a quiet, decent, peace-loving lad is able to thrash a wide-mouthed talker. And so it had transpired that by a peculiar system of elimination most of the real chiefs were quiet, decent, peace-loving boys, and they had no desire to engage in a fight with a boy on the sole grounds that it was not known who could whip. Johnnie Hedge attended his affairs, they attended their affairs, and around them waged this discussion of relative merit. Jimmie Trescott took a prominent part in these arguments. He contended that Johnnie Hedge could thrash any boy in the world. He was certain of it, and to any one who opposed him he said, "You just get one of those smashes in the eye, and then you'll see." In the mean time there was a grand and impressive silence in the direction of Willie Dalzel. He had gathered remnants of his clan, but the main parts of his sovereignty were scattered to the winds. He was an enemy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Owing to the circumspect behavior of the new boy, the commotions on the school grounds came to nothing. He was often asked, "Kin you lick him?" And he invariably replied, "I dun'no'." This idea of waging battle with the entire world appalled him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A war for complete supremacy of the tribe which had been headed by Willie Dalzel was fought out in the country of the tribe. It came to pass that a certain half-dime blood-and-thunder pamphlet had a great vogue in the tribe at this particular time. This story relates the experience of a lad who began his career as cabin boy on a pirate ship. Throughout the first fifteen chapters he was rope's-ended from one end of the ship to the other end, and very often he was felled to the deck by a heavy fist. He lived through enough hardships to have killed a battalion of Turkish soldiers, but in the end he rose upon them. Yes, he rose upon them. Hordes of pirates fell before his intrepid arm, and in the last chapters of the book he is seen jauntily careering on his own hook as one of the most gallous pirate captains that ever sailed the seas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"NIG-NIG-R-R-! NIG-NIG-R-R!" Two boys. The smaller boy is turning and shouting at someone out of the picture. Illustration by Peter Newell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Naturally, when this tale was thoroughly understood by the tribe, they had to dramatize it, although it was a dramatization that would gain no royalties for the author. Now it was plain that the urchin who was cast for the cabin-boy's part would lead a life throughout the first fifteen chapters which would attract few actors. Willie Dalzel developed a scheme by which some small lad would play cabin boy during this period of misfortune and abuse, and then, when the cabin boy came to the part where he slew all his enemies and reached his zenith, that he, Willie Dalzel, should take the part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This fugitive and disconnected rendering of a great play opened in Jimmie Trescott's back garden. The path between the two lines of gooseberry bushes was elected unanimously to be the ship. Then Willie Dalzel insisted that Homer Phelps should be the cabin-boy. Homer tried the position for a time, and then elected that he would resign in favor of some other victim. There was no other applicant to succeed him, whereupon it became necessary to press some boy. Jimmie Trescott was a great actor, as is well known, but he steadfastly refused to engage for the part. Ultimately they seized upon little Dan Earl, whose disposition was so milky and docile that he would do whatever anybody asked of him. But Dan Earl made the one firm revolt of his life after trying existence as cabin-boy for some ten minutes. Willie Dalzel was in despair. Then he suddenly sighted the little brother of Johnnie Hedge, who had come into the garden, and in a poor little stranger sort of fashion was looking wistfully at the play. When he was invited to become the cabin boy he accepted joyfully, thinking that it was his initiation into the tribe. Then they proceeded to give him the rope's end and to punch him with a realism which was not altogether painless. Directly he began to cry out. They exhorted him not to cry out, not to mind it, but still they continued to hurt him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a commotion among the gooseberry bushes, two branches were swept aside, and Johnnie Hedge walked down upon them. Every boy stopped in his tracks. Johnnie was boiling with rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE HAND OF ONE APPROACHING FROM BEHIND LAID HOLD UPON HIS EAR A stern woman grabbing a small boy by the ear. Three other boys watch in disbelief. Illustration by Peter Newell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who hurt him?" he said, ferociously. "Did you?" He had looked at Willie Dalzel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Willie Dalzel began to mumble: "We was on'y playin'. Wasn't nothin' fer him to cry fer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The new boy had at his command some big phrases, and he used them. "I am goin' to whip you within an inch of your life. I am goin' to tan the hide off'n you." And immediately there was a mixture — an infusion of two boys which looked as if it had been done by a chemist. The other children stood back, stricken with horror. But out of this whirl they presently perceived the figure of Willie Dalzel seated upon the chest of the Hedge boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got enough?" asked Willie, hoarsely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," choked out the Hedge boy. Then there was another flapping and floundering, and finally another calm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got enough?" asked Willie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the Hedge boy. A sort of war-cloud again puzzled the sight of the observers. Both combatants were breathless, bloodless in their faces, and very weak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got enough?" said Willie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the Hedge boy. The carnage was again renewed. All the spectators were silent but Johnnie Hedge's little brother, who shrilly exhorted him to continue the struggle. But it was not plain that the Hedge boy needed any encouragement, for he was crying bitterly, and it has been explained that when a boy cried it was a bad time to hope for peace. He had managed to wriggle over upon his hands and knees. But Willie Dalzel was tenaciously gripping him from the back, and it seemed that his strength would spend itself in futility. The bear cub seemed to have the advantage of the working model of the windmill. They heaved, uttered strange words, wept, and the sun looked down upon them with steady, unwinking eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter Washington came out of the stable and observed this tragedy of the back garden. He stood transfixed for a moment, and then ran towards it, shouting: "Hi! What's all dish yere? Hi! Stopper dat, stopper dat, you two! For lan' sake, what's all dish yere?" He grabbed the struggling boys and pulled them apart. He was stormy and fine in his indignation. "For lan' sake! You two kids act like you gwine mad dogs. Stopper dat!" The whitened, tearful, soiled combatants, their clothing all awry, glared fiercely at each other as Peter stood between them, lecturing. They made several futile attempts to circumvent him and again come to battle. As he fended them off with his open hands he delivered his reproaches at Jimmie. "I's s'prised at you! I suhtainly is!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?" said Jimmie. "I 'ain't done nothin'. What have I done?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Y-y-you done 'courage dese yere kids to scrap," said Peter, virtuously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me?" cried Jimmie. "I 'ain't had nothin' to do with it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I raikon you 'ain't," retorted Peter, with heavy sarcasm. "I raikon you been er-prayin', 'ain't you?" Turning to Willie Dalzel, he said, "You jest take an' run erlong outer dish yere or I'll jest nachually take an' damnearkill you." Willie Dalzel went. To the new boy Peter said: "You look like you had some saince, but I raikon you don't know no more'n er rabbit. You jest take an' trot erlong off home, an' don' lemme caitch you round yere er-fightin' or I'll break yer back." The Hedge boy moved away with dignity, followed by his little brother. The latter, when he had placed a sufficient distance between himself and Peter, played his fingers at his nose and called out:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nig-ger-r-r! Nig-ger-r-r!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Peter Washington's resentment poured out upon Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Pears like you never would understan' you ain't reg'lar common trash. You take an' 'sociate with an'body what done come erlong."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aw, go on," retorted Jimmie, profanely. "Go soak your head, Pete."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The remaining boys retired to the street, whereupon they perceived Willie Dalzel in the distance. He ran to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I licked him! Didn't I, now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the Whilomville point of view he was entitled to a favorable answer. They made it. "Yes," they said, "you did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I run in," cried Willie, "an' I grabbed 'im, an' afore he knew what it was I throwed 'im. An' then it was easy." He puffed out his chest and smiled like an English recruiting-sergeant. "An' now," said he, suddenly facing Jimmie Trescott, "whose side were you on?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question was direct and startling. Jimmie gave back two paces. "He licked you once," he explained, haltingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He never saw the day when he could lick one side of me. I could lick him with my left hand tied behind me. Why, I could lick him when I was asleep." Willie Dalzel was magnificent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A gate clicked, and Johnnie Hedge was seen to be strolling toward them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You said," he remarked, coldly, "you licked me, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Willie Dalzel stood his ground. "Yes," he said, stoutly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you're a liar," said the Hedge boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're another," retorted Willie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I ain't, either, but you're a liar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're another," retorted Willie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare tell me I'm a liar, or I'll smack your mouth for you," said the Hedge boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I did, didn't I?" barked Willie. "An' whatche goin' to do about it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm goin' to lam you," said the Hedge boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He approached to attack warily, and the other boys held their breaths. Willie Dalzel winced back a pace. "Hol' on a minute," he cried, raising his palm. "I'm not — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the comic windmill was again in motion, and between gasps from his exertions Johnnie Hedge remarked, "I'll show — you whether — you kin — lick me — or not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first blows did not reach home on Willie, for he backed away with expedition, keeping up his futile cry, "Hol' on a minute." Soon enough a swinging fist landed on his cheek. It did not knock him down, but it hurt him a little and frightened him a great deal. He suddenly opened his mouth to an amazing and startling extent, tilted back his head, and howled, while his eyes, glittering with tears, were fixed upon this scowling butcher of a Johnnie Hedge. The latter was making slow and vicious circles, evidently intending to renew the massacre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the spectators really had been desolated and shocked by the terrible thing which had happened to Willie Dalzel. They now cried out: "No, no; don't hit 'im any more! Don't hit 'im any more!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie Trescott, in a panic of bravery, yelled, "We'll all jump on you if you do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Hedge boy paused, at bay. He breathed angrily, and flashed his glance from lad to lad. They still protested: "No, no; don't hit 'im any more. Don't hit 'im no more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll hammer him until he can't stand up," said Johnnie, observing that they all feared him. "I'll fix him so he won't know hisself, an' if any of you kids bother with me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly he ceased, he trembled, he collapsed. The hand of one approaching from behind had laid hold upon his ear, and it was the hand of one whom he knew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other lads heard a loud, iron-filing voice say, "Caught ye at it again, ye brat, ye." They saw a dreadful woman with gray hair, with a sharp red nose, with bare arms, with spectacles of such magnifying quality that her eyes shone through them like two fierce white moons. She was Johnnie Hedge's mother. Still holding Johnnie by the ear, she swung out swiftly and dexterously, and succeeded in boxing the ears of two boys before the crowd regained its presence of mind and stampeded. Yes, the war for supremacy was over, and the question was never again disputed. The supreme power was Mrs. Hedge.</field>
