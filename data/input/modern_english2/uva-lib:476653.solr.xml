      <field name="fulltext">Image of first two printed columns. James Fenimore Cooper 6245-l 1840; 19th-Century American Literature, Clifton Waller Barrett Library, University of Virginia Special Collections</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having heretofore promised our readers a review of these books, we deem the present a favorable moment for the re- demption of our pledge, in as much as MR. COOPER has recent- ly immortalized himself by arguing his own cause in our Demur- rer case at Utica , and we learn that Col. WEBB, the editor of the Courier and Enquirer, is to be tried at the approaching Ot- sego Circuit for two several libels on the "just and handsome Mr. Effingham."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our readers will bear in mind, that MR. COOPER commenced his libel-suit against us for copying a paragraph from the Courier and Enquirer, accusing him of sueing Col. Stone in order to get up an excitement about his Naval History; after which we remarked that "Vain, weak, self-inflated, silly and preposterous as his conduct has been, we do not believe him capable of such baseness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, our present object, is not only to make a critical analy- sis of the two books before us and to demonstrate that they are the most abusive works ever published in relation to the United States; but at the same time to prove from their pages, that we were fully warranted in the use of stronger language in regard to MR. COOPER than any in which we have indulged. We hold it to be a matter of great importance, that the public should thoroughly understand the nature of the controversy now pending between MR. COOPER and those whom he calls his libellers ; not that we deem it of great public importance whether Col. WEBB, Col. STONE, THURLOW WEED and ourselves , should be successful or unsucessful so far we are concerned, but because MR. COOPER'S success or failure in his vexatious libel suits, is to determine the all-important question, whether, hereafter, the Press of our country is to be prosecuted and punished, if it dare to vindicate our people and our institutions from the base and interested slander of fo- reign book-manufacturers, or from the still more despicable assault of one of our own citizens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first great point is clearly to understand the author's object in these publications; and, this being ascertained, we have only to quote from the works, to exhibit in their true co- lors , the character of the slanders heaped upon our country and every class of society of which it is composed. In the preface to Homeward Bound, dated April 1838, (the work offered in London and Paris in June,) the author says, "It was commenced with a sole view to exhibit THE PRESENT STATE OF SOCIETY in the United States , through the agency in part of a set of characters with different peculiarities, who had freshly arrived from Europe, and to whom the distinctive features of the country would be apt to present themselves with greater force, than to those who had never lived beyond the influence of the things portrayed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The persons referred to, as "freshly arrived from Europe," are Mr. EDWARD and JOHN EFFINGHAM, EVE the daughter of EDWARD, and Mr. PAUL POWIS, alias EFFINGHAM, he proving in the sequel to be the son of Mr. JOHN EFFINGHAM. Now, in reviews of this work it has been charged that in Mr. EDWARD EFFINGHAM, Mr. COOPER had delineated a character intended for himself, and that his leading object, in addition to making money out of the publication, was to give himself and family a fictitious importance in Europe—a harm- less vanity, with which no one would ever have interfered if he had not, at the same time, traduced every thing American, and grossly slandered each and every class and portion of our people, whose manners and customs he attempted to de- lineate .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the distinct avowal to the world —for the work was- published simultaneously in London, Paris and Philadelphia , —that his "sole view" was "to exhibit the present state of society in the United States ," the reader of course is bound to presume that in describing classes Mr. COOPER selected from each an individual, one who should be deemed a fair spe- cimen of the whole body. Thus, when he brought forward a lawyer, his object being to give to Europeans a comprehen- sive view of the profession of the Law in the United States, it is to be presumed that the character delineated is a fair sample of the profession—one, by whose sentiments, manners, and con- duct the whole profession is to be estimated. And so with the editor, mechanic , or any other class. Mr. COOPER, ar- guing correctly upon this point, adopted this course; and accordingly, in order to give Europeans a just idea of "the present state of society in the United States ," he introduces into his work the family of EFFINGHAMS alias COOPERS, just returned from Europe; an Editor by the name of STEADFAST DODGE; a Lawyer , whom he denominates ARISTABULUS BRAGG; two private gentlemen, Mr HOWELL and Mr. WEN- HAM ; all the literati of New-York, and a packet captain, TRUCK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These, with the exception of several females casually introduced, are the personages in whose conduct and conver- sation the people of Europe are assured by Mr. COOPER, on his veracity as a gentleman and his character as an author, that they will find a faithful picture of "the present state of society in the United States."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the first place let us prove the identity of Mr. COOPER and Mr. EFFINGHAM, and then see what account he gives of himself and family, and, in that, discern the real object of his works.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Mr. Cooper's early work, entitled the Pioneers , he de- scribed the region in and about Cooperstown, where he was born and which was first setttled by his father, who was an honest hard-working wheelwright from New Jersey: a man who boasted of his humble origin; and who, in after life, when by his enterprise and integrity he had become a large landed proprietor, and colonized a portion of the wilderness, was in the habit of proclaiming to his guests that the vehicle which brought him and his family into the wilds of Otsego, was the work of his own hands . He knew no pride but that of developing the resources of his infant colony; and the com- panion of his bosom was equally humble and unassuming.— The daughter of an honest huckster woman in the Philadel- phia market, she never in the hour of prosperity, forgot her orgin; but used frequently to make her boast, that many and many was the time that she was compelled to send our author to bed by "early candle light," in order that she might wash and dry his only suit of clothes! In the work referred to, in which the early days of Cooperstown and the COOPERS are described, the place is called Templeton and the Cooper family denominated Temple ; and in the work before us, the Effinghams are described as the descendants of the settler of Cooperstown , which is still called Templeton . The grea- ter part of the scene of the last two volumes is laid in Tem- pleton or Cooperstown and on Lake Otsego , the name of which he retains throughout, in order that there may not be any mistake with regard to the place and the persons intended to be delineated. But to make "assurance doubly sure," the author brings into the work the whole story of his grievances in relation to "the three mile Point," with which the public are familiar as a controversy between JAMES FENIMORE COOPER and the good people of the village of Cooperstown! Mr. Cooper's Card in regard to this matter is before the public—so also, is the history of his libel suit against several editors for having dared to comment on the Point controversy. Now, with these facts before the public, let the reader note the following extracts from page 228, 229-30, '31, vol. 1, of Home as Found : *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the way, Miss Effingham," he said, "I suppose you flatter yourself with being the heiress of that desirable re- treat ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is very natural that, at some day, though I trust a very distant one, I should succeed to that which belongs to my dear father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Both natural and legal, my fair cousin; but you are yet to learn that there is a power that threatens to rise up and dis- pute your claim."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What power—human power, at least—can dispute the lawful claim of an owner to his property? That Point has been ours ever since civilized man has dwelt among these hills; who will presume to rob us of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will be much surprised to discover that there is such a power, and that there is actually a disposition to exercise it. The public—the all-powerful, omnipotent, overruling, law- making law-breaking public—has a passing caprice to possess itself of your beloved point; and Ned Effingham must show unusual energy or will get it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you serious, cousin Jack?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As serious as the magnitude of the subject can render a responsible being, as Mr. Dodge would say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eve said no more, but she looked vexed, and remained al- most silent until they landed, when she hastened to seek her father, with a view to communicate what she had heard. Mr. Effingham listened to his daughter, as he always did, with tender interest; and when she had done, he kissed her glow- ing cheek, bidding her not to believe that which she seemed so seriously to dread, possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, cousin John would not trifle with me on such a sub- ject , father," Eve continued; "he knows how much I prize all those little heir-looms that are connected with the affec- tions ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can inquire further into the affair, my child, if it be your desire; ring for Pierre, if you please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pierre answered, and a message was sent to Mr. Bragg, re- quiring his presence in the library.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aristabulus appeared, by no means in the best humor, for he disliked having been omitted in the late excursion on the lake, fancying that he had a community-right to share in all his neighbor's amusements, though he had sufficient self-com- mand to concela his feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish to know, sir," Mr. Effingham commenced, with- out introduction, "whether there can be any mistake concern- ing the ownership of the Fishing Point on the west side of the lake?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not, sir; it belongs to the public."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Early in the summer the Effinghams (Coopers) leave New-York for their "Hereditary Estates" in Otsego , and on their embarking on the Hudson we find the following reflec- tions :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The American spring is the least pleasant of its four sea- sons, its character being truly that of "winter lingering in the lap of May." Mr. Effingham, who the reader will probably suspect, by this time, to be a descendant of a family of the same name, that we have had occasion to introduce into another work , had sent orders to have his country residence prepared for the reception of our party.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They approach the Highlands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must confess, Jack ," said the mild, thoughtful Mr. Effingham , "that these rocks strike my eyes as much less imposing than formerly. The passage is fine, beyond ques- tion, but it is hardly grand scenery."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The character of our countrymen in regard to a fondness for change is thus described:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A dozen years, Ned ! You name an age. Speak of three or four, if you wish to find any thing in America where you left it! The whole country is in such a constant state of mutation, that I can only liken it to that game of children, in which as one quits his corner, another runs into it, and he that finds no corner to get into, is the laughing-stock of the others. Fancy tha dwelling the residence of one man from childhood to old age; let him then quit it for a year or two, and on his return he would find another in possession, who would treat him as an impertinent intruder, because he had been absent two years. An American 'always,' in the way of usages, extends no further back than eighteen months. In short every thing is condensed into the present moment; and services, character, for evil as well as good unhappily, and all other things, cease to have weight, except as they influence the interests of the day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eve , the heroine, thus describes New-York :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I expected to see a capital in New-York , Grace , and in this I have been grievously disappointed. Instead of finding the tastes, tone, conveniences, architecture, streets, churches, shops, and society of a capital, I found a huge expansion of common-place things, a commercial town, and the most mixed and the least regulated society, that I had ever met with.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On approaching Cooperstown the conversation turns upon Mr. Cooper 's house, which, having been the residence of his father, had passed into other hands, some thirty years pre- vious , through the medium of a sheriff's sale , but which, we understand, a connection of Col. Webb's resold him on his return to the country for mere cost and interest, and which he has certainly improved with great taste and judgement, and rendered superior to most, and inferior to but few residences in Otsego .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As my house came to me from my father," said Mr. Effingham, across whose mild and handsome face a smile was gradually stealing, "I knew its history, and when called on for an explanation of its singularities, could refer all to the composite order. But, you, Jack , have supplanted all this, by a style of your own, for which I shall be compelled to consult the authorities for explanations."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, was this written for the meridian of Coopers- town where the history of the "Hereditary Estate" is well- known, or was it not rather designed to impress his European readers with an idea of his being a different person from his countrymen—one nobly descended—whose forefathers were knighted centuries ago —who resided on his "Hereditary Estate" surrounded by a dependant peasantry, and sustaining all the baronial customs and manners of a long line of noble ancestors? We shall answer this question as we proceed. — [Page 167, vol. 1.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The progress of society in America, has been distinguished by several peculiarities that do not so properly belong to the more regular and methodical advances of civilization in other parts of the world. On the one hand, the arts of life, like Minerva, who was struck out of the intellectual being of her father at a blow, have started full-grown into existance, as the legitimate inheritance of the colonists, while, on the other, every thing tends towards settling down into a medinm, as regards quality, a consequence of the community character of the institutions. Everything she had seen that day, had struck Eve as partaking of this mixed nature, in which, while nothing was vulgar, little even approached to that high standard [EOF]</field>
