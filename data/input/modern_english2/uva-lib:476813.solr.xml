      <field name="fulltext">LIfes lowest, but far greatest Sphere, I sing, Of all things, that adorn the gawdy Spring: Such as in Deserts live, whom, unconfin'd, None but the simple Laws of Nature bind: And those, who growing tame by human care, The well-bred Citizens of Gardens are: Those that aspire to Sol , their Sires bright Face, Or stoop into their Mother Earths embrace: Such as drink Streams, or Wells, or those, dry fed, Who have Jove only for their Ganymede : And all, that Salomon 's lost Work of old, (Ah fatal Loss!) so wisely did unfold. Though I the Oaks vivacious Age shou'd live, I ne'r to all their Names in Verse could give. Yet I the Rise of Groves will briefly show In Verses, like their Trees, ranged all a-row. To which some one perhaps new Shades may joyn, Till mine, at last, become a Grove Divine. Assist me, Phœbus ! Wit of Heav'n, whose care So bounteously both Plants and Poets share. Where e'er thou com'st, hurl Light and Heat around, And with new Life enamel all the Ground; As when the Spring feels thee, with Magick Light, Break through the Bonds of the dead Winters Night; When thee to Colchis the gilt Ram conveys, [1] And the warm'd North rejoyces in thy Rays. Where shall I first begin? For, with delight Each gentle Plant me kindly does invite. My self to slavish Method I'll not tye, But like the Bee, where e'er I please, will flie; Where I the glorious hopes of Honey see, Or the free Wing of Fancy carries me. Here no fine Garden Emblems shall reside, In well-made Beds to prostitute their Pride: But we rich Nature, who her Gifts bestows, Unlimited (nor the vast Treasure knows) And various plenty of the pathless Woods Will follow; Poor Men only count their Goods. Do thou, bright Phœbus ! guide me luckily To the first Plant by some kind Augury. The Omen's good; so, we may hope the best, The Gods mild Looks our grand Design have blest. For thou kind Bet'ny ! art the first we see, And opportunely com'st dear Plant! for me; For me, because the Brain thou dost protect, See, if y'are wise, my Brain you don't neglect. For it concerns you, that in Health that be, I sing thy Sisters, Betony! and thee. But who, best Plant! can praise thee to thy merit, Or number the Perfections you inherit? The Trees, he, in th' Hercynian Woods as well, Or Roses, that in Pæstum grow, may tell. Musa at large, thy say, thy Praises writ, [2] But, I suppose, did part of them omit. Cæsar his Triumphs would recount; do thou, Greater than he a Conqueress! do so now. [1] When the sun enters Aries , i. e. in March . Colchis Sea when the Ram with the Golden Fleece was said to have been translated into a Constellation. [2] Antonius Musa , Physician to Augustus .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BETONY TO know my Virtues briefly, you in vain Desire, all which this whole Book can't contain. O'er all the World of Man great I preside, Where e'er red Streams though milky Medows glide; O'er all you see throughout the Body spread, Between the distant Poles of Heel and Head. But in the Head my chief Dominions are, [3] The Soul commits her Palace to my Care. I all the Corners purge, refresh, secure, Nor let it be, for want of Light, obscure. That Soul, that came from Heav'n, which Stars adorn, Her God's great Daughter, by Creation born, Alas! to what a frail Apartment now, And ruinated Cottage does she bow! Her very Mansion to Infections turns, And in the Place, wherein she lives, she burns. When Falling-Sickness thunder-strikes the Brain, Oft Men, like Victims, fall, as Thunder-slain. Oft does the Head with a swift Whinsie reel, And the Soul's turn'd, as on Ixion 's Wheel. Oft pains i' th'Head an Anvil seem to beat, And like a Forge, the Brain-pan burns with heat. Some parts the Palsie oft of Sense deprives [4] And Motion, (strange effect!) one side survives The other. This Mezentius fury quite [5] Outdoes; in this Disease dead Limbs unite With live ones. Some with Lethargy opprest Under Deaths weight seem fatally to rest. Ah! Life, thou art Deaths Image, but that Thee In nought resembles, save thy Brevity. Vain Phantoms oft the Mind distracted keep, [6] And roving thoughts possess the place of Sleep. Oft when the Nerves for want of Juice grow dry [7] (That Heavenly Juice, unknown to th'outward Eye) Each feeble Limb as 'twere grows loose, and quakes, Yea, the whole fabrick of the Body shakes. These, and all Evils which the Brain infest (For numerous, sawcy Griefs that part molest) Me Phœbus bad, by constant War restrain; Saying, my Kingdom (Child!) see, you maintain. And straight he gave me Arms well forg'd from Heav'n, Like those t' Æneas or Achilles giv'n. One wondrous Leaf he wisely did create 'Gainst all the Darts of Sickness and of Fate, And into that a Soverign mystick Juice, With subtile heat from Heav'n he did infuse. 'Tis not in vain, bright Sire! that you bestow Such Arms on me, nor shall they rusty grow. No; from that Crime not the just Head alone Acquits me, but th'inferior Limbs will own, I'm guiltless. When the Lungs with Phlegm opprest [8] Want Air, to fan the Heart, and cool the Brest, A fainty Cough strives to expel the Foe, But seeks the help of powerful Medicines too. It comes to me, I my assistance lend, Open th'obstructed Pores, and gently send Refreshment to the Heart. Cool Gales abate Th'internal Heat, and it grows temperate. The Quartan Ague its dry Holes forsakes, As Adders do; Dropsies like Water Snakes, With liquid Aliment no longer fed, By me are forc'd to fly their wat'ry Bed. I loss of Appetite repair, and heat The Stomach, to concoct the Food men eat. Torturing Gripes I in the Guts allay, And send out murmuring Blasts the backward way. I wash the Saffron Jaundice of the Skin, And ease the Kidneys of dire Stones within. Thick Blood that stands in Womens veins I soon Force to flow down, more powerful than the Moon. But then th'unnatural Floods of Whites arise; Ah me! that common Filth will not suffice. I likewise stop the Current, when the Blood [9] Through some new Channel seeks a purple Flood. I all the Tumults of the Womb appease, And to the Head, which that disturbs, give Ease. Womens Conceptions I corroborate, [10] And let no Births their time anticipate. But in the sacred time of Labor I The careful Midwifes Hands with help supply. The lazy Gout my Virtue swiftly shuns, [11] Whilst from the Joynts with nimble heels it runs. All Poysons I expel, that men annoy, And baneful Serpents by my Power destroy. [12] My pointed Odor through its marrow flies, And of a secret wound the Adder dies. So Phœbus , I suppose, the Python slew, And with my Juice his arrows did imbrew. From every limb all kinds of Ach and Pain I banish, never to return again. The wearied Clown I with new vigor bless, And Pains as pleasant make as Idleness. Nor do I only Lifes Fatigue relieve, But 'tis adorn'd with what I freely give. I make the colour of the Blood more bright, And cloath the Skin with a more graceful White. [13] Spain in her happy Woods first gave me Birth, Then kindly banish'd me o'er all the Earth; Nor gain'd she greater Honor when she bore Trajan to rule the World, and to restore Romes Joys. 'Tis true, he justly might compare With my Deserts; his Virtues equal were. But a good Prince is the short Grant of Fate, The World's soon robb'd of such a vast Estate. But of my Bounty Men for ever taste, And what he once was I am like to last. [3] Betony is hot and dry in the second degree. Wine or Vinegar Impregnated with it, is excellent for the Stomack and Sight. The Smell alone refreshes the Brain. 'Tis an Italian Proverb. He has as many Virtues as Betony , i. e. innumerable. [4] Fernel. [5] Virg. Æn. [6] Betony is drunk as remedy against Madness, Plin. l. 26.11. [7] This is according to Dr. Glisson's Opinion, which see in L. de Anatomia hepatis . And Plin. ut supra . [8] Concerning these Diseases help'd by Betony, see Pliny and Fernelius . [9] See Plin. l. 26. 19. [10] Fernel . [11] It is every where made use of against the Gout and Sciatica. [12] Betony is said to have so great a Virtue against Serpents, that if they are inclosed in a circle made thereof, they'll lash themselves to death. Plin. l. 25.8. [13] It has a particular faculty to amend the dead colour of the skin, and to render it vivid and clear. Id. l. 26.11.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MAIDEN-HAIR , or VENUS-HAIR I Being the chief of all the Hairy State, [14] Me they have chosen for their Advocate, To speak on their behalf; Now We, you know, Among the other Plants make no small show. And Fern too, far and near which does preside [15] O'er the wild Fields, is to our kind ally'd. Some Hairy Comets also hence derive, [16] And Marriages of Stars with Plants contrive. But we such Kindred do not care to own, Rather than rude Relations we'll have none. My hair of Parentage far better came, 'Tis not for nought, it has Loves gentle Name. Beauty her self my Debtor is, she knows, [17] And of my Threads Love does his Nets compose. Their Thanks to me the beauteous Women pay For wanton Curls, and shady Locks, that play Upon their Shoulders. Friend! who e'er thou art, (If thou'rt in Love) to me perform thy part. Keep thy Hair florid, and let dangling toils Around thy Head, make Ladies Hearts thy spoils. For when your Head is bald, or Hair grows thin, In vain you boast of Treasures lodg'd within. The Women won't believe you, nor will prize Such Wealth; all Lovers ought to please the Eyes. So I to Venus my assistance lend (I'm pleas'd to be my Heavenly Name-sakes Friend) [18] Though I am modest, and consent to go In simple Weeds, that make no gawdy show; For I am cloth'd, as when I first was born, [19] No painted Flow'rs my rural Head adorn. But above all, I'm sober; I ne'er drink Sweet Streams, nor does my Thirst make Rivers sink. When Jove to Plants begins an Health in show'rs, And from the Sky large Bowls of Water pours, You see the Herbs quaff all the Liquor up, When they ought only modestly to sup: You'd think the German Drunkards near the Rhine , Were keeping Holy-day with them in Wine. Mean while I blush; shake from my trembling Leaves The Drops; and Jove my Thanks in drought receives. But I no Topers envy; for my meen Is always gay, and my complexion green. Winter it self does not exhaust the Juice, That makes me look so verdant and so spruce. Yet the Physicians steep me cruelly In hateful Water, which I drink and die. But I ev'n dead, on Humors operate, [20] Such force my Ashes have beyond my Fate. I through the Liver, Spleen, and Reins the Foe Pursue, whilst they with speed before me flow. Ten thousand Maladies down with 'em they Like Monsters fell, in bracky Waves convey. For this I might deserve, above the Air, An higher place than Berenices Hair; [21] But if into the Sea the Stars turn round, Rather than Heav'n it self, I'd chuse dry ground. [14] Capillary Plants. [15] From the likeness of their Leaves. [16] Alluding to the Name [17] The Name it bears, because it tinges the Hair, and is tot his purpose boil'd in Wine with Parsley-seed, and plenty of Oil, which renders the hair thick and curling, and keeps it from falling. Plin. l. 22.11. [18] Being called in Latin Capillus Veneris . [19] 'Tis always green, but never flowers. It delights in dry places, and is green in Summer, but withers not in Winter. Plin. [20] It forces Urine, is good against Dropsie, Stangury, etc . Plin. [21] The Wife of Ptolomy Euergetes , who having vowed, if her Husband had success in his Asian Expedition, that she would cut off and dedicate her Hair: at his Return she did so; and on the morrow, it not being found in the Temple of Venus , where it was laid, Ptolomy was highly enraged, till one Conon , a Mathematician, made it out to him, that it was transferred to Heaven, and there made a Constellation of seven Stars near the Lion's Tail ; which still bears this Name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAGE SAge! who by many Virtues gain'st renown, [22] Sage! whose Deserts all happy Mortals own. Since thou, dear Sage! preserv'st the Memory, I cannot sure forgetful prove of Thee. Thee, who Mnemosyne dost recreate [23] Her Daughter Muses ought to celebrate, Nor shalt thou e'er complain, that they're ingrate. High on a Mount the Souls firm Mansion stands, And with a view the Limbs below commands. Sure some great Architect this Pile design'd, Where all the World is to a Span confin'd. A mighty throng of Spirits here reside, Which to the Soul are very near alli'd. Here the grand Council's held; hence to and fro The Spirits scout to see what News below. Busie as Bees, through every part they run, Thick as the Rays stream from the glitt'ring Sun. Their subtle Limbs Silk, thin as Air, arrays, And therefore nought their rapid Journey stays. But with much toil they weary grow, at length Perpetual Labor tires the greatest Strength. Off too, as they in pains bestow their hours, The airy vagrants hostile Heat devours. Oft in Venereal Raptures they expire, Or burnt by Wine, and drown'd in liquid Fire. Then Leaden Sleep does on the Senses seize, And with dull drowziness the Vitals freeze. Cold Floods of dire Distempers swiftly rowl, For want of Dams and Fences, o'er the Soul. Then are the Nerves dissolv'd, each member quakes, And the whole ruinated Fabrick shakes. You'd think the Hands fear'd Poyson in the Cup, They tremble so, and cannot lift it up. Hence, Sage! 'tis manifest what thou canst do, And glorious dangers beg relief from you. The Foe, by cold and humors so inclos'd, From his chill Throne by thy strong heat's depos'd. And to the Spirits thou bring'st fresh Recruits, When they are wearied in such long Disputes. To Life, whose Body was almost its Urn, New Life, (if I may say it) does return. The members by their Nerves are steady ty'd, A Pilot, not the Waves, the Vessel guide. You all things fix: Who this for truth wou'd take, That thy weak Fibres such strong Bonds shou'd make? Loose Teeth thou fasten'st; which, at thy command, Well riveted in their firm Sockets stand. May that fair, useful Bulwark, ne'er decay, Nor the Mouth's Ivory Fences e'er give way! Conceptions, Women by thy help retain, [24] Nor does th'injected Seed flow back again. Ah! Death, don't Life it self anticipate, Let a Man live, before he meets his Fate. Thou'rt too severe, if, in the very Dock, Our Ship, before 'tis built, strikes on a Rock. Of thy Perfections this is but a tast, You bring to view things absent, and what's past Recal; such tracts i' th'mind of things you make, None can the well form'd Characters mistake. And lest the Colours there shou'd fade away, Your Oil embalms, and keeps 'em from decay. [22] The Virtues of Sage are highly celebrated by all Authors; particularly the Writers of Schola Salernitana , who may be consulted. It is hot in the first, and dry in the second degree; it is easily astringent, and stays Bleedings. It strengthens the Stomack and Brain; and rowzes a dull Appetite, but its peculiar Faculty is to corroborate the Nerves, and to oppose all Diseases incident unto them. Hence it hath the hightest reputation among Medicaments for the Memory. [23] The Memory [24] Agrippa calls it the holy Herb , and says the Lionesses eat it when they are big. See Heurnius concerning its virtues this way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BAUM HEnce, Cares! my constant, troublesome Company, Be gone! Melissa 's come and smiles on me. [25] Smiling she comes, and courteously my Head With Chaplets binds from every fragrant Bed: Bidding me sing of her, and for my strains, Her self will be the Guerdon of my pains. My Heart, methinks, is much more lightsome grown, And I thy influence, kind Plant! must own: Justly thy Leaves may represent the Heart, For that, among its Wealth, counts thee a part. As of Kings Heads Guinies th'impression bear, That Princely part you in Effigie wear. All Storms and Clouds you banish from the mind, But leave Serenity and Peace behind. Bacchus himself no more revives our Blood, When he infuses his hot, purple flood: When in full Bowls he all our sorrow drowns, And flattering hopes with short-liv'd riches crowns. But those Enjoyments some disturbance bring, And such delights flow from a muddy Spring. For Bacchus does not kill, but wound the Foe, | Whose rage and strength increases by the Blow. | But without force or dregs thy pleasures flow, | Thy Joys no after-claps of Torments know. | Thy Hony, gentle Bawm! no pointed Stings, Like Bees, thy great admirers, with it brings. [26] Oh! Heavenly Gift to sickly human kind, All Goddess, if from care thou freest the mind. All Plagues annoy, but Cares the whole Man seise: Whene'er we labor under this Disease. These, though in prosp'rous affluence we live, To all our Joys a bitter Tincture give. Frail humane Nature its own Poyson breeds, And Life it self thy healing Virtue needs. [25] Baum is hot and dry in the first degree; it is excellent against Melancholy, and the Evils arising therefrom. It causes chearfulness, a good digestion and florid colour; The leaves are said, by those who mind Signatures, to resemble a heart. [26] It is very much loved by the Bees, and is a present Remedy against the Stings of them and Wasps, etc. Plin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCURVY-GRASS. A Malady there is, that runs through all The Northern World, which they the Scurvy call. Thrice happy Greece , that scorns the barbarous Word, [27] Nor in its Tongue a neater does afford. Destructive Monster! God ne'er laid a Curse, On Man like this, nor could he send a worse. A thousand horrid shapes the Monster wears, [28] And in as many hands fierce arms it bears. This Water-Serpent, in the Belly's bred, By muddy Fens, and sulph'rous Moistures fed. Him either Sloth or too much Labour breeds, He both from Ease and Pain it self proceeds. Oft from a dying Fever he receives His Birth, and in the Ashes of it lives. Of him just born you easily may dispose, Then he's a Dwarf, but soon a Giant grows. That a small Egg should breed a Crocodile, Of such vast bulk and strength, the wondering Nile Thinks he as much amazed ought to stand, As men, when he o'erflows the drowned Land. With nasty Humors and dry Salts he's fed, By stinking Wind and Vapours nourished. Even in his Cradle he unlucky grows (Though he be Son of sloth, no sloth this shows) His Toils no sooner Hercules began; Monsters now ape that Monster-murdering Man. E're he's well born the Limbs he does oppress, And they are tired with very Idleness. They languish and deliberating stand, Loth to obey the active Souls command. Nor does it to your wildred Sense appear, Where their pain is, 'cause it is every where. When Men for want of breath can hardly blow, Nor Purple Streams in azure Channels flow, Then the bold Enemy shews he's too nigh, One so mischievous cannot hidden lie. The Teeth drop out, and noisome grows the Breath, The man not only smells, but looks like Death. Qualms, Vomiting, and torturing Gripes within Besides unseemly spots upon the skin His other symptoms are; with clouds the mind He overcasts, and, fettering the Sense, To Life it self makes Living an Offence. This Monster Nature gave me to subdue, [29] (Such feats with herbs t'accomplish is not new) So the fierce Bull and watchful Dragon too On Colchis shore the valiant Jason slew. But whether those defeated Monsters fell By virtue of my Juice I cannot tell. But them he conquer'd and then back he row'd O'r the proud waves; nor was it only Gold He got; he brought away a Royal Maid Beside (may all Physicians so be paid.) The hardness of my task my courage fir'd, A powerful Foe was that I most desir'd. I love to be commended, I must own, And that my Name in Physick books be shown. I envy them, whom Galen deigns to name, Or old Hippocrates , great Sons of Fame. Achilles Alexander envy'd; why, If he complain'd so justly, may not I? When Græcian Names did other Plants adorn And were by them as marks of honour born, I grew inglorious on the British coast, [30] (For Britain then no reason had to boast) Hapless I on the Gothick shore did lie, Nor was the Sea-weed less esteem'd than I. Now sure 'tis time, those losses were regain'd, Which in my youth and fame so long I have sustain'd; 'Tis time, and so they are; Now I am known, Through all the Universe my fame has flown: Who my deserts denies, when by my hands That Tyrant falls, that plagues the Northern Lands? Sing Io Pæan ; yea thrice Io sing, And let the Gothick shores with Triumphs ring; That wild Disease, which such disturbance gave, Is led before my Chariot like a Slave. [27] There is no proper Greek word for the Scurvy . [28] Description of the Scurvy . [29] Scurvy-Grass is reckoned among the Medicines peculiar to this Disease. It opens, penetrates, renders volatile the crude and gross humous, purges by urine and sweat, and strengthens the entrails. [30] Not but that 'tis by some thought to be the Britannica of Pliny .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DODDER. THou neither leaf nor stalk, nor root can'st show; How, in this pensile posture dost thou grow? Thou'rt perfect Magick; and I cannot now Those things you do, for Miracles allow; Those wonders, if compar'd to you, are none; Since you yourself are a far greater one. To make the strength of other Herbs thy prey, The Huntress thou thy self for Nets dost lay, Live Riddle! He that would thy mysteries Unfold, must with some Oedipus advise. No wonder in your Arms the Plants you hold, Thou being all Arms must them needs so infold. For thee large threads the fatal Sisters spin, But to your work nor woof nor web put in. Hence 'tis, that you so intricately twine About that plant [ [31] ] which yields so long a line. Oh! Spouse most constant to a Plant most dear, Than whom no Couple e'er more loving were. No more let Love of wanton Ivy boast, Her kindness is th'effect of nought but Lust. Another she enjoys; but that her Love And she are Two, many distinctions prove. [32] Their strength and leaves are different, and her fruit Puts all the Difference beyond dispute. The likeness to the Parent does profess, That She in that is no Adulteress. Her root with different juices is supply'd, And She her Maiden name bears though a Bride. But Dodder on her Spouse depends alone, And nothing in her self can call her own. Fed with his juice, she on his stalk is born, And thinks his Leaves her head full well adorn. Whe'r he be, She loves to take his Name, And must with him be every way the same. Alceste and Evadne thus enflam'd Are, with some others, for their passion, fam'd. So, Dodder , for thy husband Flax thoud'st die I guess; but may'st thou speed more luckily. This is her living passion; but she grows Still more renown'd for kindness, which she shows To mortal Men, when she 'as resign'd her breath; For She of them is mindful even in Death. The Liver and the Spleen most faithfully [33] Of all oppressions she does ease and free. Where has so small a Plant such strength and store Of Virtues, when her Husband's weak and poor? Who'd think the Liver shou'd assistance need, A noble part, from such a wretched Weed? Use therefore little things; nor take it ill That Men small things preserve; for less may kill. [31] Flax. [32] The Ivy is always call'd Ivy , whatsoever it cleaves to: but this Herb takes the name from the Plant on which it hands, with whom also it partakes its Virtues, as Epithymum, Epilinum, Epiurtica , etc. [33] Concerning its manifold Virtues, consult Heurnius and Fernelius .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WORMWOOD. 'MOng Children I a baneful Weed am thought, [34] By none but Hags or Fiends desir'd or sought. They think a Doctor is in jest, or mad, If he agrees not, that my juice is bad. The Women also I offend, I know, Though to my bounteous hands so much they owe. Few Palates do my bitter tast approve, How few, alas! are well inform'd by Jove ! Sweet things alone they love; but in the end They find what bitter gusts those sweets attend. Long nauseousness succeeds their short-liv'd joys, And that which so much pleas'd the Palate, cloys. The Palate justly suffers for the wrong [35] Sh' 'as done the Stomach; into which so long All tastefull food she cramm'd, til now, quite tir'd, She loaths the Dainties she before admir'd, A grievous stench does from the stomach rise, And from the mouth Lernæan Poison flies. Then they're content to drink my harsher juice, Which for its bitterness they n'er refuse. It does not idle in the stomach lie, But, like some God, give present remedy. (So the warm Sun my vigour does restore, When he returns and the cold Winter's o'r.) There I a Jakes out of a Stable throw, And Hercules 's labour undergo. The Stomach eas'd its Office does repeat, And with new living fire concocts the meat. The purple Tincture soon it does devour, Nor does that Chyle the hungry veins o'rpower. The visage by degrees fresh Roses stain, And the perfumed breath grows sweet again. The good I do Venus herself will own, She, though all sweets, yet loves not sweets alone. She wisely mixes with my juice her joys, And her delights with bitter things alloys. We Herbs to different studies are inclined, And every faction does its Author find. Some Epicurus 's sentiments defend, And follow pleasure as their only end. It is their pride and boast sweet fruits to bear, And on their heads they flowry Chaplets wear. Whilst others courting rigid Zeno 's Sect, In Virtue fruitful, all things else neglect. They love not pomp, or what delights the sense, And think all's well, if they give no offence. And none a greater Stoick is, than I, The Stoa 's Pillars on my Stalk rely. Let others please, to profit, is my pleasure. The Love I slowly gain's a lasting treasure. In Towns debauch'd he's the best Officer, | Who most censorious is and most severe; | | Such I am; and such you, dear Cato, were. | But I no dire, revengeful passion show, Our Schools in Wisemen Anger don't allow. No fault I punish more than that which lies | Within my Province; wherefore from my eyes | Choler with hasty speed before me flies. | As soon as Me it in the stomach spies, Preparing for a War in Martial guise, Not daring in its lurking holes to stay, It makes a swift escape the backward way. I follow him at th'heels, and by the scent Find out which way the noisom Enemy went. Of Water too I drain the flesh and bloud, [36] When Winter threatens a devouring flood. The Dutchmen with less skill their Country drain, And turn the course of Waters back again. Sometimes th'obstructed Reins too narrow grow, And the salt floods back to their Fountains flow. Unhappy state! the neighboring members quake, And all th'adjacent Country seems to shake. Then I begin the Waters thus to chide; Why, sluggish Waters, do you stop your tide? Glide on with me, I'll break the Rampires down, That stop the Channel where you once have flown. I do so; straight the Currents wider grow, And in their usual banks the Waters flow. This all the members does rejoice and chear, Who of a dismal Deluge stood in fear. Men-eating Worms I from the body scare, [37] And conquering Arms against that Plague prepare. (Voracious Worm! thou wilt most certainly Heir of our bodies be, whene'r we die; Deferr a while the meal which in the Grave, Of humane Viands thou e'r long must have.) Those Vermine Infants bowels make their food, And love to suck their fill of tender bloud. They cannot stay till Death serves up their feast, But greedily snatch up the meat undrest. Why shou'd I speak of fleas? such Foes I hate, So basely born, ev'n to enumerate, Such dust born, skipping points of life; I say, Whose only virtue is, to run away. My Triumphs to such numbers do amount, That I the greater ones can hardly count. To such a bulk the vast account does swell, That I some Trophies lose which I should tell. Oft wandring Death is scatter'd through the Skies, [38] And through the Elements infection flies. The Earth below is sick, the Air above, Slow Rivers prove they're sickly, whilst they move; All things Deaths Arms in cold embraces catch, Life even the vital Air away doth snatch. To remedy such evils God took care, Nor me as least of Med'cines did prepare. Oft too, they say, I (though no Giant neither) Have born the shock of three strong Foes together. Not without reason therefore, or in vain [39] Did conquering Rome my Honour so maintain: The Conqu'ror a Triumphal draught of Me Drank, as the Guerdon of his Victory. Holding the crowned Goblet in his hand He cry'd aloud, This Cup can health command. Nor does it, cause 'tis bitter, please me less, My toils were so, in which I met success. [34] Pliny spends all Chap. 7. l. 27. in enumerating the Virtues of Wormwood , and Fernelius is large upon it; whom consult.

      <field name="fulltext">WATER-LILY. D'ye slight me, 'cause a bog my Belly feeds, And I am found among a crowd of Reeds I'm no green vulgar Daughter of the Earth, But to the noble Waters owe my birth. I was a Goddess of no mean degree; [40] But Love alas! deposed my Deity. He bad me love, and straight my kindled heart In Hercules 's triumphs bore a part. I with his Fame, and actions fell in love, And Limbs, that might become his Father Jove . And by degrees Me a strong impulse hurl'd, That Man t'enjoy, who conquer'd all the World. To tell you true, that Night I most admir'd, When he got fifty Sons and was not tir'd. Now, blushing, such deeds hate I, to profess; But 'twas a Night of noble wickedness. He (to be short) my honour stain'd, and he Had the first flow'r of my Virginity. But He by 's Father Jove 's example led Rambled and cou'd not brook a single bed. Fierce monstrous Beasts and Tyrants, worse than they, All o'r the World he ran to seek and slay. But He, the Tyrant, for his Guerdon still A Maid requires, if he a Monster kill. All Womankind to me his Harlots are, Ev'n Goddesses in my suspicion share. Perish me; let the Sun this Water dry, And may I scorch'd in this burnt puddle die; If I of Juno were not jealous grown, And thought I shew'd her hatred in my own. (Perhaps, said I, my passion he derides, And I'm the scorn of all his virtuous Brides. Grief, anger, shame and fury vex my mind, But, maugre all, Loves darts those passions blind.) If I from tortures of eternal grief Did not design by Death to seek relief. But Goddesses in Love can never die, Hard Fate! our punishment's Eternity. Mean time I'm all in tears both night and day, And as they drop, my tedious hours decay. Into a Lake the standing showers grow, And o'r my feet th'united Waters flow: Then (as the dismal boast of misery) I triumph in my griefs fertility. Till Jove at length, in pity, from above, Said, I shou'd never from that Fen remove. His Word my body of its form bereft, And straight all vanish'd, that my grief had left. My knotty root under the Earth does sink, [41] And makes me of a Club too often think. My thirsty leaves no liquor can suffice; My tears are now return'd into my eyes. My form its ancient Whiteness still retains, [42] And pristine paleness in my Cheeks remains. Now in perpetual mirth my days I pass, We Plants, believe me, are an happy Race. We truly feel the Suns kind influence, Cool winds and warmer Air refresh our sense, Nectar in dew does from Aurora rise, And Earth Ambrosia untill'd supplies. I pity Man, whom thousand cares perplex, And cruel Love, that greatest plague, does vex; Whilst mindful of the ills I once endur'd His flames by me are quench'd, his wounds are cur'd. [43] I triumph, that my Victor I o'rthrow, Such changes Tyrants Thrones shou'd undergo. Don't wonder, Love, that Thee thy Slave shou'd beat, Alcides Monsters taught me to defeat. And lest, unhappy Boy! thou shou'dst believe, All handsom folks thy cruel Yoke receive; I have a Wash that beautifies the Face, [44] Yet chastly look in my own wat'ry Glass. Diana 's meine, and Venus face I lend, So to both Deities I prove a friend. But lest that God shou'd artfully his Flame Conceal, and burn me in anothers Name; All Heats in general I resist, nay I [45] To all that's Hot am a sworn Enemy. Whether distracting flames with fury flie, Through the burnt brain, like Comets through the skie, Or whether from the Belly they ascend, And fumes all o'r the Body swiftly send, Whether with sulphurous fire the veins within They kindle, or just singe the outward skin. Whate'r they are, my awful juice they fly; When glimmering through the pores they run and die. Why wink'st thou? why doest so with half an eye Look on me? Oh—my sleepy root's too nigh. Besides my tedious Discourse might make | Any Man have but little mind to wake, | Without that's help; Thus then our leaves we take. | [40] Deianira 's blood is said by Calepine to be turn'd into this Herb, after she had kill's her self with Hercules his Club, for grief that she had been the cause of his death. [41] It is call'd by some Hercules 's Club . [42] There are two sorts, a white and a yellow. [43] 'Tis said to be a great allayer of Lechery. [44] It takes away Morphews and Freckles. [45] It is cold in the second degree, its root and seed are drying; but the flower moistens, being applied to the forehead and nostrils it cures the Head-ach arising from Plegm, and is very cooling.

      <field name="fulltext">SPLEENWORT or MILTWAST. ME cruel Nature, when she made me, gave [46] Nor stalk, nor seed, nor flow'r, as others have. The Sun ne'r warms me, nor will she allow, I shou'd in cultivated Gardens grow. And to augment the torment of my years, No lovely colour in my leaves appears. You'd think me Heav'ns aversion, and the Earth Had brought me forth at some chance, spurious Birth. Vain outward gaudy shews mankind surprize, And they resign their Reason to their eyes. To Gardens no poor Plant admittance gains, For there, God wot, the painted Tulip reigns. But the wise Gods mind no such vanity, Phœbus above all Tulips values me. So does that Coan, old Hippocrates , Who the next place to Phœbus challenges. For when the Members Nature did divide, And over such or such bad Herbs preside; I of the savage and unruly Spleen, A stubborn Province, was created Queen. I that restrain, though it resist my power, And bring its swelling, rebel humor lower. The passages with Rampires it in vain Obstructs; I quickly break them down again. All Commerce I with speedy force restore, And the ways open all my Kingdom o'r. If I don't take that course, it furious grows, And into every part Contagion throws. With poisonous vapours it infects the blood, And Life it self drinks of a venomous flood. Foul Leprosie upon the skin appears, And the chang'd visage Deaths pale colours wears. Hence watchfulness, distracting cares, and tears, And pain proceeds; with hasty, killing fears. Hence Halters, cruel Love! our necks release | From thy more fatal Yoke; and Daggers ease | Our Souls of Life's incurable Disease: | May no such monstrous evils good Men hurt, Jove and my Virtue all such things avert! The Treasury Trajan rightly to the Spleen Compar'd; for, when that swells, the body's lean. Why do you laugh? Is it, because that I Pretend to know the Roman History, I a dull stock and not a Plant shou'd be, | Having so long kept Doctors company, | If their discourse shou'd not advantage me. | It has; and I great wonders cou'd relate, But I'm a Plant, that ne'r was given to prate. But to return from whence I have digrest, I many Creatures ease by Spleen opprest. Creet , though so used to lye, you may believe, [47] When for their Swine their thanks to me they give. The wretched Ass, whom constant labour tires, Sick of the Spleen my speedy aid desires. Eating my leaves (for I relieve his pain) He cheerfully resumes his work again. Now, if you can, vain, painted Flow'rs admire, Delights, scarce sooner born, than they expire. They're fair, 'tis true, they're cheerful and they're green; But I, though sad, procure a gladsom mein. [46] The Vertues of this Herb are told in its name. [47] Vitruvius says that in Creet , where this Herb abounds, the Swine have no Spleen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTUCE. SOme think your commendation you deserve, [48] 'Cause you of old Augustus did preserve. Why did you still prolong that fatal breath, That banish'd Ovid , and was Tully 's death? But I suppose that neither of 'em you, Nor Orator nor Poet ever knew; Wherefore I wonder not, you shou'd comply, And the Worlds Tyrant so far gratify. Thou truly to all Tyrants art of use, Their madness flies before thy pow'rful juice. Their heads with better wreaths, I pri'thee, crown, And let the World in them thy kindness own. At thy command forth from its scorched Heart, Of Tyrants Love the greatest does depart. False Love, I mean; for thou ne'r try'st t'expel True Love, who, like a good King, governs well. Justly that Dog star, Cupid , thou do'st hate, Whose fire kills Herbs, and Monsters does create. [48] Augustus is said to have been preserved in his Sickness by Lettuce. Plin.</field>

The Worlds first golden Age such Viands blest, I was the chief ingredient at a Feast: Large bodies for the Demigods my juice, And blood proportionable, did produce. Then neither fraud nor force, nor lust was known, Such ills their rise from too much heat must own. Let their vile Name religiously be curst, Who to base Glutt'ny gave dominion first. For thence sprang Vice, whose Train Distempers were, And Death did in new, ghastly shapes appear. Shun cruel Tables, that with blood are dy'd, And Banquets by destructive Death suppli'd.

      <field name="fulltext">EYEBRIGHT. ENter, sweet Stranger, to my Eyes reveal Thy self, and gratefully thy Poet heal. If I of Plants have any thing deserv'd, Or in my Verse their Honour be preserv'd. Thus, lying on the Grass and sad, pray'd I, Whilst nimbly Eye-bright came and stood just by. I wonder'd that so noble an Herb so soon Rose by my side like a Champignon; I saw her not before, nor did sh' appear, For any thing I knew, to be so near. On a black stalk, nine inches long she grew, With leaves all notch'd, and of a greenish hue. While pretty Flowers on her top she bore, With yellow mixt and purple streaks all ore. I knew her straight; her Name and Visage sute; And my glad Eyes their Patroness salute. Strange News! To me she bow'd with Flow'r and stalk, And thus, in Language fit for her, did talk. 'Twas low; for Herbs that modest custom love, Hoarse murmurs of the Trees they don't approve. Thou only Bard said she, o' th'verdant Race, Who in thy Songs do'st all our Virtues trace. All Men are not allow'd our Voice to hear, Though such respect to you, our Friend, we bear, We hate the custome, which with Men obtains, To slight a kind, ingenuous Poets pains. I wish my root cou'd heal you, and I'm sure, Our Nation all wou'd gladly see the Cure. [49] But if by Natures self it be withstood, The pow'r of Herbs, alas! can do no good. Natures injunctions none of us withstands, We're Slaves to all her Ladyships commands. Let what She gives your Appetite suffice, | Nor grumble, when she any thing denies. | For she with sparing Hands large gifts supplies. | But if some Malady impair the Sight, Or Wine, or Love, that's blind, and hates the Light; Or Surfeits, watchful Cares, or putrid Air, Or numerous other things, that hurtful are; Then am I useful: If you wou'd engage To count my Conquests, or the Wars I wage, The Ev'ning Star much sooner wou'd go down, And all the Fields in dewy Nectar drown. Oft a salt Flood which from the head descends, [50] With the Eyes fresher streams its current blends. That Pain, which causes many watery Eyes, [51] From its own tears it self does here arise. Oft times the Channels of a paler Flood [52] Are fill'd and swell with strange, unnatural blood; And by a Guest, who thither lately came, The House is set all on a raging flame. Take care, if your small worlds bright Sun appear Blood-red, or he'll soon leave your Hemishpere. Oft fumes and wandering Flies obscure the Eye, [53] And in those Clouds strange Monsters seem to fly. Fume, what does thy dull, sooty visage here? I see no fire, that thou shoud'st be so near. Or what (with a Mischief) means the troublesome Fly? I'd as soon have the God of Flies as nigh. Oft times the sight is dark'ned with false snow, [54] And night it self in blanched Robes does go; Whilst shapes of distant things, that real were, In different colours, or in none, appear. Tumours, and Cankers, Pustles, Ulcers why [55] Shou'd I recount, those torments of the Eye? Or thousands more which I'm affraid to name, Lest when I tell them they my Tongue inflame, Or that which from its hollow length Men call Fistula [Pipe] a name too Musical. All these I tame; the Air my vertue clears, Whilst the Clouds vanish and the day appears. The joyful Face smiles with diffused Light; What comeliness is mix'd with that delight! You know, Arnoldus (if you've read him o'r) [56] Did sight by me to Men stone-blind restore. 'Tis true; and my known virtue ought to be The more esteem'd for that strange Prodigy. With my kind leaves he bids you tinge your Wines, And profit with your pleasure wisely joins. Those Light will truly give, and sacred bowls, Bacchus will dwell in your enlarged Souls. Then call thy Boy, with a capacious Cup, And with that Wine be sure to fill it up, Till thou hast drunk, for all the amorous Dames, An Health to ev'ry Letter of their names. Then drink an Health to th'Eyes; they won't refuse (I'm confident) to pledge you in my juice. But we lose time; go; carefully rehearse What I have said in never-dying Verse. She spake, then vanishing away she flew; I (Reader) tell you nothing but what's true. [49] Of Plants. [50] Several Diseases of the Eyes are recounted. [51] Epiphora . [52] Ophthalmia .

      <field name="fulltext">WINTER-CHERRIES. WHen I stand musing (as I often do) I'm fill'd with shame and noble anger too; To think that all we Plants (except some few Whom Phœbus with more vigour did endue) Cannot away with Winters nipping fare, But more effeminate, than Mankind, are. From Father Sun, and Mother Earth in vain We sprang; they both your figure still retain. To our Delights why don't the Seasons yield, And banish Winter from each verdant Field? Why in Elysian Gardens don't we grow, Whe're no chill blasts may on our beauties blow? We're Halcyons forsooth, and can't with ease Bring forth, unless the world be all at peace. Nor is this softness only to be found Among small Herbs, still creeping on the ground: Great Elms and Oaks themselves it does controul. In their hard bark they wear a tender Soul. These Huffs Effeminacy count no crime; You'd think in Summer they to Heav'n wou'd climb. But if the Year its back upon them turn, Each Giant creeps back into th'Earth his Urn. Here lies—you on his bulky trunk may write; For shame! There lie; let not the mold lie light. But I, who very hardly dare receive The name of Shrub (though Pliny gives me leave) The dreadful Winter to the Combat dare; Though Heav'n it self shou'd fall, I'd take no care. The Winter comes; and I'm by storms alarm'd, She comes with Legions numberless, well arm'd. Then I my fruit produce, and having first Expos'd them to her, cry, Now, do thy worst. Pour, pour upon them all the Rain i' th'Skie, It will not wast away their scarlet die. Pour Snow, their Purple thence will grow more bright, Some red in a white Vessel gives delight. So the red lip the Ivory teeth befriends, And a white Skin the rosy Cheeks commends. With such like rudiments do I inure My Virtue, and the force of it secure: I, who rebellious Sickness must subdue, And every day fresh Victories pursue. Thus did I learn vast stones to break in twain, [57] And Ice, at first, put me to little pain. For I not onely water do expel, (That other weaker Plants can do as well) But such hard Rocks of Adamant I break, As Hannibal to pass wou'd prove too weak. Unhappy He, who on this Rock is tost, And shipwrack'd is on his own waters lost! Even Sisyphus might pity and bemoan The Wretch that's tortur'd with an inbred stone. How does he envy, ah, how much, the dead, Whose Corps with stones are only covered! Wou'd I not help him? Might the Earth divide, And swallow me, if I my aid deni'd. Then I my self child of some Rock must own, And that my roots were veins of hardest stone. But truly I do pity such a Man, And the obdurate matter quickly can Dissolve; my piercing Liquor round it lies, And straight into a thousand parts it flies. The long obstructed streams then glide away, And fragments with them of the Stone convey. [57] It is excellent against the Stone and all Diseases of the Bladder, thence in Latin call'd Vesicaria .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUN-DEW or LUSTWORT [58] TO say the truth Nature's too kind to Thee, For all thy days thou spend'st in luxury. Thy Flowers are Silver, and a purple Down Covers thy body, like a Silken Gown: Whilst, to increase thy pomp and pride, each vein Of thine a Golden humour does contain. Each leaf is hollow made, just like a Cup, Which Liquor always to the brim fills up. The drunken Sun cannot exhaust thy bowl, Nor Sirius himself, that thirsty Soul. Full thou survey'st the parched Fields around, And enviously in thy own floods art drown'd. Drinking, the thirsty months thou laugh'st away, day. Thy Nile from secret sources moistens Thee, And bids Thee merry, though Jove angry be. [58] Vulgarly call'd also Rosa Solis .</field>

This Herb, with Plenty's bounteous current feeds, Plenty which constantly it self succeeds. So thy extended Guts thy Godship swills, And its own self thy titled Hogshead fills. So at Joves Table Gods the Goblet drain, But straight with Nectar it grows full again. Nor do the Cups the Phrygian Stripling need, To fill them; each is his own Ganymede . So in the Heart, that double lusty bowl (In which the Soul it self drinks Life and Soul) That Heav'nly bowl, made by an Heav'nly hand, With purple Nectar always crown'd does stand. Of what she spends Nature ne'r feels the lack, What one throws out, another brings it back. Blest Plant, brimful of moisture radical! No wonder thou the Spirits, lest they fall, Support'st, or that Consumptive bodies you, And the firm Limbs bind with a lasting glue. Or that lifes Lamp, which ready is to die, With such vivacious Oil you can supply. No wonder to the Lungs thou grateful art, Thy constant waters feed that spongy part.

You bravely Men and other Plants outvie, Who no kind Office do, until they die; Thy Virtues thou, yet living, do'st impart, And ev'n to thy own Garden Physick art.

My conquering hand Pimpgenets cannot shun, Nor blackish, yellow spots the Face o'r run; Morphew departs, and out each Freckle flies, Though from our god himself they had their rise.

Thorns, splinters, nails I draw, who wondering stand How they could so come forth without an hand. This is the least: all Poisons I expel, And Death force thence, where it was like to dwell. Infants that know not what it is to live, Before they're wretched, from the Womb I drive. Oh Heavens! says th'ignorant amazed world; What's this? Is't a Distemper to be born? Yes, 'tis.

[65] DAunian Arachne ! who spinn'st all the day, [66] Nor to Minerva will't ev'n yet give way; Whilst thy own bowels thou to Lawn dost weave, What pleasure canst thou from such pains receive? Why thy sad hours in such base deeds dost spill, Or do things so ridiculously ill? Why dost thou take delight to stop our breath, Or act the serious sports of cruel Death. Whom thou scarce touchest straight to rave he's found, He raves although he hardly feels thy wound. One Atome of thy Poison in the veins, Dominion soon o'r all the body gains. Within upon the Soul her self it preys, Which it distracts a thousand cruel ways. One's silent, whilst another roars aloud; He's fearful, t'other fights with th'gazing crowd. This cryes, and this his sides with laughter shakes, A thousand habits this same Fury takes. But all with love of Dancing are possest, All day and night they dance and never rest. As soon as Musick from struck strings rebounds, Or the full Pipes breath forth their Magick sounds; The stiff old Woman straight begins a Round, And the Lethargick Sleeper quits the ground. The poor lame Fellow, though he cannot prance So nimbly as the rest, he hops a Dance. The old Man, whom this merry Poison fires, Satyrs themselves with dancing almost tires. To such a sad, phrenetick Dance as this A Siren, sure, the fittest Minstrel is. Cruel Distemper! thy wild fury proves Worst Master of the Revels which it loves: When this sad Pyrrhick measure they begin, [67] Ah! what a weight hangs on their hearts within. Tell me, Physicians! which way shall I ease Poor mortals of this strange, unknown disease? For me may Phœbus never more protect (Whose Godhead you and I so much respect) If I know any more (to tell you true) Whence this dire mischief springs, than one of you. But to the heart (you know it) and the brain, | Those distant Provinces, in which I reign, | (To you, my friends, I no false stories feign.) | Auxiliary troops of Spirits I Send, and the Camp with fresh Recruits supply. Many kind Plants besides Me to the War Attend, nor blush that under me they Soldiers are. The merry Baum, and Rue which Serpents kills, Cent'ry, and Saffron from Cilician Hills, And thou, kind Birthwort , whose auspicious Name From thy good deeds to teeming Women came. The kind Pomegranate also does engage, With her bright Arms, and my dear Sister Sage . Berries of Laurel, Myrtle, Tamarisk, Ivy nor Juniper are very brisk. Lavender , and sweet Marjoram march away, Sothernwood and Angelica don't stay. Plantain , the Thistle which they Blessed call, And useful Wormwood in their order fall, Then Carrot, Anise , and white Cumin seed, With Gith , that pretty, chast, black Rogue, proceed. Next Vipers-grass a Plant but lately known, And Tormentil and Roses red, full blown; To which I Garlick may and Onions join; All these to fight I lead; go, give the sign. With indignation I am vex'd, and hate Soft Musick that great praise shou'd arrogate. Poets will say, 'tis true (they're given to lye) Willing their Mistris so to gratifie. But food I say it does, not Physick, prove To madmen (witness, all that are in Love!) She to a short-liv'd folly does supply Constant additions of new vanity; And here (to shew her Wit and Courage too) Flatters the Tyrant, whom she shou'd subdue. It is the greatest part of the Disease, That she does so immoderately please, 'Tis part of the Disease, that so they throw And toss themselves, which does for Physick go; This Plague it self is plagu'd so night and day That tir'd with labour it flies quite away. I also lend an hand, to ease her grief, When from her own strength Nature seeks relief. 'Tis something that I do; but truly I Think the Disease is its own Remedy. [65] An Insect of the Spider-kind.

      <field name="fulltext">MINT. TAke my advice, Men! and no Riddles use; [68] Why won't you rather to speak plainly choose? If you're affraid, your secrets shou'd be told, Your tongues you (that's the surest way) may hold. Why shou'd we Sense with barbarous cruelty Put to the Rack, to make it tell a lye? Of this just reason I have to complain; Old dubious Saws long since my fame do stain. How many ill conjectures grounded are On this, that I must ne'r be set in War. The Reader of a thing obscure will be Inclin'd to carp, and to take liberty. Hence one says, Mint, Mars does entirely hate, And Mint to Venus also is ingrate. Mars loves as well to get as to destroy Mankind, the booty of his fierce employ. Mint from the seed all seminal virtue takes, And of brisk Men dull frigid Eunuchs makes. And then (to make the spreading error creep Farther and farther still) they hear I keep Their Milk from thickning; but how this I do I'll tell you on these terms alone, That you Shall me before resolve how first you gain Notions of things, then, how you them retain. This I dare boldly say; the fire of Love With genial heat I gently do improve; Though constantly the noble, human seed That sacred Lamp with vital Oil does feed: For what to Venus e'r will faithful seem, If Heat it self an Enemy you esteem? Whether I know her Proserpine can tell, [69] I by my punishment am clear'd too well. [70] Besides, nought more the stomach rectifies, Or strengthens the digestive faculties. Such, such a Plant that feeds the amorous flame, If Venus love not, she is much to blame; And with ingratitude the seed I may Charge, if to me great thanks it do not pay. But other causes others have assign'd, Who make the reason, which they cannot find. They say, Wounds, if I touch them, bleed anew, And I wound wounds themselves; 'tis very true. For I a dry, astringent Pow'r retain, By which all Ulcers of their gore I drain. I Bloody fluxes stop, my Virtue's sure The Wounds that Natures self has made to cure. On bites of Serpents and mad Dogs I seize And them (Wars hurts are slight) I heal with ease. I scarce dare mention, that from Galling, I, If in the hand I'm born, preserve the thigh. D' ye laugh? laugh on, so I with laughter may Requite the scandals which on me you lay. Of which some I omit; and the true cause Of all will tell (and then she made a pause.) Though I abhor my sorrows to recal (And here the tears down her green cheeks did fall) I did not always in your Gardens grow, But once a comely Virgins face cou'd show. Black though I was ( Cocytus was my Sire) Yet Beauty had to kindle am'rous fire. Lest anyone should think this is a lye, Ovid will tell you so as well as I. [71] My Father had a pleasant, shady Grove, Where he perpetually to walk did love. There mournful Yew, and funeral Cypress grow, | Whose melancholy Greens no Winter know, | With other Trees whose looks their sorrow shew. Here Pluto , ( Jove of the infernal Throne) Saw me, as I was walking all alone. He saw me and was pleas'd; for his desire At any face, or white or black, takes fire. Ah! if you knew him but so well as I, He's an unsatiable Deity! He never stands a tender Maid to woo, But cruelly by violence falls to. He caught me, though I fled till out of breath I was; I thought he wou'd ha' been my death. What cou'd I do? his strength was far above Mine; he, the strength has of his Brother Jove . In short, Me to a secret Cave he lead, And there the Ravisher got my Maidenhead; But in the midst of all his wickedness, (How it fell out the Poets don't express. Nor can you think that I, poor Creature, well The cause at such a time as that cou'd tell) Lo! Proserpine , his Wife came in, and found My wretched limbs all prostrate on the ground. She no excuse wou'd hear, nor me again Let rise; but said, There fix'd I shou'd remain. She spake, and straight my body I perceiv'd, (Each limb dissolv'd) of all its strength bereav'd. My Veins are all straight rooted in the Earth (From whence my ruddy stalk receives its birth) A blushing crown of Flowers adorns my head, My leaves are jagged, of a darkish red, And so a lovely Bed of Mint I make In the same posture, that she did me take. But the infernal Ravisher my Fate ('Twou'd move a Devil) did commiserate; And, his respect for what I was, to show, great Virtue on my leaves he did bestow. Rich qualities to humble Me he gave, Of which my fragrant Smell's the least I have. All this the Ancients understood was true, And thence their great Religious caution grew. They thought me sacred to th'infernal King, And that 'twas ominous for me to spring In times of death and danger, nor wou'd let Me in the midst of war and blood be set. But they mistaken were; for I take care | That others be not caught in his strong snare, | Nor pass the Stygian Lake without gray hair. | [68] Aristotle gave the World a Rule, Neither eat Mint nor plant it in time of War ; which being variously understood by his Followers; The said Herb does in this Speech make out, that it can with no sense be interpreted to its dishonour, by telling her Virtues in chearing the Spirits and exciting the Stomach.

      <field name="fulltext">MISSELTOE. WElcome, thrice welcome, sacred Misseltoe ! The greatest Gift, Teutates does bestow. [72] With more Religion, Druid Priests invoke Thee, than thy sacred, sturdy Sire, the Oak. Raise holy Altars from the verdant ground, And strow your various Flowers all around: Next let the Priest when to the Gods h' 'as paid [73] All due Devotion, and his Or'sons made, Cloth'd all in white, by the attendants be, With Hands and Necks rais'd to the sacred Tree. Where that he may more freely it receive, Let him first beg the Shrubs indulgent leave. And when h' 'as cut it with a golden hook, Let the expecting crowd, that upward look, Array'd in White, the falling Treasure meet, And catch it in a pure, clean snowy Sheet. Then let two spotless Bulls before him lie, And with their grateful blood the Altar die. Which when you've done then feast, and dance, and sing, And let the Wood with their loud voices ring. Such honour had the Misseltoe ; which hate And envy to it did in Gods create. Th' Egyptian Temples do not louder sound, When there again th'adored Heifer's found. Nor did she seem less Majesty to wear (If any Tree there, Misseltoe did bear) When in Dodonas Grove upon an Oak She grew, that in its hollow Ora'cles spoke; For this one Plant the Ancients, above all, Protectress of their Life did think and call: She onely from the Earth loaths to be born, And on the meaner ground to tread thinks scorn. Nor did she from prolifick matter come, But like the World from Nothings fruitful womb. Others are set and grow by humane care, Her leaves the product of mere Nature are. Hence Serpents She of their black stings disarms, [74] And baffles (Mans worse Poison) Magick Charms; Besides all other kinds of Maladies (How numberless; alas!) that on us seize. Nor wonder, that all others ills it beats, Since the Herculean Sickness it defeats, [75] Than which none more Chiæra-like appears; One part on't's dead, the other raves and tears. This Monster she subdues; hence 'twas believ'd (And truly though 'twas false, it was receiv'd On no bad grounds) that lesser Monsters She Cou'd make the Trophies of her Victory. The Antients thought so in the infancy O' th'World, they then knew nought of Fallacy. Nor was She then thought onely to defend, | And guard Lifes Fort, but Life it self to lend, | Ev'n the Wombs fruitful Soil t'improve and mend; | For what Soil barren to that Plant can be, Which without Seed has its Nativity? Or what to her close shut and lock'd can seem, That makes th'obdurate Oaks hard entrails teem? That from a Tree comes forth in pangs and pain, Like the Athenian Goddess from Jove 's brain. But if that's true, which Antient Bards have writ (For though they're Antient Bards , I question it) [76] I wonder not, that Misseltoe 's so kind To us, since her the ties of Nature bind. For Men of old, (if you'll believe 'twas so) Born out of Oaks, were the first Misseltoe . [72] Teutates and Hesus were the two greatest Gods of the Gauls .

SEE how the yellow Gall the delug'd Eyes, [77] And Saffron Jaundice the whole Visage dies; That colour, which on Gold we think so fair; That hue which most adorns the tressed hair, When, like a Tyrant, it unjustly gains Anothers Throne, and there usurping reigns, It frightful grows, and far more beauty lacks Than, with their Saddle-noses, dusky Blacks. So (I suppose) to the Gods Eyes, the Soul O' th'Miser looks; as yellow and as foul. For if with Gold alone the Soul's inflam'd, It has th' Aurigo , from that Metal nam'd. This the almighty Gods can onely cure; And Reason, more than Herbs, our minds secure. But th'outward Jaundice does Our help implore; When with Gall floods the body's dy'd all o're. I cannot tell what others do; but I Give to that Jaundice present remedy; Nor do I rashly undertake the cure, I an Assistant have, that makes me sure. Natures own Patent gives me my command. See, here's her own sign manual, here's her hand. [78] Through leaves, and stalk and roots themselves it goes, The yellow blood through my whole body flows. Whoever me dissects, wou'd think, nay swear, O'rflown with Gall I sick o' th'Jaundice were. Mean time my skin all o'r is fresh and green, And colour good, as in an Herb you've seen. [77] A Decoction hereof with White-wine and Annise-seeds, is said to be excellent against the Jaundies . Mathiolus says it will cure the same, being applied to the soles of the feet.

TEN thousand blessings may the Gods bestow [79] Upon Thee, tunefull Swallow ! and ne'r show, [80] They bear the least resentment of that Crime, Which thou hast suffer'd for so long a time. For that the use of a choice Plant thou'st taught, Which ne'r before blind Man had seen or sought. Of Thee large Rent now e'ry House receives For th'Nests which they to Thee let under th'eaves. The painted Springs whole train on thee attend, Yet nought thou seest which thou canst more commend. For this it is that makes thee all things see, This Plant a special favour has for thee. When thou com'st, th'others come; that won't suffice; At thy return away This with thee flies. Yet we to it must more engagements own; 'Tis a small thing to heal the Eyes alone; Ten thousand torments of our Life it cures, [81] From which good Fortune you, blest Birds, secures. The Gripes by its approach it mitigates, And tortures of an aking tooth abates. The golden Jaundice quickly it defeats, And with gilt Arms at his own weapons beats: Jaundice, which Morbus Regius they call, From a King; but falsly; 'tis Tyrannical. Foul Ulcers too that from the body bud, This dries and drains of all their putrid blood. A gaping Wounds one Lip, like any Brother, Approaches nearer and salutes the other. Nor do thy shankers now, foul Lust! remain, But all thy shealing scabs rub off again. The burning Cancer and the Tetter fly, Whilst all hot, angry, red biles sink and dry. The Sun once printed kisses, disappear. Purg'd of all blemishes the smiling face Is cleaner far, and smoother than its Glass. Kind Friend to th'Eyes! who giv'st not onely sight, But with it also Objects that delight. She may be seen, as well as come to see, Whatever Woman's doubly blest by thee: The gaudy Spring by thy approach is known, And blooming Beauties thy arrival own.

They'll be a Banquet to you all the night, On them the body chews with fresh delight. But you, chaste Lads, and Girls, that lie alone, And none of Loves enjoyments yet have known, Take care and stand aloof, if you are wise; Touch not this Plant, Venus her Sacrifice; | I bring a Poison for your Modesties. | In my Grass, like a Snake, blind Cupid lies, | And with my juice his deadly weapons dies. The God of Gardens no Herb values more, Or courts, presents, or does himself devour. This is the reason, hot Priapus , why (As I suppose) you itch so constantly, And that your Arms still ready are to do, The wicked business that you put 'em to. Let him who Love wou'd shun, from me remove, Says Naso , that Hippocrates in Love. [83] Yet to his Table I was duly serv'd, Who my choice Dainty to himself reserv'd. Prove that from Love he ever wou'd be free, More chast than Lettuce I'll consent to be, The praise of Chastity let others keep, And gratifie the widow'd Bed with sleep. Action's my Task, bold Lovers to engage, And to precipitate the sportive Rage. Frankly I own my Nature, I delight In Love unmix'd and restless Appetite. From curing Maladies I seek no Fame, (Though ev'n for that I might put in my Claim) [84] Fuel I bring that Pleasure may not cease: Take that from Life, and Life is a Disease. If thus you like me, make me your Repast, I wou'd not gratifie a Stoicks tast. If Morals gross and crude be your delight, Marsh weeds can best oblige your Appetite.

From these chaste Herbs and their chast Poet flee, Us thou offend'st and w'are asham'd of thee. With such a Prostitute to come in view, Chast Matrons think a Sin and Scandal too. Blushes pale Water-Lilies cheeks o'r-spread, To be with thee in the same Volumn read. Who still the sad remembrance does retain, How when a Nymph, in thee she gorg'd her Bane.

Lascivious Plant, some other Poet find, For Ovid 's or Catullus Verse design'd: For thou in mine shalt have no place at all, Or in the List of pois'nous Herbs shalt fall. The flames of Lust of fewel have no need, His Appetite without thy Sawce can feed. Love in our very Diet finds his way, And makes the Guards that should defend, betray. Our other Ills permit our Herbs to cure Venus , who plague enough in thee endure. Those Plants which Nature made of Sex devoid, Improperly are in thy work employ'd. Yet Venus too much skill'd in impious Arts, These forein aids to her own use converts. Who'd think green Plants with constant dew supply'd, (Life's Friends design'd) such mortal Flame shou'd hide? What wonder therefore if when Monarchs feast, Lust is of Luxury the constant Guest? When He who with the Herd on Herbage fed [86] Cou'd find her lurking in the verdant Bed. The End of the First Book.

Allow the female Secrets, do not pry, Or them at least pretend you don't descry. 'Tis rude that Sex t'inspect too narrowly, Whose outside with such Beauties treats the Eye. Auspicious Glory of th'inlighten'd Skie, More sacred than thy Brothers Deity, With thy whole Horns, kind Luna , favour me, And let thy crescent Face look luckily. Thee many Names and Offices adorn. By thy kind aid poor, tender Babes are born: [88] Thou easest Women, when their Labour's hard, And the Wombs vital Gates you, Jana , guard. The menstruous courses you bring down, and them, Changing convert into a milky stream. Women, unconstant as the Sea, you bind, To Rules; both flow according to thy mind. Oh! may the Rivolets of my Fancy glide By the same secret force, which moves the Tide. Be thou the Midwife to my teeming brain, And let it fruitful be as free from pain. It was the time, when April decks the year, And the glad Fields in pompous garbs appear. How pleas'd they are the Heav'ns again to see, And that from Winters fetters they are free! The World around, and Sisters, whom they love, They view; such Objects sure their smiles must move. Straight their great work the diligent Nation ply, And bus'ness mind amidst their luxury. Each one contends with all her might and main Each day an higher, verdant Crown to gain. Each one does leaves with beauteous Flow'rs, produce, And hastens to be fit for humane use. Equipp'd they make no stay, but one and all, Intent upon th'Affair, a Council call. Each Tribe (for there are many) as of old Their custome was, a separate Council hold. They're near a thousand Tribes; their Minutes well An hundred Clerk-like tongues can scarcely tell. Nor cou'd I know them (for they won't reveal Their sacred Acts, but cautiously conceal) Had not my Laurel told me (whose Tribes name The Female 's stil'd) which summon'd thither came. The secrets of the House she open laid, Telling, how each Herb spoke and what it said. Ye gentle, Floral part of humane kind (To you and not to Men, I speak) pray mind My words, and them most stedfastly believe, Which from the Delphick Laurel you receive. 'Twas midnight, (whilst the Moon, at full, shone bright, And her Cheeks seem'd to swell with moisten'd light) When on their loosen'd roots the Plants, that grow In th' Oxford Gardens, did to Council go; And such, I mean, as succour Womens pains; Orpheus , you'd think, had mov'd them by his strains. They met upon a bed, neat, smooth and round, And softly sate in order on the ground. Mugwort first took her place (at that time She The President of the Council chanc'd to be.) Birthwort , her Predecessor in the Chair, Next sate, whose virtues breeding Women share. Then Bawm , with smiles and pleasure in her face, Without regard to Dignity took place. Tyme, Sav'ry, Wormwood , which looks ruggedly, Sparagus, Sothernwood both He and She, [89] And Crocus too, glad still soft Maids to chear, [90] Once a sad Lover, merry does appear, And thou, Amaracus , who a trifling Ill [91] Didst mourn, when thou the fragrant Box didst spill Of Ointment, in this place now far more sweet Than the occasion of thy Death dost meet. There Lilies with red Peonies find a Room, And purple Violets the place perfume. Yea noisome Devils turd , because she knows [92] Her worth, into that sweet Assembly goes. The milky Lettuce too does thither move, And Water-Lily , though a foe to Love. Sweet Ladies glove with stinking Horehound come, And kind Germander which relieves the Womb. Poley and Calamint , which on Mountains dwell, But against Frost and Snow are guarded well. Next vital Sage , well join'd with wholsom Rue. And Flower-de-luce , nam'd from its splendid hue. Then Hart-wort (much more grateful to the Deer Than Dittany ) with Wild Carrots , enters there. Consound and Plantain ; frugal herbs are they, [93] Who all things keep safe under Lock and Key. And Master-wort , whose name Dominion wears, With her, who an Angelick Title bears. [94] Lavender, Corn-rose, Pennyroyal sate, And that which Cats esteem so delicate. [95] After a while, slow-pac'd, with much ado, Ground-pine with her short Legs crept thither too. Behind the rest Camomile cou'd not stay, Through stones and craggy Rocks she cut her way. From Spanish Woods the wholsome Vett'ny came, [96] The only glory of the Vettons name. Minerva 's Plant did likewise thither hie, And was Companion to Mercury. There Scarlet Madder too a place did find, Drawing a train of its long root behind. Thither at last too Dittany did repair, Half-starv'd, and griev'd to leave the Cretan air. With her the bold, strong Sow-bread came along, And hundred more (in short) to them did throng. Many besides from th' Indies cross'd the main, Plants, that of our chill Clime did much complain. But Oxfords Fame; through both the Indies told, Eas'd all their cares, and warm'd the nipping cold: The Pigmey and Gigantick Sons o' th'Wood Betwixt all these in equal spaces stood; Spreading their verdant glories round above, Which did delight and admiration move. The scarlet Oak, that Worms for fruit brings forth, Which the Hesperian fruit exceed in worth, Was there, good Womens Maladies to ease, And Sprains, which we as truly call, Disease. Her treacherously the Ivy does embrace, And kills the Tree with kindness in her face. Hardly, in nobler Scarlet clad, the Rose, The envy of those stately Berries grows. Near which the Birch her rigid Arms extends, And Savine which kind Sinners much befriends. Next them the Beech with limbs so strong and large, With the Bush purchas'd at so small a charge. Nor did the golden Quince her self conceal, Or Myrrh, whose wounds distemper'd Mortals heal. [97] Lastly (ye Plants whom I forget to name | Excuse me) Juniper too thither came, [98] | And Laurel , sacred to the Sons of Fame. | Such reverend Heads did the green Senate fill; The Night was calm, all things were hush'd and still; Each Plant, with listening leaves stood mute to hear Their Pres'dent speak; and these her Dictates were.

Our thanks to Thee, great Father, Sun! we pay, | And to thee, Luna ! for thy nursing Ray; | Who the bright Witness art of what we say. | But the short moments of our Liberty (Who fetter'd at Day break again must lie) Let us improve, and our affairs attend, Nor festal hours, like idle Mortals, spend. 'Tis fit at this time we shou'd truly live, When Winters colds of half our life deprive. Come then, from useful pains make no delay, Winter will give you too much time to play. How many Foes Jove has to you assign'd, And what a task you in the Conquest find, By numerous and great fatigues you've try'd, And to th'opprest kind aid have oft supply'd. You're generous, noble; female Plants, nor ought The glory of your Sex cheap to be bought. The self same Battels you must wage again, Which will as long as teeming Wombs remain. But that to War you may securer go 'Tis fit the foes and your own strength you know. Call the bright Moon to witness what you say, Whilst each such tributes to their Countrey pay. Let each one willingly both teach and learn, Nor let that move their envy or their scorn. And first (I think) upon the menstruous source My constant task, 'tis fit we shou'd discourse. From what original Spring that Nilus goes, Or by what influx it so oft o'rflows. What will restrain, and what drive on the tide, And what goods or what mischiefs in it glide.

FIrst PENNY-ROYAL , to advance her Fame (And from her mouth a grateful Odour came) Tells 'em, they say, how many ills that source Threatens, whene'r it stops its purple course. That foggy dulness in the Limbs attends, And under its own weight the body bends. Things ne'r so pleasant once, now will not please, And Life it self becomes a mere Disease. Ulcers and Inflammations too it breeds, And dreadful, bloudy, vomiting succeeds. The Womb now labouring seems to strive for breath, And the Soul struggles with a short liv'd Death. The Lungs opprest hard respiration make, And breathless Coughs soon all the fabrick shake. Yea the proud foes the Capitol, in time; And all the minds well-guarded Towers climb. Hence watchful Nights, but frightful Dreams proceed, And minds that suffer true, false evils breed. Dropsie at last the wearied Life o'rflows, Which floating from its shipwreck'd Vessel goes. How oft, alas! poor, tender, blooming Maids (Before Loves pow'r their kinder hearts invades) Does this sad Malady with Clouds o'rcast, Which all the longing Lovers passion blast? The Face looks green, the ruddy Lips grow pale, Like Roses tinctur'd by a sulphurous gale. To ashes, coals, and Lime their appetite (A loathsom treat) their stomach does invite. But 'tis a sin to say, the Ladies eat Such things; those are the vile distempers meat. Thus Penny-royal spake (more passionate In words, than humane voice can e'r relate) At which, they say, the whole Assembly mov'd Wept o'r the loss of Beauty, once belov'd. So that good Company, when Day returns, The setting of the Moon, their Mistress mourns. She told the means too; by what secret aid That conquering Ill did all the limbs invade. Through the Wombs Arteries, said she, it goes, And unto all the noted passes flows. (Whether the Wombs magnetick pow'rs the cause, As the whole bodies floods the Kidney draws; Or that the Moon, the Queen of fluid things Directs and rules that, like the Oceans springs.) But if the Gates it finds so fortified, That the due current that way be deny'd; It rages and it swells; the gross part stays, And in the neighbouring parts dire revels plays: Whilst the more liquid part does upward rise, And into veins of purer nature flies. It taints the rosie Channels, as it goes, And all the soil's corrupted, where it flows. The bane its journey through the Cava takes, [99] And fierce attacks upon the Liver makes, And Heart, whose right-side Avenue it commands, Whilst that for fear amaz'd and trembling stands. But the left Region so well-guarded seems, That in her walls safe she her self esteems. Nor stops it there, but on the Lungs does seize, Where drawing breath it self grows a Disease. Thence through a small Propontis carried down, It makes the Port and takes the left-side Town. What will suffice that covetous Disease, Which all the Hearts vast treasures cannot please? But Avarice still craves for more and more, And if it all things don't enjoy, is poor. Th' Aorta its wild Legions next engage, Bless me! how uncontroul'd in that they rage! The distant head and heel no safety knows, Through ev'ry part th'unbounded Victor flows. But as the bloud through all the body's us'd To run, this Plague through all the bloud's diffus'd. They all agreed; for none of them e'r doubt, How Life in Purple Circles wheels about. That Plant they'd hiss out of their company, Which Harvey 's Circulation shou'd deny.

For what can hinder Grecian plants to be Rhetorical, when they occasion see? For Penny-royal , painting that Disease, Her nice, and quainter fansie did not please. She spake to what the other did omit, And pleas'd her self with her own prating wit. If this dire Poisons force their duller Eyes Can't see, whilst in the body warm it lies, Think with your selves how it offends the sense, When all alone (nay dead) if driven thence. Let Dogs or Men by chance but taste of it (But on Dogs rather let such mischiefs light.) Madness the tainted Soul invades within, And sordid Leprosie rough casts the skin: While panting Dogs quite raving mad appear, [100] And thirst for water, but the water fear. It stabs an half-Man by abortive birth, And from the Womb (oh! horrid) drags it forth. Now fansie Children born of such base bloud, Which gives the Embryo Poison 'stead of food. Nor is this all; for Corn and Vines too know Its baneful force, by which fields barren grow. A Tree, once us'd to bear, its fruit denies; If young it fades, and if new-born, it dies. Witness the Ivies ('tis no shame) to you What good does their medicinal virtue do? These also, Rue ! who all things do'st o'rcome, From this strong venom must receive thy doom. Plants dry and yellow, as in Autumn , grow, And Herbs, as if they had the Jaundice, show. Offended Bees with one small touch it drives (Though murmuring to be exil'd) from their hives. The wretched Creatures leave their golden store, And sweet abodes, which they must see no more. Nor do strong Fats their wine within defend, Which in their very youth draw to their end. But I name things of litle eminence; The warlike Sword it self makes no defence; And Metals, which so oft have won the Field, To this effeminate distemper yield. For frequent bloudshed, bloud now vengeance takes, And mortal wounds ev'n in the weapons makes. Beauty, the thing, for which we Women love, Th'occasion of keen Swords does often prove; Let then the female-plague those Swords rebate, Yea even the mem'ry of what's so ingrate. Maids with proud thoughts, alas! themselves deceive, Whilst each herself a Goddess does believe; Like Tyrants they misuse the po'r they have, And make their very Worshiper their Slave. But if they truly would consider things, And think what filth each month returning brings, If they their cheating Glasses then wou'd mind, | (Which now they think so faithful and so kind) | How beautiful they are they needs must find. The smooth Corrupter of their looks they taint, Which long and certain signs at that time paint. Each Maid in that still suffers the disgrace Of being poisoner to her own face. What an unnatural Distemper's this, Which ev'n to their own shadows mortal is. Thus she, and as much more she was about To say, the whole Assembly gave a shout. Through all the boughs and all the leaves around There went an angry, loud and murm'ring sound. For they of Womens honour tender are, Though she thereof had seem'd to take no care.

Greek Poets, Ditt'ny , you who oft have read, [102] Keep up their Art of lying, though they're dead. But what their Countrymen once said of you [103] Pray mind it, for I fear 'tis very true. Let that which blasts the Corn a Goddess be, [104] I cannot think her courses e'r cou'd be So hurtful to the grain. And then, I 'm sure, A Fat of lusty Wine is more secure From danger, where a thousand Damsels sit, Than if one drunken Beldam come at it. None, cause a tast of that rank bloud they've had, But for the place, from whence it comes, run mad. Madness of Dogs most certainly it cures, As thy own Author Pliny us assures. Whether by Womens touch the Bee's annoy'd I cannot tell; but Maids shou'd Bees avoid. Rue ought to let the fatal blou'd remain | Within its Vessel and ne'r force a vein, | If for her pains nought but her death she gain. | Thou, Ivy , too more careful oughtst to be Both of thy self and thy great Deity. [105] But when she says, Swords edges it rebates, | I cou'd rejoice methinks and bless the Fates, | If that be all the mischief it creates. | I only wish a Beauty might remain Perfect, till that the Lookinglass wou'd stain. But I wast time—By this sufficiently | These Grecian wonders are o'erthrown, that I | No Woman see of this dread Poison die. | At which the Bramble rose (whose fluent tongue With thorny sharpness arm'd it neatly hung) And said, all Serpents have the gift to be, As much as these, from thir own venom free; Nor wou'd the Basilisk , whose baneful Eye All others kills, by his own Image die. This mov'd 'em and they quaver'd with a smile, Some Wind you wou'd ha' thought, pass'd by the while, For by that Cynick Shrub great Freedoms shown, Which he by constant use has made his own. Way-bred at this took pet, displeas'd, that she By such an one shou'd interrupted be, And sate her down; when straight before 'em all These words the Rose from her fair lips let fall; Whilst modest blushes beautified her face, Like those in Spring, that blooming Flowers grace. [101] The many Virtues of Plantain are to be read in Pliny and Fernelius . The old Physician Themison wrote a whole Volume concerning them. [102] See Dittany . [103] Epimenides Cretensis said, The Cretans were always Lyars. [104] Rubigo . [105] Bacchus , to whom the Ivy is consecrated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ROSE. YOU Cretan Dittany , who such Poisons mix (For on my Kinsman Wild-rose I'll not fix) With Womens blood; see what a sprightly grace And ardent Scarlet decks their lovely face. No Flower, no not Flora 's self to sight Or touch than these appears more soft and white. But at the same time also take a view Of Mans rough, prickly limbs and rusty hue. You'll say with Butchers-broom sweet Violets grow, And mourn that Lilies shou'd with Brambles go. Then let their Eyes and Reason testifie, Whether pure veins their purer limbs supply. You cannot say that Dying Vat is bad, From whence a florid colour may be had. But this you'll say, committed some offence, Or the just Moon had never driv'n it thence. No, you're mistaken; it has done no wrong, But all the fault lies in its copious throng: It therefore from the rest, by the great Law Of publick safety, order'd to withdraw. So if a Nation to such numbers rise, That them their native Countrey can't suffice; To seek new Lands some part of them are sent, And suffer, for their Countrey, banishment. But why does Woman-kind so much abound? Oh! think not Nature e'r was lavish found. Nor does she lay up Riches to the end (Like Prodigals) she more may have to spend. Whate'r she does is good; what then remains? No room for doubt; the thing it self explains. This bloudy Vintage, see, lasts all the year, And the fresh Chyle duely does Life repair. The Presses still with juice swell to the brink Of which their fill the hot, male bodies drink. But temperate Women seem to kiss the Cup, Nor does their heat suck all the liquor up. A vital treasure for great uses She Lays up, lest Nature shou'd a Bankrupt be. Lest both the Parents shares of mingled Love Too little to beget a Child shou'd prove, Unless the Mother some addition made To perfect the design they both had laid. One part on't's red, the other white as snow, And both from springs of the same colour flow. One wood, you'd think, and t'other stones did yield, Whilst out of both a living House they build. The former, of such poysoning Arts accus'd, In which you fansie, venom is infus'd, (Perhaps with this that fatal Robe was dy'd, Which Hercules had sent him from his Bride) The tender Embryos body does compose, And for ten months to kind nutrition goes. Nor is this all; but on the Mothers breast Again it meets the little Infant Guest. Then chang'd it comes both in its hue and course, Like Arethusa through a secret Source. Then from the Paps it flows in double tides Far whiter than the banks in which it glides. The golden Age of old such Rivers drank, That spring from Dugs of e'ry happy bank. The candor and simplicity of Men Deserv'd the milky food of the Infants then. How just and prudent is Dame Natures care Who for each age does proper food prepare! Before the Liver's form'd, the Mother's bloud Supplies the Babe with necessary food. And when to work the Novice Heat first goes In its new shop, and scarce its bus'ness knows, Its first imployment is in Scarlet grain (A childish task for learners) Milk to stain. At last in e'ry kind its skill it tries, And spends it self in Curiosities. Now say, it venom in the members breeds, With which her Child the careful Mother feeds. Their bane to Infants cruel Stepdames give, Whilst Mothers such from better springs derive. But how, you'll say, does that which Infants love So prejudicial to their Mothers prove? 'Tis lively whilst i' th'native womb it lies, But by the veins flung out, decays and dies. Then shipwrack'd on the neighbouring shore it lies, And gasping wishes for its Obsequies. This being deni'd, new strength it does recover, And flies in vapours all the body over. But what first tast fruits from the tree receive, When rotten, they no natural sign can give. So in pure seed the Lifes white mansion stands, But surly Death corrupted seed commands. Of Life Death's no good witness; do not think A living Man can like a Carcass stink. But you a running stream (that duly flows, And no corruption by long standing knows) To be as hurtful in their nature hold, As if from some corrupted springs they rou'ld. But now do you go on (for much you know, Part false, I think, part very true) and shew: If any hurtful seeds you can descry In humane bodies (where they often lie) How quickly Natures orders they obey, when to the bloud the Flood-gates once give way. The courses this perhaps may putrifie, 'Tis dangerous to keep bad Company. Is this the blouds fault? I'm no witch, I hope, Though with my juice a Man shou'd Poison tope. She spake, and with Ambrosial Odours clos'd Her Speech, which many there, they say, oppos'd. At last the Laurels thoughts they all desir'd, Th'Oracular Laurels words they all admir'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LAUREL. THat fate which frequently attends on all Great Men, does Thee, egregious Bloud, befal. Some praise what others too much disapprove, Excessive in their Hatred as their Love. This Man in prejudice, that in favour lies, Whilst to their Ears a various rumour flies. Hear Dittany ; she says, each Woman known The Moon to bring each moneth with Poisons down. Nor need we mingle Herbs, or Charms, each one Medea proves in her own bloud alone. Yet the fair Rose , if all be true as sh' as said, Each Woman has in that a Goddess made. From thence, she says, Life spins its Purple thred, And tells you how the half-form'd Embryo's fed. But if my dear Apollo ben't unkind, Nor I in vain his sacred Temples bind, Such bloud nor form, nor nourishment supplies, And so that triumphs in false Victories. The many reasons, here I need not tell Which me induce; this one will serve as well: Woman's the onely Animal we know, Whose veins with such immoderate courses flow. Yet every Beast produces young, we see, And outdoes Mankind in fertility. Hhow many do small Mice at one time breed! Scorning the product of the Trojan Steed. With what a bulk does yon vast El'phant come! She seems to have a Castle in her womb. Thy circuits, Luna , Conies almost tell By kindling, near like thee their Bellies swell. And yet their young no bank of bloud maintains, Or nourishment that flows from gaping veins, For when i' th'amorous war a couple vies, A living spark from the Males body flies, Which the wombs thirsty jaws, when they begin To feel and tast, immediately suck in: Into recesses which so turn and wind, That them Dissecters Eyes can hardly find. In the same Chambers part o' th'female Life Keeps; a brisk Virgin, fit to make a Wife. Them Venus joins, and with connubial Love In mingled flames they both begin to move. There redness caus'd by motion you may see, And bloud, the sign of lost Virginity. Of their Invention, bloud, they're mighty glad; And to Inventions easie 'tis to add. The smallest spark 'tis easie to augment If you can get it proper nutriment. You need not introduce new flames besides, Th'Elixir by this touch rich store provides. All fires, (provide them fuel) think it shame To yield to Vesta 's never dying flame. Thus the first generous drop of bloud is bred, Which proudly scorns hereafter to be fed. With the seeds native white at first 'tis fill'd, And takes delight with its own stock to build. But when that fails, then life grows burthensom, And aid it wisely borrows from the womb. Herself the stuff she borrows purifies, And of a rosie, scarlet colour dyes. From whom the wombs full paps with thirsty lips Into its veiny mouths it daily sips. Look, where a child's new born, how soon it goes And that food swallows, which of old it knows. Kindly it plays and smiles upon the breast, O'rjoy'd again to find its former feast. Shall Nature glut her tender young with bloud? No; that can't be their Elemental food. That fare wou'd make them savage, were it so, And all mankind fierce Cannibals wou'd grow. I Nero 's acts cou'd hardly then dispraise, Nor wou'd Orestes fury wonder raise, If Mothers bloud for wretched Infants first By Heav'n's design'd, to satisfie their thirst. Yet still that Fluxes cause we don't reveal, Which does so cautiously its spring conceal. A female brute whate'r her womb contains Cherishes; yet no Moon dissolves her veins. Some qual'ty then we for the cause must find Which is peculiar to the female kind. This is the onely thing, which I can tell, That Man in form and softness they excel. No Horse a Mare outdoes, nor Bull, a Cow; If through this Iö , through that Jove may low. The Lions savage are both he and she, And in their aspect equally agree. The she's no neater lick'd than rough he-Bears, Nor fitter to adorn the starry spheres. She-Tygers ha' n't than males more spotted charms, And Sows are clean as Boars, whom Thunder arms. No painted Bird for want of Feathers scorns Her Mate, but Heav'n them both alike adorns. The Swans (who are so downy, soft and white) Leda can scarce distinguish by the sight. In Fishes you no difference can see, Both in the glttering of their Scales agree. Venus in them, arm'd by their naked sex, The darts of Beauty needed not t'annex. In them no killing eyes the conquest gain, Their smell alone their Triumphs can maintain. But humane Race in flames more bright are try'd, By Reason and resplendent Heat supply'd. Nor is Fruition their Original, | (A paltry, short-liv'd joy) Oh! may they All | Perish, who that alone true Pleasure call. | Kind Nature Beauty has on Maids bestow'd, And with a thousand Charms all o'r endow'd. Men she with golden fetters chose to bind, And with sweet force their roving Souls confin'd. Nor Women made for bestial delight, But with chaste pleasure too to rape the sight. Hence all that bloud, which after pressings squeeze Out of the grosser Chyle, as dregs or lees, And that, which on the body and the chin With dusky clouds o'rcasts the hairy skin, From their fair bodies constantly she drains, And Luna her commission for' t obtains. But if those slimy flouds, by chance supprest, Excessive heats to nutriment digest, Manlike in time the Womens cheeks become, And they, poor Iphis , undergo thy doom [106] So Phaëthusa , once so smooth and fair, [107] Wonder'd to feel her face o'rgrown with hair. Her Hand she often blam'd, and for a Glass, She call'd, to look how 'twas; but there, alas! A bearded Chin and Lips she found, and then, Blaming the Glass, felt with her hands agen. Long-looking she her own strange visage fear'd, And started, when an unknown voice she heard. Thus and much more (but who can all relate) Apollo 's Laurel did expatiate. Hence to the Wonders of the teeming Bed The way it self their grave Discourses led. Then Birth-wort , Juno 's plant, the Court commands To speak, who Women lends her Midwife hands. Willing enough to talk her stalk she rais'd, And her own Virtues very boldly prais'd. [106] The Story of Iphis chang'd into a Boy on her Wedding-day, see Ovid. Met. 9. [107] Hippocrates , lib. Epidem. says that Phaethusa , Wife of Pithæus of Abdera , having before been a fruitful Woman, upon the banishment of her Husband, and her Courses stopping, she became hairy and had a Beard, and her Voice grew strong hoarse, like that of a Man; the same he writes of Nemisa the Wife of Gorippus .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BIRTH-WORT. GReen Berries I, and Seed, and Flowers bear; And Patroness o' th'Womb's my Character. But deeper yet my great Perfection lies, For as my chiefest fruit my root I prize. This Nature did with the Wombs figure seal, Nor suffer'd me its Virtues to conceal. Thence am I call'd Earths Apple; such a one, As in th' Hesperian Gardens there are none. Had this (fair Atalanta !) then been thrown Before you, when you ran (I know you'll own Now you are married), 't has so sweet a face, | You for this sooner wou'd ha' slack'd your pace, | Than that, for which you lost your Maiden race. | Hence in her own Embraces Mother Earth | Retains and hugs it, where she gave it birth, | Nor trusts dull Trees with things of so much worth. | Easing all Births, 'tis I the wonder prove O' th'Earth our universal Parents love. That Poet was no fool, nor did he lye, Who said each Herb cou'd shew a Deity. Nor shou'd we Egypts Piety despise, Which to green Gods paid daily Sacrifice. Rome , why dost jeer? "They are in Gardens born, "And Vegetable Gods the Fields adorn. What's Ceres else, but Corn, and Bacchus , Vines? And every holy Plain with Godheads shines. And I Lucina am; for I make way, [108] And Lifes streight folding doors wide open lay. Oh! pardon, Luna ! what I rashly spoke, That from my lips such impious words have broke. In me, in me, Lucina , you remain, And in disguise a Goddess I contain: For in my roots small circle you inclose Part of those Virtues, which your Wisdom knows. Triumphant Conquests over Death I make; Arms from my self, but Pow'r from thee I take. O'rseer o' th'ways the body's roads I clear, And streets, as I that Cities Aedile were. Straight passages I widen, stops remove, And every obstacle down headlong shove. The Soul and her attendants nothing stays, But they may freely come and go their ways. I also dry each sink and fenny flood, Lest the swift Messengers shou'd stick i' th'mud. But to my stricter charge committed is The pleasant, sacred Way that leads to bliss. When dawning Life Cimmerian night wou'd leave, And its relation Days bright rays perceive, I keep Death off the Wombs straight passages, That them the watchful Foe can ne'r possess. You'd wonder (for great Nature when she shows, her greatest wonders, nothing greater does) Which way the narrow womb, so void of pain Such an unweildy weight cou'd e'r contain, How such a bulk, forc'd from its native place, Though such a narrow Avenue shou'd pass. When such cross motions teeming wombs attain First to dilate, then fold themselves again, What knots unties and solid bones divides, And what again unites the distant sides. But this I cannot do, nor all the Earth, Wherever pow'rful Plants receive their birth. 'Tis true, both I and you, my Sisters, share In this great work, and humble Handmaids are. But God (you know) performs the chiefest part; This work is fit for the Almighty Art. He to the growing Embryo bids the womb Extend, and bids the Limbs for that make room. He parts the meeting Rocks, and with his hand They gently forth at open order stand. Mean time th'industrious Infant, loth to stay, Struggles and with his head wou'd make its way. Whilst the tormented, labouring Wretch wou'd fain Be eas'd both of her burthen and her pain. Them too my piercing heat both instigates, And the inclining quarters separates. Sometimes within his Mothers fatal Womb, Before he's born, the Infant finds his Tomb. Life from her native soil Deaths terrors chase, Who fertile is herself in such a place. Th'included carcass breaths forth dire perfumes, And its own Grave the buried Corps consumes. Strange! the preposterous Child's his Mothers death, And dead deprives his living Tomb of breath. From that sad fate, ye Gods, chast Women guard; And let it be Adulteries reward. As far as in me lies, I save the tree And take the rotten [fruit] away with me. The goods to drown, 'tis the best way I think, Lest in a storm the Ship and all shou'd sink. Rash Infants often make escapes; unbind Their cords and leave their luggage all behind. Their thicker coats and thinner shirts they leave, And that sweet Cake where they their food receive. Lucina twice poor Women then implore Their throws return although the Birth be o'r. Here to the Womb again my aid I lend, And hard as well as noisom work attend. What I to cleanse the passage undergo, You wot not, but, let no man, pray you, know. For if he do, 'twill Cupid 's power impair, Nor will he such an awe o'r mortals bear. But though in me a secret Virtue lie Of pulling Darts from deepest Wounds, yet I [109] Thy pleasant Darts, kind Cupid never strove To draw; That me no friend to th'womb wou'd prove. In me one Virtue I my self admire (Ah! who can know themselves as they desire.) For 'tis a Riddle; wherefore I wou'd know How I so oft have done the thing I do. For though I life to humane Creatures give, Yet if he eat of me, no Fish can live. As soon as me they tast, away they fly Under the water and in silence die. What may the cause of this strange quarrel be? I know them not, nor have they injur'd me. No Animals, than these more fruitful passe, When yet I hate, though fruitfulness I love. Th'Effect is plain and easie to be found, But deep the Cause lies rooted underground.

      <field name="fulltext">MASTICK-TREE. THen Chian Mastick thus began; said she, This sutes not with this opportunity. To Fishes (Sister) do whate'r you please, Depopulate and poison all the Seas. This let that Herb beware, who back again Made Glaucus fishes bounce into the Main, Which with new forms the watery World supplies, [110] And changes Men into Sea-Deities. But these are trifles; since curs'd Savin here Dares in a throng of pious Plants appear; She, who the Altares of the Womb prophanes, And deep in bloud that living Temple stains. Impatient to be wicked she destroys The naked hopes of thousand future Boys. 'Tis one of Wars extream and greatest harms, To snatch an Infant from his Mothers Arms. But here the Womb (oh strange!) close shut and barr'd, The Mothers very bowels are no guard. Whilst Poisons onely in a civil rage, And lingring Ills the Step-dames hands engage. Oh! simple Colchis , rude and ignorant, Who the new Arts of wickedness dost want! Medea , Savin knows a better way Than thy Medea Children to destroy. Thou, Progne ! know'st not how revenge to take, Let Itys live; thy stay amends will make. Lie with thy Husband, though against thy will, Let thy swell'd Womb with hopes fierce Tereus fill. When you are ripe for hate, let Savin come, And dress the fatal Banquet in your Womb. The reeking bits let thy curst Husband take, And meat of thine and his own bowels make. Abortion, caus'd for spite's a generous crime, Th'effect of pleasure at the present time. Officious Savin is at the Expence Of so much Wit and so much Diligence; To make the lewdest Whore most chast appear, That of her crimes, no token she may wear. To make her lechery frugal, and provide That thy apartment, Lust ben't made too wide. The wrinkles from her belly to remove, Which with disgrace, may her a Mother prove. If Men shou'd all conspire with such a Plant, The whole World soon Inhabitants wou'd want. You then the Brutes alone in vain wou'd see, And no employment for your Art wou'd be. But you, who scatch the rapid, wheeling Days, And Fate beguile with Art and sweet delays; You, verdant Constellations here below, To whom their birth and fate all Mortals owe; Do you take care this tree-like Hag to burn, Who makes the Womb the Infants living Urn. Let Natures mortal Foe receive her doom, And with moist Laurel purge the tainted room Or let her live in Crete , her native home, And with her Virtues purge Pasiphäes womb. There two miscarriages she might ha' made At once; Oh! prize, now never to be had! But I suppose she never wou'd tha' torn, Or kept that hopeful Monster from being born; [111] For seven Boys, shose death to her was dear, That Half-man was to swallow e'ery year. Hast, Savin ! home to Crete ; we won't complain, Though Ditt'ny too with Thee return again. At this they were divided; and the sound Of various murmurs flew the Court around. Whilst sharp'ned leaves did Savin's anger show As when a Lion bristles at his Foe. Those three degrees of heat which she before From Nature had, her anger now made four. [110] Concerning Glaucus his Fishes, see Ovid. Met. , lib. 13. fab. ult. . [111] The Minotaur.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAVIN. THou, wretched Shrub (in passionate tones) said she; Dost thou pretend to be my Enemy? Dost thou a Plant, which through the world is known, Disparage? all mankind my Virtues own. Whilst thou for hollow Teeth a Med'cine art, [112] And scarcely bear'st in Barbers shops a part. Go, hang thy Tables up, to show thy Vows, And with thy Trophies load thy bending bows. Among the Monuments of thy Chivalry The greatest some old, rotten Tooth will be. What? cause thy Tear stops weeping rheum, and lays A Damm, which currents of defluxions stay, Dost think thy force can keep the Womb so tight, As to restrain Conceptions liquid flight? No sure; but thou by Cheats a Name hast sought, And woud'st, though vile though art, too dear be bought. By false pretences you on Fame impose, But I the truth of what I am disclose. Children, I own, I from the Belly wrest; Go now, of my confession make your best. I own, I say; nor canst thou for thy heart, | (Though thou more tender than the Mother wert,) | Prevent me with thy tears or all thy Art. | Thee let the pregnant Mother eat, and fence With thee her womb; with Pitch and Frankincense; A Loadstone too about her let her bear; [113] (That I suppose, does thy great Virtues wear.) For that, we know, fix'd to their native place Retains the Iron-seeds of humane Race. Let Emeralds and Coral her adorn, And many Jaspers, on her Fingers worn; With Diamonds and Pearl, Child of a shell Whose fish herself and that secures so well. But above all let her the Eagles stone Car, and two of them, not onely one. For nothing strengthens Nature more, than that; Nothing the Womb does more corroborate. Let her do all, yet all shall prove in vain, If once access to her my juices gain. I own it; nor will I ungrateful be | To bounteous Nature, lest I anger thee, | Though thou hast done thy worst to anger me. | 'Tis Natures gift, whose wisdom I esteem Much more than thine, though thou a Cato seem Into the Womb by stealth I never creep, Nor force my self on Women, whilst they sleep. I'd rather far, untouch'd, uncropt, be seene In Gardens always growing, fresh and green. I'm gather'd, pounded, and th'untimely blow Must give, which I my self first undergo. You justly blame Medea , but, for shame, The guiltless knife, she cut with, do not blame. The listening Trees will think thee drunk with Wine, If thou of drunkenness accuse the Vine. Nor this bare Pow'r do I to Heaven owe, Which greater Virtues did on me bestow. For I the Courses and the After-birth, With the dead Members deadly weight bring forth. Poor Infants from their native Goal I free, And with astonish'd Eyes the Sun they see. But nothing can they find, worth so much pain; And wou'd return into the dark again. They wish my fatal draught had come before, Ere the great work of life was yet quite o'r. That which you call a Crime, I own to be, But you must lay't on Men and not on me. Ah! what at first wou'd tender Infants give (When newly form'd they scarce begin to live) For this, if possibly they cou'd but know, Through what a passage they must after go? Ah! why did Heav'n (with reverence let me say) Into this World make such a narrow way? You'd think the Child by 's pains to Heav'n shou'd go, "Whilst he through pain's born to a world of woe. Through deadly strugglings he receives his breath, And pangs, i' th'birth resemble those of death. Mothers, the name of Mothers dearly buy, And purchase pleasure at a rate too high. But thou, Child-bearing Woman, who no ease Canst find, (tormented with a dear Disease) Whose tortur'd bowels that sweet Viper gnaws, (That living burthen, of thy Rack the cause) Take but my leaves with speed, their Virtue try (In them, believe me, sovereign juices lie.) Thy barriers they by force soon open lay, And out o' th'world, 'tis scarce a wider way. The Infant, ripe, drops from the bows, and cries The whilst his half-dead Mother silent lies; But hearing him she soon forgets her pain, And thinks to do that pleasant trick again. But thou, on whom the silver Moons moist rays (For the wombs night its Lady Moon obeys) No influence have, I charge thee, do not take My leaves, but hast, though loaded, from 'em make. Down from the Trees by my force shaken, all The fruits though ne'r so green and sour, fall. (This I foretel you, lest, when you're aggriev'd, You then shou'd say, by me you were deceiv'd.) For innocent Girls sin sore against their will, None ever wish'd her womb a Child might fill: Yet if I were not in the world, they wou'd Incline to do the fact, but never cou'd. But many other Plants the same can do, Wherefore if banishment you think my due, Companions in it I shall have, I know; And into Creet a troop of us shall go. Thou, Myrrh! for one shalt go, who heretofore [114] For lewdness punish'd now deserv'st the more. But thou, though lewd didst not prevent the birth, Though 'twas a Crime to bring the Infant forth. And All heal too, who Death affrights, must pack, With Galbanum and Gum Ammoniack. And Be s to Cyrenians never sold, Unless they brought the sweeter smell of Gold. Ground-pine and Saffron too will Exiles prove, Saffron , once Crocus , yellow dy'd by Love. Madder , and Colloquintida with me, And Dragon too the Cretan shore must see. And Sowbread too, whose secret darts are found Child-bearing Women distantly to wound. And Rue , as noble a Plant as any's here, Physick to other things, is Poison there. What shou'd I name the rest? We make a throng, Thou Birthwort too with us must troup along; Nor must you, President, behind us stay, Rise then and into Exile come away. She ended, with great favour and applause; And there's no doubt but she obtain'd her cause. the Mugwort next began, whose awful Face Check'd all their stirs, and silence fill'd the place.

If we for Womens faults must bear disgrace, We, the Ecbolicks , are a wretched Race. [115] On her head let it (if a Woman shall To her own bowels prove inhumane) fall; | Not part of Deaths sad penalties, but all. | Why are we sent for at untimely hours? That Day, when lucky Juno comes, is ours. [116] She's wicked and deserves the worst of fates, Who to ill ends that time anticipates. For the admitted juice knows no delay, But torpid as it is will force its way. Nor is it hard a Fabrick to confound Ill-fix'd within it self or to the ground. A Ship, well tackled, which the winds may scorn, Ill rigg'd away by ev'ry gust is born. The Elements of Life what can't o'rethrow? No wonder; Life it self's an empty show. Sometimes it smells a Candles snuff and dies; [117] The weaker fume before the stronger flies. Let Cesar round the Globe with 's Eagles fly, And grieve with Jove to share Equality. Yet what a trifle might ha' been his death, Preventing all his Triumphs with his breath. One farthing Candle by its dying flame Wou'd have depriv'd the world of his great Name; Nor had we had such numerous supplies Of mighty Lords and new-found Deities. Thou, Alexander , too might'st so ha' dy'd, (How well the world that smell had gratifi'd.) Thou, who, a petty King o' th'Universe, Thought'st with thy self alone thou didst converse. Yea the same chance might have remov'd from us, Both Thee, Jove 's Son, and thy Bucephalus. And if thy Groom his Candle out had slept, [118] Bucephala he from being built had kept. So slight a stink you'd scarce think this could do, Unless the niceness of the womb I knew. How shie it is of an ungrateful smell You, by its secret coyness, know full well. (But that's no prudence in it: since that place For pleasure no good situation has) But greedily sweet things it meets half-way, And into its own bosom does convey. The secret cause of which effect to find, Is hard; nor have the Learned it assign'd. Let's see if any thing further we can say; The Night grows late, and now 'tis toward Day. Wherefore a thousand wonders that remain | Concerning Childbirth, as may entertain | I' th'next Assembly, when we meet again. | You, Myrrh! who from a Line of Monarchs came, The glory of their angry Fathers name; [119] Sacred and grateful to the Gods; again A Virgin, and shalt always so remain; you know the secrets of the female kind, And what you know, I hope, can call to mind. Then surely you the nature of a smell Among rich Odours born must clearly tell. Besides, when formerly their Reason strove Weak as it was, to cope with conquering Love; You in the middle of the fight wou'd fall, They say, and lie in fits Hysterical. [120] Come then. Let's hear, what you at last can say? Speak, modest Myrrh! why do you so delay? Why do the tears run down thy bark so fast? Thou need'st not blush for faults so long time past. Ah! happy faults, that can such tears produce, Which to the World are of such Sovereign use. No Woman e'r deserv'd before this time So much for Virtue, as thou for a Crime. [115] Ecbolics, i. e. , such Medicines as bring away dead Children, or cause abortion. [116] The smell of a Candles Snuff, 'tis said, will make Women miscarry. [117] The smell of a Candles Snuff, 'tis said, will make Women miscarry. [118] The Stink of the Snuff of a Candle, is said to cause Abortion in Mares. [119] Cynaras , King of Cyprus . See the Story of his Daughter Myrrha, Ovid. Met. [120] i. e. , Fits of the Mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MYRRH. AT last when Myrrh had wip'd her od'rous tears, Putting aside her leaves, her Face and Head she rears. Then she began, but blush'd, and stopp'd anon, Nor cou'd she be entreated to go on. So a dry Pump at first will hardly go, From which a River by and by will flow. 'Tis known, the female Tribe, or all that live, Above the rest is far more talkative. And that a Plant, who was a Maid before, Speaks faster much than all the rest and more. Her story therefore gently she begins, And with her Art upon the Audience wins. Her Wars with unchast Love she reckon'd o'r; For fear of doing ill, what ills she bore: She told, how oft her breast her hands had try'd To stab, whilst chast fair Myrrha might ha' dy'd. How long and oft unequally with Love, Who even Goddesses subdu'd, she strove. And many things besides, which I'll not name, Since Ovid with more wit has said the same. Then of the Wombs intolerable pains (Sh'ad felt them) sadly she, 'tis said, complains. Had I an hundred fluent Womens Tongues, Or made of sturdy Oak, a pair of Lungs, The kinds and forms, and names of cruel fate, And monstrous shapes I hardly cou'd relate. What meant the Gods, Lifes native Seat, to fill With such a numerous Host, so arm'd to kill? What is it, Pleasure! guards Man's happiness, If thy chief City, Pain, thy Foe, possess. But me my Laurel told; then most she rail'd, When the sad Fits o' th'Mother she bewail'd. Woe to the bodies wretched Town (said she) When the wombs Fort contains the Enemy! Thence baneful vapours ev'ry way they throw, Which rout the conquer'd Soul where e'r they go. The troops of flying Spirits they destroy, As stenches from Avernus Birds annoy. [121] If they the Stomach seize, the Appetite's gone, And tasks design'd for veins lie by half done. No Meats it now endures, much less requires, And the crude Kitchin cools for want of fires. If they the Heart invade, that's walls they shake, And in the vital work confusion make; New waves they thither bring, but those the vein, Which Vena Cava 's called, bears back again. The Arteries by weak pulsings notifie, Or else by none, the Soul's then passing by. By that black Cloud all joy's extinguish'd quite, And hopes, that make the mind look gay and bright. So when grim, Stygian shades, they say, appear, The Candles tremble and go out for fear. Grief, fear, and hatred of the light invade Their Heart, the Soul a Scene of trouble's made. Then straight the jaws themselves the Ill With deadly, strangling vapours strives to fill. T' Æthereal Air it never shews desire, But Salamander -like lives all on fire: Sometimes these restless Plagues the Head too seize, And rifle all the Souls rich Palaces. In barbarous triumph led, then Reason stands, Hoodwink'd and manacled her eyes and hands. For the poor wretch a merry madness takes, And her sad sides with doleful laughter shakes. Her Dreams (in vain awake) she tells, and those, If no body admire, amaz'd she shews. She fears, or threatens ev'ry thing she spies; A piteous, she, and dreadful Object, lies. One seems to rave, and from her sparkling Eyes Fierce fire darts forth; another throbs and cries. some Deaths exactest Image seizes, so That sleep compar'd to that like Life wou'd show. A solid dulness all the senses keeps Lock'd up; no Soul of Trees more soundly sleeps. Her breath, if any from her nostrils go, The Down from Poppy tops wou'd hardly blow. If you one dead with her compar'd, you'd say, Two dead ones there, or two Hysterick lay. But then ('tis strange, and yet we must believe What we from long experience receive) Under her Nose strong-smelling Odours lay, The other vapours these will chase away. burn Partridge feathers, hair of Man or Beast, Horns, leather, warts, that Horses legs molest; All these are good; but what strange accident first found them out, or cou'd such Cures invent? Burn Oil, that Nature from hard Rocks distills, And Sulphur, which all things with Odours fills. To which the stinking Assa you may add, And Oil which from the Beavers stones is had. Through Pores, Nerves, Arteries, and all they go, And throng t'invade the labouring Womb below. But that each Avenue, which upward lies, With mounds and strong-built Rampires fortifies. Tne being contracted to a narrower place (For force decase spread in too wide a space) No humours foul or vapours these must stay, But out it purges them the lower way. On Forein parts now no assaults she makes, But care of her domestick safety takes. Carthage to Hannibal now sends no supply, To break the force of distant Italy. When from their walls with horror they descry The threatning Roman Darts and Eagles fly. This for the Nose; the Womb then you must please With such sweet Odours as the Gods appease. With Cinnamon , and Goat-bread, Ladanon. With healing Balsam and my oily Gum. Civet, and Musk, and Amber too apply, (Scarce yet well known to humane industry) With all that my rich, native Soil supplies, Such fumes as from the Phœnix Nest arise. Nor fear from Gods to take their Frankincense, In such a pious case, 'tis no offence. Then shalt thou see the limbs faint motions make, A certain sign, that now the Soul's awake. Then will the Guts with an unusual noise, The Enemy o'rthrown, seem to rejoice. Bloud will below the secret passage stain, And Arteries recruited beat again. Oft, glad to see the light, themselves the Eyes Lift up; the Face returning purple dies; One jaw from t'other with a groan retires, And the Disease it self, like Life, expires. Tell me, sweet Odours, tell me, what have you With parts so distant from the Nose to do? Or what have you, ill smells, so near the Nose To do, since that and you are mortal Foes? And why dost thou, abominamble stench! Upon remote Dominions so intrench? Say, by what secret force you sling your Darts, Whom from your Bow, the Nose, such distance parts. For some believe, that to the brain alone They fly, through ways, which in the head are known; And that the Brain to the related womb Sends (good and bad) all smells, that to it come. The Womb too oft rejoyces for That's sake, And when That's griev'd, does all its griefs partake. The Womb's Orestes , Pylades the Brain, And what to one, to th'other is a pain. I don't deny the native Sympathy, And like respects, in which these parts agree. Each its conception has, and each its birth, And both their Off-springs like the Sire, come forth. Still to produce both have a constant vein, And their streight bosoms mighty things contain. Much I omit in both; but know, that This O' th'Body, That o' th'Soul the Matrix is. But th'womb has this one proper faculty, Its actions oft from Head and Nose are free. Oft when it strives to break its bonds in vain (And often nought its fury can contain) A sweet Perfume apply'd (unknown to th'Nose) Does with a grateful glew its body close. But when oppress'd with weight the womb falls down (As sometimes it, when weak, does with its own) With dreadful weapons arm'd a noisom smell Meets it, and upward quickly does repel. So when th' Helvetians their own Land forsook, (People which in their Neighbours terror strook) A stronger Foe, their wandering to restrain, To their old quarters beat 'em back again. Here different reasons different Authors show, But none worth speaking of, I'm sure, you know. What can I add? You, Learned President, please To bid me speak; the case says, hold your peace. Yet you I must obey; Heav'n is so kind To let us seek that truth we cannot find. This truth must be i' th'wells dark bottom sought, Pardon me, if I make an heavy draught. You see the wondrous Wars and Leagues of Things, From whence the worlds harmonious consort springs. This he that thinks from th'Elements may be had, Is a grave Sot, and studiously mad. Here many causes branch themselves around, But to 'em all one onely Root is found. For those, which mortals the four Elements call, In the worlds fabrick are not first of all. Treasures in them wise Nature laid, as store, Ready at hand, of things that were before. Whence she might Principles draw for her use, And mixtures new eternally produce. Infinite seeds in those small bodies lie To us, but numbred by the Deity. Nor is the heat to Fire more natural, Nor coldness more to Waters share does fall, Than either bitter, sweet, or white or black, Or any smells, that Noses e'r attack. Our purging or astringent quality Have proper points of matter, where they lie. With Earth, Air, Water, Fire , Heav'n all things bore, Why do I faintly speak? They were before. For what Earth, Air, Fire, Water now we call, Are Compounds from the first Original. For—But a sudden fright her senses shock'd, And stopt her speech; she heard the gate unlock'd. And Rue from far the Gardener saw come in, Trembling, as she an Aspen leaf had been. (For Rue , a sovereign Plant to purge the Eyes [122] Remotest Objects easily descries) She softly whisper'd, Hence make hast away; Here's Robert come, make hast, why do we stay? Day was not broken, but 'twas almost light And Luna swiftly rowl'd the wheeling Night; Nor was the Fellow us'd so soon to rise, But him a sudden chance did then surprize. His Wife in pangs of Child-bed loudly roar'd, And gentle Juno 's present aid implor'd. But he who plants that in his Garden grew, Than forty Juno 's, of more value knew, Came thither Sowbread all in hast to gather, That he with greater ease might prove a Father. Soon as they saw the Man, straight up they got, With gentle hast and stood upon the spot, When briefly Mugwort ; I this Court adjourn; What we have left we'll do at our return. Without tumultuous noise away they fled, And every Plant crept to her proper Bed. The End of the Second Book. [121] A noisom Lake, over which if Birds flew, they were often choked with the stench of it.

      <field name="fulltext">FLORA. NOW Muse, if ever, now look brisk and gay; The Spring's at hand; blithe looks like that display. Use all the Schemes and colours now of Speech, Use all the Flow'rs that Poetry enrich. Its Glories all, its blooming Beauties bring, As may resemble the returning Spring. Let the same Musick through thy Verse resound As in the Woods and shady Groves is found. Let every line such fragrant praise exhale As rises up from some sweet-smelling Vale. Let Lights and Shades, as in the Woods appear, And shew in painted Verse the season of the Year. Come then away, for the first welcome Morn Of the spruce Moneth of May begins to dawn. This Day; so tells the Poets sacred Page; Bright Chloris did in Nuptial bands engage, This very day the knot was tied; and thence The lovely Maid a Goddess did commence. The signs of joy did everywhere appear, On Earth, in Heaven, throughout the Sea and Air; No wandring Cloud was seen in all the Sky, And if there were, 'twas of a curious dye. The Air serene, not an ungentle blast Ruffled the waters with its rude embrace, The wind that was, breath'd Odours all around, And only fann'd the streams, and only kiss'd the ground. Of unknown Flow'rs now such a numerous birth Appear'd, as e'en astonish'd Mother Earth. The Lily grew 'midst barren Heath and Sedg, And the Rose blush'd on each unprickly hedg. The purple Violet and the Daffodil , The places now of angry Nettles fill, This great and joyful Day, on which she knew What 'twas to be a Wife and Goddess too. The grateful Flora yearly did express In shews, Religious Pomp and gaudiness, Long as she thriv'd in Rome , and reign'd among The other Gods, a vast and numerous throng; But when the sacred Tribe was forc'd from Rome. Among the rest an Exile she became, Strip'd of her Plays, and of her Fane bereft, Nought of the grandeur of a Goddess left. Since then, no more ador'd on Earth by Man, But forc'd o'er Flowers to preside and reign, The best she can, she still keeps up the Day; Not as of old, when bless'd with store she lay, When with a lavish hand her bounties flew, She ha'nt the heart, and means to do it now, But in a way fitting her humble state She always did, and still does celebrate. And now that she the better may attend The flowry Empire under her command, To all the World at times she does resort, Now in this part, now that she keeps her Court. And so the Seasons of the year require; For here 'tis Spring, perhaps 'tis Autumn there. With ease she flies to the remotest shores, And visits in the way a world of Flow'rs. In Zephyr 's painted Car she cuts the Air, Pleas'd with the way, her Spouse the Charioteer. It was the year, (thrice blest that beautious year,) Which mighty Charles 's sacred Name did bear. A golden year the Heavens brought about In high procession with a joyful shout, A year that barr'd up Janus brazen Gates, that brought home peace, and lay'd our monstrous heats; A greater gift, bless'd Albion , thou didst gain, It brought home God-like Charles , and all his peaceful train; Compos'd our Chaos; cover'd o'r the fears, And clos'd the bleeding wounds of twenty years; Nor felt the Gown alone the fruits of peace, But Gardens, Woods, and all the flowry race; This year to every thing fresh honours brought, Nor 'midst these were the learned Arts forgot. Poor exil'd Flora with the Sylvan Gods Came back again to their old lov'd abodes; I saw her (through a Glass my Muse vouchsaf'd) Plac'd on the painted bow securely waft. Triumphantly she rode, and made her course Towards fair Albion 's long forsaken Shores. That she our Goddess was, to me was plain From the gay various colours of her train. She light, renowned Thames , upon thy shore, Long time belov'd, and shown to her before; 'Twas here the Goddess an Appointment set For all the Flow'rs; accordingly they met; Those that are parch'd with heat, or pinch'd with cold, Or those which a more temperate Clime does hold, Those drunk with dew, the Sun just rising sees, Or those, when setting, with a face like his, All sorts that East and West can boast, were there, But not such Flow'rs as you see growing here, Poor mortal Flow'rs, obnoxious still to harms, Which quickly die out of their mothers arms; But those that Plato saw, Ideas nam'd, Daughters of Jove , for heavenly extract fam'd. T'Æthereal Plants! what Glories they disclose, What excellence the first Celestial Rose; What blush, what smell! and yet on many scores, the Learned say, it much resembles ours; Onely 'tis ever fresh, with long life bless'd, Not in your fading mortal colours dress'd. This Rose, the Image of the heavenly mind, The other growing on our Earth, we find; Which is the Image of that Image, then No wonder it appears less fresh and fine. These Heaven-born species of the flowry race Assembled all, the Wedding Morn to grace. Phœbus , do thou the Pencil take, the same With which thou gildst the worlds great chequer'd frame. Lights Pencil take; try if thou canst display The various Scenes of this resplendent Day. And yet I doubt thy skill, though all must bow To thee as God of Plants and Poets too; I'm sure 'tis much too hard a task for me, Yet some I'll touch,in passing, like the Bee. Where the whole Garden can't be had, we know, A Nosegay may; and that if sweet, will do. Now when a part of this triumphant Day In sacred pompous Rites had pass'd away, Rites, which no mortal Tongue can duly tell, And which perhaps 'ts not lawful to reveal, At length the sporting Goddess thought it best (Though sure the humour went beyond a Jest) A pleasant sort of Trial to propose, And from among the Plants a Queen to chuse, Which shou'd preside over the flowry Race, Be a Vice-Goddess and supply her place. Each Plant was to appear, and make its plea, To see which best deserv'd the Dignity. The Scene Arch'd o'r with wreathing branches stood, Which like a little hollow Temple show'd, The Shrubs and Branches, darting from aloof Their pretty fragrant shades, compos'd the roof; Red and white Jasmine , with the Myrtle Tree The favourite of the Cyprian Deity, The golden Apple-tree with silver bud, Both sorts of Pipe-tree, with the Sea-dew stood; There was the twining Woodbind to be seen, And yellow Hather , Roses mixt between. Each Plant its Notes and known distinctions brought With various Art the gaudy Scene was wrought; Just in the Nave of this new-modell'd Fane, A Throne the judging Goddess did sustain, Rob'd in a thousand several sorts of leaves, And all the colours which the Garden gives, Which join'd together trim, in wondrous wise, With their deluding Figures mock'd your Eyes. A noble checquer'd work; which real seems, And firmly set with glistring Stones and Gems; It real seem'd; though Gods such bodies wear For weight, as Flow'rs upon their down may bear; The Goddess seated in Majestick wise With all the pride the wealthy Spring supplies, Had Ariadne 's Crown; and such a vest With which the Rainbow on bright days is drest; Before her Throne did the officious band Of Hours, Days,Months in goodly order stand. The Hours upon soft painted wings were born, Painted; but swift alas! and quickly gone; The Days with nimble feet advanc'd apace; And then the Months, each with a different face, On Cynthia 's Orb they tend with constant care, In Monthly Courses whirling round her Sphere. First Spring , a Rosy-colour'd Youngster, stood With looks enough to bribe a judging God. Summer appear'd, rob'd in a yellow Gown, Full Ears of ripen'd Corn compos'd her Crown; Then Autumn proud of rich Pomona 's store, And Bacchus too treading the blushing floor; Poor half-starv'd Winter shivering in the Rear, The Stoical and sullen part o' th'year. Yet not by Step-dame Nature wholly left Of every grace is Winter-time bereft. Some Friends it has in this afflicted state, Some Plants that Faith and Duty don't forget; Some Plants the Winter season does supply Born purely for delight and luxury; Which brave the frost and cold, and merit claim, Though few indeed, and of a lower frame. The New Year did him this peculiar grace, And Janus favouring with his double face, That he shou'd first be heard; and have the power To draw forth all his poor and slender store. Winter obeys; and ranks 'em, best he can, More trusting to the worth than number of his Men. Just in the front of Winter's scanty band Two lofty Plants, or flowry Giants stand, Spurge-Olive one, t'other a kind of Bay. Both high, and largely spreading every way, But did they in a milder season sprout, Whether they e'er wou'd pass for Flow'rs, I doubt, But now they do; and such their looks and smell The place they hold, they seem to merit well. Next Woolfs-bane , us'd in Step-dames poisoning trade, Born of the foam of Pluto 's Porter, said, A baneful Plant, springing in craggy ground, Thence its hard name, itself much harder found; Briskly its gilded Crest it does display, | And boldly stares i' th'face the God of Day, | Which Cerberus its Sire durst ne'r assay. | The Plant, call'd Snow-drops , next in course appear'd, [123] But trembling, by its frightful Neighbour scar'd, Yet clad in white her self, like fleecy Snow, Near her bad Neighbour, finer does she show. The noble Liver-wort does next appear, Without a speck, like the unclouded Air; A Plant of noble use and endless fame, The Liver's great Preserver, thence its Name; The humble Plant conscious of inbred worth In Winters hardest frost and cold, shoots forth. Let other Plants, said she, for seasons wait, For Summer gales, or the Suns kindly heat, She scorns delay; naked, without a Coat, As 'twere in hast, the noble Plant comes out. Next the blew Primrose , which in Winter blows, But wears the Spring both in its name and cloaths; The Saffron then, and tardy Celandin , To these our Lady's-Seal , and Sow-bread join. But these appearing out of season, were Bid to their homes and proper tribes repair. There now remain'd of Winters genuine store And off-spring, Bears-foot or the Christmas Flow'r, [124] The pride of Winter, which in frost can live, And now alone for Empire dar'd to strive. On its black stalk it rear'd it self, and then With pale but fearless face to plead began. [123] These Plants by Art sometimes are made to flower in Winter. [124] This flower's in December .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Helleborus Niger , or, Christmas Flower I Mean not now my Beauty to oppose To that of Lilies, or the blushing Rose; Old Prœtus Daughters me from that do feare, Who once with Juno durst their face compare, Mad with Conceit, each thought her self a Cow; Just judgment! teaching all themselves to know. My noble Plant banish'd this wild caprice, And gave 'em back their human voice and speech. Melampus by my aid soon brought relief, And for the care had one of 'em to Wife. And none will charge me with that blindness, sure, Or the same folly I pretend to cure. The Goddesses above a Beauty claim Lasting and firm as their immortal frame, Which time can't furrow, or Diseases wrong; To be immortal is, to be for ever young. In Flow'rs or Girls Beauty's a transient thing; Expect as well the whole year will be Spring. Ye flow'ry Race, that open to the sky, And there have seen a Cloud of curious Dye, The gaudy Phantome now with pride appears, Look up again, 'tis strait dissolv'd in tears; Such is the short-liv'd glory Flowers have, Bending, they point still toward their womb and grave. The wind and rain aim at their tender Head, Besides the Stars their baneful influence shed; Like the fam'd Semele , they die away In the embraces of the God of Day. Expos'd to Air, to Heat an open prey, Colds though their tender fibres force their way: The Swallow or the Nightingale abhors Not Winter more, than do th'whole race of Flow'rs. If among these a Flow'r you can descry (Fitter to be transplanted to the Sky) Which is so hardy, as to stand the threat Of storms and tempests that around her beat; That with contending winds dare boldly strive, Scorns Cold, and under heaps of Snow can live, To this, great Goddess, to this noble Plant You ought the Empire of the `Garden grant. Kings are Joves Image; and if that be true, To Virtue onely Sovereign sway is due. Trusting to this, and not the empty Name Of Beauty, I the flowry Empire claim. Nor will this soft, luxurious, pamper'd Race Of Flow'rs, were things well weigh'd, deny me place; For lo! the Winter's come; what change is there, What looks, what dismal aspect of the year! The winds from Prison break; no mercy yield, But spoil the native Glories of the Field. First on the Infant Boughs they spend their rage, And scarcely spare the poor trunks reverend age; Either with swelling Rains, the ground below Is drown'd, or covered thick in beds of Snow; Or stiff with Frost; the streams Ic'd o'r Are pent within a bank, unknown before. Each Nymph complains, and every River God Feels on his shoulders an unusual load; Nature a Captive now to Frost become Lies fairly buried in a Marble tomb. And can you wonder then that Flow'rs shou'd die, Or hid within their beds, the danger fly? D' ye see the Sun, how faint his looks; that tell The God of Plants himself i' n't over-well. Now let me see the Violet, Tulip, Rose. Or any of 'em their fine face disclose, Ye Lilies with your snowy Tresses now Come forth, this is the proper time for Snow. Deaf to the call, none of 'em all appear, But close in Bed they lie half dead with fear. I onely in this Universal dread Of Nature dare exalt my fearless head; Winter with thousand several arms prepar'd To be my death, still finds me on my Guard. Great Umpire of this harmless fray, If you are fix'd to crown some Plant to Day, Let all appear and take the Field, let all Agree to give the chiefest Plant the ball; Let it in Winter be, though, I desire; That season does a hardy Chief require. If any of these tender, dainty Dames Deck'd with their rich Perfumes and gaudy Names, Dare but at such a time shew half an Eye, I'll frankly yield, and strait let fall my plea. Not a Plant's seen, I'll warrant you; they hate to gain a Kingdom at so dear a rate; They fear th'unequal trial to sustain; None dare appear, but those that fill my train, And none of these are so ambitious grown, To stand themselves, but beg for me the Crown. These numerous hardships I can undergo; | I'll tell you now, fair Judg, what I can do, | My Virtue's both active and passive too. Kings get no fame by conquering at home, That from some forein vanquish'd Land must come. If equal to my triumphs, names I bore And every vanquish'd Foe increast the store, Old Rome 's most haughty Champion I'd defie With me in Honours, Titles, Names to vie. I act such wonders, I may safely say the twelve Herculean labours were mere play. The spreading Cancer my blest Plant does chase, And new skins o'r the Leper's monstrous face. The lingring Quartan-Fever I oblige To draw his forces off and raise the Siege. Swimmings i' th'Head that do from vapours come, I exorcise strait by my Counter-fume. In every swelling part when Dropsies reign, I dry the Fen, the standing waters drein. The Falling sickness too, to wave the rest, Though sacred that Disease, by some confest. Why in these Cures thus trifle I my breath? Death yields to me, the Apoplectick Death. Into each part my Plant new vigour sends, And quickly makes the Soul and Body friends. These are great things, you'll say, and yet the rest That follow, must much greater be confest, I do compose the minds distracted frame, A gift the Gods and I alone can claim; Madmen and Fools are cast beneath my power, What to my grandeur can the Gods add more? Who thus can do; the world his Province is, Cæsar can't boast a larger sway than this. She spoke; her train with shouts the Area fill'd, Nay Winter (if you will believe it) smil'd. Next the gay Spring draws out his warlike bands, Which to the Scene a grateful shadow lends, Homer , though well the Grecian Camp he paints, Wou'd fail, I fear, in mustering up these Plants. Bright Spring, what various Nations dost thou boast? The Xerxes of a numerous flowry Host; Which cou'd (since Flow'rs without due moisture die) Like his, I fansie, drink whole Rivers dry. His flowry troops made the same stately shew, Whose painted arms a dazling lustre threw; Then a gay Flow'r, for shape, the Trumpet nam'd [125] Blew thrice, and with a strenuous voice proclaim'd, That all but Candidates shou'd quit the place; First, as they went, bowing with awful grace. And now the pleasure of the Goddess known, The Herb, call'd Ragwort , pass'd before the Throne, A bunchy stalk, and painted Bees she bore With several foolish fancies on her Flow'r, Ragwort the Satyrs and Priapus love, Venus her self and the fair Judg approve. Dogs-tooth pass'd next, to Ragwort near ally'd, A faithful friend to Love, and often try'd; Next Hyacinths , of violet -kind, proceed, A noble, powerful and a numerous breed, They wanted courage, though, to keep the place, Labouring alas! under a late disgrace; Of noble House themselves they did pretend, From Ajax bloud directly to descend, The cause in Flora 's Court of Chivalry Was heard, where they fail'd to make out their plea, They bore no Coat of Arms, nor cou'd they show Those mournful Notes said from his bloud to flow. The next akin, a Flow'r, which Greeks of old [126] From Excrements of Birds descended hold, Which Britain , Nurse of Plants, a milder Clime, Gentilely calls the Star of Bethlehem. The Daizy next march'd off in modest wise, Dreading to wait the issue of the Prize; Though the Spring don't a trustier party know, | After, before and in the Spring they grow, | Quick in the charge, and in retreating slow. | They dare not venture, though the Sons of Art The name of Binders to 'em do impart; They cure all wounds, yet make none; which you grant Is the true Office of a warlike Plant. Next spotted Sanicle and Navel-wort. Though both have signs of bloud, forsake the Court. Moon-wort goes next born on its reddish stalk, And after that does gently Cranebil walk; They all gave way; 'tis nat'ral in a Flow'r More in its form to trust than worth and pow'r; Nay more than that, the Corn flag quits the Field, Though made Sword-wise, does to the Tulip yield, Though, like some Tyrant, rounded with the same, Yet to affected Empire waves all claim; How much this Sword-flow'r differs, as to harm, From those which we on mortal Anvils form! Nature on this an Unguent has bestow'd, Which, when ours make it issue, stops the bloud. Next you might see the gaudy Columbine. Call'd sometimes Lions-mouth , desert the Scene, Though of try'd courage, and of high renown, In other things, curing Diseases, known. The Sea-gull Flow'r express'd an equal fear, The Tygers more and prettier spots don't bear; These Beauty-spots she ought to prize like Gold; Citron held hers at dearer rates, of old, The Persian Lily of a ruddy hue; And next the Lily of the Vale , withdrew, Lilies o' th' Vale such looks and smell retain, They're fit to furnish Snuff for Gods and Men; Nor a Plant kinder to the Brain does live; A glass of Wine does less refreshment give. Next Periwinkle or the Ladies bow'r Weakly, and halting crept along the floor. All kinds of Crow-foot pass'd and bow'd their head, The worst run wild, the best in Gardens bread; Day-Lily next, the Root by Hesiod lov'd, Although not for the chiefest Dish approv'd. Then came a Flow'r, of a far differing look, Which on it thy lov'd Name, Adonis , took; But Celandine , thy genuine offspring stil'd, They tell us, at the proud Usurper smil'd. Stock-gillow-flow'r the Years Companion is, Which the Sun scarce in all his rounds does miss; Officious Plant! which every month can bring; But rather wou'd be reckon'd to the Spring. This pass'd along with a becoming mien, And in her train the Wall-flow'r wou'd be seen. The constant Marigold next these went out, And Ladies-slipper fit for Flora 's foot. The goats beard , which each Morn abroad does peep, But shuts its Flower at Noon, and goes to sleep. Then Ox-eye did its rowling Eyeball spread, Such as Joves Wife and Sister had, they said. Next Viper-grass , full of a milky juice, Good against Poison, which curst Stepdames use. Then Hollow-root , cautious and full of fear, | Whiich neither Summers heat, nor cold can bear, | Comes after Spring, before it does retire. | Then Sattin-flower , and Moth-mullein withdraw, Worthy a noble Title to enjoy. The Ladies-smock , and Lugwort went their way, With several more too tedious here to say; With many an humble Shrub these took their leaves, To which the Garden entertainment gives; As Honey-suckle, Rosemary and Broom , That Broom which does of Spanish Parent come; Both sorts of Pipe-tree ; neat in either dress, White or sky-colour'd, whether please you best; Next, the round-headed Elder-rose , which wears A Constellation of your little stars; The Cherry ; ours and Persian Apple add Proud of the various Flowers adorn'd its head. Nature has issue, Eunuch-like, deny'd, But (like them too) by a fine face supply'd. These and a thousand more were fain to yield, And left the Candidates to keep the Field. Each Flower appear'd with all its kindred, drest, Each in its richest Robes of gaudiest Vest; The Violet first, Springs Usher, came in view, From whose sweet Lips these pleasing accents flew. [125] A Plant of the Tribe of Pseudo-narcissi Juncifolii , from the shape of a Tube in the midst of the Flower, called Trumpets [126] The vast price of Citron Tables, see Plin. l. 13.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIOLET. THE Ram now ope the golden Portal throws, [127] Which holds the various seasons of the Year, And on his shining Fleece the Spring does bear, Ye Mortals, with a shout salute him as he goes. (Io Triumph!) now now the Spring comes on In solemn state and high Procession, Whilst I; the beauteous Violet , still before him go And usher in the gaudy show; As it becomes the Child of such a Sire, I'm wrap'd in Purple, the first-born of Spring, The marks of my Legitimation bring, And all the tokens of his verdant Empire wear. Clad like a Princely Babe, and born in State, I all your Regal Titles hate, Nor priding in my bloud and mighty birth Unnatural Plant, despise the lap of mother Earth. Loves Goddess smiles upon me just new-born, Rejoycing at the Years return. The Swallow is not a more certain sign That Love and warm Embraces now begin. To the lov'd Babe a thousand kisses The Goddess gives, a thousand balmy blisses. Besides, my purple Lips In sacred Nectar dips; Hence 'tis, no sooner does the Violet burst, By the warm Air to a just ripeness nurst, But from my opening, blooming Head A thousand fragrant Odours spread. I do not only please the smell, And the most critick tast beguile, Not onely with my pretty die Impose a Cheat upon the Eye; But more for profit than for pleasure born I furnish out a wholesom juice, Which the fam'd Epicurus did not scorn Upon a time, when sick to use. O'er pressing and vexatious pain, I such a silent Vict'ry gain, That though the Body be the Scene, It scarcely knows whether a fight has been. The Fevers well-known Valor I invade, Which blushes with mere rage to yield To one that ne'er knew how to tread a Field, But onely was for sights and Nuptial Banquets made. It yields, but in a grumbling way, Just as the winds obedience pay, When Neptune from the Floud does peep And silences these troublers of the deep. What though some Flowers a greater courage know, Or a much finer face can show, That does but still the fansie feed, Whilst I for business fit, in real worth exceed. Search over all the Globe, you'll find, The Glory of a Princely Flower Consists not in tyrannick Power, But in a Majesty with mildness join'd. She spoke; and from her balmy Lips did come A sweet Perfume that scented all the Room. The smell so long continued, that you'd swear The Violet , though you heard no sound, was there. Quitting the Stage; the next that took her place, Were Ox-lips, Pugles with their numerous Race; A parti-colour'd Tribe, of various hue, Red, yellow, purple, pale, white, dusky, blew. The Primrose and the Cowslip too were there, Both of 'em kin, but not so handsom far; Bears-ear , so call'd, did the whole Party head, And yellow, claiming merit, needs wou'd plead. Tossing her hundred Heads in slanting rate, Each had a Mouth, and cou'd at pleasure prate. [127] The sign Aries .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Auricula Ursi. BEARS-EAR. GReat Queen of Flow'rs, why is thy snowy Breast, With such a sight of various Posies drest! Whereas one stalk of mine Alone a Nosegay is, alone can make thee fine; A lovely, harmless Monster, I Gorgon 's many Heads outvie; Others, as single Stars, may Glory beam; Take me, for I a Constellation am; Let those who Subjects want, pursue the flowry Crown, A flowry Nation, I, alone; Nor did kind Nature thus in vain, So many Heads to me assign; I for Mans Head, Lifes chiefest seat Am set apart and wholly consecrate. The minds Imperial Tow'r, the brain, (A pooor Apartment for so great a Queen) The Light-house where Mans Reason stands and shines, Maugre the malice of contending winds, I guard the sacred Place, repel the Rout, And keep the everlasting Fire from going out. Go now, and mock me with this monstrous Name Which the late barbarous Age did coin and frame, The true and proper names of things, of old, Through a Religious silence ne'r were told. Thus Guardian Gods true names were seldom known, Lest some invading Foe might charm 'em from the Town. Impudent Fool! that first stil'd beauteous Flowers By a detested Name; the Ears of Bears. Worthy himself of Asses Ears, a pair, Fairer than Midas once was said to wear. At this rate singing (for your merry Flowers Still sing their words, not bring 'em forth like ours) The Daffadil succeeded, once a Youth, (As any Poets tell, a sacred truth.) And all his Clients and his kindred came, A numerous train, to vote and poll for him; All of 'em pale or yellow did appear, The Livery which wounded Lovers wear. Though Virgil purple Honours has assign'd And blewish dy, too liberal and kind, The Chalcedonick with white Flower thought best To be the Mouth, and sing for all the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DAFFADIL.— Narcissus. WHat once I was, a Boy, not ripen'd to a Man, My roots of one years growth explain, A lovely Boy, of killing Eyes | Where ambuscading witchcraft lies, | Which did at last the Owners self surprize. | Of fatal Beauty, such as cou'd inspire Love into coldest Breasts, in water kindle fire. Me the hot beds of Sand in Libya burn, Or Ister 's frozen Banks to raine turn. I, when a Boy, among the boys Had still the noblest place, The same my Plant among the Flow'rs enjoys, And is the Gardens Ornament and grace. Become a Flower, I cannot tell Why my face shou'd not please me still; Downwards I lean my bending Head Longing my looks in the same Glass to read; Shew me a stream, that liquid Glass Will put me in the self same case; In th'colour with the same Nymphs I am drest, Who wear me in their snowy Breast; Who with my Flowers their pride maintain, And wish I were a Boy again. She spoke; Anemone her station took, To whom the Goddess deign'd a smiling look; For with the Tulip 's leave, I needs must say No Race more numerous, none more fine or gay; The Purple with its large and spreading Leaf [128] Was chosen by consent to be their Chief. Of fair Adonis bloud's undoubted strain, And to this hour it shews the dying stain; As soon as Zephyr had unloos'd its Tongue [129] The beauteous Plant after this manner sung. [128] 'Tis fabled to have sprung, out of Adonis 's bloud. [129] Its Flower never opens but when the Wind blows, Plin. 21.23.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANEMONE , or EMONIES. THOU gentle Zephyr , who didst Flora wed Thrice worthy of the Goddess bed; Who in a winged Chariot hurl'd With breezing Airs dost fan this nether world, Which kind refreshing motion, far I before lazy rest prefer; That Air with which thou every thing dost cheer, Inspire into the Goddess Ear; That the fair Judg would mindful be Of her lov'd Consort and of me; For since I take my Name from thee, Nay of thy Kindred said to be; Since I with thee do sympathize Who in Æolian Dungeon Captive lies, And viewing Zephyr 's doleful state, All Dress and Ornament I hate, And locking up my mournful Flower, My self a Pris'ner make, the same restraint endure. Since I have change of Suits and gaudy Vests, Which in my various Flowers are exprest; In brief, since I'm akin to Gods above; All these together sure may favour move; Sprung from the fair Adonis purple tide And Venus tears, to both I am ally'd; The Rosy Youth, the lov'd Adonis stood | The pride and glory of the Wood, | Till a Boars fatal tusk let out the precious bloud. | Into each flowing drop that still'd | A falling tear the Goddess spill'd, | Which to a bloudy torrent swell'd. | The Lovers tears and bloud combine As if they wou'd in Marriage join; From such fair Parents, and that wedding morn Was I, their fairer off-spring, born. My force and power perhaps you question now, My Power? Why, I a handsom face can show; Besides, my heavenly Extract I can prove, And that I'm Sister to the God of Love. The Crown Imperial (as she step'd aside) Advanc'd with stately, but becoming pride, Not buskin'd Heroes strut with nobler pride, Nor Gods in walking use a finer stride: No Friends or Clients made her Train, not one; Conscious of native worth, she came alone. With an erect and sober Countenance [130] In following terms she did her Plea commence. [130] The most noble Flow'r, to the sight, that grows. Lauremberg .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IMPERIAL CROWN. WITH furious heats and unbecoming rage Ye flowry Nations cease t'engage; Since on my stately Stem Nature has plac'd th'Imperial Diadem; Why all these words in vain, why all this noise? Be judg'd by Nature and approve her choice. Perhaps it does your envy move, And to my right may hurtful prove, That I an upstart Novel Flower am Who have no rumbling hard Greek name; Perhaps I may be thought In some Plebeian bed begot, Because my Lineage wears no stain, | Nor does Romantick shameful Stories feign | That I am sprung from Jove , or from his bastard strain. I freely own, I have not been Long of your world a Denizen; But yet I reign'd for Ages past | In Persia and in Bactria plac'd, | The pride and joy of all the Gardens of the East. | My Flower a large-siz'd golden head does wear, | Much like the Ball Kings in their hands do bear, | Denoting Sovereign Rule and striking Fear. | My purple stalk, I, like some Scepter wield, Worthy in Regal hands to shine, Worthy of thine, great God of Wine, When India to thy conquering Arms did yield. Besides all this; I have a flowry Crown My Royal Temples to adorn, Whose buds a sort of Hony liquor bear, Which round the Crown, like Stars or Pearls appear; Silver threads around it twine, Saffron , like Gold, with them does join; And over All My verdant Hair does neatly fall. Sometimes, a threefold rank of Flowers Grows on my top, like lofty Towers. Imperial Ornaments I scorn, And, like the Pope, affect a triple Crown; The Heavens look down and envy Earth For teeming with so bright a Birth; For Ariadnes starry crown By mine is far out-done, And as they've Reason, let 'em envy on. She thunder'd out her Speech; and walk'd to greet | The Judg, not falling meanly at her feet, | But as one Goddess does another meet. | A flower that wou'd too happy be and blest, Did but its Odour answer all the rest! The Tulip next appear'd, all over gay, But wanton, full of pride, and full of play; The world can't shew a Dye, but here has place, Nay by new mixtures she can change her face. Purple and Gold are both beneath her care, The richest Needlework she loves to wear; Her onely study is to please the Eye, And to outshine the rest in Finery; Oft of a Mode or Colour weary grown By which their Family had long been known, They'll change their fashion strait, I know not how, And with much pain in other Colours go; As if Medea 's Furnace they had past; (She without Plants old Æson ne'r new-cast) And though they know this change will mortal prove They'll venture yet—to change so much they love. Such love to Beauty, such the thirst of praise, That welcome Death before inglorious days! The cause by all was to the white assign'd, Whether because the rarest of the kind, Or else because every Petitioner [131] In antient times, for Office, white did wear. [131] Thence such were are are still call'd Candidates .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TULIP. SOmewhere in Horace , if I don't forget, [132] (Flowers are no foes to Poetry and Wit; For us that Tribe the like affection bear, And of all Men the greatest Florists are) We find a wealthy man Whose Ward-robe did five thousand Suits contain; He counted that a vast prodigious store, But I that number have twice told and more. Whate'r in Spring the teeming Earth commands; What Colours e'r the painted pride of Birds, Or various Lights the glistering Gem affords Cut by the artful Lapidary's hands; Whate'r the Curtains of the Heavens can show, Or Light lays Dyes upon the varnish'd Bow, Rob'd in as many Vests I shine, In every thing bearing a Princely Mien. Pity I must the Lily and the Rose (And the last blushes at her threadbare Clothes) Who think themselves so highly blest, Yet have but one poor tatter'd Vest. These studious, unambitious things, in brief, Wou'd fit extreamly well a College-life, And when the God of Flowers a Charter grants Admission shall be given to these Plants; Kings shou'd have plenty, and superfluous store, Whilst thriftiness becomes the poor. Hence Spring himself does chiefly me regard: Will any Flower refuse to stand to his award? Me for whole Months he does retain And keeps me by him all his Reign; Caress'd by Spring, the season of the year, Which before all to Love is dear. Besides; the God of Love himself's my friend, Not for my Face alone; but for another end. Lov'd by the God upon a private score, I know for what—but say no more; But why shou'd I, Become so silent or so shy? We Flow'rs were by no peevish Sire begot, Nor from that frigid, sullen Tree did sprout, So famed in Ceres sacred Rites; Nor in moroseness Flora 's self delights. My Root, like Oil in antient Games, prepares [133] Lovers for Battle or those softer wars; My quickning heat their sluggish veins inspires With vigorous and sprightly fires; Had but chast Lucrece us'd the same, The night before bold Tarquin try'd his flame, Upon Record she ne'r a Fool had been, But wou'd have liv'd to reap the pleasure once again. The Goddess conscious of the truth, a while Contain'd, but then was seen to blush and smile. The Flower-de Luce next loos'd her heavenly Tongue; And thus, amidst her sweet Companions, sung. [132] Horat. lib. I. Ep. 6. [133] Lauremberg. Gerard, Parkinson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Iris , or the FLOWER-DE-LUCE. IF Empire is to Beauty due (And that in flowers, if anywhere, holds true) Then I by Nature was design'd for Reign; Else Nature made a beauteous Face in vain. Besides, I boast a sparkling Gem, And brighter Goddess of my Name. My lofty front toward the Heaven I bear, And represent the Sky, when 'tis serene and clear. To me a Godlike Power is given With a mild face resembling Heaven; And in the Kingly stile, no Dignity Sounds better than SERENITY; Beauty and Envy oft together go, Handsom my self, I help make others so; [134] Both Gods and Men of the most curious Eyes With secret pleasure I surprise; Nor do I less oblige the Nose, With fragrance from my Root that blows. Not Sibaris or soft Capua did know | A choicer Flower for smell or show, | Though both with pleasure of all kinds did flow. | I own, the Violet and the Rose Divinest Odours both disclose; The Saffron and Stock Gilloflower. With many more; But yet none can so sweet a root produce. [135] My upper parts are trim and fair, My lower breath a grateful Air, I am a Flower for sight, a Drug for use. Soft as I am, amidst this luxury, Before me rough Diseases fly. Thus a bold Amazon with Virgin face Troops of dastard Men will chase. Thus Mars and Venus often greet, And in single Pallas meet: Equal to her in Beauties charms And not to him inferior in Arms. By secret Virtue and resistless power Those whom the Jaundice seizes I restore; [136] Though moist with Unguent, and inclin'd to love, I rather was for Luxury design'd, And yet like some enraged Lioness Before my painted Arms the yellow foe does hast. The Dropsie headlong makes away As soon as I my Arms display; The Dropsie, which Mans Microcosm drowns Pulling up all the Sluces in its rounds, I follow it through every winding vein, And make it quit in hast the delug'd Man. The Nation of the Jews , a pious folk, Though our Gods they don't invoke; And not to You, ye Plants, unknown I' th'days of that great Flowrist Salomon. Tell us, that Jove to cheer the drooping Ball After the Floud, a Promise past, How that so long as Earth shou'd last, No future Deluge on the world shou'd fall. And as a Seal to this obliging Grant, The Rain-bow in the Sky did plant; I am that Bow, in poor Hydropick Man, The same refreshing hopes contain. I look as gay, and show as fine, I am the Thing, of which that onely is the Sign. My Plant performs the same Towards Mans little worldly frame; And when within him I appear, He need no Deluge from a Dropsie fear. The Peony then, with large red Flower came on, [137] And brought no train, but his lov'd Mate alone; Numbers cou'd not make him the cause espouse, Nor did her costly wardrobe Pride inspire, All dress'd alike, all did one colour wear. And yet he wanted not for Majesty, Appearing with a sober gravity. For He advanc'd his purple forehead, which A Flower with thousand foldings did enrich: Some love to call it the Illustrious Plant. And we may well, I think, that Title grant; Physicians in their publick Writings show, What praise is to the first Inventor due. Pæon was Doctor to the Gods, they say, [138] By the whole College honour'd to this day. With her own merits, and this mighty Name Hearten'd and buoy'd, she thus maintain'd her Claim. [134] The juice of the Root takes away Freckles and Morphews. [135] Of the Root is made, that call'd Powder of Cyprus , or Orris Powder. [136] Its faculty in curing these Diseases, is celebrated by Laurember, Fernelius , etc. [137] The Peony male and female. [138] Homer says, Pæon cur'd Pluto with this Plant, when he was wounded by Hercules .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pæonia. The PEONY. IF the fond Tulip, swell'd with pride, In her Fools-coat of motley colours dy'd; If lov'd Adonis Flower, the Celandine. Wou'd proudly be prefer'd to mine; Then let Joves Bird, the Eagle quit the Field, The Thunder to the painted Peacock yield: Then let the Tyrant of the Woods be gone, The Lion yield to the Chameleon. You'll say perhaps the Nymphs make much of you, They gather me for Garlands too. And yet d' ye think I value that? Not I, by Flora , not a jot. Virtue and courage are the valuable things, On difficult occasions shown. Not painted Arms ennoble Kings, Virtue alone gives lustre to a Crown. Hence I, the known Herculean Disease The Falling Sickness, cure with ease, Which, like the Club, that Hero once did wear, Down with one single blow mankind does bear. I fansie, hense the story rise, That Pluto wounded once by Hercules. My juice, infus'd by Pæon , gave him ease, | And did the groaning God appease. | Pæon was fam'd, I'm sure, for curing this disease. | Pluto is God of Hell, 't shou'd seem Prince of inexorable Death; Now this Disease is Death; but not like him Without a sting, plac'd in the Shades beneath. I shou'd be vain, extreamly vain, indeed A quarrel on Punctilio's to breed, Since a more noble Flower, than I, The Sun in all his journey does not spy. Nor do I go in Physick's beaten Road | By other Plants before me trod, | But in a way worthy a healing God. | I never with the foe come hand to hand. My Odour Death does at a distance send; Hung round the Neck strait without more ado I put to fight the rampant foe; I neither come (what think you, Cesar , now) Nor view the Camp, and yet can overthrow. She spoke, and bow'd, and so the Court forsook, Her Consort follow'd with a blushing look; When strait a fragrant Air of strong Perfume, And a new lustre darted through the Room. No wonder, for the Rose did next appear, Spring wisely plac'd his best and choicest troops i' th'Rear. Some wild in woods; yet worth and beauty show, Such as might in Hesperian Gardens grow. Nought, by experience, than the Wood-Rose found, Better to cure a mad Dogs poisonous wound; This brings away the Gravel and the Stone, And gives you ease though to a Quarry grown. The beauteous Garden-Rose she did not shame, Though better bred and of a softer Name; Which in four Squadrons drawn, the Damask Rose In name of all the rest maintain'd the Cause; Which sprung, they say, from Syrian Venus bloud, [139] Long time the pride of rich Damascus floud. [139] The Rose is said at first to have grown white only, till Venus running after Adonis , scratch'd her Legs upon its thorns, and stain'd the flowers red with her bloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ROSE. AND who can doubt my Race, says she, Who on my face Love's tokens see? The God of Love is always soft, and always young, I am the same, then to his bloud what wrong? My Brother wingèd does appear; I leaves instead of wings do wear; He's drawn with lighted Torches in his hand; Upon my top bright flaming glories stand; The Rose has prickles, so has Love, Though these a little sharper prove; There's nothing in the world above, or this below, But would for Rosy-colour'd go; This is the Dye that still does please Both mortal Maids, and heavenly Goddesses; I am the Standard by which Beauty's try'd, The wish of Chloe , and immortal Juno 's pride. The bright Aurora , Queen of all the East. Proud of her Rosy fingers, is confest; When from the gates of LIght the rising Day Breaks forth, his constant rounds to go, The winged hours prepare the way, And Rosy Clouds before him strow. The windows of the Sky with Roses shine; I am Days Ornament as well as sign. And when the glorious pomp and tour is o'er, I greet it posting to the Western shore. The God of Love, we must allow, Shou'd tolerably Beauty know. Yet never from those Cheeks he goes, Where he can spy the blushing Rose. Thus the wise Bee will never dwell (That, like the God of Love has wings, That too has Honey, that has stings) On vulgar Flowers that have no grateful smell. Tell me, blest Lover: what's a kiss Without a Rosy Lip create the bliss? Nor do I onely charming sweets dispence, But bear Arms in my own and Mans defence. I without the Patient's pain Mans body, that Augean Stable clean. Not with a rough and pressing hand, As Thunder-storms from Clouds command, But as the dew and gentle flowers Dissolving light on Herbs and Flowers. Nor of a short and fading date Was I the less design'd for Rule and State; Let proud ambitious Floramour [140] Usurping on the Gods immortal Name, Joy to be stil'd the Everlasting Flower. I ne'r knew yet that Plant that near to Nestor came. We too too blest, too powerful shou'd be grown, Which wou'd but Envy raise, If we cou'd say our beauty were our own, Or boast long life and many days. But why shou'd I complain of Fate For giving me so short a date? Since Flowers, the Emblems of Mortality, All the same way and manner die. But the kind Gods above forbid, That Virtue e'er a Grave shou'd find, And though the fatal Sisters cut my thread, My Odour, like the Soul, remains behind. To a dead Lion a live Worm's prefer'd, Though once the King of all the savage Herd. After my Death I still excel The best of Flowers that are alive and well. If that the name of Dead will bear, From whose meer Corps does come, (Like the dead bodies still surviving Hale) So sweet a smell and strong Perfume. Let 'em invent a thousand ways My mangled Corps to vex and squeeze, Though in a sweating Limbeck pent My Ashes still preserve their scent. Like a dead Monarch to the Grave I come, Nature embalms me in my own Perfume. She spoke, a Virgin blush came o'r her face, And an Ambrosian scent flew round the place; But that which gave her words a finer grace, Not without some constraint she seem'd to tell her praise. Her Rivals trembled; for the Judge's look A secret pleasure and much kindness spoke; The Virgin did not for well-wishers lack, Her kind red Squadrons stood behind her back. The yellow nearest stood, unfit for war, Nor did the spoils of cur'd Diseases bear; The white was next, of great and good renown, A kind assistant to the Eye-sight known; The third, a mighty Warrier, was the Red, Which terribly her bloudy Banner spread; She binds the Flux with her restringent Arts, And stops the humours journey to those parts; She brings a present and a sure relief To Head and Heart, the Fountains both of Life; The Fevers fires by her are mildness taught, And the Hagg'd Man to sweet composure brought. By help of this, Jason of old, we read, Yok'd and subdu'd the Bulls of fiery breed; One Dose to sleep the watchful Dragon sent, By which no more but a high Fever's meant. Between this Squadron and the White, we're told, A long and grievous strife commenc'd of old; Strife is too soft a word for many years Cruel, unnatural, and bloudy wars; The fam'd Pharsalian fields twice dy'd in bloud, Ne'r of a nobler Quarrel witness stood; The thirst of Empire, ground of most our wars, Was that which solely did occasion theirs; For the Red Rose cou'd not an Equal bear, And the White wou'd of no Superiour hear, The Chief by York and Lancaster upheld [141] With civil rage harass'd the British field. What madness drew ye Roses to engage, Kin against kin to spend your thorns and rage! Go, turn your Arms, where you may triumph gain, And fame unsullied with a blushing stain; See the French Lily spoils and wasts your shore, Go conquer there, where you've twice beat before. Whilst the Scotch Thistle with audacious pride, Taking advantage, gores your bleeding side. Do Roses no more sense and prudence own Than to be fighting for Domestick Crown? From Venus You much of the Mother bear, You both take pleasure in the God of War; I now begin to think the Fable true, That Mars sprung from a Flower, fulfill'd by You. War ravages the Field, and like the furious Boar, That turns up all the Gardens beauteous store; O'rthrows the Trees and Hedges, and does wound With his ungentle tusk the bleeding ground; Roots up the Saffron and the Violet-bed. And feasts upon the gaudy Tulip 's head. You'd grieve to see a beauteous Plat so soon Into confusion by a Monster thrown. But oh, my Muse, oh whither doest thou tow'r This is a flight too high for thee to soar. The harmless strife of Plants, their wanton play, Thy Pipe perhaps may well enough essay; But for their Wars, that is a Theme so great, Rather for Lucan 's Martial Trumpet fit; To him that sung the Theban Brothers death, To Maro or some such, that task bequeath.

What further specious Clogs of Life remain, He leaves for Fools to seek, and Knaves to gain. This happy Life did th'Old Corycian choose; [142] A Life deserving Maro 's noble Muse; This Life did wise Abdolominus charm, The mighty Monarch of a little Farm. While howing weed that on his Walks encroach'd Great Alexander 's Messenger approach'd, Receive, said He, the Ensigns of a Crown A Scepter, Mitre, and Sidonian Gown: To Empire call'd unwillingly he goes, And longing looks back on his Cottage throws. Thus Aglaus 's Farm did frequent Visits find From Gods, himself a stranger to Mankind. Gyges the richest King of former times, (Wicked and swelling with successful Crimes) Is there, said he, a Man more blest than I? Thus challeng'd he the Delphick Deity. Yes, Aglaus , the plain-dealing God reply'd. Aglaus ? Who's he? the angry Monarch cry'd. Say, is there any King so call'd? there's none. No King was ever by that Title known. Or any great Commander of that Name, Or Heroe who with Gods do's kindred claim: Or any who does such vast wealth enjoy As all his Luxury can ne'r destroy. Renown'd for Arms, for Wealth, or Birth, no Man Was found call'd Aglaus : Who's this Aglaus then? At last in the retir'd Arcadian Plains (Silence and Shades surround Arcadian Swains) Near Ptophis Town (where he but once had been) At Plow this Man of Happiness was seen. In this Retirement was that Aglaus found, Envy'd by Kings and by a God Renown'd.

Of Summer Flow'rs a mighty Host remain, With those which Autumn musters on the Plain, Who with Joint forces fill the shining Field, Grudging that Spring shou'd equal numers yield To both their Lists; or 'cause some Plants had been Under the service of both Seasons seen. Of these, my Muse, rehearse the Chief (for all Though Mem'ry 's Daughter thou can'st ne'r recall) The spikes of Summers Corn thou mayst as well Or ev'ry Grape of fruitful Autumn tell. The flamy Pansie ushers Summer in, [143] His friendly March with Summer does begin; Autumn 's Companion too (so Proserpine Hides half the year and half the year is seen) The Violet is less beautiful than thee, That of one colour boasts, and thou of three. Gold, Silver, Purple are thy Ornament, Thy Rivals thou mightst scorn hadst thou but scent. The Hesperis assumes a Violet 's Name [144] To that which justly from the Hesper came; Hesper do's all thy precious sweets unfold, Which coyly thou didst from the Day with-hold: In him more than the Sun thou tak'st delight, To him like a kind Bride thou yieldst thy sweet at Night. The Anthemis a small but glorous Flower, Scarce rears his Head yet has a Giant's Tow'r; Forces the lurking Fever to retreat (Esconc'd like Cacus in his smoky Seat) Recruits the feeble joints and gives them ease: He makes the burning Inundation cease; And when his force against the Stone is sent He breaks the Rock and gives the waters vent. Not Thunder finds through Rocks so swift a course, Nor Gold the Rampir'd Town so soon can force. Blew-bottle , thee my Numbers fain wou'd raise, And thy Complexion challenges my Praise, Thy Countenance like Summer Skies is fair, But ah! how diff'rent thy vile Manners are! Ceres , for this excludes thee from my Song, And Swains to Gods and me a sacred Throng: A treach'rous Guest; Destruction thou dost bring To th'hospitable Field where thou dost spring. Thou bluntst the very Reaper's Sicle, and so In Life and Death becom'st the farmers Foe. The Fenel-Flow'r do's next our Song invite, Dreadful at once, and lovely to the sight: His Beard all bristly, all unkemb'd his Hair, Ev'n his wreath'd Horns the same rough aspect bear; His Visage too a watrish Blew adorns, Like Achelous , ere his Head wore Horns. Nor without Reason, (prudent Nature's Care Gives Plants a Form that might their Use declare) Dropsies it Cures, and makes moist Bodies dry, It bids the Waters pass, the frighten'd Waters fly, Do's through the Bodies secret Channels run; A Water-Goddess in the little World of Man. But say, Corn-Violet , why thou dost claim Of Venus Looking Glass the pompous Name? Thy studded Purple vie, I must confess, With the most noble and Patrician dress; Yet wherefore Venus Looking-Glass ? that Name Her Off-spring Rose did ne'r presume to claim. Antirrhinon , more modest, takes the stile Of Lions-Mouth , sometimes of Calfsnout vile, By us Snap-dragaon call'd to make amends. But say what this Chimera-name intends? Thou well deservs't it, if, as old Wives say, Thou driv'st nocturnal Ghosts, and Sprights away. Why do's thy Head, Napellus , Armor wear? [145] Thy Guilt, perfidious Plant, creates thy fear: Thy Helmet we cou'd willingly allow, But thou alas, hast mortal Weapons too! But wherefore arm'd? as if for open Fight; Who work'st by secret Poyson all thy spight. Helmet gainst Helmet justly thou dost wear, Blew Anthora , upon thy lovely Hair; [146] This cov'ring from felt Wounds thy Front do's shield; With such a Head-piece Pallas goes to field. What God to thee such baneful force allow'd, With such Heroick Piety endow'd? Thou poyson'st more than e'r Medea slew, Yet no such Antidote Medea knew. Nor powerful only 'gainst thy own dire harms, Thy Virtue ev'ry noxious plant disarms: Serpents are harmless Creatures made by Thee, And Africa its self from Poyson free. Air, Earth and Seas, with secret Taint opprest, Discharge themselves of the unwelcome Guest; On wretched Us they shed the deadly Bane, Who dye by them that should our Life maintain. Then Nature seems t'have learnt the poys'ning Trade, Our common Parent our Step-mother made: 'Tis then the sickly World perceives thy Aid, By thy prevailing force the Plague is staid. A noble strife 'twixt Fate and Thee we find, That to destroy, thou to preserve Mankind. Into thy Lists, thou Martial Plant admit, Goats Rue, Goats-Rue is for thy Squadrons fit. Thy Beauty Campion , very much may claim, [147] But of Greek-Rose how didst thou gain the Name? The Greeks were ever priviledg'd to tell Untruths, they call thee Rose , who hast no smell. Yet formerly thou wert in Garlands worn, Thy starry Beams our Temples still adorn. Thou crown'st our Feasts, where we in Mirth suppose, And in our Drink allow Thee for a Rose . The Chalcedonian Soil did once produce A Lychnis of much greater size and Use; Form'd like a Sconce, where various branches rise, Bearing more Lights than Juno 's Bird has Eyes. [148] Like those in Palaces, whose Golden Light Strikes up and makes the gilded Roofs more bright: This, great Mens Tables serves, while that's preferr'd To Altars and the Gods Celestial Board. Shou'd Maro ask me in what Region springs The Race of Flow'rs inscrib'd with Names of Kings, I answer, that of Flow'rs deserv'dly crown'd With Royal Titles many may be found, The Royal Called Loose-strife , Royal Gentian grace [149] [150] Our gardens, proud of such a Princely Race. Soap Wort , though coarse thy Name, thou dost excell [151] In Form, and art enrich'd with fragrant Smell: As great in Virtue too, for thou giv'st Ease In Dropsies and Fair Venus foul Disease. Yet dost not servile offices decline, But condescend'st to make our Kitchins shine. Rome 's Great Dictator thus, his triumph past, Return'd to plow, nor thought his Pomp debas'd, The same right hand guides now the humble Stive, And Oxen Yoaks, that did fierce Nations drive. Next comes the Flow'r in figure of a Bell, [152] Thy sportive-meaning Nature who can tell: In these what Musick Flora dost thou find? Say for what jocund Rites they are design'd. By us these Bells are never heard to sound, | Our Ears are dull, and stupid is our Mind, | Nature is all a Riddle to Mankind. | Some Flow'rs give Men as well as Gods delight, These gratifie nor Smell, nor Taste, nor Sight; Why therefore should not our fifth Sense be serv'd? [153] Or is that pleasure for the Gods reserv'd? But of all Bell -Flow'rs Bindweed do's surpass, [154] Of brighter Metal than Corinthian Brass. My Muse grows hoarse and can no longer sing, But Throat-Wort hasts her kind relief to bring; The Colleges with Dignity enstal This Flow'r, at Rome he is a Cardinal. [155] The Fox-Glove on fair Flora 's Hand is worn, [156] Lest while she gathers Flow'rs she meet a Thorn. Lov-Apple , though its Flow'r less fair appears, It's golden Fruit deserves the Name it bears. But this is new in Love, where the true Crop Proves nothing; all the Pleasure was i' th'Hope. The Indian Flow'ry-Reed in Figure vies, [157] And Lustre, with the Cancer of the Skies. The Indian Cress our Climate now do's bear, Call'd Larks-heel , 'cause he wears a Horse-mans Spur. This Gilt-spur Knight prepares his Course to run, Taking his Signal from the rising Sun. And stimulates his Flow'r to meet the day: So Castor mounted spurs his Seed away. This Warriour sure has in some Battel been, For spots of Bloud upon his Breast are seen. Had Ovid seen him, how would he have told His History, a Task for me too bold; His Race at large and Fortunes had exprest, And whence those bleeding Signals on thy Brest: From later Bards such Mysteries are hid, Nor do's the God inspire, as heretofore he did. With the same weapon Lark-spur thou dost mount [158] Amongst the Flow'rs, a Knight of high account; To want those war-like Ensigns were a shame For thee, who kindred dost with Ajax claim: Of unarm'd Flowers he cou'd not be the Sire, Who for the loss of Armor did expire: Of th'ancient Hyacinth thou keep'st the Form, Those lovely Creatures, that ev'n Phœbus Charm; In thee those skilful Letters still appear, [159] That prove thee Ajax his undoubted Heir. That up-start Flow'r, that has usurpt thy Fame, O'rcome by thee, is forc'd to quit his Claim. [160] The Lily too wou'd fain thy Rival be, | And brings, 'tis true, some signs that well agree, | But in Complexion differs much from thee. | At Spring thou mayst adorn the Asian Bow'rs, We reap thee here among our Summer Flow'rs. But Martagon a bolder Challenge draws, And offers Reason to support his Cause: Nor did Achilles Armor e'r create, 'Twixt Ajax and Ulysses such debate, So fierce, so great, as at this day we see, For Ajax Spoils, 'twixt Martagon and thee. That Bastard Dittany of Sanguine hue [161] From Hector 's reeking Bloud Conception drew, I cannot say, but still a Crimson stain Tinctures it's Skin, and colours every Vein; In Man the three chief Seats it do's maintain, Defends the Heart, the Stomach, and the Brain. But all in vain thy Virtue is employ'd, To save a Town must be at last destroy'd; In vain thou fight'st with Heav'n and Destiny, Our Troy must fall, and thou our Hector die. Next comes the Candy-Tuft , a Cretan Flower, [162] That rivals Jove in Country and in Power. The Pellitory healing Fire contains, That from a raging Tooth the Humor drains; At bottom red, above 'tis white and pure, Resembling Teeth and Gums, for both a certain Cure. The Sow-Bread do's afford rich Food for Swine, Physick for Man, and Garlands for the Shrine. Mouse-Ear , like to its Name-sake, loves t' abide [163] In places out o' th'way, from Mankind hid. It loves the shade, and Nature kindly lends A Shield against the Darts that Phœbus sends; 'Tis with such silky Bristles cover'd o'r, The tend'rest Virgin's Hand may crop the Flow'r. From all its num'rous Darts no hurt is found, Its Weapons know to Cure, but not to wound. Sweet William small, has Form and aspect bright, Like that sweet Flower that yields great Jove delight; Had he Majestick bulk, he'd now be stil'd | Jove 's flower, and if my skill is not beguil'd, | He was Jove 's flower when Jove was but a Child. | Take him with many Flow'rs in one conferr'd, He's worthy Jove , ev'n now he has a Beard. The Catch-Fly with Sweet-William we confound, Whose Nets the stragglers of the swarm surround, Those viscous Threads that hold th'entangled Prey From its own treach'rous Entrails force their way. Three branches in the Barren Wort are found, Each Branch again with three less Branches crown'd, The Leaves and Flowers adorning each are three, This Frame must needs contain some Sacred Mystery. Small are thy Blossoms, double Pelitory , Which yet united are the Garden's Glory. Sneezing thou dost provoke, and Love for thee When thou wert born sneez'd most auspiciously. But thou that from fair Mella tak'st thy Name, Thy Front surrounded with a Star-like flame, [164] Scorn not the Meads, for from the Meads are born Wreaths, which the Temples of the Gods adorn; Kind sustenance thou yieldst the lab'ring Bee, When scarce thy Mother Earth affords it thee. Thy Winter-store in hardest Months is found, And more than once with Flow'rs in Summer crown'd. Thy Root supplies the place of Flowers decay'd, and fodder for the fainting Hive is made. Behold a Monster loathsome to the Eye, [165] Of slender bulk, but dang'rous Policy, Eight Legs it bears, three joynts in every Limb, That nimbly move and dextrously can climb, Its Trunk (all Belly) round, deform'd and swell'd, With fatal Nets and deadly Poyson fill'd. For Gnats and wand'ring Flies she spreads her toils; And Robber-like, lives high on ravish'd spoils. The City Spider, as more civilis'd, With this less hurtful practice is suffic'd. With greater fury the Tarantula | Tho small it self, makes Men and Beasts it's Prey; | Takes first our Reason then our Life away. | Thou Spider-Wort dost with the Monster strive, And from the conquer'd Foe thy Name derive. Thus Scipio , when the Worlds third part he won, While to the Spoils the meaner Captains run, The only Plunder he desir'd was Fame, And from the vanquish'd Foe to take his Name. The Marvail of the World comes next in view, At home, but stil'd the Marvail of Peru ; (Boast not too much, proud Soil, thy Mines of gold, Thy Veins much wealth, but more of Poyson hold.) Bring o'r the Root, our colder Earth has Power In its full Beauty to produce the Flower; But yields for Issue no prolific Seed, And scorns in foreign Lands to Plant and Breed. The Halihock disdains the common size Of Herbs, and like a Tree do's proudly rise; Proud she appears, but try her and you'll find | No Plant more mild, or friendly to Mankind: | She gently all Obstructions do's unbind. | The Africans their rich Leaves closely fold, [166] Bright as their Country's celebrated Gold. Each hollow Leaf, envelop'd, does impart The form of a gilt Pipe, and seems a work of Art. Wou'd kind Apollo once these Pipes inspire They'd give such sounds as should surpass his Lyre. A more than common date this Flow'r enjoys, And sees a Month compleated ere she dyes. These only Fate permits so long to stand, And crops 'em then with an unwilling Hand, The Calyx where her fertile Seeds are laid In likeness of a painted Quiver made, With store of Arrows too this Quiver's grac'd. And decently on Flora 's Shoulder plac'd, When she in Gardens hunts the Butterfly , | In vain the wretch his Sun-burnt wings do's try, | Secure enough, did Fear not make him fly. | Himself would seem a Flow'r if motionless, and cheat the Goddess with his gaudy dress. Retreating, the keen Spike his sides do's goad, To Earth he falls, a light and unfelt Load. Such was the Punic Caltha , which of Yore, Of Juno's Rose the lofty Title bore. Of famous Carthage , now by Fate bereft, This last (and surely) greatest Pride is left. How vain, O Flowers, your hopes and wishes be, Born like your selves by rapid winds away. Once you had hopes at Hannibal 's Return From vanquish'd Rome , his Triumphs to adorn, And ev'n imperious Carthage Head surround, When she the Mistris of the World were crown'd; Presum'd that Flora wou'd for you declare, Tho she that time a Latian Goddess were: But now (alas!) reduc'd to private State, Thou shar'st, poor Flower , thy Captive Countrey's Fate. Why Holly-Rose , dost thou, of slender frame, And without scent, assume a Rose 's Name? Fate on thy Pride a swift Revenge does bring, The Day beholds thee dead, that sees thee spring. Yet to the shades thy Soul triumphing goes, Boasting that thou didst imitate the Rose . A better claim Sweet-Cistus may pretend, Whose sweating Leaves a fragrant Balsam send: To crop this Plant the wicked Goat presumes, Whose fetid Beard the precious Balm perfumes: But in Revenge of the unhallowed Theft, The Caitiff's of his larded Beard bereft. Baldness thou dost redress, nor are we sure Whether the Beard or Balsam gives the cure. Thy Ointment, Jessamine , without abuse Is gain'd, yet grave old Sots condemn the use; Tho' Jove himself, when he is most enrag'd, With thy Ambrosial Odour is asswag'd: Capricious Men! why should that scent displease, That is so grateful to the Deities? Flora her self to th' Orange-Tree lays claim, [167] Calls it her own, Pomona does the same; Hard words ensue, (for under sense of wrong Ev'n Goddesses themselves can find a Tongue) If Apples please you so, Pomona cries, Take your Love-Apple , and let that suffice, To claim anothers Right is Harlots trade. So may a Goddess of an Harlot made. And on what score, Flora incens'd reply'd, Were you by kind Vertumnus deify'd? You kept (no thanks) your Maiden Virtue, when He was a Matron, when a Youth—what then? Such fragrant Fruits as these may Flowers be call'd, And henceforth with that Name shall be enstall'd. On sundry sorts of Pulse we do bestow That Title, though in open field they grow, As others oft are in the Garden seen, Witness the everlasting Pulse and Scarlet Bean . The vulgar Beans sweet scent, who does not prize, With Iv'ry Forehead, and with Jet-black Eyes, Amongst our Garden-Beauties may appear, If Gardens only their cheap Crop did bear. Pythagoras , not rightly understood, Has left a Scandal on the noble Food: Take care henceforth, ye Sages , to speak true, Speak truth, and speak intelligibly too. Lupine unsteep'd, to harshness does encline, And like old Cato , is of temper rough, But drench the Pulse in Water, him in Wine, They'll lose their sowrness and grow mild enough. These Flowers, and thousands more, whose num'rous tribe, And pompous March, 'twere endless to describe. The Mandrake only imitates our walk, [168] And on two Legs erect is seen to stalk. This Monster struck Bellona 's self with aw, When first the Man-resembling Plant she saw. The Water-Lily still is wanting here, [169] | What cause can Water-Lily have to fear, Where Beauties of inferiour Rank appear? | Her Form excells, and for Nobility The whole Assembly might her Vassals be: A Water-Nymph she was, Alcides Bride, [170] (Who sprung from Gods, himself now deify'd) This cost her dear—by Love of him betray'd, The Water-Goddess a poor Plant was made; From this Misfortune she does tristful prove, And to this hour she hates the name of Love. All freedom she renounces, Mirth and Play, That to more close Embraces lead the way: And since our Flora 's former Pranks are know (Who sprung from Gods, himself now deify'd) This cost her dear—by Love of him betray'd, The Water-Goddess a poor Plant was made; From this Misfortune she does tristful prove, And to this hour she hates the name of Love. All freedom she renounces, Mirth and Play, That to more close Embraces lead the way: And since our Flora 's former Pranks are known, | (If in a Goddess we such Crimes may own) | In life the common Mistress of the Town. | She scorns at her Tribunal to be seen, Nor would on terms so scandalous be Queen. To be from Earth divorc'd she'd rather choose, And to the Sun her wither'd Root expose. Thee Maracot a much more sacred Cause [171] From these profane ridic'lous Rites withdraws; With signals of a real God adorn'd, Poets and Painter's Gods by thee are scorn'd: T'unfold the Emblems of this mystick Flower Transcends (alas!) my feeble Muses Power. But Nature sure by chance did ne'r bestow A form so diff'rent from all Plants that grow, Enrob'd with ten white Leaves, the proper dress Of Virgins Chast and sacred Priestesses. Twice round her two-fold Selvedge you may view, A Purple Ring, the sacred Martyrs hue. Thick sprouting Stems of ruddy Saffron-Grain Strive to conceal the Flower, but strive in vain, This Coronet of Ruby-Spikes compos'd, The thorny Bloodstain'd Crown may be suppos'd; The Blood-stain'd Pillar too a curious Ey May there behold, and if you closely pry, | The Spung, the Nails, the Scourge thereon you'll spy, | And knobs resembling a Crown'd Head descry. | So deep in Earth the Root descends, you'd swear, It meant to visit Hell, and Triumph there; In ev'ry Soil it grows, as if it meant To stretch in Conquest to the World's extent. [142] Virg. Georg. 4. [143] Call'd Flamy because her three colours seen in the flame of wood as in the Rainbow. [144] Dames Violet call'd Hesperis , because it smells strongest in the Night. Plin. lib. 27.7. [145] Blew Helmet Flowers, or Monks-hood, so called from its figure. [146] Counter-Poyson-Monks-hood, or wholesom Helmet flower. [147] Called Lychnis quod noctu lucet . [148] The Peacock. [149] Called Lysimachia from Lysimachus . [150] Found by Gentius King of Illyricum , where they grow largest. [151] So called from its cleansing quality, used in washing Cloth and scouring Kitchin Vessels. [152] Bell -flowers Campanulæ . [153] The Hearing. [154] Call great Bind-Weed , or great Bell -Flower. [155] In Latin call'd Flos Cardinalis . [156] Flos Digitalis from resembling a Glove. [157] Canna Indica , or, Flos Cancri . [158] Consolida Regalis . [159] The Syllables Ac , As , most visible in this flower. [160] The common Hyacinth , who wants all the Notes of the old Hyacinth or Ajax Flower. [161] Fraxinella . [162] Thlaspi . [163] Auricula muris, Pilosella . [164] Start-Wort. Virg. Georg. 4. [165] Phalangium . [166] A flower so call'd, and sometimes falsly French Marigolds . [167] Malus Aurantius [168] Male and Female. [169] Nymphæa . [170] See Nymphæa or Water-Lily . [171] Flos Passionis Christi . The Passion-Flower, or Virginian Climber. The first of these Names was given it by the Jesuites , who pretend to find in it all the Instruments of our Lord's Passion; not so easily discern'd by men of Senses so fine as they. Beside the fore-nam'd Candidates, but few Remain'd, and most of them were modest too. But where such fragrant Rivals did appear, Who would have thought to find rank Moly there? Amongst Competitors of such fair Note Sure, Garlick only will for Moly Vote. Yet something 'twas, (and Plants themselves confess The Honour great) that Homer did express Her famous Name in his Immortal Song: Swell'd with this Pride, she presses through the throng. Deep silence o'r the whole Assembly spreads, Whilst with unsav'ry Breath her Title thus she Pleads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOLY. TO find a Name for me the Gods took care, A Mystick Name, that might my Worth declare, They call'd me Moly : dull Grammarians sense Is puzzled with the term— But Homer held Divine Intelligence. In Greek and Latin both my Name is Great, [172] The term is just, but Moly sounds more neat: My Pow'rs prevented Circes dire Design, Ulysses but for me had been a Swine; In vain had Mercury inspir'd his Brain With Craft, and tipt his wheedling tongue in vain, Had I not enter'd timely to his Aid, Thus Moly spoke, and would much more have said But by mischance (as if some angry Pow'r Had ow'd her long a shame) a Belch most sowr Broke from her throat, perfuming all the Court, And made her Rivals unexpected Sport. Her pompous Name no longer can take place, Her Odour proves her of the Garlick Race; Forthwith with one consent the gibing throng Set up their Notes, and sung the well-known Song [173] He that to cut his Father's throat Did heretofore presume, T'have Garlick cram'd into his Gut Receiv'd the dreadful Doom. Flora to silence the tumultuous jest, (Though secretly she smil'd amongst the rest) That she her self would speak a sign exprest, Then with sweet Grace into these Accents broke, Th'unhallow'd place perfuming while she spoke.

      <field name="fulltext">FLORA. HOMER I will not vain or careless call, Though he no mention makes of me at all, That he blame-worthy was in this, 'tis true, But the blind Bard gives other Gods their due. To doubt his truth were Piety to slight, Ev'n what of Moly he affirms is right, I once had such a Flower, but now bereft O' th'happiness, the Name is onely left. No sooner Men its wondrous Virtue knew, But jealous Gods the pow'rful Plant withdrew; 'Tis said that Jove did Mercury chastise For shewing to Ulysses such a Prize. To say I saw him do't I'll not presume, But witness am of Moly 's unjust Doom. Ev'n to the Shades below her Root strikes down, As she wou'd make th'infernal world her own. As from their Seats the very Fiends she'd drive, And spight of flames and blasting Sulphur thrive. Jove saw 't, and said, Since Fire can't stop thy course, We'll try some Magick water's stronger force. Then calling Lympha to him, thus at large [174] Unfolds his Mind, and gives the Goddess charge: Thou know'st, said he, where Cicones reside, There runs a marv'lous petrifying tide; Take of that stream (but largely take) and throw Where-e'r thou seest the wicked Moly grow; Our Empire is not safe, her Powr's so large; Whole Rivers therefore on her Head discharge. Lympha with lib'ral Hand the Liquor pours, While thirsty Moly her own Bane devours; Her Stem forthwith is turn'd (O Prodigy) Into a Pillar; where her Flow'r shou'd be The sculpture of a Flow'r is onely shown: Poor Moly thus transform'd to Marble Stone, The story of her fate do's still present, And stands in Death her own sad Monument. Here ended little Moly 's mighty Reign, By jealous Gods for too much Virtue slain. What wonder then if that bold Flow'r did prove [175] The object of his wrath that Rival'd Jove . That to embrace chast Juno did aspire, Gallant t'a Goddess, of a God the Sire. The vig'rous Herb begat a Deity, | A God, like Jove himself for Majesty, | And one that thunders too as loud as he, | With one short Moment's touch begot him too, That's more than ever threshing Jove cou'd do. The Flow'r it self appears with Warriours Mien, (As much as can in growing Plants be seen.) With stabbing Point and cutting edg 'tis made, | Like warlike weapon, and upon it's Blade | Are ruddy stains like drops of Bloud displa'd. | Its Spikes of Falchion-shape are sanguine too, Its Stem and Front is all of bloudy hue: The Root in form of any Shield is spread, A crested Helmet's plac'd upon it's Head. Upon his Stalk, Strings, Bow and Arrow's grow, A Horsman's Spur upon his Heel below. Minerva I would have this Warriour wed, | A Warriour fit for chast Minerva 's Bed; | So might she teem, yet keep her Maiden-head. | My Garden had but one of these I own, And therefore by the name of Phœnix known, The Herb that could encrease Jove 's mighty Breed; T'its self an Eunuch was and wanted seed. Grieving that Earth so rich a Prize should want, I try'd all means to propagate the Plant: What cannot Wit, what cannot Art fulfil? At least where Pow'rs Divine wou'd shew their skill. One tender Bulb another did succeed, And my fair Phœnix now began to breed; But mark th'Event, shall I expecting sit, Cries Jove , till this young Sprout more Gods beget? To have a Rival in my Heav'n, and see An Herb-race mingle with Jove 's Progeny? A dreadful and blind Monster then does make; [176] That on his Rival dire Revenge might take; Though less of size, shap'd like a Forest Boar, And turns him loose into my Garden's store. What havock did the Savage make that day, (I weep to think what flow'ry Ruins lay) With Sulphur's fume I strove to drive him thence, The fume of Sulphur prov'd too weak defence. Great Spurge and Assa Fotida I try'd, In vain, in vain strong Moly 's scent apply'd. Small Vermin did his Ancestors suffice, | When they cou'd catch a Bettle 'twas a Prize, | But such coarse fare this Salvage does despise. | He like a Swine of Epicurus breed, On the best Dainties of my Soil must feed. Tulips of ten pounds price (so large and gay Adorn'd my Bow'r) he'd eat me ten a Day: For twice the sum I could not now supply The like, though Jove himself should come to buy. Yet like a Goddess I the damage bore, With courage, trusting to my Art for more. While therefore I contrive to trap the Foe The wretch devours my precious Phœnix too. Nor to devour the Sire is satisfy'd, But tears the tender off-spring from his side. O impious Fact—here Flora paus'd awhile, And from her Eyes the Crystal tears distil: But as became a Goddess checkt her grief, And thus proceeds, in language sweet and brief; Thee Moly, Homer did perhaps devour, For, to Heav'ns shame be't spoke; the Bard was poor. But in thy praise wou'd ne'r vouchsafe to speak. From these Examples, Moly , warning take, To fatal Honours seek not then to rise, | 'Tis dangerous claiming Kindred with the Skies: | Thou honest Garlick art, let that suffice, | Of Countrey-growth, own then thy Earthly Race, Nor bring by pride on Plants or Man, disgrace. She said—and to the Lily waiting by, Gave Sign, that she her Title next should try. [174] The Goddess of Waters [175] Lark-Spur . The Herb, by the touch of which Juno was feigned to conceive Mars .

      <field name="fulltext">White- LILY. SUCH as the lovely Swan appears When rising from the Trent or Thame , And as aloft his Plumes he rears, Despises the less beauteous stream: So when my joyful Flow'r is born, And does its native glories show; Her clouded Rival she does scorn; Th'are all but soils where Lily 's grow. Soon as the Infant comes to light With harmless Milk alone 'tis fed; That from the Innocence of white A gentle temper may be bred. The milky Teat is first apply'd To fiercest Creatures of the Earth, But I can boast a greater pride, A Goddess Milk, produc'd my Birth. [177] When Juno in the Days of yore Did with the great Alcides teem, Of Milk the Goddess had such store The Nectar from her Breast did stream. Whitening beyond the pow'r of Art The Pavement where it lay, Yet through the Crevises some part Made shift to find its way. The Earth forthwith did pregnant prove With Lily flow'rs supply'd, That scarce the Milky way above With her in whiteness vy'd. Thus did the Race of Man arise, When sparks of heav'nly fire Breaking through Crannies in the Skies, Did Earth's dull Mass inspire. Happy those Souls that can like Me Their native White retain; Preserve their Heav'nly purity, And wear no guilty stain. Peace in my Habit comes array'd, My Dress her Daughters wear; Hope and Joy in white are clad, In Sable weeds Despair. Thus Beauty, Truth and Chastity Attir'd we always find These in no Female meet, but me, From me are ne'r disjoin'd. Nature on many Flow'rs beside Bestows a muddy white; On me she plac'd her greatest Pride, All over clad in Light. Thus Lily spoke, and needless did suppose Because of form, her Virtues to disclose. Then follow'd Lilies of a diff'rent hue, | Who ('cause their beauty less than hers they knew) | From Birth and high Descent their title drew. | Of these the Martagon chief Claim did bring (The noble Flow'r that did from Ajax spring) But from the noblest Hero's veins to flow, Seem'd less than from a Goddess Milk to grow. At last the drowzy Poppy rais'd her Head And sleepily began her Cause to plead, Ambition ev'n the drowzy Poppy wakes, Who thus to urge her Merit undertakes. [177] Jupiter in order to make Hercules Immortal, clap'd him to Juno 's breats, while she was asleep. The lusty rogue suck'd so hard, that too great gush of Mild coming forth, some spilt upon the Sky, which made the Galaxy or Milky Way; and some out of some which fell to the Earth arose the Lily .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POPPY. O Sleep, the gentle ease of Grief, Of Care and toil the sweet Relief; Like Sov'reign Balm thou canst restore When Doctors give the Patient o'r. Thou to the wretched art a friend, A Guest that ne'r does harm intend, In Cottages mak'st thy aboad, To th'Innocent thou art a God. On Earth with Jove bear'st equal sway, Thou rul'st the Night as Jove the Day; A middle station thou dost keep 'Twixt Jove and Pluto , pow'rful Sleep! As thou art just and scorn'st to lie, Confess before this Company, That by the Virtue of my Flow'r Thou holdest thy nocturnal Pow'r. Why do we call thee Loiterer, Who fly'st so nimbly through the air; The Birds on wing confess thy force, And stop i' th'middle of their course. Thy Empire as the Ocean wide, Rules all that in the Deep reside; That moving Island of the Main The Whale, is fetter'd in thy Chain. The Desart Lands thy Pow'r declare, Thou rul'st the Lion, Tyger, Bear, To mention these alas, is vain, O'r City-tyrants thou dost Reign. The Basilisk whose looks destroy, And Nymph more fatal, if she's coy; Whose Glances surer Death impart To her tormented Lover's Heart, When Sleep commands, their Charms give way, His more prevailing force obey; Their killing Eyes they gently close Disarm'd by innocent Repose. That careful Jove does always wake The Poets say; a foul mistake! For when to Pow'r the wicked rise, Can Jove look on with open eyes? When bloud to Heav'n for vengeance calls, So loud it shakes his Palace walls; Yet does unheard, unanswer'd sue, Must Jove not sleep, and soundly too? That Ceres with my Flow'r is griev'd Some think, but they are much deceiv'd, For where her richest Corn she sows, The inmate Poppy she allows. Together both our seeds does fling, And bids us both together spring, Good cause, for my Sleep-giving juice Does more than Corn to Life conduce. On us the Mortals freely feed, Of other Plants there's little need; Full of Poppy , full of Corn, Th' Hesperian Gardens you may scorn. Bread's more refreshing mix'd with me, [178] Honey and I with Bread agree, Our tast so sweet it can excite The weak, or sated Appetite. In Ceres Garland I am plac'd, Me she did first vouchsafe to tast, When for her Daughter lost she griev'd, Nor in long time had Food receiv'd. 'Bove all she does extol my Plant, For if sustaining Corn you want, From me such kind supplies are sent, As give both Sleep and Nourishment. The Reason therefore is most plain Why I was made the fruitful'st Grain, The Persian brings not to the Field, Such Armys as my Camp does yield. Diseases in all Regions breed, No corner of the World is freed, Hard labour ev'ry where we find, The constant Portion of mankind. Sick Earth Great Jove beheld with Grief, And sent me down to her relief, And 'cause her Ills so fast did breed, Endu'd me with more fertile Seed. Thus Poppy spake, nor did as I suppose, So soon intend her bold Harangue to close, But seiz'd with sleep, here finish'd her Discourse; Nor cou'd resist her own Lethargick force. I tell strange things, (but nothing should deter Since 'tis most certain truth what I aver,) Nor would I Sacred History profane As Poets use with what is false and vain. While Poppy spoke— Th'Assembly could no longer open keep Their Eyes, ev'n Flora 's self fell fast asleep. So Daffodils with too much Rain opprest Recline their drooping Heads upon their Breast. Zephyr , not long could bear this foul disgrace; With a brisk Breeze of Air he shook the Place: Flora , who well her Husbands Kisses knew, Wak'd first, but rear'd her Head with much ado; With heavy Motion to her drowsie Eyes Her Fingers lifts, and what's a Clock, she cryes: At which the rest (all by degrees) unfold Their Eye-lids, and the open Day behold. The Sun Flow'r thinking 'twas for him foul shame To Nap by Day-light, strove t'excuse the blame; It was not sleep that made him Nod, he said, But too great weight and largeness of his Head. Majestick then before the Court he stands, And silence with Phœbean Voice commands. [178] In old time the Seed of the White- Poppy parch'd was serv'd up as a Dessert.</field>

IF by the Rules of Nature we proceed, And likeness to the Sire must prove the breed, Believe me Sirs, when Phœbus looks on you, He scarce can think his Spouse the Earth was true. No sooner can his Eye on me be thrown, But he by Styx will swear I am his own. [179] My Orb-like golden Aspect bound with Rays, The very Picture of his Face displays. Among the Stars long since I should have place, Had not my Mother been of mortal Race: Presume not then, ye Earth-born Mushroom brood To call me Brother—I derive my Blood From Phœbus self, which by my Form I prove, And (more than by my Form) my filial Love. I still adore my Sire with prostrate Face, Turn where he turns, and all his motions trace. Who seeing this (all things he sees) decreed To you his doubtful, if not spurious breed, These poorer Climes, to be in dow'r enjoy'd, Of that Divine Phœbean metal void; On me that richer soil he did bestow [180] Where Gold, the product of his Beams, does grow. Among his Treasures well might he assign A Place for me, his like and living coin. He said, and bowing twice his Head with Grace To Flora , thrice to 's Sire, resum'd his Place. To him succeeds a Flow'r of greater Name, [181] Who from high Jove himself deriv'd his Claim. [179] The usual Oath of the Gods. [180] America , where grow the largest Sun Flowers .

HOw this Pretender for no Medicine good, Can be allow'd the Son of Physick's God, I leave to the wise Judgment of the Court: With better proofs my Title I support, Jove was my Sire, to me he did impart (Who best deserv'd) the Empire of the Heart. Let him with Golden Aspect please the Eye, A Sov'raign Cordial to the Heart am I. Not Tagus , nor the Treasures of Peru Thy boasted Soil, can Grief like me, subdue. Should Jove once more descend in Golden show'r, Not Jove cou'd prove so Cordial as my Flow'r. One Golden Coat thou hast, I do confess, That's all, poor Plant, thou hast no change of Dress. Of sev'ral hue I sev'ral Garments wear, Nor can the Rose her self with me compare: The gaudy Tulip and the Emony Seem richly coated when compar'd with thee. View both their Stocks, my Ward-robe has the same, The very Crœsus I of Colours am. Rich but in Dress they are, in Virtue poor, Or keep like Misers to themselves their store, Most lib'rally my Bounty I impart, 'Tis joy to mine to ease anothers Heart. Some Flowers for Physick serve, and some for Smell, For Beauty some—but I in all excell. While thus she spake, her Voice, Scent, Dress and Port, Majestick all, drew Rev'rence from the Court: Well might th'Inferiour Plants concern'd appear, The very Rose her self began to fear: Her next of kin a fair and num'rous Host, Of their Alliance to Carnatian boast. Then divers more, who, though to fields remov'd From Garden-Gilly-Flower their Lineage prov'd. They of the Saffron-house next took their Course, Of dwarfish Stature, but gigantick force; Led by their Purple Chief, who dares appear, And stand the shock of the declining Year. In Autumn 's stormy Months he shews his head, When tainted Skies their baneful Venom shed. He scarce begins to speak, when looking round, The Colchic Tribe amongst his Train he found; [182] Hence ye profane, he cry'd, nor bring disgrace On my fair Title, I disown your Race. Repaair to Circe 's or Medea 's Tent, When on some fatal mischief they are bent, To baneful Pontus fly, seek kindred there, You who of Flowers, Earth, Heav'n, the scandal are. Thus did he storm, for tho by Nature mild, Against the poys'nous Race his Choler boil'd. His sacred Virtue the Intruders knew, And from th'Assembly consciously withdrew.

      <field name="fulltext">SAFFRON. WHile others boast their proud Original, And Sol or Jove their Parents call, I claim (contented with such slender Flowers) No kindred with Almighty Pow'rs. I from a Constant Lover took my Name, [183] And dare aspire no greater Fame. Whom after all the Toils of anxious Life 'Twixt Hopes and Fears a tedious strife, Great Jove to quit me of my hopeless Fire, (My Patron he, though not my Sire,) Transform'd me to a smiling Flower at last, To recompence my Sorrows past. Live cheerful now, he said, nor only live Merry thy self, but Gladness give; Then to my sacred Flow'r with Skill he joyn'd, Stems three or four of Star-like kind, Made them the Magazines of Mirth and Joy, What e'r can sullen Grief Destroy. Gay Humours there, Conceit and Laughter ly, Venus and Cupid 's Armory. Bacchus may like a Quack give present Ease, That only strengthens the Disease. You crush (alas!) the Serpent's Head in vain, Whose Tail survives to strike again. All noxious Humours from the Heart I drive, And spight of Poyson keep alive. The Heart secur'd, through all the Parts beside Fresh Life and dancing Spirits glide. But still 'tis vain to guard th'Imperial Seat, If to the Lungs the Foe retreat, If of those Avenues he's once possest, Famine will soon destroy the rest. I watch and keep those Passes open too, For Vital Air to come and go. Ungrateful to his Friend that Breath must be, That can abstain from praising me. But having been an Instance of Love's pow'r To Females still a sacred flow'r, Tis just that I shou'd now the Womb defend, And be to Venus Seat a friend. Gainst all that wou'd the teeming part annoy My ready Succour I emply, I ease the lab'ring Pangs, and bring away The Birth that past its time wou'd stay. If this Assembly then my Claim suspend, Who am to Nature such a friend, Who all that's Good protect, and Ill confound, If you refuse to have me Crown'd, If you decline my gentle cheerful sway, | Let my pretended Kinsman come in play, [184] | Punish your folly and my wrongs repay. | He said, and shaking thrice his fragrant Head Through all the Court a Cordial flavour spread: While of his scatter'd Sweets each Plant partakes, And on th' Ambrosial scent a Banquet makes. Touch'd with a sense of Joy, his Rivals smil'd, Ev'n them his Virtue of their Rage beguil'd; Ev'n Poppy 's self, refresh'd, erects her Head, Who had not heard one word of what he said. Flower-gentle last, on lofty stem did rise, [185] And seem'd the humble Saffron to despise: On his high Name and Stature he depends, And thus his Title to the Crown defends. [183] Ovid. Metam. 4.

      <field name="fulltext">AMARANTH, FLOWER-GENTLE. WHat can the puling Rose or Violet say, Whose Beauty flies so fast away? Fit only such weak Infants to adorn, Who dye as soon as they are born. Immortal Gods wear Garlands of my Flowers, Garlands eternal as their Powers, Nor time that does all earthly things invade Can make a Hair fall from my head. Look up, the Gardens of the Sky survey, And Stars that there appear so gay, If credit may to certain Truth be giv'n, They are but th' Amaranths of Heav'n. A transient Glance sometimes my Cynthia throws Upon the Lily or the Rose , But views my Plant, astonish'd, from the Sky, That she should Change, and never I. Because with Hair instead of Leaves adorn'd, By some, as if no Flower , I'm scorned, But I my chiefest Pride and Glory place In what they reckon my Disgrace. My Priv'ledge 'tis to differ from the rest; What has its like can ne'r be best: Nor is it fit Immortal Plants shou'd grow In form of fading Plants below. That Gods have Flesh and Blood we cannot say, That they have something like to both we may, So I resembling an Immortal Power, Am only as it were a Flower. Their Plea's thus done, the several Tribes repair, | And stand in Ranks about the Goddess Chair, | Silent and trembling betwixt hope and fear. | Flora , who was of Temper light and free, Puts on a personated Gravity; As with the grave occasion best might suit, And in this manner finish'd the dispute.</field>

AMongst the Miracles of ancient Rome , When Cineas thither did as Envoy come, Th'August and purpled Senate he admir'd, View'd 'em, and if they all were Kings, enquir'd? So I in all this num'rous throng must own I see no Head but what deserves a Crown. On what one Flower can I bestow my Voice, Where equal Merits so distract my Choice? Be rul'd by me, the envious Title wave, Let no one claim what all deserve to have. Consider how from Roman -Race we spring, Whose Laws you know wou'd ne'r permit a King. Can I who am a Roman Deity, A haughty Tarquin in my Garden see? Ev'n your own Tribes, if I remember right, Rejoyc'd when they beheld the Tyrant's flight. With Gabine slaughter big, think how he slew The fairest Flow'rs that in his Plat-forms grew; Mankind and you, how he alike annoy'd, And both with sportive Cruelty destroy'd. You who are Lords of Earth as well as they Should Free-born Romans Government display. Rest ever then a Common-wealth of Flow'rs, Compil'd of People and of Senators. This, I presume, the best for you and me, With Sense of Men and Gods does best agree. Lily and Rose this Year your Consuls be The Year shall so begin auspiciously. Four Prætors to the Seasons four, I make, The vernal Prætorship thou, Tulip , take: Jove 's [186] Flow'r the Summer, Crocus [187] Autumn sway, Let Winter war-like Hellebore obey.

      <field name="heading_text">OF PLANTS BOOK V.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POMONA Let now my Muse more lofty numbers bring Proportion'd to the lofty Theme we sing, The Race of Trees , whose towring branches rise In open Air, and almost kiss the Skies. Too light those strains that tender Flow'rs desir'd, Too low the Verse that humbler Herbs requir'd; Those weaklings near the Surface of the Earth Reside, nor from the Soil that gave them birth Dare launch too far into the airy Main, The Winds rough shock unable to sustain: These to the Skies with Heads erected go, Laughing at tender Plants that crouch below. Not Man the Earth's proud Lord so high can raise His Head, they touch those Heav'ns which he surveys. Between th' Herculean Bounds and Golden Soil By great Columbus found, there lies an Isle Of those call'd Fortunate the fairest Seat, Indulg'd by Heaven and Natures blest retreat. A constant settled Calm the Sky retains, Disturb'd by no impetuous Winds or Rains. Zephyr alone with fragrant Breath does chear The florid Earth, and hatch the fruitful Year. No Clouds pour down the tender Plants to chill, | But fatning Dews instead from Heav'd distill, | And friendly Stars with vital Influence fill. | No Cold invades the temp'rate Summer there More rich than Autumn, and than Spring more fair. The Months without distinction pass away, | The Trees at once with Leaves, Fruit, Blossoms gay; | The changing Moon all these, and always does survey. | Nature some Fruits does to our Soil deny Nor what we have can ev'ry Month supply, But ev'ry sort that happy Earth does bear, All sorts it bears, and bears 'em all the Year. This seat Pomona now is said to prise, And fam'd Alcinous Gardens to despise. Betwixt th'old World and new makes this retreat Of her Green Empire the Imperial Seat: And wisely too, that Plants of ev'ry sort May from both Worlds repair to fill her Court. Hedges instead of Walls this Place surround, | Brambles and Thorns of various kinds abound, With Haw-Thorn that does Magick Spells confound. | The well rang'd Trees, within broad walks display Through which her Verdant City we survey: I' th'midst her Palace stands, of Bow'rs compos'd, With twining Branches, and Green Walls enclos'd; By Nature deck'd with Fruits of various kind, You'd swear some Artist had the work design'd. When Autumn's Reign begins the Goddess here, | (Autumn with us eternal Summer's there) | When Scorpio with his Venom blasts the Year, | The Goddess her Vertumnal rites prepares, (So call'd from various Forms Vertumnus wears) No cost she spares those Honours to perform, (For no Expence can that Rich Goddess harm) She then brings forth her Gardens choice Delights, To treat the Rural Gods whom she invites. The twelve of Heavenly Race her guests appear, Wanton Priapus too is present there, | The fair Host more attracts him than the Fare . | Then Pales came, and Pan Arcadia 's God, On his dull Ass the Fat Silenus rode Lagging behind; the Fauni next advance, With nimble Feet, and to the Banquet dance, Nor Heav'ns Inferiour Pow'rs were absent thence, Whose Altars seldom smoak with Frankincense. Picumnus who the barren Land manures, Tutanus too who gather'd Fruit secures, Collina from the Hills, from Valleys low [188] Vallonia [189] came, Rurina [190] from the Plow, With whom a hundred Rustick Nymphs appear, Who Garments form'd of Leaves or Bark did bear, To these strange Powers from New-Found India came, [191] Most dreadful in their Aspect, Form and Name. The hundred Mouths of Fame cou'd ne'r suffice To taste or tell that Banquet's Rarities. With change of Fruits the Table still was stor'd, For ready Servants waited on the Board In various Dress, the Months attending too In number twelve, twelve times the Feast renew. Of Apples, Pears and Dates they fill'd the Juice, The Indian Nut supply'd the double use Of Drink and Cup: the more luxuriant Vine | Afforded various kinds of sprightly Wine. | Canaria 's neighb'ring Isle, the most Divine. | Of this glad Bacchus fills a Bowl, and cries, O sacred Juice; O wretched Deities! Who absent hence of sober Nectar take Dull draughts, nor know the Joys of potent Sack . The rest who Bacchus Judgment cou'd not doubt, Pledg'd him in Course, and sent the Bowl about. Venus and Flora Chocolate alone Wou'd Drink,—the Reason to themselves best known. The Gods (who surely were too wise to spare, When they both knew their welcome and their Fare) Fell freely on, till now Discourse began, And one, exclaiming cry'd, O foolish Man! That grossly feeds on flesh, when ev'ry field Does easie and more wholesom Banquets yield. Who in the blood of Beasts their hands imbrue, And eat the Victims to our Altars due. From hence the rest occasion take at last The Goddess to extol, and her Repast: The Orange one, and one the Fig commends, Another the rich fruit that Persia sends, Some cry the Olive up above the rest, But by the most the Grape was judg'd the best. The Indian God who heard them nothing say Of Fruits that grow in his America , (Of which her Soil affords so rich a store Her Golden Mines can scarce be valu'd more) Thus taxes their unjust partiality, As well he might; the Indian Bacchus he. Can Prejudice, said he, corrupt the Powers Of this old World? far be that Crime from ours. If when to furnish out a noble Treat | You seek our Fruits, the Banquet to compleat; | (Which I with greediness have seen you eat) | Are these your thanks, ungrateful Deities? Your Tongues reproach what did your Palates please: You only praise the growth of your own Soil, Because the Product of long Ages toil; But had not Fortune been our Countrey's foe, And Parent Nature's self forsook us too, Had not your armed Mars in Triumph rode O'r our Ochecus , a poor naked God, Had not your Neptune 's floating Palaces Sunk our tall Ochus Fleet of hollow Trees, Nor thundring Jove made Viracocha yield, Nor Spaniards yet more fierce laid wast our field, And left alive no Tiller to recruit | The breed of Plants, and to improve the Fruit, | Our Products soon had silenc'd this Dispute. | But as it is, my Climate I'll defend, No Soil can to such num'rous Fruits pretend; We still have many to our Conqu'ror's shame, | Of which you are as yet to learn the name, | So little can you boast to shew the same. | This I assert; if any be so vain To contradict the Truth that I maintain, (Since from both Worlds this Feast has hither brought All Fruits with which our diff'rent Climes are fraught) The Deities that are assembled here Shall judge which World the richest will appear; In Fruits I mean, for that our Lands excell In Gold, you to our sorrow know too well. His Comrade-Gods in this bold Challenge join, Nor did our Powers the noble strife decline; Minerva in her Olive safe appear'd; Bacchus who with a smile the boaster heard, As in the East his Conquest had been shown, Now reckons the West-Indies too his own. His Courage with ten Bumpers first he chear'd; Then all agree to have the Table clear'd, And each respective Tree to plead her worth; The Goddess one by one commands them forth. She summon'd first the Nut of double Race, And Apple, which in our old World have place, Of each the noblest Breeds, for to the name A thousand petty Families lay claim. The Nut -trees name at first the Oak did grace, Who in Pomona 's Garden then had place, Till her nice Palate Acorns did decline, Scorning in Diet to partake with Swine: At last the Filbert and the Chesnut sweet Were scarce admitted to her verdant seat; The airy Pine of form and stature proud, With much entreaty was at length allow'd. The Hazel with light Forces marches up, The first in field, upon whose Nutty top A Squirrel sits, and wants no other shade Than what by his own spreading Tail is made; He culls the soundest, dextrously picks out The Kernels sweet and throws the Shells about, You see, Pomona crys, the cloyster'd Fruit, That with your Tooth, Silenus , does not suit. That therefore useless 'tis you cannot say, It serves our Youths at once for Food and Play; But while such toys, my Lads, you use too long, Expecting Virgins think you do them wrong; 'Tis time that you these childish sports forsake, Hymen for you has other Nuts to crack. O Plant most fit for Boys to patronize (Cries Bacchus ) who my gen'rous juice despise, A restive Fruit, by Nature made to grace The Monky's jaws and humour the Grimace. The sudden Gibe made sober Pallas smile, Who thus proceeds in a more serious style. A strong and wondrous Enmity we find In Hazel tree 'gainst Poysons of all kind, More wondrous their Magnetick sympathy, | That secret Beds of Metals can descry, [192] | And point directly where hid treasures lie. | In search of Golden Mines a Hazel Wand The wise Diviner takes in his right Hand, In vain alas! he calls his Eyes about To find the rich and secret Mansions out, Which yet, when near, shall with a force Divine The Top of the suspended Wand incline. So strong the sense of gain, that it affects The very Lifeless twig, who strait reflects His trembling head, and eager for th'embrace, Directly tends to the Magnetick place. What wonder then so strange Effects confound The minds of Men, in mists of Errour drown'd; It puzzles me, who was at Athens bred, Ev'n me the off-spring of great Jove 's own head; Let Phœbus then unfold this Mystery, Much more than Man we know, but Phœbus more than we. She said— Apollo , with th'Ænigma vext, And scorning to be pos'd, in words perplext, Strove to disguise his Ignorance, and spent Much breath on Atoms, and their wild ferment: Of Sympathy he made a long Discourse, And long insisted on Self-acting force; But all confus'd and distant from the mark, His Delphick Oracle was ne'r so dark. 'Twas Mirth for Jove to see him tug in vain At what his wisdome onely cou'd explain: For those profounder Mysteries to hide From Gods, and Men is sure Jove 's greatest pride. The shady Chesnut next her Claim puts in, Though seldom she is in our Gardens seen. So coarse her fare, that 'tis no small Dispute If Nuts or Acorns we shou'd call her fruit; So vile, the Gods from Mirth cou'd not forbear To see such Kernels such strong Armour wear; First with a linty Wad wrapt close about, (Useful to keep green wounds from gushing out) Her next defence of solid wood is made, The third has Spikes that can her foes invade. Thersites sure no greater sport cou'd make; With Ajax sev'nfold Shield upon his Back. The Pine with awful Rev'rence next did rise Above Contempt, and almost touch'd the Skies: Carv'd in his sacred Bark he wore beside [193] Great Maro 's words, to justifie his Pride: Pan own'd th'approaching Plant, and bowing low His Pine wreath'd Head, but just respect did show; Were Neptune present he had done the same; To that fair Plant that in his Isthmian Game The Victor crowns, whose loud Applauses he With equal transport hears in either Sea. Neptune of other Plants no Lover seems, But with good reason he the Pine esteems; The Pine alone has courage to remove From 's native Hills (where long with winds he strove In youth) on watry Mountains to engage With 's naked Timber fiercer tempests rage. In vain were Floods to Plants and Men deny'd In vain design'd for fishes to reside. Since Natures Laws by Art are overcome, And Men with Ships make Seas their Native home. But of all Pines Mount Ida bears the best, By Cybele prefer'd above the rest. This Plant a lovely Boy was heretofore, Belov'd by Cybele , upon whose score He sacrific'd to Chastity, but now Repents him of the rashness of his Vow. His fruit delaying Venus now excites, His Wood affords the Torch which Hymen lights. Ia , for whom her Father, of White-thorn [194] A Torch prepar'd (e'r Pine by Brides was born) When she shou'd meet her long expected Joy Embrac'd the Pine-tree for her lovely Boy, Dire change, yet cannot from his trunk retire But languishes away with vain Desire: Till Cybele afforded her relief, [195] (Her Rival once, now partner in her grief) Transform'd her to the bitter Almond-tree, [196] Whose fruit seems still with sorrow to agree. Her Sister who the dreadful change did mark, Strove with her hands to stop the spreading Bark; But while the pious Office she perform'd In the same manner found her self transform'd. But as her grief was less severe, we find Her Almond sweet and of a milder kind. [197] Thus did this Plant into her Arms receive Th'unfortunate and more than once relieve. Poor Phyllis thus Demophoon 's absence mourn'd, Till she into an Almond-tree was turn'd. Thus Phyllis vanish'd; Ceres saw her bloom, And prophesy'd a fruitful Year to come. The firm Pistachoe next appear'd in view, Proud of her fruit that Serpents can subdue. The Walnut then approach'd, more large and tall, His fruit which we a Nut , the Gods an Acorn call; Jove 's Acorn, which does no smal praise confess, [198] T'have call'd it Man 's Ambrosia had been less. Nor can this Head-like Nut, shap'd like the Brain | Within, be said that form by chance to gain, | Or Caryon call'd by learned Greeks in vain. | For Membranes soft as Silk her kernel bind, Whereof the inmost is of tendrest kind, Like those which on the Brain of Man we find, [199] All which are in a Seam-join'd Shell enclos'd, Which of this Brain the Skull may be suppos'd. This very Skull envelop'd is again In a green Coat, his Pericranion. Lastly, that no Objection may remain, To thwart her near Alliance to the Brain; She nourishes the Hair, remembring how | Her self deform'd without her Leaves does show: | On barren scalps she makes fresh honours grow. | Her timber is for various uses good The Carver she supplies with lasting wood; She makes the Painters fading Colours fast, A Table she affords us and repast; Ev'n while we feast, her Oil our Lamps supplies, | The rankest Poison by her Virtue dies, | The Mad-dogs foam, and taint of raging Skies. | The Pontick King who liv'd where Poisons grew, Skillful in Antidotes, her Virtues knew; Yet envious Fates that still with Merit strive, And Man ingrateful from the Orchard drive This Sov'raign Plant excluded from the Field Unless some useless Nook a Station yield: Defenceless in the common Road she stands, Expos'd to restless War of vulgar hands; By neighb'ring Clowns, and passing Rabble torn, Batter'd with stones by Boys, and left forelorn. To her did all the Nutty-tribe succeed, A hardy Race that makes weak Gums to bleed; But to the Banquets of the Gods preferr'd, Are said to open of their own accord. 'Twixt these and juicy fruits of painted Coat, Such as on Sunny Apples we may note; Advanc'd the tribe of those with rugged skin, More mild than Nuts, but to the Nut a kin. Pomgranate Chief of these, whose blooming Glow'r ( Pomona 's pride) may challenge Flora 's Bow'r, The Spring-Rose seems less fair when she is by, Nor Carbuncle can with her colour vie; Nor Scarlet Robes by proudest Monarchs worn, | Nor purple streaks that paint the rising Morn, | Nor Blushes that consenting Maids adorn. | In the Euboan Isle did stand of old Great Juno 's Image, form'd of massy Gold, In one Right Hand she held a Scepter bright, (For with the Pow'rs Divine both Hands are Right) [200] Her Carthage lovely fruit the other grac'd, And fitly in Lucina 's Hand was plac'd; [201] Whose Orb within so many Cells contains, In form of Wombs, and stor'd with seedy Grains. But Proserpine implacable remain'd [202] Against this Plant, for former wrongs sustain'd, Nor Ceres yet her hatred cou'd disguise, But from Pomgranate turn'd her weeping Eyes. For the Elysian Fields (whence fates permit Nought to return) what Tree can be more fit That this restringent Plant? a single tast [203] Of three small grains kept Ceres Daughter fast. Orange and Lemon next like Lightning bright Came in, and dazled the Beholders sight; These were the fam'd Hesperian Fruits of old, | Both Plants alike, ripe fruit and Blossoms hold, | This shines with pale and that with deeper Gold. | Planted by Atlas , who supports the Skies, Proud at his feet to see these brighter Stars to rise. To keep them safe the utmost care he took, He fenc'd 'em round with walls of solid Rock, Nor with Priapus Custody content A watchful Dragon for their Guard he sent. Let vulgar Apples, Boys and Beggars fear, These, worth Alcides stealing did appear. From Lands remote he came, and thought his toils Were more than recompenc'd in those rich spoils. He onely priz'd 'em for their taste and hue, For half their real worth he never knew: Nor cou'd his Tutor Mars to him impart The nobler secrets of Apollo 's Art. Had he but known their juice 'gainst Poison good The Hydra 's Venom mixt with Centaur bloud, Had never made Mount Oeta hear his Cries, Nor th'oft-slain Monster more had pow'r to rise. The Plums came next, by Cherry led, whose fruit Th'expecting Gard'ner early does salute, To pay his thanks impatient does appear, And with red Berries first adorns the Year. May , rich in Dress, but in Provision poor, Admires and thinks his early Fruit a Flow'r. To wait for Summer 's ripening heat disdains, Nor puts the Planter to immod'rate pains. He loves the cooler Climes. Egyptian Nile Cou'd ne'r persuade him on her Banks to smile. He scorns the bounty of a two-months tide That leaves him thirsting all the year beside. Proud Rome , her self this Plant can scarcely rear Ev'n to this day he seems a Captive there. Pris'ner of War from Cerasus he came; (From 's native Cerasus he took his name) [204] From thence transplanted to th' Italian Soil Lucullus triumph brought no richer spoil: Loud Pæans to your noble Gen'ral sing, Italian Plants, that such a Prize did bring. The Conqu'rours Laurels as in triumph wear The blushing Fruit, and captive Cherries bear. Yet grieve thou not to leave thy native home, | Erelong thou shalt a Denizen become Amongst the Plants of World-commanding Rome . | A num'rous Host of Plants did next succed, Diff'ring in colour and of various breed: The Damask Prune, most antient led the Van, Who in Damascus first his Reign began. Time out of mind he had subdu'd the East , 'Twas long ere he got footing in the West ; But now in Northern Climates he is known, A hardy Plant makes ev'ry Soil his own. Next him th' Armenian Apricock took place, Not much unlike but of a nobler Race; Of richer Flavour and of tast Divine, Whose golden Vestments, streakt with Purple, shine. Then came the Glory of the Persian Field, And to Armenia 's pride disdain'd to yield. The Peach with Silken Vest and pulpy juice, Of Meat and Drink at once supplies the use. But take him while he's ripe, he'll soon decay, For next Days Banquet he disdains to stay, Of Fruits the fairest, as the Rose of Flow'rs, But ah! their Beauties have but certain Hours. A Fruit there is on whom the Rose confers [205] Her Name, of smell and colour too like Hers. A Plum that can it self supply the Board, To hungry Stomachs solid food afford. To please our Gust and Stomach to recruit He thinks sufficient Tribute to his Fruit; For Physicks use his other parts are good, His Leaves, his Blossoms, ev'n his Gum and wood. Does to us health and joy alike restore, Friend to our Pleasure, to our Health much more. Not so the Corneil-tree design'd for harms, [206] Her wood supplies dire Mars with impious Arms, For such a Plant our Gardens are too mild, Harsh is her Fruit and fit for Desarts wild. With her the Jujube -tree, a milder Plant Which (tho offensive thorns she does not want) In Peace and Mirth alone does pleasure take, | Her Flow'rs, at feasts, the genial Garlands make, | Her wood the Harp that keeps the Guests awake. Next comes the Lote -tree in whose dusky hue Her black and Sun-burnt Countrey you might view, [207] To whom th'Assembly all rose up (from whence Came this Respect?) and paid her Reverence. Priapus onely with a down-cast look, And conscious Blushes at her presence shook: Th'All-seeing Gods through that obscure disguise Nymph Lotis saw: conceal'd from humane Eyes. [208] They knew how on the Hellespontick shore T'escape the dreadful Dart Priapus wore, And zealous to preserve her Chastity, She lost her Form and chang'd into a Tree. Though now no more a Nymph, a better Fate She does enjoy, and lives with longer Date. A longer Date than Oaks she does enjoy, Those long-liv'd Oaks that call'd old Nestor Boy. She calls them Girls , green Branches she display'd When Rome was built, and when in Ashes laid. 'Tis true, she did not long survive the fire, (With grief and flames at once forc'd to expire.) Almost nine hundred years were past away, Yet then she grudg'd to die before her Day. Ev'n after Death her Trunk appears to Live; [210] Does vocal Pipes and breathing Organs give, And fitly, like us Poets, may be said To make the greatest Noise when she is dead. A thousand Years are since elaps'd, yet still She flourishes in Praise, and ever will. Her Trees rich Fruit with which she charm'd Mankind Shew'd, when a Nymph, the sweetness of her mind; These sounds express the Musick of her tongue, More sweet than Circe 's or the Syren throng. But Nymph, retire, triumphant Palm appears, She thrives the more the greater weight she bears, No pressure for her Courage is too hard, Of Virtue both th'Example and Reward. She flourish'd once in Solymæan ground, [211] Fam'd Joshua 's and Jessides sacred triumphs crown'd. But since that Land was curst, the gen'rous Plant Grieves to continue her Inhabitant. Pisa bears Olives , Pines the Isthmian Fields, But all breed Palms , the prize of Victory, All Lands in honour of the Palm agree. And 'tis but the just tribute of her Worth, Virtue no fairer Image has on Earth. Her Verdure she inviolate does hold, In spight of Summer 's heat and Winter 's cold. Opprest with weight she from the Earth does rise, And bears her Load in triumph to the Skies. What various Benefits does she impart [212] To humane kind; her Wine revives the Heart, Her Dates rich Banquets to our Tables send, At once to Pleasure, and to Health a friend. A Lover true, and well to love and serve Is Virtues noblest task, and does the Palm deserve. Evadne who a willing Victim prov'd, [213] Nor chast Acestis so her Husband lov'd, [214] As does the Female Palm her Male, her Arms to him are stretch'd with most endearing Charms, Nor stops their passion here; like Lovers, they To more retir'd Endearments find the way, In Earth's cold Bed their am'rous Roots are found In close Embraces twining under ground. Let Arms to Learning yield, the Palm resign, The conqu'ring Palm to Olive more Divine; Peace all prefer to War—thus Pallas spoke; And in her Hand a peaceful Olive shook. 'Twas with this Branch that she the Triumph gain'd (The greatest that can be by Gods obtain'd.) On learned Athens to confer her Name, A Right which she, most learn'd of Powers, might claim. Not Gods in Heav'n without Ambition live, But, who shall be poor Mortals Patrons, strive. First, Neptune with his Trident struck the ground; the warlike Steed no sooner heard the sound, But starts from his dark Mansion, shakes his Hair, His Nostrils snort the unaccustom'd Air, Neighs loud, and of th'unwonted Noise is proud, | With his insulting Feet his native Field is plough'd, | Intrepid he beholds of Gods the circling Crowd. | Pallas on th'other side with gentle stroke Of her strong Spear, Earth's tender surface broke, Through which small Breach a sudden Tree shoots up, Ev'n at his Birth with rev'rend hoary top, And vig'rous fruit; the Gods applaud the Plant, And to Minerva the Precedence grant. The vanquish'd Steed and God in rage assail'd | The Victors, but ev'n so, their malice fail'd, | Wit's Goddess and the peaceful Tree prevail'd. | Hail sacred Plant, who well deserv'st to be [216] By Laws secur'd from wrong as well as we; From War's wild rage Respect thou dost command, When Temples fall thou art allow'd to stand. Neptune 's bold Son revenging the disgrace [217] His Sire sustain'd, fell dead upon the place, The whirling Ax upon his Head rebounds, The stroke design'd on thee, himself confounds. The Gods concern'd Spectators stood, and smil'd To see his impious Sacrilege beguil'd. Such be his fate whoe'r presumes to be A Foe to Peace and to her sacred Tree. Yet ev'n this peaceful Plant upon our guard Warns us to stand, and be for War prepar'd. In peace delights, but when the Cause is just, Permits not the avenging Sword to rust. With suppling Oil and conqu'ring wreath's supplys The Martial Schools, of youthful Exercise: Nor is the strong propension she does bear To Peace, th'effect of Luxury or Fear. Earth's teeming Womb affords no stronger Birth, No Soil manuring needs to bring her forth. Allow her but warm Suns and temp'rate Skies, The vig'rous Plant in any Soil will rise. Lop but a Branch and fix't in Earth, you'll see She'll there take root and make her self a Tree. Her youth, 'tis true, by slow degrees ascends, But makes you with long flourishing years amends. Nature her care in this did wisely show, That useful Olive long and easily shou'd grow. Most sov'raign taken inward, is her Oil, And outwardly confirms the Limbs for toil. Lifes passages from all obstruction frees, Clears Natures walks, to smarting wounds gives ease. With easie Banquets does the poor supply, And makes cheap Herbs with Royal Banquets vie. The Painters flying Colours it binds fast, Makes short-liv'd Pictures long as Statues last, The Student's Friend, no Labour can excel And last, but of Minerva 's Lamp must smell. Nay, This does so!— Most justly therefore may this Liquor rise O'r all in mixture, justly does despise T'incorporate with any other Juice; Sufficient in himself for ev'ry Use. Most justly therefore did Judæa 's Land, (Who best religious Kings did understand) Oyl, potent, chast and sacred Oyl appoint Her Kings, her Priests, and Prophets to anoint. Such was th'appearance which the Olive made, With noble Fruit and verdant Leaves assay'd; From whom Minerva took as she withdrew, A joyful Branch, and with it wreath'd her Brow. Fresh Armies then advanc'd into the Plain, First those whose Fruit did many Stones contain, In their first Lists the Medlar-Tree was found Proud of his putrid Fruit because 'twas crown'd. [218] Of Beauties Goddess then the Plant more fair, Whose fragrant motion so perfum'd the Air; The smoak of Gums when from their Altars sent, Ne'r gave th'Immortal Guests such sweet content. Let Phœbus Laurel bloody Triumphs lead | The Myrtle those where little blood is shed, [219] | Th'Ovation of a bleeding Maiden-head. | No Virgin Fort impregnable can be To him that Crowns his Brow with Venus Tree. The tribe of Pears and Apples next succeed, Of noble Families, and num'rous breed; No Monarch's Table e'r despises them, Nor they the poor Man's board or earthen dish contemn. Supports of Life, as well as Luxury, | Nor like their Rivals a few Months supply, | But see themselves succeeded ere they die. | Where Phœbus shines too faint to raise the Vine , They serve for Grapes, and make the Northern Wine. Their Liquor for th'effects deserves that name, Love, Valour, Wit and Mirth it can enflame, Care it can drown, lost Health, lost Wealth restore, And Bacchus potent Juice can do no more. With Cyder stor'd the Norman Province sees [220] Without regret the neighb'ring Vintages, Of Pear and Apple -kinds an Army stood, Before the Court, and seem'd a moving Wood; On them Pomona smil'd as they went off, But flouting Bacchus was observ'd to scoff. The Quince yet scorn'd to mingle with the crowd, | Alone she came, of signal Honours proud, | With which by grateful Jove she was endow'd. | A silky Down her golden Coat o'r-spreads, Her ripening Fruit a grateful Odour sheds; Jove otherwise ingrateful had been stil'd, In Honey steep'd she fed him when a Child, In his most froward Fits she stopt his cries; And now he eats Ambrosia in the Skies, Reflects sometimes upon his Infant Years, And just Respect to Quince and Honey bears. The nobles of Wine-Fruits brought up the Rear, But all to reckon, endless wou'd appear, The Barberry and Currant must escape, Though her small Clusters imitate the Grape. The Raspberry , and prickled Goosberry , Tree- Strawberry , must all unmention'd be, With many more whose names we may decline; Not so the Mulberry , the Fig and Vine , The stoutest Warriours in our Combat past, And of the present Field the greatest hope and last. But cautiously the Mulberry did move, And first the temper of the Skies wou'd prove, What sign the Sun was in, and if she might Give credit yet to Winter 's seeming flight. She dares not venture on his first retreat, Nor trust her Leaves and Fruit to doubtful Heat: Her ready Sap within her Bark confines, Till she of settled warmth has certain signs. But for her long delay amends does make | At once her Forces the known signal take, | And with tumultuous Noise their Sally make. | In two short Months her purple Fruit appears, And of two Lovers slain she tincture wears. [221] Her Fruit is rich, but Leaves she does produce, That far surpass in worth and noble Use; The frame and colour of her Leaves survey, And that they are most vulgar you must say, But trust not their appearance, they supply The Ornaments of Royal Luxury. The Beautiful they make more beauteous seem, The Charming Sex owes half their Charms to them. Effeminate Men to them their Vestments owe, How vain that pride which insect-worms bestow! Such was the Mulberry of wondrous Birth, The Fig succeeds; but to recite her worth, And various Powers, what numbers can suffice? Hail, Ceres , author of so great a Prize. By thee with Food and Laws we were supply'd, And with wild Fare wild Manners laid aside. With Peace and Bread our Lives were blest before, And modest Nature cou'd desire no more; But thou ev'n for our Luxury took care, And kindly didst this milky Fruit prepare. The poor Man's Feast, but such delicious Cheer Did never at Apicius Board appear; The grateful Ceres with this Plant is said Her hospitable Host to have repaid; [222] Yet with no vernal Bloom the Tree supply'd; To lighter Plants, said she, I leave that Pride; To lighter Plants I leave that gaudy Dress, Who meretricious qualities confess, And who like wanton Prostitutes expose Their Bloom to ev'ry Hand, their Sweets to ev'ry Nose. My Fruit, like a chast Matron does proceed, And has of painted Ornament no need, They study Dress, but mine Fertililty; Forcing her Off-spring from her solid Tree. Through haste sometimes abortive Births she bears, But ever makes amends in those she rears. For whom her full-charg'd Veins supplies afford, Like a strong Nurse with Milk she's ever stor'd. Our Voice by thee refresh'd, ingrateful 'twere If, Fig-Tree , thy just praise it shou'd forbear; The Passes of our vital Breath by thee Are smooth'd and clear'd, obstructed Lungs set free. Nor only dost to Speech a Friend appear, | Ev'n for that Speech thou dost unlock the Ear, | Set'st ope the gate, and giv'st it entrance there. | The foulest Ulcers putrid sinks are drein'd By thee, by thee the Tumour's Rage restrain'd; The Gangrene, Ring-Worm, Scurf and Leprosie; Kings evil, Cancers, Warts are cur'd by thee: Of flaming Gout thou dost suppress the Rage, Of Dropsie thou the deluge dost asswage. 'Twere endless all thy Vertues to recite, | With all the Hosts of Poysons thou dost fight, | Aided by Rue and Nut put'st Africa to flight. | Encounter'st the Diseases of the Air, And baneful Mischiefs secret Stars prepare; Whence does this Vegetative Courage rise? Even angry Jove himself thou dost despise, His Lightning's furious Sallies thou dost see, That spares not his own Consecrated Tree, While he with Temples does wild havock make, | While Mountains rend, and Earths foundations quake, | Of thy undaunted Tree no Leaf is seen to shake. | Hail, Bacchus ! hail, thou powerful God of Wine, Hail Bacchus , hail! here comes thy darling Vine, Drunk with her own rich Juice, she cannot stand, But comes supported by her Husbands hand, The lusty Elm supports her stagg'ring Tree; My best lov'd Plant, how am I charm'd with thee? Bow down thy juicy Clusters to my Lip, Thy Nectar sweets I wou'd not lightly sip, But drink thee deep, drink till my Veins were swell'd, Drink till my Soul with Joys and thee were fill'd. What God so far a Poets friend will be, Who from great Orpheus draws his Pedigree? (And tho his Muse comes short of Orpheus fame, Yet seems inspir'd, and may the Ivy claim) To place him on Mount Ismarus , or where Campanian Hills the sweetest Clusters bear, Where Grapes, twice ripen'd, twice concocted grow, With Phœbus beams above, Vesuvius flames below. Or in the fortunate Canarian Isles , Or where Burgundia 's purple Vintage smiles. 'Tis fit the Poet should beneath their shade | Transported lye, or on their Hills run mad, | His Veins, his Soul swell'd with th'Inspiring God, | Who worthily would celebrate the Vine, And with his grateful voice discharge agen The Deity, which with his Mouth he drank so largely in. O vital Tree, what blessings dost thou send? Love, Wit and Eloquence on thee attend, Mirth, Sports, green Hopes, ripe Joys, and Martial Fire. These are thy Fruits, thy Clusters these inspire; The various Poysons which ill Fortune breeds (Not Pontus so abounds with baneful weeds, Nor Africa so many Serpents feeds) By thy rich Antidote defeated are, 'Tis true, they'll rally and renew the War, But 'tis when thou our Cordial art not by, They watch their time and take us when w' are Dry. Thou mak'st the Captive to forget his chain, By thee the Bankrupt is enrich'd again, The Exul thou restor'st, the Candidate [223] | Without the People's Vote thou dost create, | And mak'st him a Caninian Magistrate. | Like kind Vespasian thou Mankind mak'st glad, None from thy presence e'r departed sad. What more can be to Wisdom 's School assign'd, Than from prevailing Mists to purge the Mind? From thee the best Philosophy does spring, Thou canst exalt the Beggar to a King; Th'unletter'd Peasant who can compass thee, As much as Cato knows, and is as great as he. Thy Transports are but short, I do confess, But so are the Delights Mankind possess. Our Life it self is short, and will not stay, Then let us use thy Blessing while we may, And make it in full streams of Wine more smoothly pass away. The Vine retires; with loud and just Applause Of European Gods; As she withdraws Each in his Hand a swelling Cluster prest; But Bacchus much more sportive than the rest, Fills up a Bowl with Juice from Grape-stones drein'd, And puts it in Omelochilus hand: Take off this Draught, said he, if thou art wise, 'Twill purge thy Cannibal Stomach's Crudities. He, unaccustom'd to the acid Juice Storm'd, and with blows had answer'd the Abuse, But fear'd t'engage the European Guest, Whose Strength and Courage had subdu'd the East ; He therefore chooses a less dang'rous fray, And summons all his Country's Plants away: Forthwith in decent Order they appear, And various Fruits on various Branches wear; Like Amazons they stand in painted Arms, Coca alone appear'd with little Charms, Yet lead the Van, our scoffing Venus scorn'd The shrub-like Tree, and with no Fruit adorn'd. The Indian Plants, said she, are like to speed In this Dispute of the most fertil Breed, Who choose a Dwarf and Eunuch for their Head. Our Gods laugh'd out aloud at what she said. Pachamama defends her darling Tree, And said the wanton Goddess was too free, You only know the fruitfulness of Lust, | And therefore here your Judgment is unjust, | Your skill in other off-springs we may trust. | With those Chast Tribes that no distinction know Of Sex, your Province nothing has to do. Of all the Plants that any Soil does bear, | This Tree in Fruits the richest does appear, | It bears the best, and bears 'em all the year. | Ev'n now with Fruit 'tis stor'd—why laugh you yet? Behold how thick with Leaves it is beset, Each Leaf is Fruit, and such substantial Fare No Fruit beside to Rival it will dare. Mov'd with his Countries coming Fate, (whose Soil Must for her Treasures be expos'd to spoil) Our Viracocha first this Coca sent, Endow'd with Leaves of wondrous Nourishment, Whose Juice suck'd in, and to the Stomach ta'n Long Hunger and long Labour can sustain; From which our faint and weary Bodies find More Succour, more they chear the drooping Mind, Than can your Bacchus and your Ceres join'd. Three Leaves supply for six days march afford, The Quitoita with this Provision stor'd, Can pass the vast and cloudy Andes o'r, The dreadful Andes plac'd 'twixt Winters store Of Winds, Rains, Snow, and that more humble Earth, | That gives the small but valiant Coca Birth; | This Champion that makes war-like Venus Mirth. | Nor Coca only useful art at home, A famous Merchandize thou art become; A thousand Paci and Vicugni groan, | Yearly beneath thy Loads, and for thy sake alone | The spacious World's to us by Commerce known. | Thus spake the Goddess, (on her painted Skin Were figures wrought) and next calls Hovia in. That for its stony Fruit may be despis'd, But for its Vertue next to Coca priz'd. Her shade by wondrous Influence can compose, And lock the Senses in such sweet Repose, That oft the Natives of a distant Soil Long Journeys take of voluntary Toil, Only to sleep beneath her Branches shade: Where in transporting Dreams, entranc'd they lye, And quite forget the Spaniards Tyranny. The Plant (at Brasil Bacoua call'd) the name Of th'Eastern Plane-Tree takes, but not the same: Bears Leaves so large, one single Leaf can shade The Swain that is beneath her Covert laid; Under whose verdant Leaves fair Apples grow, Sometimes two hundred on a single Bough; Th'are gather'd all the year, and all the year | They spring, for like the Hydra they appear, | To ev'ry one you take succeeds a Golden Heir. | 'Twere loss of time to gather one by one, Its Boughs are torn, and yet no harm is done; New-sprouting Branches still the loss repair, What would so soon return 'twere vain to spare. The Indian Fig-Tree next did much surprise With her strange figure all our Deities. Amongst whom, one, too rashly did exclaim (For Gods to be deceiv'd 'tis woful shame) This is a Cheat, a work of Art, said he, And therefore stretcht his hand to touch the Tree; At which the Indian Gods laugh'd out aloud, And ours, no less surpriz'd with wonder stood. For lo! the Plant her Trunk and Boughs unclos'd, Wholly of Fruit and Leaves appear'd compos'd; New Leaves, and still from them new Leaves unfold, A sight 'mongst Prodigies to be enroll'd. The Tuna to the Indian Fig a kin (The Glory of Tlascalla ) next came in; But much more wonderful her Fruit appears, Than th'other's Leaves, for living Fruit she bears. To her alone great Varicocha gave The Priviledge, that she for Fruit should have Live Creatures, that with purple Dye adorn Th'Imperial Robe; the precious Tincture's worn With pride ev'n by the Conqu'rors of the Soil, But ah! we had not grudg'd that Purple spoil, Our Cochinel they freely might have gain'd, If with no other Blood they had been stain'd. Guatimala produc'd a Fruit unknown To Europe , which with pride she call'd her own; Her Cacao-Nut with double Use endu'd, (For Chocolate at once is Drink and Food) Does strength and vigour to the Limbs impart, Makes fresh the Countenance and chears the Heart. In Venus Combat strangely does excite The fainting Warriour to renew the fight; Not all Potosi 's silver Grove can be Of equal value to this useful Tree. Nor cou'd the wretched hungry owner dine, Rich Cartama , upon thy Golden Mine. Of old the wiser Indians never made Their Gold or Silver the support of Trade, Nor us'd for Life's support what well they knew Useless to Life, at best, and sometimes hurtful too. With Nuts instead of Coin they bought and sold, Their Wealth by Cacao 's, not by Sums, they told. One Tree, the growing Treasure of the Field, Both Food and Cloths did to its owner yield; Procur'd all Utensils, and wanting Bread, The happy Hoarder on his Money fed. This was true Wealth, those Treasures we adore | By Custom valu'd, in themselves are poor, | And Men may starve amidst their Golden store. | Too happy India had this Wealth alone, And not thy Gold been to the Spaniard known. The Aguacat no less is Venus Friend (To th' Indies Venus Conquest does extend) A fragrant Leaf the Aguacata bears, Her Fruit in fashion of an Egg appears; With such a white and spermy Juice it swells, As represents moist Life's first Principles. The Cacao 's owner any thing may buy, But he that has the Metla , may supply Himself with almost all things he can want; From Metla 's almost all sufficient Plant; Metla to pass as Money does despise, Or Traffick serve, it self is Merchandise. She bears no Nuts for Boys, nor luscious Fruit, That may with nice Effeminate Palates suit. Her very Tree is fruit; her Leaves when young, Are wholesom Food, for Garments serve when strong; Not only so, but to make up the Cloth [224] They furnish you with Thread and Needle both. What though her native Soil with drought is curst, Cut but her Back, and you may slake your thirst, A sudden Spring will in the Wound appear, Which through streight passes strein'd comes forth more clear; And though through long Meanders of the Veins | 'Tis carry'd, yet no vicious hue retains, | Limpid and sweet the Virgin-stream remains. | These Gifts for Nature might sufficient be, | But bounteous Metla seem'd too small for thee; | Thou gratifi'st our very Luxury. | For liqu'rish Palates Honey thou dost bear, For those whose Gust wants quickning, Vinegar. But these are trifles, thou dost Wine impart, That drives dull care and trouble from the Heart. If any wretch of Poverty complains, Thou pour'st a golden Stream into his Veins. The poorest Indian still is rich in thee, | In spight of Spanish Conquests still is free, | The Spaniard 's King is not so blest as he. | If any doubts the Liquor to be Wine, Because no Cristal Water looks more fine, Let him but drink he'll find the weak Nymph fled, And potent Bacchus enter'd in her stead. To all these Gifts of Luxury and Wealth, Thou giv'st us sov'reign Med'cines too for Health: Choice Balm from thy concocted Bark breaks forth, Thou shedst no Tear, but 'tis of greater worth Than fairest Gems, no Lover more can prize | The tears in his consenting Mistris Eyes, | When in his Arms the panting Virgin lies: | No Antidote affords more present aid 'Gainst doubly mortal wounds by pois'nous Arrows made. Almost all Needs thou Metla dost supply, | Yet must not therefore bear thy self too high; | While th'all-sufficient Coccus Tree is by. | To Coccus thou must yield the Victory. Where she preserves this Indian Palm alone, America can never be undone, Embowell'd and of all her Gold bereft, | Her liberty and Coccus only left, | She's richer than the Spaniard with his theft. | What sensless Miser by the Gods abhorr'd, Wou'd covet more than Coccus doth afford? House, Garments, Beds and Boards, ev'n while we dine, Supplies both Meat and Dish, both Cup and Wine. Oyl, Honey, Milk, the Stomach to delight, And poignant Sawce to whet the Appetite. Nor is her service to the Land confin'd For Ships intire compos'd of her we find, Sails, Tackle, Timber, Cables, Ribs and Mast, Wherewith the Vessel fitted up, at last With her own Ware is freighted, all she bears Is Coccus growth, except her Mariners; Nor need we ev'n her Mariners exclude Who from the Coco-Nut have all their food. The Indian Gods with wild and barb'rous voice And Gestures rude, tumultuously rejoice; Ours as astonish'd and with envious Eyes | Each other view'd, if as weak Men surmise, | Envy can touch immortal Deities. | My modest Muse that Censure does decline, Nor dares interpret ill of Pow'rs Divine. The Indian Pow'rs (though yet they had not shown The hundredth part of Plants to India known) Already did conclude the Day their own. Rash and impatient round the Goddess throng, And think her Verdict is deferr'd too long. Pomona seated high above the rest, Was cautiously revolving in her Breast, (The cause depending was no trifling toy, That did the Patrons of both Worlds employ) T'express her self at large she did design, And handsomly the Sentence to decline; (If I may guess at what the Goddess meant) | But lo! a slight and sudden Accident | Puts all the Court into a wild Ferment. | For, during th'tryal, the most tipling Brace, Omelochilus of the Indian Race, And our Lenæus , at whate'r was spoke [225] Or done that pleas'd him, a full Bumper took And drank to t'other, him the Metla -Tree Supply'd with juice, thy Vine, Lenæus thee. Each Bowl they touch'd, they turn'd the Bottom up, And gave a brisk Huzza at ev'ry Cup. Their Heads at last the rising vapour gains And proves too hard for their immortal Brains. With mutual Repartees they jok'd at first, Till growing more incens'd they swore and curst; Omelochilus does no longer dread (With present Metla warm'd) the Grecian God, | But throws a Coco Bowl at Bachus Head. | Which spoil'd his Draught; but left his forehead sound, And rests betwixt his Horns without a wound. Bacchus enrag'd with Wine and passion too, With all his might his massy Goblet threw, Directly levell'd at the Rustick's Face, That laid him bruis'd and sprawling on the place: He in his native Gibb'rish cries aloud, And with his Noise alarms the savage Crowd; Gnashing their foamy Teeth, like Beasts of prey, Promiscuously they bellow, roar and bray; The frighted Waves back to the Deep rebound, The very Island trembles with the sound. Next him Vitziliputli sat, in smoak Of foul Tobacco almost hid, that broke In Belches from his gormandizing Maw, Where humane flesh as yet lay crude and raw, Throwing in rage his kindled Pipe aside And snatching Bow and Darts, Arm, Arm, he cry'd. Tescalipuca (of the salvage Band | the next in fierceness) took his Spear in hand, | And all in Arms the barb'rous Legion stand. | The Goddesses disperse, and sculk behind The Thickets, frighted Venus bore in mind Her former Wound, th'effect of mortal Rage, What must she then expect where Gods engage? Pallas , who onely courage had to stay, In vain her peaceful Olive did display: Th'He gods with manly weapons in their Hand Devoted to the dire Encounter stand; Most woful some had that days Battel found, And long been maim'd with many an aking wound, (For to suppose th'Immortals can be slain Though with Immortals they engage, is vain) Had not Apollo in the nick of time Found out a Strat'gem to divert that Crime; Which with his double Title did agree The God of Wit and healing Deity; None better knew than he to use the Bow, But now resolv'd his nobler Skill to show Sweet Musicks Powr; he takes his Lyre in hand, And does forthwith such charming sounds command, As struck the Ear of Gods with new delight, When Nature did this world's great frame unite: When jarring Elements their War did cease, And danc'd themselves into harmonious Peace. Such streins had surely charm'd the Centaur 's Rage, Such streins the raving Billows cou'd asswage; Wild Hurricanes had due obedience shown, And to attend his sounds supprest their own. The wrangling Guests at once appear bereft, Of ev'ry Sense, their Hearing onely left. Vitziliputli , fiercest of the Crew, While to the Head his venom'd Shaft he drew, Lets fall both Dart and Bow; with lifted Hands Astonish'd, and with Mouth wide gaping stands, So high to raise his greedy Ears he's said, As forc'd his feather'd Di'dem from his Head. Pomona 's Altar hew'd from solid Rock In both his Hands bold Varicoca took; which like a Thunder bolt he wou'd have hurld, (He is the Thund'rer in the Indian world) But at the first sweet strain forgot his heat, Laid down the stone, and us'd it for a Seat; His ravish'd Ears the peaceful sounds devour, His hundred Victims never pleas'd him more. Their Magick force in spight of his disgrace And gore yet streaming from his batter'd Face, Omelochilus self did reconcile; At first, 'tis true, he did but faintly smile, But laugh'd anon as loud as any there; For such the sacred Charms of Measures are; The ambient Air struck with the healing sounds Of Phœbus Lyre, clos'd up the bleeding wounds. Ev'n of their own accord the Breaches close, For pow'rful Musick all things can compose. Pleas'd with his Art's success, Apollo smil'd To see the aukward Mirth and Gestures wild Of his charm'd Audience; having thus subdu'd Their ravish'd sense, his Conquest he pursu'd, And still to make the pleasing Spell more strong, Joins to his Lyre his tuneful Voice and Song. He sung, how th'inspir'd Hero's mind beheld A World that for long Ages lay conceal'd. Most happy thou whose Fancy cou'd descry A World seen onely by my circling Eye. [226] Thou who alone in Toils hast equal'd me, Great Alexander is out-done by thee; By thee whose Skill cou'd find and courage gain That other world for which he wish'd in vain. Not my own Poets Tales cou'd thee deceive, No credit to their fables thou didst give, Me, weary'd with my Day's hard course, they feign To rest each Night in the Hesperian Main, Can Phœbus tire My great Columbus thou Didst better judg, and Phœbus better know. For I my self did then thy thoughts incline, Inspir'd thy Skill, and urg'd the bold Design. Herculean Limits cou'd not thee contain | Nor terrour of an unexperienc'd Main; | Nor Nature's awful Darkness cou'd restrain. | Thy Native worlds dear sight for three Months lost, For three long Months on the wide Ocean tost, New Stars, new Floods, and Monsters thou didst spy Unterrify'd thy self, new Gods didst terrifie: Thou only thou undaunted didst appear, While thy faint Comrades half expir'd with fear; They urge thee to return and threaten high, | When, Guanahan , thy Watch-light they descry, | Thy flaming Beacon from afar they spy: | Whose happy Light to their transported Eyes Discloses a new World; with joyful cries They hail the sign that to a golden Soil Unlock'd the Gate; forgetting now their Toil, They hug their Guide at whom they late repin'd; | From this small Fire, and for small use design'd, | How great a Light was open'd to Mankind! | How easily did Courage find the way | By this Approach to seize the golden Prey, | That in a secret World's dark Entrails lay! | For Courage what attempt can be too bold? Or rather what for thirst of Pow'r and Gold? While to the shoar the Spanish Navy drew, The Indian Natives with amazement view Those floating Palaces, which fondly they Mistook for living Monsters of the Sea; Wing'd Whales—nor at the Spaniards less admire, A Race of Men with Beards and strange Attire, Whose Iron-dress their native Skin they deem'd: the Horse-man mounted on his Courser seem'd To them a Centaur of prodigious kind; A compound Monster of two Bodies join'd: That cou'd at once in sev'ral accents break, Neigh with one Mouth, and with the other speak. But most the roaring Cannon they admire, Discharging sulph'rous Clouds of Smoak and Fire; Mock-Thunder now they hear, mock-Lightning view, With greater Dread than e'r they did the true. Ev'n thou the Thunderer of the Indian Sky (Nor wilt thou Varicocha this deny) Ev'n thou thy self astonish'd didst apear When Mortals louder Thunder thou didst hear. Strange Figures, and th'unwonted Face of things No less amazement to the Spaniard brings, New Forms of Animals their sight surprise, | New Plants, new Fruits, new Men and Deities, | Intirely a new Nature meets their Eyes. | But most transported with the glitt'ring Mould, | And wealthy Streams whose Sands were fraught with Gold, | These they too much admire with too much love behold. | For these forthwith against their Hosts engage The treach'rous Guests in impious War and Rage; From these, inhumane slaughter did ensue Which now I grieve to tell, as then I blush'd to view. By sudden force, like some demolish'd Town, I saw the Indian world at once o'rthrown. What can this Land by this Dispute intend? | About her Fruits she does in vain contend, | Who knows not how her Entrails to defend. | Thy Slaughters past, do thou at length forget: | For with no small Revenge thy wrongs have met, | And Heav'n will give thee greater Comforts yet. | Enjoy thy fate whose bitter Part is o'r And all the sweet for thee reserv'd in store. Here Phœbus his most chearful Airs employs And melts their savage Hearts in promis'd Joys. They felt his Musick glide through ev'ry vein, | Their heavy Limbs from Dancing scarce refrain, | But fear'd to interrupt his charming strain. | That Gold which Europe ravish'd from your Coast O'r Europe now a Tyrants pow'r does boast. Already has more Mischiefs brought on Spain Than from insulting Spaniards you sustain. Where e'r it comes all Laws are straight dissolv'd, In gen'ral Ruin all things are involv'd: No Land can breed a more destructive Pest | Grieve not that of your Bane y' are dispossest, | Call in more Spaniards to remove the rest. | The fatal Helen drive from your Aboads, Th' Erinnys that has set both worlds at odds. Fire, Sword and slaughter on her footsteps wait; Whole Empires she betrays to utmost Fate. Mean while these benefits of Life you reap Consider, and you'll find th'exchange was cheap. Your former salvage Customs are remov'd, The Manners of your Men and Gods improv'd: With humane flesh no more they shall be fed; Whether dire Famine first that practice bred, Or more detested Luxury— Nor long shalt thou Vitziliputli feed On bloudy feasts, or smoak thy Indian weed; Er long (like Us) with pure Ambrosial Fare Thou shalt be pleas'd, and tast Celestial Air. To live by wholesom Laws you now begin, Buildings to raise and fence your Cities in, To plow the Earth, to plow the very Main, And Traffick with the Universe maintain; Defensive Arms and Ornaments of Dress, All Implements of Life you now possess. To you the Arts of War and Peace are known, And whole Minerva is become your own. Our Muses to your Sires an unknown Band, Already have got footing in your Land, And like the Soil— Inca 's already have Historians been, And Inca -Poets shall ere long be seen. But (if I fail not in my Augury And who can better judg events than I?) Long rowling years shall late bring on the times, When with your Gold debauch'd and ripen'd Crimes, Europe (the world's most noble Part) shall fall, Upon her banish'd Gods and Virtue call In vain; while forein and domestick War At once shall her distracted Bosom tear; Forlorn, and to be pity'd ev'n by you.— Mean while your rising Glory you shall view; Wit, Learning, Virtue, Discipline of War | Shall for protection to your world repair, | And fix a long illustrious Empire there. | Your native Gold (I would not have it so But fear th'Event) in time will follow too: O, should that fatal Prize return once more, 'Twill hurt your Countrey as it did before. Late Destiny shall high exalt your Reign Whose Pomp no Crowds of Slaves, a needless Train, Nor Gold (the Rabble's Idol) shall support Like Motezume 's, or Guanapati 's Court, But such true Grandeur as old Rome maintain'd, Where Fortune was a Slave and Virtue Reign'd.

      <field name="fulltext">SYLVA. Cease, O my Muse, the soft delights to sing Of flowry Gardens in their fragrant Spring; And trace the rougher paths of obscure Woods, All gloom aloft, beneath o'rgrown with Shrubs: Where Phœbus , once thy Guide, can dart no ray T'inspire thy flight, and make the Scene look gay. Courage, my Huntress, let us range the Glades, And search the inmost Grotto's of the Shades: Even to the lone Recesses let us pass, Where the green Goddess rests on Beds of Moss. Let loose, my Fancy, swift of foot to trace With a sagacious scent the noble chase, And with a joyful cry pursue the Prey; 'Tis hidden Nature we must rouse to day. Set all your Gins, let every Toil be plac'd, | Through all her Tracks let flying Truth be chas'd, | And seize her panting with her eager hast. | Nor yet disdain, my Muse, in Groves to range, Or humbler Woods for nobler Orchards change. Here Deities of old have made abode, And once secur'd Great Charles our earthly God. The Royal Youth, born to out-brave his Fate, Within a neighbouring Oak maintain'd his State: The faithful Boughs in kind Allegiance spread | Their sheltring Branches round his awful Head, | Twin'd their rough Arms, and thicken'd all the Shade. | To thee, belov'd of Heaven, to thee we sing Of sacred Groves blooming perpetual Spring. Mayst thou be to my Rural Verse and Me, A present and assisting Deity. Disdain not in this leafy Court to dwell, Who its lov'd Monarch did secure so well. Th'Eternal Oak now consecrate to thee No more thy Refuge, but thy Throne shall be. We'll place thee Conqueror now, and crown thy brows With Garlands made of its young gayest boughs: While from our oaten Pipes the world shall know How much they to this sacred shelter owe. And you, the soft Inhabitants of the Groves, You Wood-Nymphs, Hamadryades and Loves, Satyrs and Fauns, who in these Arbors play, Permit my Song, and give my Muse her way. She tells of ancient Woods the wondrous things, | Of Groves long veil'd in sacred darkness sings, | And a new Light into your Gloom she brings. | Let it be lawful for me to unfold Divine Decrees that never yet were told: The Harangues of the Wood Gods to rehearse, And sing of Flowry Senates in my Verse. Voices unknown to Man he now shall hear, | Who always ignorant of what they were, | Have pass'd 'em by with a regardless ear; | Thought 'em the murmurings of the ruffled Trees, That mov'd and wanton'd with the sporting Breeze. But Daphne knew the Mysteries of the Wood, [227] And made discoveries to her amorous God; Apollo me inform'd, and did inspire My Soul with his Divine Prophetic fire: And I, the Priest of Plants, their sense expound, Hear, O ye Worlds, and listen all around. 'Twas now when Royal Charles that Prince of peace, (That pious Offspring of the Olive Race) Sway'd Englands Scepter with a God-like hand, Scattering soft Ease and Plenty o'r the Land, Happy 'bove all the neighbouring Kings, while yet Unruffled by the rudest storms of Fate, More fortunate the People, till their Pride Disdain'd Obedience to the Sovereign Guide, And to a base Plebeian Senate gave The Arbitrary Priv'lege to enslave; Who through a Sea of Noblest Blood did wade, To tear the Diadem from the Sacred Head. Now above Envy, far above the Clouds The Martyr sits triumphing with the Gods. While Peace before did o'r the Ocean fly On our blest Shore to find security: In British Groves she built her downy nest, No other Climate could afford her rest; For warring Winds o'r wretched Europe range, Threatning Destruction, universal Change. The raging Tempest tore the aged Woods, Shook the vast Earth, and troubl'd all the Floods. Nor did the faithful Goddess brood in vain, But here in safety hatch'd her golden train. Justice and Faith our Cornucopiæ fill, Of useful Med'cines known to many an Ill. Such was the Golden Age in Saturn 's sway, Easie and innocent it pass'd away; But too much Luxury and good Fortune cloys, And Virtues she should cherish she destroys. What we most wish, what we most toil to gain Enjoyment palls, and turns the bliss to pain. Possession makes us shift our Happiness, From peaceful Wives to noisie Mistresses. The Repetition makes the Pleasure dull; 'Tis only Change that's gay and beautiful. O Notion false! O Appetite deprav'd, That has the nobler part of Man enslav'd. Man born to Reason, does that Safety quit, To split upon the dangerous Rock of Wit. Physicians say, there's no such danger near, As when, though no signs manifest appear, Self-tir'd and dull, man knows not what he ails, And without toil his Strength and Vigor fails. Such was the State of England , sick with Ease, Too happy, if she knew her Happiness. [228] Their Crime no Ignorance for Excuse can plead, That wretched refuge for Ingratitude. 'Twas then that from the pitying Gods there came | A kind admonishing Anger to reclaim | In dreadful Prodigies; but, alas, in vain. | So rapid Thunder-bolts before the Flame Fly, the consuming Vengeance to proclaim. I then a Boy, arriv'd to my tenth year, And still those horrid Images I bear. The mournful Signs are present to my Eyes. I saw o'r all the Region of the Skies, The History of our approaching Wars Writ in the Heav'ns in wondrous Characters. The vaulted Firmament with Lightning burns, And all the Clouds were kindled into Storms, And form'd an Image of th'Infernal Hell; (I shake with the portentous things I tell) Like sulph'rous waves the horrid Flames did roll, Whose raging Tides were hurl'd from Pole to Pole; Then suddenly the bursting Clouds divide, A Fire-like burning mounts on either side, Discovering (to th'astonish'd World) within At once a dreadful and a beauteous Scene: Two mighty Armies clad in Battle-array Ready by Combat to dispute the day: Their waving Plumes and glittering Armour shone, Mov'd by the Winds and guilded by the Sun. So well in order seem'd each fearless Rank, As they'd been marshall'd by our Hero, Monk , Monk , born for mighty things and great command, The glorious Pillar of our falling Land. Perhaps his Genius on the Royal side One of those Heav'nly Figures did describe, Here pointed out to us his noble force, And form'd him Conqueror on a flaming Horse. We heard, or fancy'd that we heard, around, The Signal giv'n by Drum and Trumpet sound, We saw the fire-wing'd Horses fiercely meet, And with their fatal Spears each other greet. Here shining brandish'd Pikes like Lightning shook, While from Etheral Guns true Thunder broke. With gloomy Mists th'involv'd the Plains of Heaven, And to the Cloud-begotten men was given A memorable Fate— By the dire Splendor which their Arms display'd, And dreadful Lightning that from Cannons play'd, We saw extended o're the Aereal Plain The wounded Bodies of the numerous slain. (Their Faces fierce with anger understood) Turning the Sky red with their gushing Blood, At last that Army we the Just esteem'd, And which adorn'd by noblest Figures seem'd Of Arms and Men, alas! was put to flight; | The rest was veil'd in the deep Shades of Night, | And Fates to come secur'd from humane sight. | But stupid England touch'd with no remorse, Beholds these Prodigies as things of course. (With many more, which to the Just appear'd As ominous Presages.) Then who fear'd The Monsters of the Caledonian Woods, Or the hid ferments of Schismatic Crowds? Nor had the impious Cromwel then a Name, For England 's Ruin, and for England 's Shame. Nor were the Gods pleas'd only to exhort By signs the restive City and the Court. Th'impending Fates o'r all the Thickets reign'd, And Ruin to the English Wood proclaim'd, We saw the sturdy Oaks of monstrous growth, Whose spreading roots fix'd in their native Earth, Where for a thousand years in peace they grew, Torn from the Soil, though none but Zephyrus blew. But who such violent Outrages could find To be th'effects of the soft Western wind? The Dryads saw the right hand of the Gods O'rturn the noblest shelters of the Woods. Others their Arms with baneful leaves were clad, That new unusual Forms and Colours had, Whence now no Aromatic moisture flows, Or noble Misseltoe enrich the boughs. But bow'd with Galls, within whose boding hulls Lurk'd Flies, diviners of ensuing ills. Whose fatal buz did future slaughters threat, And confus'd murmurs full of dread, repeat. When no rude winds disturb'd the ambient Air, The Trees, as weary of repose, made war. With horrid noise grappling their knotty Arms, Like meeting Tides they ruffle into Storms; But when the Winds to ratling Tempests rise, Instead of warring Trees we heard the Cries Of warring Men, whose dying Groans around The Woods and mournful Echo's did resound. The dismal Shades with Birds obscene were fill'd, Which, spight of Phœbus , he himself beheld. On the wild Ashes tops the Bats and Owls, With all night, ominous and baneful Fowls Sate brooding, while the Scrieches of these Droves Prophan'd and violated all the Groves. If ought that Poets do relate be true, The strange Spinturnix led the feather'd crew. [229] Of all the Monsters of the Earth and Air Spinturnix bears the cruelest Character. The barbarous Bird to mortal Eyes unknown Is seen but by the Goddesses alone: And then they tremble; for she always bodes Some fatal Discord, even among the Gods. But that which gave more wonder than the rest, Within an Ash a Serpent built her nest, [230] And laid her Eggs; when once, to come beneath The very shadow of an Ash, was death: Rather, if Chance should force, she through the Fire From its faln Leaves so baneful, would retire. But none of all the Sylvan Prodigies Did more surprise the Rural Deities, Than when the Lightning did the Laurel blast, The Lightning their lov'd Laurels all defac'd: The Laurel, which by Jove 's Divine Decree Since ancient time from injuring Tempests free; No angry threats from the celestial powers Could make her fear the ruin of her Bowers; But always she enjoy'd a certain Fate, Which she cou'd ne'r secure the Victor yet. In vain these Signs and Monsters were not sent From angry Heav'n; the wise knew what they meant. Their coming by Conjectures understood, As did the Dryads of the British wood, There is an ancient Forest known to fame= On this side separate from the Cambrian Plain By wandering Wye ; whose winding Current glides, And murmuring Leaves behind its flowry sides. On that, 'tis wash'd by nobler Severn 's streams Whose Beauties scarce will yield to famous Thames . Of Yore 'twas Arden call'd, but that great Name, As like her self diminish'd, into Dean . The cursed Weapons of destructive War In all their Cruelties have made her share; The Iron has its noblest Shades destroy'd, Then to melt Iron is its Wood employ'd; And so unhappy 'tis as it presents Of its own Death the fatal Instruments. With Industry its ruin to improve Bears Minerals below, and Trees above. Oh Poverty! thou happiness extreme, (When no afflicting want can intervene) And oh thou subtle Treasure of the Earth, From whence all Rapes and Mischiefs take their birth; And you, triumphing Woods, secur'd from spoil By the safe blessing of your barren Soil. Here, unconsum'd, how small a part remains Of that rich Store that once adorn'd the Plains. Yet that small part that has escap'd the Ire Of lawless Steel, and avaricious Fire, By many Nymphs and Deities possest Of all the British shades continues still the best. Here the long Reverend Dryas (who had been Of all the shady verdant Regions Queen, To which by Conquest she had forc'd the Sea His constant tributary Waves to pay) Proclaim'd a general Council through her Court To which the Sylvan Nymphs shou'd all resort. All the Wood-Goddesses do strait appear, At least who cou'd the British Climate bear, And on a soft ascent of rising Ground Their Queen, their charming Dryas they surround, Who all adorn'd was in the middle plac'd, And by a thousand awful Beauties grac'd. These Goddesses alike were drest in Green, the Ornaments and Liveries of their Queen. Had Travellers at any distance view'd The beauteous Order of this stately Crowd, They wou'd not guess they'd been Divinities, But Groves all sacred to the Deities. Such was the Image of this leafy Scene, On one side water'd by a cooling Stream, Upon whose brink the Poplar took her place, The Poplar whom Alcides once did grace, Whose double colour'd shadow'd Leaves express The Labours of her Hero Hercules : Whose upper sides are black, the under white To represent his Toil and his Delight. The Phaetonian Alder next took Place, Still sensible of the burnt Youths disgrace, She loves the purling Streams, and often Laves Beneath the Floods, and wantons with the Waves. Close by her side the Pensive Willows join'd, Chast Sisters all, to Lovers most unkind. Olesicarpians call'd, in Youth severe [231] Before the Winter age had snow'd their Hair. In Rivers take delight, whose chilling Streams, Mixt with the native coldness of their Veins, Like Salamanders can all Heat remove, And quite extinguish the quick fire of Love. Firm lasting Bonds they yield to all beside, But take delight the Lovers to divide. The Elders next, who though they Waters love The same from Humane Bodies yet remove, And quite disperse the humid moisture thence, And parly with the Dropsie in this sense. "Why do you linger here, O lazy Floud? "This Soil belongs to Rivolets of Blood. "Why do you Men torment, when many a shade, "And honest Trees and Plants do want your Aid? "Begon, from Humane Bodies quick begon, | "And back into your native Channels run | "By every Pore, by all the ways you can. | The Moisture frightened flies at the command, And awful terror of her powerful wand. The Hospitable Birch does next appear, Joyful and Gay in hot or frigid Air, Flowing her Hair, her Garments soft and white, And yet in Cruelty she takes delight, No wild Inhabitant of the Woods can be So quick in Wrath, and in Revenge as she; In Houses great Authority assumes, And's the sole punisher of petty Crimes. But most of all her Malice she employs In Schools, to terrifie and awe young Boys, If she chastise, 'tis for the Patient's good, Though oft she blushes with their tender Blood. Not so the generous Maples ; they present What e'r the City Luxury can invent, Who with industrious Management and Pains Divide the Labyrinth of their curious Grains, And many necessary things produce, That serve at once for Ornament and Use. But thou, O Pteleas , to the Swain allows [232] Shades to his Cattel, Timber for his Plows, Ennobled thou above the leafie Race In that an Amorous God does thee embrace. [233] Next the Oxias of her self a Grove, Whose spreading shade the Flocks and Shepherds love, [234] Whether thy murmurs do to sleep invite, Or thy soft noise inspire the rural Pipe; Alike thou 'rt gratful, and canst always charm, In Summer cooling, and in Winter warm. Tityrus of yore the Nymph with Garlands hung, And all his Love-lays in her shadow sung. When first the infant-World her reign began, Ere Pride and Luxury had corrupted Man, Before for Gold the Earth they did invade, The useful Houshold-stuff of Beech was made; No other Plate the humble Side-board drest, No other Bowls adorn'd the wholesom Feast, Which no voluptuous Cookery cou'd boast, The home-bred Kid or Lamb was all the cost. The Mirth, the Innocence, and little care, Surpast the loaded Boards of high-priz'd fare. There came no Guest for Interest or Design, For guilty Love, fine Eating or rich Wine. The Beechen -Bowl without Debauch went round, And was with harmless Mirth and Roses crown'd: In these—the Ancients in their happy state Their Feasts and Banquets us'd to celebrate. Fill'd to the Brim with uncorrupted Wine, They made Libations to the Powers Divine To keep 'em still benign, no Sacrifice They need perform the angry Gods t'appease. They knew no Crimes the Deities to offend, But all their care was still to keep 'em kind. No Poyson ever did those Bowls infest, Securely here the Shepherd quench'd his thirst; 'Twas not that any Vertue in the Wood Against the baneful Liquor was thought good, But Poverty and Innocence were here The Antidotes against all Ills, and Fear. Such was the Ash , the Nymph was Melias nam'd, For peaceful Use, and liberal Virtues fam'd: But when Achilles Spear was of her Wood Fatally form'd, and drank of Hector 's Blood, O wretched Glory! O unhappy Power, She loves the Rain, and neighbouring Floods no more. No more the falling Showers delight her now, She only thirsts to drink of bloody Dew. Philyra , not Inferiour to her Race, [235] For her Bel-taille , good Mien and handsom Grace, For pious use, and noblest studies fit, Minerva here might exercise her wit, And on the lasting Vellum which she brings, May in small Volumes write Seraphic things; 'Mongst all the Nymphs and Hamadryades, There's none so fair, and so adorn'd as this. All soft her Body, Innocent and White, In her Green flowing Hair she takes delight, Proud of her perfum'd Blossoms far she spreads Her lovely, charming, odoriferous Shades. Her native Beauties even excelling Art; Her Vertues many Medicines still impart; The dowry of each Plant in her does rest, And she deserv'dly triumphs o'r the Best. Next her Orcimelis and Achras stood, [236] Whose Off-spring is a sharp and rigid Brood, A Fruit no Season e'er cou'd work upon, Not to be mellow'd by th'all ripening Sun. Hither the fair Amphibious Nymphs resort, Who both in Woods and Gardens keep their Court, [237] The Ouas , but of no ignoble Fame, Although she bears a base and servile Name, Sharp Oxyacatha , next the Mulberry stood, [238] The Mulberry dy'd in hapless Lovers blood. [239] Craneia , a Nymph too lean to be admir'd, [240] But hard-gain'd Carya is by all desir'd. [241] The pretty Corylus so neat and trim, [242] And Castanis with rough ungrateful Skin. These Nymphs of all their Race live rich, and high, | They taste the City Garden Luxury, | And Woods their Country Villas 's do supply. | Nor was the Hawthorn absent from this place, All Soils are native to her harden'd Race, Though her the Fields and Gardens do reject, She with a thorny Hedge does both protect. Helvetia rough with Cold and Stones first bred [243] The Nymph, who thence to other Climates fled, Of her a warlike sturdy Race was born, Whose dress nor Court, nor City can adorn, But with a faithful hand they both defend While they upon no Garison depend, No show, or noisie Grandeur they affect, But to their Trust they'r constant and exact: Should you behold 'em rang'd in Battel-array, | All muster'd in due order, you wou'd say, | That no Militia were so fine and gay. | Let none the Ancients rashly then reproach, Who cut from hence the Hymeneal Torch. Since they such safeguard were 'gainst Thieves and Beasts, Which with an equal force their charge molests. And 'twas commanded they should always bear Their watchful Twigs before the married Pair. With the Helvetian Nymph, a pretty Train, All her Companions to the Circle came, The fruitful Bullace first, whose Off-spring are, Though harsh and sharp, yet moderately fair. The prickly Bramble , neat and lovely Rose So nice and coy, they never will dispose Their valu'd Favours, but some wounds they give To those who will their guarded Joys receive. No less a Troop of those gay Nymphs were seen, Who nobly flourish in Eternal Green, Unsubject to the Laws o' th'changing Year, They want no Aids of kindly Beams or Air. But happy in their own peculiar Spring, While the Pole weeps in showers, they laugh and sing. The generous Pyxias , who a Conquest gains [244] O'r armed Winter with her Host of Rains, All Ages she subdues: devouring Time In vain endeavours to destroy her prime; Still in her Youth and Beauty she survives, When all the Spring is dead, she smiles and lives: Yet though she's obstinate to time, and storms, She's kindly pliable to all curious Forms. To artful Masters she Obedience lends, And to th'ingenious hand with ease she bends. Into a thousand True-loves-knots she twines, And with a verdant Wall the Flowers confines. Still looking up with gay and youthful Love To the triumphing Flow'rs that reign above. Or if you please, she will advance on high, And with the lofty Trees her stature vie, And chearfully will any figure take, Whether Man, or Lyon, or a Bird you make, Or on her Trunk like a green Parrot show, Or sometimes like a Hercules she grow: And hence Praxiteles fair Statues forms, When with Green Gods the Gardens he adorns. Nor yet being dead does of less use appear To the Industrious Artificer: From her the noblest Figures do arise, And almost are Immortal Deities; Of her the Berecynthian Pipe is made, That charms its native Mountain and its shade, That in such tuneful Harmonies express The Praises of their Goddess Cibeles . With this the lovely Females dress their Hair, [245] | That not least powerful Beauty of the Fair, | Their noblest Ornament and th'Lovers snare. | This into form the Beauteous Nets still lay That the poor heedless Gazer does betray. Agrias is content with easier spoils, [246] Onely for silly Birds she pitches toyls. The wanton Bird she stops upon the wing, And can forbid the insolence of Men; With a Defence the garden she sypplys, And does perpetually delight the Eyes: Her shining Leaves a lovely green produce, And serve at once for Ornament and Use. Deform'd December by her Posie-boughs All deck'd and drest like joyful April shows. Cold Winter days she both adorns and clears, While she her constant springing Livery wears. Camaris , who in Winter give their Birth, [247] Not humbly creeping on the servile Earth, But rear aloft their nobler fruitful heads, Whose Sylvan food unhappy Janus feeds. His hungry Appetite he here destroys And both his ravenous Mouths at once destroys [ for he cloys?] Phillyrea , here and Pyracantha rise, [248] Whose Beauty onely gratifies the Eyes Of Gods and Men, no Banquets they afford But to the welcome though unbidden Bird, Here gratefully in Winter they repay For all the Summer Songs that made their Groves so gay. Next came the melancholy Yew , who mourns With silent Languor at the Warriers Urns, See where she comes all in black shadow veil'd, Ah too unhappy Nymph on every side assail'd! Whom the Greek Poets and Historians blame, (Deceiv'd by easie faith and common fame) Thee as a guilty poisoner they present; Oh false Aspersers of the Innocent! If Poets may find credit when they speak, (At least all those who are not of the Greek ) No baneful Poison, no Malignant dew Lurks in, or hangs about the harmless Yew , No secret mischief dares the Nymph invade, And those are safe that sleep beneath her shade. Nor thou Arceuthis , art an Enemy [249] To the soft Notes of charming Harmony. Falsly the chief of Poets would persuade That Evil's lodg'd in thy Eternal shade, Thy Aromatick shade, whose verdant Arms Even thy own useful fruits secures from harms; Many false Crimes to thee they attribute, Wou'd no false Virtues too, they wou'd to thee impute. But thou Sabina , my impartial Muse Cannot with any honesty excuse, By thee the first new sparks of Life, not yet Struck up to shining flame to mature heat, Sprinkled by thy moist Poison fade and die, Fatal Sabina Nymph of Infamy. [250] For this the Cypress thee Companion calls, Who piously attends at Funerals: But thou more barbarous, dost thy pow'r employ, And even the unborn Innocent destroy. Like Fate destructive thou, without remorse, While she the Death of even the Ag'd deplores. Such Cyparissus was, that bashful Boy, Who was belov'd by the bright God of Day; Of such a tender mind, so soft a Breast, With so compassionate a Grief opprest, For wounding his lov'd Dear, that down he lay And wept, and pin'd his sighing Soul away. Apollo pitying it, renew'd his fate | And to the Cypress did the Boy translate, | And gave his hapless life a longer Date. | Then thus decreed the God—and thou oh Tree, Chief Mourner at all Funerals shall be. And since so small a cause such grief cou'd give, Be't still thy Talent (pitying youth) to grieve. Sacred be thou in Pluto 's dark abodes, For ever sacred to th'Infernal Gods! This said, well skill'd in truth he did bequeath Eternal life to the dire Tree of Death, A substance that no Worm can e'r subdue Whose never dying Leaves each Day renew, Whose Figures like aspiring flames still rise And with a noble Pride salute the Skies. Next the fair Nymph that Phœbus does adore, But yet as nice and cold as heretore: She hates all fires, and with aversion still She chides and crackles if the flame she feel. Yet though she's chast, the burning God no less Adores, and makes his Love his Prophetess. And even the Murmurs of her scorn do now For joyful Sounds and happy Omens go. Nor does the Humble, though the sacred Tree Fear wounds from any Earthly Enemy; For she beholds when loudest storms abound, The flying thunder of the Gods around, Let all the flaming Heav'ns threat as they will Unmov'd th'undaunted Nymph out-braves it still. Oh thou!— Of all the woody Nations happiest made Thou greatest Princess of the fragrant shade, But shou'd the Goddess Dryas not allow That Royal Title to thy Vertue due, At least her justice must this truth confess, If not a Princess, thou 'rt a Prophetess, And all the Glories of immortal Fame Which conquering Monarchs so much strive to gain; Is but at best from thy triumphing Boughs To reach a Garland to adorn their Brows, And after Monarchs, Poets claim a share As the next worthy thy priz'd wreaths to wear. Among that number, do not me disdain, Me, the most humble of that glorious Train. I by a double right thy Bounties claim, Both from my Sex, and in Apollo 's Name: [251] Let me with Sappho and Orinda be | Oh ever sacred Nymph, adorn'd by thee; | And give my Verses Immortality. | The tall Elate next, and Peuce stood The stateliest Sister-Nymphs of all the wood. The flying Winds sport with their flowing Hair, While to the dewy Clouds their lofty heads they rear. As mighty Hills above the Valleys show, | And look with scorn on the descent below, | So do these view the Mountains where they grow. So much above their humbler Tops they rise, So stood the Giants that besieg'd the Skies, The terror of the Gods! they having thrown Huge Ossa on the Leafy Pelion , The Firr with the proud Pine thus threatning stands Lifting to Heav'n two hundred warring hands, In this vast prospect they with ease survey the various figur'd Land and boundless Sea, With joy behold the Ships their timber builds, How they've with Cities stor'd once spacious Fields. This Grove of English Nymphs, this noble train In a large Circle compass in their Queen, The Scepter bearing Dryas — Her Throne-arising Hillock, where she sat With all the Charms of Majesty and State, With awful Grace the numbers she survey'd, Dealing around the favours of her shade. If I the voice of the loud winds cou'd take Which the re echoing Oaks do agitate, 'Twould not suffice to celebrate thy Name Oh sacred Dryas of Immortal Fame. If we a faith can give Antiquity That sings of many Miracles, from thee In the worlds Infant-Age Mankind broke forth, From thee the noble Race receiv'd their Birth; Thou then in a green tender Bark wert clad, But in Deucalion 's Age a rougher covert had, More hard and warm, with crusted white all o'r, As noble Authors sung in times of yore; Approv'd by some, condemn'd and argu'd down By the vain troop of Sophists, and the Gown, The scoffing Academy, and the Schools Of Pyrrho ; who Traditions over-rule: But let 'em doubt; yet they must grant this truth Those Brawny Men that then the Earth brought forth, Did on thy Acorns feed, and feast and thrive And with this wholesom Nourishment survive In health and strength an equal age with thee, Secur'd from all the Banes of Luxury. Oh happy Age! oh Nymph Divinely good! That mak'st thy shade Mans house, thy fruit his food. When onely Apples of the Wood did pass For noble Banquets spread on Beds of Grass. Tables not yet by any Art debauch'd, And fruit that ne'r the Grudgers hand reproach'd. Thy Bounties Ceres were of little use, And thy sweet food ill Manners did produce: Unluckily they did thy Virtues find With that of the wild Boar and hunted Hind; With all wild Beasts on which their Luxury prey'd, While new desires their Appetites invade. The Natures they partake of what they eat, And salvage they become as was their Meat. Hence the Republick of the world did cease, Hence they might dare the forfeit of their peace. The common good was now peculiar made, | A generous Int'rest now became a Trade, | And Men began their Neighbour's rights t'invade. | For now they measur'd out their common ground, And outrages commit t'inlarge their Bound: Their own seem'd despicable, poor and small; Each wants more room and wou'd be Lord of all. The Plowman with disdain his Field surveys, Forsakes the Land, and plows the faithless Seas. The Fool in these deep furrows seeks his gain, Despising Dangers, and induring pain. The sacred Oak her peaceful Mansion leaves Transplanted to the Mountains of the Waves. Oh Dryas , Patron to th'industrious kind, If Man were wise and wou'd his safety find; What perfect Bliss thy happy Shade wou'd give? And Houses that their Masters wou'd out-live. All necessaries thou afford'st alone For harmless Innocence to live upon. Strong yokes for Oxen, handles for the Plow, What Husbandry requires thou dost allow; But if the madness of desiring Gain, Or wild Ambition agitate the Brain, Straight to a wandering Ship they Thee transfer, And none more justly serves the Mariner. Thou cutst the Air, dost on the Waves rebound, Wild Death and Fury regins all around, Disdaining to behold the ravag'd Wood, Out-brave the Storms and baffle the rude Flood. To Swine, O richest Oak, thy Acorns leave, And search for Man what e'er the Earth can give, All that the spacious Universe brings forth, What Land and Sea conceals of any worth, Bring Aromaticks from the distant East, | And Gold so dangerous from the rifl'd West, | What e'er the boundless Appetite can feast. | With thee the utmost bounds of Earth w'invade, By thee the unlockt Orb is common made. By thee— The great Republique of the World revives, And o'er the Earth luxurious traffick thrives; If Argos Ship were valued at that rate (Which Ancient Poets so much celebrate, From Neighbouring Colchos only bringing home The Golden Fleece from Seas whose Tracts were known: If of the dangers they so much have spoke (More worthy smiles) of the Cyanean Rock, What Oceans then of Fame shall thee suffice? What Waves of eloquence can sing thy Praise? O sacred Oak, that great Columbus bore | IO! thou bearer of a happier Ore, | Than celebrated Argo did before. | And drake 's brave Oak that past to Worlds unknown, Whose Toils, O Phœbus , were so like thy own, Who round the Earths vast Globe triumphant rode, Deserves the Celebration of a God. O let the Pegasæan Ship no more Be worshipt on the too unworthy Shore, After her watery life, let her become A fixt Star shining equal with the Ram. Long since the Duty of a Star she's done, And round the Earth with guiding light has shone. Oh how has Nature blest the British Land, Who both the valued Indies can command! What tho thy Banks the Cedars do not grace Those lofty Beauties of fam'd Libanus . The Pine, or Palm of Idumean Plaines, Arabs rich Wood or its sweet smelling Greens, Or lovely Plantan whose large leafy boughs A pleasant and a noble shade allows. She has thy warlike Groves and Mountains blest With sturdy Oak's, ore all the World the best, And for the happy Islands sure Defence, Has wall'd it with a Mote of Seas immense, While to declare her Safety and thy Pride, With Oaken Ships that Sea is fortifi'd. Nor was that Adoration vainly made, Which to the Oak the Ancient Druids paid, Who reasonably believed a God within, Where such vast wonders were produc'd and seen. Nor was it the dull Piety alone, And superstition of our Albion , Nor ignorance of the future Age, that paid Honours Divine to thy surprising shade, But they foresaw the Empire of the Sea, Great Charles , should hold from the Triumphant Thee. No wonder then that Age should thee Adore, Who gav'st our sacred Oracles heretofore, The hidden pleasure of the Gods was then In a hoarse voice deliver'd out to Men. So vapors from Cyrrhean Caverns broke Inspir'd Apollo 's Priestess when she spoke. While ravisht the fair Enthusiastic stood, Upon her Tripos , raging with the God. So Priest Inspir'd with sacred fury shook, When the Winds ruffled the Dodonian Oak, And tost their Branches, till a dreadful sound Of awful horror they proclaim around, Like frantic Bacchanals; and while they move Possess with trembling all the sacred Grove. Their rif'ld leaves the tempest bore away, And their torn Boughs scatter'd on all sides lay. The tortur'd thicket knew not that there came A God Trimphant in the Hurricane, Till the wing'd winds with an amazing cry, Deliver'd down the pressing Deity. Whose thundering voice strange secrets did unfold, And wond'rous things of Worlds to come he told. But truths so veil'd in obscure Eloquence, They 'muze the Adoring crowd with double sense. But by Divine Decree the Oak no more, Declares security as heretofore, With words, or voice, yet to the listening Wood, Her differing Murmurs still are understood: For sacred Divinations while the sound, Informs, all but Humanity, around Nor e'er did Dryas Murmur awful truth More clear and plain, from her Prophetic mouth, Than when she spoke to the Chaonian Wood, While all the Groves with eager silence stood. And with erected Leaves themselves dispose, To listen to the Language of her Boughs. You see (oh my companions) that the Gods, Threaten a dire Destruction of the Woods, And to all human kind—the black portents Are seen, of many sinister Events; But lest their quick Approach too much should press, (Oh my astonish'd Nymphs) your Tenderness, The Gods command me to foretel your Doom, And prepossess ye with the Fate to come. With heedful Reverence then their Will observe, And in your Barks deep Chinks my Words preserve: Believe me, Nymphs, nor is your Faith in vain, | This Oaken Trunk in which conceal'd I am | From a long Honored Ancient Lineage came, | who in the fam'd Dodonian Grove first spoke, When with astonish'd Awe the Sacred Valley shook. 'Know then that Brutus by unlucky Fate 'Murdering his Sire, bore an immortal Hate 'To his own Kingdom, who's ungrateful shore 'He leaves with Vows ne'er to revisit more. 'Then to Epirus a sad Exile came, | '(Unhappy Son who hast a Father slain, | 'But happy Father of the British name.) 'There by victorious Arms he did restore 'Those Scepters once the Race of Priam bore, 'In their paternal Thrones his Kindred plac'd, 'And by that Piety his fatal Crime defac'd. 'There Jupiter disdain'd not to relate 'Thorough an Oaken Mouth his future Fate. 'Who for his Gandsire's, great Æneas , sake 'Upon the Royal Youth will pity take: 'Whose Toils to his shall this Resemblance bear 'A long and tedious Wandring to endure. ' 'Tis said the Deity-retaining Oak 'Bursting her Bark, thus to the Hero spoke, 'Whose Voice the Nymphs surpriz'd with awful Dread, 'Who in Chaonian Groves inhabited. 'Oh noble Trojan of great Sylvia 's Blood, 'Haste from the Covert of this threatening Wood. 'A Mansion here the Fates will not permit, 'Vast Toils and Dangers thou 'rt to conquer yet, Ere for a murder'd Father thou can'st be | Absolv'd, tho innocently slain by thee, But much must bear by Land, and much by Sea. | Then arm thy solid mind, thy Virtues raise, | And thro' thy rough Adventures cut new Ways, | 'Whose End shall crown thee with immortal Bays. | 'Tho Hercules so great a Fame achiev'd, 'His conquests but to th'Western Cales arriv'd: 'There finish'd all his Glories and his Toils, 'He wish'd no more, nor sought more distant Spoils. 'But the great Labors which thou hast begun 'Must, fearless of the Oceans Threats, go on. And this remember, at thy lanching forth, 'To set thy full spread Sails against the North. 'In Charles's Wain thy Fates are born above | 'Bright Stars descended from thy Grandsire Jove , | 'Of motion certain, tho they slowly move. | 'The Bear too shall assist thee in thy Course 'With all her Constellations glittering Force. 'And as thou goest, thy Right Hand shall destroy 'Twice six Gomeritish Tyrants in thy way. 'Tho exil'd from the World, disdain all Fear, 'The Gods another World for thee prepare, 'Which in the Bosom of the deep conceal'd 'From Ages past, shall be to thee reveal'd. 'Reserv'd, O Brutus , to renown thy Fame, 'And shall be bless'd still with thy Race and Name, 'All that the Air surrounds, the Fates decree | 'To Brutus and Æneas Progeny, | ' Æneas all the Land, and Brutus all the Sea. | This said the God, from the Prophetick Oak, Who stretching out her Branches further spoke: 'Here fill thy Hands with Acorns from my Tree, | Which in thy tedious Toils of use shall be, | 'And Witnesses of all I promise thee. | 'And when thy painful wandring shall be o'er, 'And thou arriv'd on happy Britains shore, 'Then in her fruitful Soil these Acorns sow, 'Which to vast Woods of mighty use shall grow. 'Not their Chaonian Mother's sacred Name 'Shall o'er the World be sung with greater Fame. 'Then holy Druids thou shalt consecrate, 'My Honor and my Rites to celebrate. ' Teutates in the sacred Oak shall grow, 'To give bless'd Omens of the Misseltoe . Thus spake the Oak—with reverend Awe believ'd, And in no one Prediction was deceiv'd. My Lineage from Chaonian Acorns came, | I two Descents from that first Parent am | And now Oraculous Truths to you proclaim. | My Grandam Oak her Blooming Beauties wore, When first the Danish Fleet surpriz'd our Shore: When Thor and Tuisco and the Saxon Gods Were angry with their once belov'd Abodes, Her Age two hundred years; a small Account To what our long-lived Numbers do amount, Such Prodigies then she saw as we behold; And such our Ruins, as their Signs foretold. Now from the Caledonian Mountains came New risen Clouds that cover'd all the Plain, The quiet Tweed regards her Bounds no more, But driv'n by Popular winds usurps the Shore; In her wild Course a horrid Murmur yields, And frightens with her Sound the English Fields. Nor did they hear in vain; or vainly fear Those raging Prologues to approaching War. But Silver Showers did soon that Foe subdue, Weapons the Noble English never knew. The People, who for Peace so lavish were, Did after buy the Merchandise more dear. Curst Civil War even Peace betray'd to Guilt, And made her blush with the first Bloud was spilt. O cruel Omens of those future Woes, Which now sate brooding in the Senate House! That Den of Mischief, where obscur'd she lyes, And hides her purple face from human Eyes. The working Furies there, lay unreveal'd, Beneath the Privilege of the House conceal'd. There, by the Malice of the Great and Proud, And unjust Clamors of the frantick Crowd, The Great, the Learned Strafford met his Fate; O Sacred Innocence! what can expiate For guiltless Blood, but Blood? and much must flow Both from the Guilty and the Faultless too. O Worcester , condemn'd by Fate to be The Mournful Witness of our Misery, And to bewail our first Intestine Wars; By thy soft Severn 's Murmurs, and her Tears; Wars that more formidable did appear Even at their End, than their Beginnings were. Me to Kintonian Hills some God convey, [252] That I the horrid Valley may survey; Which like a River seem'd of human Blood, Swell'd with the numerous Bodies of the Dead. What Slaughters makes fierce Rupert round the Field, Whose Conquests Pious Charles with Sighs beheld; And had not Fate the Course of Things forbade, This Day an End of all our Woes had made. But our Success the angry Gods controul, And stopt our Race of Glory near the goal. Where e'er the British Empire did extend, The Tyrant War with Barbarous Rigor reign'd, From the remotest Parts it rifled Peace From the Belerian Horn even to the Orcades . [253] The Fields opprest, no joyful Harvest bear, War ruin'd all the Product of the Year. Unhappy Albion ! by what Fury stung? What Serpent of Eumenides has flung His Poison thro' thy Veins? thou bleed'st all o'er, Art all one Wound, one univeral Gore. Unhappy Newberry , I thy fatal Field, (Covered with mighty Slaughters, thrice beheld.) In horrors thou Philippi 's Fields outvi'd Which twice the Civil Gore of Romans di'd. Long mutual Loss, and the alternate Weight Of equal Slaughters, pois'd each others Fate. Uncertain Ruin waver'd to and fro, And knew not where to fix the deadly Blow; At last in Northern Fields like Lightening broke; And Naseby doubl'd every fatal Stroke. But, Oh ye Gods, permit me not to tell the Woes, that after this, the Land befel: Oh, keep 'em to your selves, lest they shou'd make Humanity your Rites, and Shrines forsake: To future Ages let 'em not be known, For wretched England 's Credit, and your own. And take from me, ye Gods, Futurity, And let my Oracles all silent lye, Rather than by my Voice they shou'd declare The dire Events of England 's Civil War. And yet my Sight a confus'd Prospect fills, A Chaos all deform'd, a Heap of Ills; Such as no mortal Eyes cou'd e'r behold, Such as no human Language can unfold. But now— The Conquering evil Genius of the Wars, The impious Victor all before him bears; And oh,—behold the Sacred Vanquish'd flies, And tho in a Plebean 's mean Disguise, I know his God-like Face; the Monarch sure Did ne'er dissemble till this fatal hour. But oh he flies, distrest, forlorn he flies, And seeks his safety 'mong his Enemies. His Kingdoms all he finds hostile to be, No place to th'vanquish'd proves a Sanctu'ry. Thus Royal Charles — From his own People cou'd no safety gain, Alas, the King! (their Guest) implores in vain. The Pilot thus the burning Vessel leaves, And trusts what most he fears, the threatning Waves. But oh the cruel Flood with rude Disdain Throws him all struggling to the Flames again: So did the Scots , alas, what shou'd they do, That Prize of War (the Soldiers Interest now) By Prayers and Threatnings back they strive to bring, | But the wise Scot will yield to no such thing; And England to retrieve him buys her King. | Oh shame to future Worlds! who did command, As powerful Lord of all the Sea and Land, Is now a Captive-Slave exposed to Sale; And Villany o'er Virtue must prevail. The Servant his bought Master bears away, Oh shameful Purchase of so glorious Prey. But yet, O Scotland , far be it from me, To charge thee wholly with this Infamy; Thy Nations Virtues shall reverse that Fate, And for the Criminal Few shall expiate: Yet for these Few the Innocent Rest must feel, The dire Effects of the avenging Steel. But now, by Laws to God and Man unknown, their Sovereign, Gods anointed they dethrone, Who to the Isle of Wight is Prisoner sent: What Tongue, what cruel Hearts do not lament? That thee, O Scotland , with just Anger moves, And Kent who valued Liberty so loves; And thee, O Wales , of still as noble Fame As were the ancient Britains whence ye came. But why should I distinctly here relate All I behold, the many Battels fought Under the Conduct still of angry Stars: Their new-made Wounds and old ones turn'd to Scars; The Blood that did the trembling Ribla dy, Stopping its frighted Stream that strove to fly. Or thou, O Medway , swell'd with Slaughters, born Above the flowery Banks that did thee once adorn. Or why, O Colchester , shou'd I rehearse Thy brave united courage and thy Force, Or Deaths of those illustrious Men relate, Who did with thee deserve a kinder Fate. Or why the miserable Murders tell Of Captives who by cooler Malice fell. Nor to your Griefs will this Addition bring, The sad Idea's of a Martyred King; A King who all the Wounds of Fortune bore, Nor will his mournful Funerals deplore, Lest that Celestial Piety (of Fame O'er all the World) should my sad Accents blame. Since Death he still esteem'd, how e'er 'twas given, The greatest good, and noblest Gift of Heaven. But I deplore Man's wretched Wickedness. (Oh horrid to be heard, or to express.) Whom even Hell can ne'er enough torment With her eternal Pains and Punishment. But oh what do I see! alas they bring Their Sacred Master forth, their God-like King, There on a Scaffold rais'd in solemn State And plac'd before the Royal Palace Gate, 'Midst of his Empire the black Deed was done, While Day, and all the World, were looking on. By common Hangman's Hands—Here stopt the Oak, When from the bottom of its Root there broke A thousand Sighs, which to the Sky she lifts, Bursting her solid Bark into a thousand Clefts. Each Branch her Tributary sorrow gives, And Tears run trickling from her mournful Leaves; Such numbers after rainy Nights they shed, When showering Clouds that did surround her Head, Are by the rising Goddess of the Morn Blown off, and flie before the approaching Sun. At which the Troop of the Green Nymphs around Ecchoing her Sighs, in wailing Accents groan'd, Whose piercing sounds from far were understood, And the loud Tempest shook the wondering Wood: And then a cruel Silence did succeed, As in the gloomy Mansions of the Dead. But after a long awful Interval Dryas assum'd her sad Prophetick Tale. Now Britany o'erwhelm'd with many a Wound, Her Head lopt off, in her own Blood lies drown'd: A horrid Carcase, without Mind or Soul, A Trunk not to be known, deform'd and foul. And now who wou'd not hope there shou'd have been After so much of Death, a quiet Scene; Or rather with their Monarch's Funeral Eternal Sleep shou'd not have seis'd 'em all. But nothing less, for in the room of One, Who govern'd justly on his peaceful Throne, A thousand Heads sprung up, deform'd and base, With a tumultuous and ignoble Race; The vile, the vulgar Off-spring of the Earth, Insects of poisonous kinds, of monsterous Birth, And ravenous Serpents now the Land infest; And Cromwell viler yet than all the rest. That Serpent even upon the Marrow preys, Devouring Kingdoms with insatiate Jaws. Now Right and Wrong (mere Words confounded ly) Rage sets no Bounds to her Impiety; And having once transgrest the Rules of Shame, Honor or Justice counts an empty Name. In every Street, as Pastime for the Crowd, Erected Scaffolds reek'd with Noble Blood. Prisons were now th'Apartments of the Brave, Whom Tyranny commits, and only Death retrieve; Whose Paths were crowded ere the Morning dawn, Some to the Dungeons, some to Gibbets drawn. But tir'd-out Cruelty pauses for a while, To take new Breath amidst her Barbarous Toil. So does not Avarice, she unwearied still, Ne'er stops her greedy Hand from doing ill; The Warrior may a while his Spear forsake, But Sequestrations will no Respit take. What a long Race of Kings laid up with Care, The Gifts of happy Peace, and Spoils of War, What ever liberal Piety did present, Or the Religion (all magnificent) Of our Fore-fathers, to the Church had given, And consecrated to the Pow'rs of Heav'n, Altars, or or whatso'er cou'd guilty be Of tempting Wealth, or fatal Loyalty, Was not enough to satisfie the Rage Of a few Earth-begotten Tyrants of the Age. The impious Rout thought it a trivial thing To rob the Houses of their God and King, Their Sacrilege admitting of no Bound, Rejoyc'd to see 'em levell'd with the Ground; As if the Nation (wicked and unjust) Had even in Ruin found a certain Lust; On every side the groaning Earth sustains The ponderous weight of Stones and wonderous Beams. Fiercely they ply their Work, with such a noise, As if some mighty Structure they wou'd raise For the proud Tyrant; no, this clamorous Din Is not for building but demolishing. When (my Companions) these sad things you see, And each beholds the dead Beams of her Parent Tree, Long since repos'd in Palaces of Kings, Torn down by furious Hands as useless things; Then know your Fate is come; those Hands that cou'd From Houses tear dead Beams, and long hewn Wood, Will for your living Trunks find no remorse. Religion, which was great of old, commands No Woods shou'd be profaned by impious Hands, Those noble Seminaries for the Fleet, Plantations that make Towns and Cities great: Those Hopes of War, and Ornaments of Peace Shou'd live secure from any Outrages, Which now the barbarous Conqueror will invade, Tear up your Roots, and rifle all your shade, For gain they'll sell you to the covetous Buyer, A Sacrifice to every common Fire, They'll spare no Race of Trees of any Age, But murder infant Branches in their Rage: Elms, Beeches, tender Ashes shall be fell'd, And even the Grey and Reverend Bark must yield: The soft, the murmuring Troop shall be no more, No more with Musick charm as heretofore, No more each little Bird shall build her House, And sing in her Hereditary Boughs, But only Philomel shall celebrate In mournful Notes a new unhappy Fate: The banish'd Hamadryads must be gone, And take their flight with sad, but silent Moan; For a Celestial Being ne'er complains, Whatever be her Grief, in noisie Strains. The Wood-Gods fly, and whither shall they go, | Not all the British Orb can scarce allow, | A Trunk secure for them to rest in now. | But yet these wild Saturnals shall not last, Oppressing Vengeance follows on too fast; She shakes her brandish'd Steel, and still denies Length to immoderate Rage and Cruelties. Do not despond, my Nymphs; that wicked Birth Th'avenging Powers will chase from off the Earth; Let 'em hew down the Woods, destroy and burn, And all the lofty Groves to Ashes turn; Yet still there will not want a Tree to yield Timber enough old Tiburn to rebuild, Where they may hang at last; and this kind one Shall then revenge the Woods of all their Wrong. In the mean time (For Fate not always shows A swift complyance to our Wish and Vows) The Off-spring of great Charles forlorn, and poor, And exil'd from their cruel native Shore, Wander in Foreign Kingdoms, where in vain They seek those Aids, alas, they cannot gain; For still their pressing Fate pursues 'em hard, And scarce a place of Refuge will afford. Oh pious Son of such a holy Sire! Who can enough thy Fortitude admire? How often tost by Storms of Land and Sea, | Yet unconcern'd thy Fate thou didst survey, | And her Fatigues still underwent with Joy. Oh Royal Youth, pursue thy just Disdain, Let Fortune and her Furies frown in vain, Till tir'd with her Injustice, she give out, And leave her giddy Wheel for thee to turn about. Then that great Scepter which no human Hand From the tenacious Tyrant can command, Scorning the bold Usurper to adorn, Shall ripe and falling to thy Hand be born. But oh, he rowzes now before his time! Illustrious Youth, whose Bravery is a Crime, Alas, what wilt thou do? Ah, why so fast? The Dice of Fate, alas, not yet are cast. While thou all fire, fearless of future Harms, And prodigal of life, assumest thy Arms. And even provoking Fame he cuts his way Through hostile Fleets, and a rude Winters Sea. But neither shall his daring Course oppose, Even to those Shores so very late his Foes, And still to be suspected; but mean while The Oliverian Demons of the Isle, With all Hells Deities, with Fury burn, To see great Charles preparing to return; They call up all their Winds of dreadful Force In vain, to stop his sacred Vessels course. In vain their Storms a Ruine do prepare, For what Fate means to take peculiar care; And trembling find great Cesar safe at Land, By Heav'n conducted, not by Fortunes Hand. But Scotland , you your King recal in vain, While you your unchang'd Principles retain; But yet the time shall come, when some small share Of Glory, that great Honor shall confer, When you a conquering Hero forth shall guide, While Heav'n and all the Stars are on his side, Who shall the exil'd King in Peace recal, And England 's Genius be esteem'd by all: but this,not yet my Nymphs—but now's the time, When the illustrious Heir of Fergus Line, From full a hundred Kings, shall mount the Throne, | Who now the Temple enters, and at Scone , After the ancient manner he receives the Crown; | But, oh, with no auspicious Omens done, The Left Hand of the Kingdom put it on. But now th'insulting Conqueror draws nigh, Disturbing the August Solemnity; When with Revenge and Indignation fir'd, And by a Father's Murder well inspir'd, The brave, the Royal Youth for War prepares, O Heir most worthy of thy hundred Scepter'd Ancestors: With Thoughts all Glorious now he sallies forth; Nor will he trust his Fortune in the North, That Corner of his Realms, nor will his haste Lazily wait till coming Winter's past; He scorns that Aid, nor will he hope t'oppose High Mountains 'gainst the Fury of his Foes, Nor their surrounding Force will here engage, Or stay the Pressures of a shameful Siege; But boldly further on resolves t'advance, And give a generous Loose to Fortunes Chance. And shut from distant Tay he does essay To Thames , even with his Death to force his way. Behind he leaves his trembling Enemies, Amaz'd at this stupendous Enterprise. And now the wish'd for happy Day appears, Sought for so long by Britain 's Prayers and Tears; The King returns, and with a mighty Hand, Avow'd Revenger of his Native Land. And through a thousand Dangers and Extremes, Marches a conqueror to Sabrina 's Streams; | (Ah, wou'd to Heaven Sabrina had been Thames .) | So wish'd the King, but the persuasive Force Of kind mistaken Councils stopt his Course. Now, warlike England , rouse at these Alarms, Provide your Horses, and assume your Arms, And fall on the Usurper, now for shame, If Piety be not Pretence and Name; Advance the Work Heaven has so well begun, Revenge the Father, and restore the Son. No more let that old Cant destructive be, Religion, Liberty and Property. No longer let that dear-bought Cheat delude, (Oh you too credulous, senseless Multitude,) Words only form'd more easily to enslave, By every popular and pretending Knave. But now your bleeding Land expects you shou'd Be wise, at the expence of so much Blood; Rouze then, and with awaken'd Sense prepare | To reap the Glory of the Holy War, | In which your King and Heaven have equal share. | His Right Divine let every Voice proclaim And a just Ardor every Soul inflame. But England 's evil Genius watches still To ruin Virtue, and incourage Ill; Industrious, even as Cromwel , to subvert Honor and Loyalty in every Heart; A baneful Drug of four-fold Poison makes, and an infernal sleepy Asp he takes Of cold and fearful Nature, adds to this | Opium that binds the Nerves with Laziness, | Mixt with the Venom of vile Avarice: | Which all the Sprits benum, as when y' approach the chilling wonderful Torpedo 's Touch. Next Drops from Lethe 's Stream he does infuse, And every Brest besprinkles with the Juice, Till a deep Lethargy o'er all Britain came, Who now forgot their Safety and their Fame. Yet still Great Charles 's Valour stood the Test; By Fortune tho forsaken and opprest, Wittness the Purple of Sabrina 's Stream, And the Red Hill , not call'd so now in vain. And Worster thou, who didst the Misery bear, And saw'st the End of a long fatal War. The King, tho vanquish'd, still his Fate outbraves, And was the last the captiv'd City leaves; Which from the Neighbouring Hills he does survey, Where round about his Bleeding Numbers lay. He saw 'em rifled by th'insulting Foe, And sighs for those he cannot rescue now. But yet his Troops will rally once agian, Those few escap'd, all scatter'd o'er the Plain; Disdain and Anger now resolves to try | How to repair this Days Fatality, | The King has sworn to conquer, or to dye. | Darby and Willmot , Chiefs of mighty Fame, With that bold lovely Youth, great Buckingham , Fiercer than Lightening; to his Monarch dear, That brave Achates worth Æneas Care, Applaud his great Resolve! there's no delay But toward the Foe in haste they take their way, Not by vain hopes of a new Victory fir'd, But by a kind Despair alone inspir'd. This was the King's Resolve, and those great Few Whom Glory taught to die, as well as to subdue, Who knew that Death and the reposing Grave No Foes were to the Wretched or the Brave. But oh this noble Courage did not rest In each ungenerous unconsidering Brest, They fearfully forsake their General, Who now in vain the flying Cowards call, Deaf to his Voice will no Obedience yield; But in their hasty Flight scowr o'er the dreadful Field. Oh vainly gallant Youth, what pitying God Shall free thee from this Soul-oppressing Load Of Grief and Shame; abandon'd and betray'd By perjur'd Slaves, whom thou hast fed and pay'd. Prest with more Woes than mortal Force could bear, And Fortune still resolv'd to be severe. But yet that God— To whom no Wonders are impossible Will, to preserve thee, work a Miracle. And for the sacred Father's Martyrdom Will with a Crown reward the injur'd Son, While thou, great Charles , with a prevailing Pray'r Dost to the Gods commend the safety of thy Heir; And the Celestial Court of Powers Divine With one consent do in the Chorus joyn. But why, oh why must I reveal the Doom, (Oh my Companions) of the years to come; And why divulge the Mysteries that lye Inroll'd long since in Heav'ns vast Treasury, In Characters which no Dreamer can unfold, Nor ever yet Prophetick Rapture told; Nor the small Fibres of the victim'd Beast, Or Birds which Sacred Auguries have exprest; No Stars, or any Divination Shows Made Mystick by the Murmurs of the Boughs. Yet I must on, with a Divine Presage, And tell the Wonders of the coming Age. In that far part where the rich Salop gains An ample View o'er all the Western Plains, A Grove appears, which Boscobel they name, Not known to Maps; a Grove of scanty Fame, Scarce any human thing does there intrude, But it enjoys it self in its own Solitude. And yet henceforth no celebrated Shade, Of all the British Groves shall be more Glorious made. Near this obscure and destin'd happy wood, A Sacred House of lucky Omen stood, White Lady call'd; and old Records relate 'Twas once— To Men of Holy Orders consecrate; But to a King a Refuge now is made, The first that gives a wearied Monarch Bread. Oh Present of a wonderous Excellence! That can relieve the Hunger of a Prince. Fortune shall here a better Face put on, And here the King shall first the King lay down; Here he dismisses all his Mourning Friends, Whom to their kinder Stars he recommends, With Eyes all drown'd in Tears, their Fate to see, But unconcern'd at his own Destiny; Here he puts off those Ornaments he wore Through all the Splendor of his Life before; Even his Blew Garter now he will discharge, Nor keep the Warlike Figure of Saint George , That holy Champion now is vanquish'd quite; Alas, the Dragon has subdu'd the Knight; His Crown, that restless weight of Glory now Divests a while from his more easie Brow: And all those charming Curls that did adorn His Royal Head—those Jetty Curls are shorn; Himself he cloaths in a coarse Russet Weed, Nor was the poor Man feign'd, but so indeed; And now the greatest King the World e'er saw Is subject to the Houses ancient Law. (A Convent once, which Poverty did profess, Here, here puts off all worldly Pomp and Dress,) And like a Monk a sad Adieu he takes Of all his Friends, and the false World forsakes. But yet ere long, even this humble State, Alas, shall be denied him by his Fate; She drives him forth even from this mean Abode, | Who wanders now a Hermit in the Wood, | Hungry and tir'd, to rest and seek his Food; | The dark and lonely Shade conceals the King, Who feeds on Flowers, and drinks the murmuring Spring; More happy here than on a restless Throne, Cou'd he but call'd those Shades and Springs his own: No longer Fate will that Repose allow, Who even of Earth it self deprives him now. A Tree will hardly here a Seat afford Amidst her Boughs, to her abandon'd Lord. Then (O my Nymphs) you who your Monarch love, To save your Darling, hasten to that Grove; (Nor think I vain Propheticks do express) In silence let each Nymph her Trunk possess; O'er all the Woods and Plants let not a Tree Be uninhabited by a Deity; While I the largest Forest Oak inspire, And with you to this Leafy Court retire. There keep a faithful Watch each night and day, | And with erected Heads the Fields survey, | Lest any impious Soldier pass that way: | And shou'd profanely touch that Pledge of Heaven, Which to our guarding Sahde in charge was given: Here then, my Nymphs, your King you shall receive, And safety in your darkest Coverts give. But ha, what rustick Swain is that I see Sleeping beneath the Shade of yonder Tree, Upon whose knotty Root he leans his Head, And on the Mossy Ground has made his Bed? And why alone? Alas, some Spy I fear, For only such a Wretch would wander here, Who even the Winds and Showers of Rain defies, Out-daring all the Anger of the Skies. Observe his Face, see his disordered Hair Is ruffl'd by the Tempest-beaten Air. Yet look what Tracts of Grief have ag'd his Face, Where hardly twenty years have run their Race, Worn out with numerous Toils; and even in sleep Sighs seem to heave his Brest, his eyes to weep. Nor is that Color of his Face his own, | That sooty Veil, for some Disguise put on, | To keep the Nobler Part from being known; | For 'midst of all—something of Sacred Light | Beams forth and does inform my wondering sight, | And now—arises to my View more bright. | Ha—can my Eyes deceive me, or am I At last no true presaging Deity? Yet if I am, that wretched Rustick Thing, Oh Heavens, and all your Powers, must be the King. —Yes 'tis the King! His Image all Divine Breaks thro' that Cloud of Darkness; and a Shine Gilds all the sooty Vizar!—but alas, Who is't approaches him with such a Pace? Oh—'tis no Traytor, the just Gods I find Have still a pitying Care of Human kind. This is the Gallant, Loyal Carles , thrown (By the same Wreck by which his King's undone.) Beneath our Shades, he comes in Pious Care | (Oh happy Man! than Cromwel happier far | On whom ill Fate this Honor does confer) | He tells the King the Woods are overspread With Villains arm'd to search that Prize, his Head: Now poorly set to sale;—the Foe is nigh, What shall they do? Ah whither shall they fly? They from the danger hasty Counsel took; And by some God inspir'd, ascend my Oak, My Oak, the largest in the faithful Wood; Whom to receive I my glad Branches bow'd, And for the King a Throne prepar'd, and spread My thickest Leaves a Canopy o'er his Head. The Misseltoe commanded to ascend Around his sacred Person to attend, (Oh happy Omen) straight it did obey, The Sacred Misseltoe attends with Joy. Here without fear their prostrate Heads they bow, The King is safe beneath my shelter now; And you, my Nymphs, with awful silence may Your Adorations to your Sovereign pay, And cry, all hail, you most belov'd of Heaven, To whom its chiefest Attributes are given; But above all that God-like Fortitude, That has the Malice of thy Fate subdu'd. All hail! Thou greatest now of Kings indeed, while yet With all the Miseries of life beset, Thy mighty mind cou'd Death nor Danger fear, Nor yet even then of safety cou'd despair. This is the Virtue of a Monarch's Soul, Who above Fortunes reach can all her Turns controul; Thus if Fate rob you of your Empires Sway, You by this Fortitude take hers away; O brave Reprisal! which the Gods prefer, That makes you triumph o'er the Conqueror. The Gods who one day will this Justice do Both make you Victor and Triumpher too. That Day's at hand, O let that Day come on, Wherein that wonderous Miracle shall be shown: May its gay Morn be more than usual bright, And rise upon the World with new created Light; Or let that Star whose dazling Beams were hurl'd Upon his Birth-Day, now inform the World, That brave-bold Constellation, which in sight Of Mid-day's Sun durst lift its Lamp of Light. Now, happy Star again at Mid-day rise, And with new Prodigies adorn the Skies; Great Charles again is born, Monk 's valiant Hand At last delivers the long labouring Land. This is the Month, Great Prince, must bring you forth, May pays her fragrant Tributes at your Birth; This is the Month that's due to you by Fate, O Month most Glorious, Month most Fortunate: When you between your Royal Brothers rode, Amidst your shining Train attended like some God, One would believe that all the World were met To pay their Homage at your Sacred Feet. The wandering Gazers, numberless as these, Or as the Leaves on the vast Forest Trees. He comes! he comes! they cry, while the loud Din Resounds to Heaven and then, Long live the King: And sure the Shouts of their re-echoed Joys Reach'd to the utmost Bounds of distant Seas, Born by the flying Winds thro' yielding Air, And strike the Foreign Shores with awful Fear. O 'tis a wonderous Pleasure to be mad, Such frantick Turns our Nation oft has had. Permit it now ye Stoicks, ne'er till now, The Frenzy you more justly might allow, Since 'tis a joyful Fit that ends the Fears, And wretched Fury of so many years. Nor will the Night her Sable Wings display T'obscure the Lustre of so bright a day. At least the much transported Multitude Permits not the dark Goddess to intrude; The whole Isle seem'd to burn with joyful Flames, Whose Rays gilt all the Face of Neighbouring Thames . But how shall I express the Vulgars Joys, Their Songs, their Feasts, their Laughter and their Cries; How Fountains run with the Vines precious Juice, And such the flowing Rivers shou'd produce, Their Streams the richest Nectar should afford: The Golden Age seems now again restor'd. See—smiling Peace does her bright Face display, | Down thro' the Air serene she cuts her way, | Expels the Clouds, and rises on the Day. | Long exil'd from our Shores, new Joy she brings, Embracing Albion with her Snowy Wings; Nor comes she unattended, but a Throng Of Noble British Matrons brings along. Plenty, fair Fame, and charming Modesty, | Religion, long since fled with Loyalty, | And in a decent Garb the lovely Piety: | Justice from Fraud and Perjury forc'd to fly; Learning, fine Arts, and generous Liberty. Blest Liberty, thou fairest in the Train, And most esteem'd in a just Prince's Reign. With these, as lov'd, Great Mary too return'd, In her own Country who long Exile mourn'd. You, Royal Mother! you, whose only Crime Was loving Charles , and sharing Woes with him. Now Heaven repays, tho slow, yet just and true, For him Revenge, and just Rewards for you. Hail, mighty Queen, form'd by the Pow'rs divine, The Shame of our weak Sex, and Pride of thine, How well have you in either Fortune shown, In either, still your Mind was still your own; The giddy World roll'd round you long in vain, Who fix'd in Virtues Center still remain. And now, just Prince! thou thy great Mind shalt bring To the true weighty Office of a King. The gaping Wounds of War, thy Hand shall cure, Thy Royal Hand, gentle alike, and sure: And by insensible Degrees efface Of foregone Ill the very Scars and Trace. Force to the injur'd Law thou shalt restore, And all that Majesty it own'd before. Thou long corrupted Manners shalt recliaim, And Faith and Honor of the English Name; Thus long-neglected Gardens entertain Their banish'd Master, when returned again All over-run with Weeds he finds, but soon Luxuriant Branches carefully will prune, The weaken'd Arms of the sick Vine he'll raise, And with kind Bands sustain the loosen'd Sprays. Much does he plant, and much extirpate too, And with his Art and Skill make all things new, A work immense, yet sweet, and which in future Days, | When the fair Trees their blooming Glories raise, | The happy Gard'ners Labor over-pays. Cities and Towns, Great Prince, thy Gardens be With Labor cultivated, worthy Thee. In decent Order thou dost all dispose: | Nor are the Woods nor Rural Groves disdain'd; | He who our Wants, who all our Breaches knows, | He all our drooping Fortunes has sustain'd. | As young Colonies of Trees thou dost replace | I' th'empty Realms of our Arboreal Race; | Nay, dost our Reign extend to future Days; | And blest Posterity, supinely laid, Shall feast and revel underneath thy Shade. Cool Summer Arbors then thy Gift shalt be, And their bright Winter Fires they'll owe to thee. To thee those Beams their Palaces sustain, And all their floating Castles on the Main. Who knows, Great Prince, but thou this happy Day For Towns and Navies mayst Foundations lay After a thousand years are roll'd away. Reap thou those mighty Triumphs then which for thee grow, And mighty Triumphs for succeeding Ages sow: Thou Glory's craggy Top shalt first essay, Divide the Clouds, and mark the shining Way; To Fame's bright Temples shalt thy Subjects guide, Thy Britains bold, almost of Night deny'd. The foaming Waves thy dread Commands shall stay, The watry World no Neptune owns but thee, And thy three Kingdoms shall thy Trident be. What Madness O Batavians ! you possest, That the Sea's Scepter you'd from Britain wrest, Which Nature gave, whom she with Floods has crown'd, And fruitful Amphitrite embraces round; The rest o' th'World's just kiss'd by Amphitrite , Albion sh'embraces, all her dear delight. You scarce th'insulting Ocean can restrain, | Nor bear the Assaults of the besieging Main, | Your Graafts and Mounds, and Trenches all in vain. | And yet what fond Ambition spurs you on? You dare attempt to make the Seas your own. O'er the vast Ocean, which no Limit knows, The narrow Laws of Ponds and Fens impose; But Charles his lively Valour this defies, And this the sturdy British Oak denies. O'er empty Seas the fierce Batavian Fleet Sings Triumphs, while there was no Foe to meet. But fear not, Belgian , he'll not tarry long, He'll soon be here, and interrupt thy Song. Too late thou'lt of thy hasty Joys complain, And to thy Native Shores look back in vain. Great James , as soon as the first Whisper came, Prodigal of his Life, and greedy but of Fame, With eager haste returns, as fast as they After the dreadful Fight will run away. And now the Joyful English from afar Approaching saw the floating Belgian War. Hark what a Shout they give, like those who come From long East-Indy Voyage rich loaden home, When first they make the happy British Land, The dear White Rocks, and Albion 's Chalky Strand. The way to all the rest, brave Rupert show'd, And thro' their Fleet cuts out his flaming Road, Rupert , who now had stubborn Fate inclin'd, Heaven on his side engaging, and the Wind: Famous by Land and sea; whose Valor soon Blunts both the horns of the Batavian Moon. Next comes illustrious James , and where he goes, To Cowards leaves the Crowd of vulgar Foes, To th'Royal Sovereign's Deck he seems to grow, Shakes his broad Sword, and seeks an equal Foe. Nor did bold Opdam 's mighty Mind refuse The dreadful Honor which 'twas Death to chuse. Both Admirals with haste for Fight prepare, The rest might stand and gaze; themselves a War. O whither, whither, Opdam , dost thou flie? Can this rash Valor please the pow'rs on high: | It can't, it won't—or woud'st thou proudly die | Bu such a mighty Hand? no Opdam , no: Thy Fate's to perish b'yet a nobler Foe. Heav'n only, Opdam shall thy Conqu'ror be, A Labor worth its while, to conquer thee. Heav'n shall be there, to guard its best lov'd House, And just Revenge inflict on all your broken Vows. The mighty Ship a hundred Canons bore, A hundred Canons which like Thunder roar; Six times as many Men in Shivers torn, E'er one Broadside, or single Shot't had born, Is with a horrid Crack blown up to th'Sky, | In Smoak and Flames o'er all the Ocean nigh, | Torn, half-burnt Limbs of Ships and Seamen scatter'd lie. | Whether a real Bolt from Heav'n was thrown Among the guilty Wretches is not known, Tho likely 'tis; Amboina 's Wickedness, And broken Peace and Oaths deserv'd no less, Or whether fatal Gunpowder it were By some unlucky Spark enkindled there; Even Chance, by Heaven directed, is the Rod, The fiery Shaft of an avenging God, The flaming Wrack the hissing Deep floats o'er, Far, far, away, almost to either shore, Which ev'n from pious Foes wou'd pity draw, A trembling pity, mixt with dreadful aw. But pity yet scarce any room can find, What Noise, what Horror still remains behind? On either side does wild confusion reign, Ship grapples Ship, and sink into the Main. The Orange careless of lost Opdam 's Fate | Will next, To attack victorious James prepare, | Worthy to perish at the self same rate, | But English Guns sufficient Thunder bear; By English Guns, and human Fire o'erpowr'd, 'Tis quickly in the hissing Waves devour'd. Three Ships besides are burnt, if Fame says true, | None of whose baser Names the goddess knew; | As many more the Dolphin did subdue. | Their Decks in Show'rs of kindled Sulphur steep, And send 'em flaming to th'affrighted deep. So burns a City, storm'd and fir'd by night, The Shades are pierc'd with such a dreadful Light; Such dusky Globes of Flame around 'em broke Through the dark Shadow of the Guns and Smoke. Can Fire in Water then such Licence claim? Justly the Water hides it self for shame: The dreadful Wrack outstretching far away Vast Ruins o'er its trembling Bosom lay; Here Masts and Rudders from their Vessels torn, There Sails and Flags across the Waves are born, A thousand floating Bodies there appear, As many half-dead Men lie groaning here. If any where the Sea it self's reveal'd With horrid purple Tracks the azure Wave's conceal'd. All sunk or took, 'twere tedious to relate, And all the sad variety of Fate One day produces—with what Art and Skill | Ev'n chance ingenious seems, to save or kill, | To spare, or to torment who e'er she will, | The vulgar Deaths, below the Muse to heed Not only Faith, but Number too exceed, Three noble Youths by the same sudden Death A brave Example to the World bequeath; Fam'd for high Birth, but Merits yet more high, All at one fatal Moment's Warning die, Torn by one Shot, almost one Body they, Tree Brothers in one Death confounded lay; Who wou'd not Fortune harsh and barbarous call, Yet Fortune was benign and kind withal, For next to these—I tremble still with fear, My Joys disturb'd while such a danger near, Fearless, unhurt, the Royal Adm'ral stood, Stunn'd with the Blow, and sprinkled with their Blood. Fiercer he presses on, while they retir'd, He presses on with Grief, and Anger fir'd. Nor longer can the Belgian Force engage The English Valor, warm'd with double Rage. Breaks with their Losses, and a Cause so ill, Their shatter'd Fleet all the wide Ocean fill, Till trembling Rhine opens his Harbors wide, | Seeing the Wretches from our Thunder fly: | From our hot Chase their shatter'd Fleet he'd hide, | And bends his conquer'd Horns as we go by. | In sacred Rage the Dryad this reveal'd, Yet many future wond'rous things conceal'd, But this to grace some future Bard will serve, For better Poets this the Gods reserve.
