      <field name="heading_text">Canto I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R ash Author, 'tis a vain presumptuous Crime</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To undertake the Sacred Art of Rhyme ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If at thy Birth the Stars that rul'd thy Sence</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shone not with a Poetic Influence :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In thy strait Genius thou wilt still be bound,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Find Phoebus deaf, and Pegasus unsound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You then, that burn with the desire to try</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dangerous Course of charming Poetry ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Forbear in fruitless Verse to lose your time,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or take for Genius the desire of Rhyme :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fear the allurements of a specious Bait,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And well consider your own Force and Weight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nature abounds in Wits of every kind,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And for each Author can a Talent find :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One may in Verse describe an Amorous Flame,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another sharpen a short Epigram :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Waller a Hero's mighty Acts extol ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spencer Sing Rosalind in Pastoral :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Authors that themselves too much esteem,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lose their own Genius, and mistake their Theme ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus in times past * Dubartas vainly Writ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Allaying Sacred Truth with trifling Wit,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Impertinently, and without delight,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Describ'd the Israelites Triumphant Flight,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And following Moses o're the Sandy Plain,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perish'd with Pharaoh in th' Arabian Main.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What-e're you write of Pleasant or Sublime,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Always let sence accompany your Rhyme :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Falsely they seem each other to oppose ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rhyme must be made with Reason's Laws to close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* Dubartas Translated by Sylvester.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when to conquer her you bend your force ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Mind will Triumph in the Noble Course ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Reason's yoke she quickly will incline,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Which, far from hurting, renders her Divine :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, if neglected, will as easily stray,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And master Reason, which she should obey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Love Reason Then : and let what e're you Write</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Borrow from her its Beauty, Force, and Light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most Writers, mounted on a resty Muse,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Extravagant, and Senceless Objects chuse ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They Think they erre, if in their Verse they fall</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On any thought that's Plain, or Natural :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fly this excess ; and let Italians be</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vain Authors of false glitt'ring Poetry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All ought to aim at Sence ; but most in vain</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strive the hard Pass, and slipp'ry Path to gain :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You drown, if to the right or left you stray ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reason to go has often but one way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sometimes an Author, fond of his own Thought,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pursues his Object till it's over-wrought :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If he describes a House, he shews the Face,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And after walks you round from place to place ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here is a Vista , there the Doors unfold,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balcone's here are Ballustred with Gold ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then counts the Rounds and Ovals in the Halls,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* The Festoons, Freezes, and the Astragals :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tir'd with his tedious Pomp, away I run,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And skip o're twenty Pages to be gon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of such Descriptions the vain Folly see,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And shun their barren Superfluity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All that is needless carefully avoid ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Mind once satisfi'd, is quickly cloy'd :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He cannot Write, who knows not to give o're,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To mend one Fault, he makes a hundred more :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* Verse of Scudery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Verse was weak, you turn it much too strong,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And grow Obscure, for far you should be Long.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some are not Gaudy, but are Flat and Dry ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not to be low, another soars too high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you of every one deserve the Praise?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Writing, vary your Discourse, and Phrase ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A frozen Stile, that neither Ebs or Flows,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of pleasing, makes us gape and doze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Those tedious Authors are esteem'd by none</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who tire us, Humming the same heavy Tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Happy, who in his Verse can gently steer,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From Grave, to Light ; from Pleasant, to Severe :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His Works will be admir'd where-ever found,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">All, except trivial points, grew out of date ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Parnassus spoke the Cant of Belinsgate :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boundless and Mad, disorder'd Rhyme was seen :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Disguis'd Apollo chang'd to Harlequin .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Plague, which first in Country Towns began,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cities and Kingdoms. quickly over-ran ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dullest Scriblers some Admirers found,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the * Mock-Tempest was a while renown'd :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But this low stuff the Town at last despis'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And scorn'd the Folly that they once had pris'd ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Distinguish'd Dull, from Natural and Plain,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And left the Villages to Fleckno's Reign.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let not so mean a Stile your Muse debase ;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Spencer did next in Pastorals excel,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And taught the Noble Art of Writing well :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To stricter Rules the Stanza did restrain,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And found for Poetry a richer Veine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then D'Avenant came; who, with a new found Art,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chang'd all, spoil'd all, and had his way apart :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His haughty Muse all others did despise,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Till the Sharp-sighted Critics of the Times</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In their Mock- Gondibert expos'd his Rhimes;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Lawrels he pretended did refuse,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">* Fairfax in his Translation of Godfrey of Bullen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Waller came last, but was the first whose Art</field>

      <field name="fulltext">That of a well-plac'd Word could teach the force,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And shew'd for Poetry a nobler Course :</field>

      <field name="fulltext">If in your Verse you drag, and Sence delay,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My Patience tires, my Fancy goes astray,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And from your vain Discourse I turn my mind,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor search an Author troublesom to find.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is a kind of Writer pleas'd with Sound,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The smoothest Verse, and the exactest Sence</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Displease us, if ill English give offence :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A barb'rous Phrase no Reader can approve ;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In short, without pure Language, what you Write,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Take time for thinking ; never work in hast ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And value not your self for writing fast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A rapid Poem, with such fury writ,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Than from high Banks to hear loud Torrents roar,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With foamy Waters on a Muddy Shore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gently make haste, of Labour not afraid ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A hundred times consider what you've said :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Polish, repolish, every Colour lay,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And sometimes add ; but oft'ner take away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tis not enough, when swarming Faults are writ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That here and there are scattered Sparks of Wit ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each Object must be fix'd in the due place,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The publick Censure for your Writings fear,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And to your self be Critic most severe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fantastic Wits their darling Follies love ;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">That on your Works may look with careful Eyes,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And of your Faults be zealous Enemies :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lay by an Author's Pride and Vanity,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And from a Friend a Flatterer descry,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who seems to like, but means not what he says :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Embrace true Counsel, but suspect false Praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Sycophant will every thing admire ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each Verse, each Sentence sets his Soul on Fire :</field>

      <field name="fulltext">He shakes with Joy, and weeps with Tenderness ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He over-pow'rs you with his mighty Praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Truth never moves in those impetuous ways :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Faithful Friend is careful of your Fame,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And freely will your heedless Errors blame ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He cannot pardon a neglected Line,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Verse to Rule and Order will confine,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reproves of words the too affected found ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the Sence flags and your expression's round</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Fancy tires and your Discourse grows vain,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Terms improper make them just and plain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus 'tis a faithful Friend will freedom use ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Authors, partial to their Darling Muse,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Think to protect it they have just pretence,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And at your Friendly Counsel take offence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Said you of this, that the Expression's flat ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Servant, Sir ; you must excuse me that,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He answers you. This word has here no grace,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pray leave it out : That, Sir's the proper'st place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This Turn I like not : 'Tis approv'd by all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus, resolute not from a fault to fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If there's a Syllable of which you doubt,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis a sure Reason not to blot it out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet still he says you may his Faults confute,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And over him your pow'r is absolute :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But of his feign'd Humility take heed ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tis a Bait lay'd, to make you hear him read :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when he leaves you, happy in his Muse,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Restless he runs some other to abuse,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And often finds ; for in our scribling times</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No Fool can want a Sot to praise his Rhymes :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The flattest work has ever, in the Court,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Met with some Zealous Ass for its support :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And in all times a forward, Scribling Fop</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Has found some greater Fool to cry him up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">End of the first Canto .</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Canto II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pastoral. A s a fair Nymph, when Rising from her bed, With sparkling Diamonds dresses not her head ; But, without Gold, or Pearl, or costly Scents, Gathers from neighb'ring Fields her Ornaments : Such, lovely in its dress, but plain withal, Ought to appear a Perfect Pastoral : Its humble method nothing has of fierce, But hates the ratling of a lofty Verse : There, Native beauty pleases, and excites, And never with harsh Sounds the Ear affrights. But in this stile a Poet often spent, In rage throws by his * Rural Instrument, And vainly, when disorder'd thoughts abound, Amid'st the Eclogue makes the Trumpet Sound : Pan flyes, Alarm'd, into the neighb'ring Woods, And frighted Nymphs dive down into the Floods. Oppos'd to this another, low in stile, Makes Shepherds speak a Language base and vile : His Writings, flat and heavy, without Sound, Kissing the Earth, and creeping on the ground ; You'd swear that Randal , in his Rustick Strains, Again was quav'ring to the Country Swains, And changing, without care of Sound or Dress, Strephon and Phyllis , into Tom and Bess . Twixt these extreams 'tis hard to keep the right ; For Guides take Virgil , and read Theocrite : * Flute Pipe. Be their just Writings, by the Gods inspir'd ; Your constant Pattern, practis'd and admir'd. By them alone you'l easily comprehend How Poets, without shame, may condescend To sing of Gardens, Fields, of Flow'rs, and Fruit, To stir up Shepherds, and to tune the Flute, Of Love's rewards to tell the happy hour, Daphne a Tree, Narcissus made a Flower, And by what means the Eclogue yet has pow'r * To make the Woods worthy a Conqueror : This of their Writings is the grace and flight ; Their risings lofty, yet not out of Sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Elegy . The Elegy , that loves a mournful stile, With unbound hair weeps at a Funeral Pile, * Virg . Eclog. 4. It paints the Lovers Torments, and Delights, A Mistress Flatters, Threatens, and Invites : But well these Raptures if you'l make us see, You must know Love, as well as Poetry. I hate those Lukewarm Authors, whose for'cd Fire In a cold stile describes a hot Desire, That sigh by Rule, and raging in cold blood Their sluggish Muse whip to an Amorous mood : Their feign'd Transports appear but flat and vain ; They always sigh, and alwayes hug their Chain, Adore their Prison, and their Suff'rings bless, Make Sence and Reason quarrel as they please. 'Twas not of old in this affected Tone That Smooth Tibullus made his Amorous moan ; Nor Ovid , when, Instructed from above, By Nature's Rules he, taught the Art of Love. The Heart in Elegies forms the Discourse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ode. The Ode is bolder, and has greater force. Mounting to Heav'n in her Ambitious flight, Amongst the Gods and Heroes takes delight ; Off Pisa's ,Wrestlers tells the Sin'ewy force, And sings the dusty Conqueror's glorious Course : To Simois streams does fierce Achilles bring, And makes the Ganges bow to Britan's King. Sometimes she flies, like an Industrious Bee, And robs the Flow'rs by Nature's Chymistry, Describes the Shepherds Dances, Feasts, and Bliss, And boasts from Phyllis to surprise a Kiss, When gently she resists with feign'd remorse, That what she grants may seem to be by force : Her generous stile at random oft will part, And by a brave disorder shows her Art. Unlike those fearful Poets, whose cold Rhyme In all their Raptures keep exactest time, That sing th'Illustrious Hero's mighty praise (Lean Writers !) by the terms of Weeks and Dayes; And dare not from least Circumstances part, But take all Towns by strictest Rules of Art : Apollo drives those Fops from his abode ; And some have said, that once the humorous God Resolving all such Scriblers to confound For the short Sonnet order'd this strict bound : Set Rules for the just Measure, and the Time, The easy running, and alternate Rhyme; But, above all, those Licenses deny'd Which in these Writings the lame Sence Supply'd ; Forbad an useless Line should find a place, Or a repeated Word appear with grace. A faultless Sonnet, finish'd thus, would be Worth tedious Volumes of loose Poetry. A hundred Scribling Authors, without ground Believe they have this only Phoenix found : When yet th' exactest scarce have two or three Among whole Tomes, from Faults and Censure free. The rest, but little read, regarded less, Are shovel'd to the Pastry from the Press. Closing the Sence within the measur'd time, 'Tis hard to fit the Reason to the Rhyme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epigram. The Epigram , with little art compos'd, Is one good sentence in a Distich clos'd. These points, that by Italians first were priz'd, Our ancient Authors knew not, or despis'd : The Vulgar, dazled with their glaring Light, To their false pleasures quickly they invite ; But publick Favor so increas'd their pride, They overwhelm'd Parnassus with their Tide . The Madrigal at first was overcome, And the proud Sonnet fell by the same Doom ; With these grave Tragedy adorn'd her flights, And mournful Elegy her Funeral Rites : A Hero never fail'd 'em on the Stage, Without this point a Lover durst not rage ; The Amorous Shepherds took more care to prove True to their Point, than Faithful to their Love. Each word, like Janus , had a double face : And Prose, as well as Verse allow'd it place : The Lawyer with Conceits adorn'd his Speech, The Parson without Quibling could not Preach, At last affronted Reason look'd about, And from all serious matters shut 'em out : Declar'd that none should use 'em without Shame, Except a scattering in the Epigram ; Provided that, by Art, and in due time They turn'd upon the Thought, and not the Rhime. Thus in all parts disorders did abate ; Yet Quiblers in the Court had leave to prate : Insipid Jesters, and unpleasant Fools, A Corporation of dull Punning Drolls. 'Tis not, but that sometimes a dextrous Muse May with advantage a turn'd Sence abuse, And, on a word, may trifle with address ; But above all avoid the fond excess, And think not, when your Verse and Sence are lame, With a dull Point to Tag your Epigram. Each Poem his Perfection has apart ; The Brittish Round in plainness shows his Art ; The Ballad, tho the pride of Ancient time, Has often nothing but his humorous Rhyme ; The † Madrigal may softer Passions move, And breath the tender Ecstasies of Love : † An old way of Writing, which began and ended with the same Measure. Desire to show it self, and not to wrong Arm'd Virtue first with Satyr in its Tongue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Satyr. Lucilius was the man who bravely bold, To Roman Vices did this Mirror hold, Protected humble Goodness from reproach, Show'd Worth on foot and Rascals in the Coach : Horace his pleasing Wit to this did add, And none uncensur'd could be Fool, or mad ; Unhappy was that Wretch, whose name might be Squar'd to the Rules of their Sharp Poetry. Persius , obscure, but full of Sence and Wit, Affected brevity in all he writ ! And Juvenal , Learn'd as those times could be, Too far did stretch his sharp Hyperbole ; Tho horrid Truths through all his labors shine, In what he writes there's something of Divine : Whether he blames the Caprean Debauch, Or of Sejanus Fall tells the approach, Or that he makes the trembling Senate come To the stern Tyrant, to receive their Doom ; Or Roman Vice in coursest Habits shews, And paints an Empress reeking from the Stews : In all he Writes appears a noble Fire ; To follow such a Master then desire, Chaucer alone fix'd on this solid Base ; In his old Stile, conserves a modern grace : Too happy, if the freedom of his Rhymes Offended not the method of our Times. The Latin Writers, Decency neglect ; But modern Readers challenge our respect, And at immodest Writings take offence, If clean Expression cover not the Sence. I love sharp Satyr, from obsceneness free ; Not Impudence, that poaches Modesty : Our English , who in Malice never fail, Hence, in Lampoons and Libels, learnt to Rail ; Pleasant Detraction, that by Singing goes From mouth to mouth, and as it marches grows ! Our freedom in our Poetry we see, That Child of Joy, begot by Liberty. But, vain Blasphemer, tremble, when you chuse God for the Subject of your Impious Muse : At last, those Jeasts which Libertines invent Bring the lewd Author to just punishment, Ev'n in a Song there must be Art, and Sence ; Yet sometimes we have seen, that Wine, or Chance Have warm'd cold Brains, and given dull Writers And furnish'd out a Scene for Mr. S— : (Mettle, But for one lucky Hit, that made thee please, Let not thy Folly grow to a Disease, Nor think thy self a Wit ; for in our Age If a warm Fancy does some Fop ingage ; He neither eats or sleeps, till he has Writ, But plagues the World with his Adulterate Wit. Nay, 'tis a wonder, if, in his dire rage, He Prints not his dull Follies for the Stage ; And, in the Front of all his Senceless Plays, Makes * David Logan Crown his head with Bayes. * D. Logan a Graver.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Tragedy. T here's not a Monster bred beneath the Sky But, well dispos'd by Art, may please the Eye: A curious Workman, by his Skill Divine, From an ill Object makes a good Deisgn. Thus, to Delight, as Tragedy, in Tears For * Oedipus , provokes our Hopes, and Fears : For Parricide Orestes asks relief ; And, to encrease our pleasure, causes grief. * Writ by Mr. Dryden. You then, that in this noble Art would rise, Come ; and in lofty Verse dispute the Prize. Would you upon the Stage acquire renown, And for your Judges summon all the Town ? Would you your Works for ever should remain, And, after Ages past, be fought again ? In all you Write, observe with Care and Art To move the Passions, and incline the Heart. If, in a labour'd Act, the pleasing Rage Cannot our Hopes and Fears by turns ingage, Nor in our mind a feeling Pity raise ; In vain with Learned Scenes you fill your Plays : Your cold Discourse can never move the mind Of a stern Critic, natu'rally unkind ; Who, justly tir'd with your Pedantic flight, Or falls asleep, or censures all you Write. The Secret is, Attention first to gain ; To move our minds, and then to entertain : That, from the very op'ning of the Scenes, The first may show us what the Author means I'm tir'd to see an Actor on the Stage That knows now whether he's to Laugh, or Rage ; Who, an Intrigue unravelling in vain, Instead of pleasing, keeps my mind in pain : I'de rather much the nauseous Dunce should say Downright, my name is Hector in the Play ; Than with a Mass of Miracles, ill joyn'd, Confound my Ears, and not instruct my Mind. The Subject's never soon enough exprest ; Your place of Action must be fix'd, and rest. A Spanish Poet may, with good event, In one day's space whole Ages represent ; There oft the Hero of a wandring State Begins a Child, and ends the Play of Age : But we, that are by Reason's Rules confin'd, Will, that with Art the Poem be design'd, That unity of Action, Time, and Place Keep the Stage full, and all our Labors grace. Write not what cannot be with ease conceiv'd ; Som Truths may be too strong to be believ'd. A foolish Wonder cannot entertain : My mind's not mov'd, if your Discourse be vain. You may relate, what would offend the Eye : Seeing, indeed, would better satisfy ; But there are objects,, that a curious Art Hides from the Eyes, yet offers to the Heart. The mind is most agreably surpris'd, When a well-woven Subject, long disguis'd, You on a sudden artfully unfold, And give the whole another face, and mould. * At first the Tragedy was void of Art ; A Song ; where each man Danc'd, and Sung his Part, * The beginning and progress of Tragedies. And of God Bacchus roaring out the praise Sought a good Vintage for their Jolly dayes : Then Wine, and Joy, were seen in each man's Eyes, And a fat Goat was the best Singer's prize. Thespis was first, who, all besmear'd with Lee, Began this pleasure for Posterity : And, with his Carted Actors, and a Song, Amus'd the People as he pass'd along. Next, AEschylus the diff'rent Persons plac'd, And with a better Masque his Players grac'd : Upon a Theater his Verse express'd, And show'd his Hero with a Buskin dress'd. Then Sophocles , the Genius of his Age, Increas'd the Pomp, and Beauty of the Stage, Ingag'd the Chorus Song in every part, And polish'd rugged Verse by Rules of Art : He, in the Greek , did those perfections gain Which the weak Latin never could attain. Our pious Fathers, in their Priest-rid Age, As Impious, and Prophane, abhorr'd the Stage : A Troop of silly Pilgrims, as 'tis said, Foolishly zealous, scandalously Play'd (Instead of Heroes, and of Love's complaints) The Angels, God, the Virgin, and the Saints. At last, right Reason did his Laws reveal, And show'd the Folly of their ill-plac'd Zeal, Slienc'd those Nonconformists of the Age, And rais'd the lawful Heroes of the Stage : Only th' Athenian Masque was lay'd aside, And Chorus by the Musick was supply'd. Ingenious Love, inventive in new Arts, Mingled in Playes, and quickly touch'd our Hearts: This Passion never could resistance find, But knows the shortest passage to the mind. Paint then, I'm pleas'd my Hero be in Love ; But let him not like a tame Shepherd move : Let not Achilles be like Thyrsis seen, Or for a Cyrus show an * Artamen ; That, strugling oft, his Passions we may find, The Frailty, not the Virtue of his mind. Of Romance Heroes shun the low Design ; Yet to great Hearts some Human frailties joyn : Achilles must with Homer's heat ingage ; For an affront I'm pleas'd to see him rage. Those little Failings in your Hero's heart Show that of Man and Nature he has part : To leave known Rules you cannot be allow'd ; Make Agamemnon covetous, and proud, Æneas in Religious Rites austere, Keep to each man his proper Character. Of Countryes and of Times the humors know; From diff'rent Climates, diff'ring Customs grow : And strive to shun their fault, who vainly dress An Antique Hero like some modern Ass; Artamen, the name of Cyrus in Scuderies Romance . Who make old Romans like our English move, Show Cato Sparkish, or make Brutus Love. In a Romance those errors are excus'd : There 'tis enough that, Reading, we're amus'd : Rules too severe would then be useless found ; But the strict Scene must have a juster bound : Exact Decorum we must always find. If then you form some Hero in your mind, Be sure your Image with itself agree ; For what he first appears, he still must be. Affected Wits will nat'urally incline To paint their Figures by their own design : Your Bully Poets, Bully Heroes write ; Chapman , in Buffy D'Ambois took delight, And thought perfection was to Huff, and Fight. Wise Nature by variety does please ; Cloath diff'ring Passions in a diff'ring Dress : Bold Anger, in rough haughty words appears ; Sorrow is humble, and dissolves in Tears. Make not your * Hecuba with fury rage, And show a Ranting grief upon the Stage ; Or tell in vain how the rough Tanais bore His seven-fold Waters to the Euxine Shore : These swoln expressions, this affected noise Shows like some Pedant, that declaims to Boys. In sorrow, you must softer methods keep ; And, to excite our tears, your self must weep : Those noisy words with which ill Plays abound, Come not from hearts that are in sadness drown'd. The Theatre for a young Poet's Rhymes Is a bold venture in our knowing times : An Author cannot eas'ly purchase Fame ; Critics are always apt to hiss, and blame : You may be Judg'd by every Ass in Town, The Priviledge is bought for half a Crown. To please, you must a hundred Changes try ; Sometimes be humble, then must soar on high : * Seneca Trag. In noble thoughts must every where abound, Be easy, pleasant, solid, and profound : To these you must surprising Touches joyn, And show us a new wonder in each Line ; That all in a just method well design'd, May leave a strong Impression in the mind, These are the Arts that Tragedy maintain :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epic. But the Heroic claims a Loftier Strain. In the Narration of some great Design, Invention, Art, and Fable all must joyn : Here Fiction must employ its utmost grace ; All must assume a Body, Mind, and Face : Each Virtue a Divinity is seen ; Prudence is Pallas , Beauty Paphos Queen. 'Tis not a Cloud from whence swift Lightnings fly; But Jupiter , that thunders from the Sky : Nor a rough Storm, that gives the Sailor pain ; But angry Neptune , plowing up the Main : Echo's no more an empty Airy Sound ; But a fair Nymph that weeps, her Lover drown'd. Thus in the endless Treasure of his mind, The Poet does a thousand Figures find, Around the work his Ornaments he pours, And Strows with lavish hand his op'ning Flow'rs. 'Tis not a wonder if a Tempest bore The Trojan Fleet against the Libyan Shore ; From faithless Fortune this is no surprise, For every day 'tis common to our eyes ; But angry Juno , that she might destroy, And overwhelm the rest of ruin'd Troy : That Æolus with the fierce Goddess joyn'd, Op'ned the hollow Prisons of the Wind ; Till angry Neptune , looking o're the Main, Rebukes the Tempest, calms the Waves again, Their Vessels from the dang'rous rous quick-sands steers; These are the Springs that move our hopes and fears Without these Ornaments before our Eyes, Th' unsinew'd Poem languishes, and dyes : Your Poet in his art will always fail, And tell you but a dull insipid Tale. In vain have our mistaken Authors try'd These ancient Ornaments to lay aside, Thinking our God, and Prophets that he sent, Might Act like those the Poets did invent, To fright poor Readers in each Line with Hell, And talk of Satan, Ashtaroth , and Bel ; The Mysteries which Christians must believe, Disdain such shifting Pageants to receive : The Gospel offers nothing to our thoughts But penitence, or punishment for faults ; And mingling falshoods with those Mysteries, Would make our Sacred Truths appear like Lyes. Besides, what pleasure can it be to hear, The howlings of repining Lucifer , Whose rage at your imagin'd Hero flyes, And oft with God himself disputes the prize ? Tasso , you'l say, has done it with applause ; It is not here I mean to Judge his Cause : Yet, tho our Age has so extoll'd his name, His Works had never gain'd immortal Fame, If holy Godfrey in his Ecstasies Had only Conquer'd Satan on his knees ; If Tancred , and Armida's pleasing form, Did not his melancholy Theme adorn. 'Tis not, that Christian Poems ought to be Fill'd with the Fictions of Idolatry ; But in a common Subject to reject The Gods, and Heathen Ornaments neglect ; To banish Tritons who the Seas invade, To take Pan's Whistle, or the Fates degrade, To hinder Charon in his leaky Boat To pass the Shepherd with the Man of Note, Is with vain Scruples to disturb your mind, And search Perfection you can never find : As well they may forbid us to present Prudence or Justice for an Ornament, To paint old Janus with his front of Brass, And take from Time his Scythe, his Wings and Glass, And every where, as't were Idolatry, Banish Descriptions from our Poetry. Leave 'em their pious Follys to pursue ; But let our Reason such vain fears subdue : And let us not, amongst our Vanities, Of the true God create a God of Lyes. In Fable we a thousand pleasure see, And the smooth names seem made for Poetry ; As Hector , Alexander , Helen , Phillis , Ulysses , Agamemnon , and Achilles : In such a Crowd, the Poet were to blame To chuse King Chilperic for his Hero's name. Sometimes, the name being well or ill apply'd, Will the whole Fortune of your Work decide. Would you your Reader never should be tir'd ? Choose some great Hero, fit to be admir'd, In Courage signal, and in Virtue bright, Let ev'n his very failings give delight ; Let his great Actions our attention bind, Like Cæsar , or like Scipio , frame his mind, And not like Oedipus his perjur'd Race ; A common Conqueror is a Theme too base. Chuse not your Tale of Accidents too full ; Too much variety may make it dull : Achilles rage alone, when wrought with skill, Abundantly does a whole Iliad fill, Be your Narrations lively, short, and smart ; In your Descriptions show your noblest Art : There 'tis your Poetry may be employ'd ; Yet you must trivial Accidents avoid. Nor imitate that * Fool, who, to describe The wondrous Marches of the Chosen Tribe, Plac'd on the sides, to see their Armyes pass, The Fishes staring through the liquid Glass ; Describ'd a Child, who with his little hand, Pick'd up the shining Pebbles from the sand. Such objects are too mean to stay our fight ; Allow your Work a just and nobler flight. Be your beginning plain ; and take good heed Too soon you mount not on the Airy Steed : Nor tell your Reader, in a Thundr'ing Verse, † I sing the Conqueror of the Universe. What can an Author after this produce ? The lab'ring Mountain must bring forth a Mouse. * St. Amant . † The first line of Scuderies Alaric. Much better are we pleas'd with his * Address Who, without making such vast promises, Sayes, in an easier Stile and plainer Sence, “ I Sing the Combats of that pious Prince “ Who from the Phrygian Coast his Armies bore, “ And landed first on the Lavinian shore. His op'ning Muse sets not the World on fire, And yet performs more than we can require : Quickly you'l hear him celebrate the same, And future glory of the Roman Name ; Of Styx and Acheron describe the Floods, And Cæsars wandring in th' Elysian Woods : With Figures numberless his Story grace, And every thing in beauteous Colours trace. At once you may be pleasing, and sublime ; I hate a heavy melancholy Rhyme : * Virgils Eneids . I'de rather read Orlando's Comic Tale, Than a dull Author always stiff and stale, Who thinks himself dishonour'd in his stile, If on his Works the Graces do but smile. 'Tis said, that Homer , Matchless in his Art, Stole Venus Girdle, to ingage the Heart : His Works indeed vast Treasures do unfold, And whatsoe're he touches, turns to Gold : All in his hands new beauty does acquire ; He always pleases, and can never tire. A happy Warmth he every where may boast ; Nor is he in too long Digressions lost : His Verses without Rule a method find, And of themselves appear in order joyn'd : All without trouble answers his intent ; Each Syllable is tending to th' Event. Let his example your indeavours raise : To love his Writings, is a kind of praise. A Poem, where we all perfections find, Is not the work of a Fantastick mind : There must be Care, and Time, and Skill, and Pains ; Not the first heat of unexperienc'd Brains. Yet sometimes Artless Poets, when the rage Of a warm Fancy does their minds ingage, Puff'd with vain pride, presume they understand, And boldly take the Trumpet in their hand; Their Fustian Muse each Accident confounds ; Nor can she fly, but rise by leaps and bounds, Till their small stock of Learning quickly spent, Their Poem dyes for want of nourishment : In vain Mankind the hot-brain'd fools decryes, No branding Censures can unveil his eyes ; With Impudence the Laurel they invade; Resolv'd to like the Monsters they have made. Virgil , compar'd to them, is flat and dry ; And Homer understood not Poetry : Against their merit if this Age Rebel, To future times for Justice they appeal. But waiting till Mankind shall do'em right, And bring their Works Triumphantly to Light ; Neglected heaps we in by-corners lay, Where they become to Worms and Moths a prey; Forgot, in Dust and Cobwebs let 'em rest, Whilst we return from whence we first digrest. The great Success which Tragic Writers found, In Athens first the Comedy renown'd, Th' abusive Grecian there, by pleasing wayes, Dispers'd his natu'ral malice in his Playes : Wisdom, and Virtue, Honor, Wit, and Sence, Were Subject to Buffooning insolence : Poets were publickly approv'd, and sought, That Vice extol'd, and Virtue set at naught ; And Socrates himself, in that loose Age, Was made the Pastime of a Scoffing Stage. At last the Public took in hand the Cause, And cur'd this Madness by the pow'r of Laws ; Forbad at any time, or any place, To name the Person, or describe the Face. The Stage its ancient Fury thus let fall, And Comedy diverted without Gall : By mild reproofs, recover'd minds diseas'd, And, sparing Persons, innocently pleas'd. Each one was nicely shown in this new Glass, And smil'd to think He was not meant the Ass : Miser oft would laugh the first, to find A faithful Draught of his own sordid mind ; And Fops were with such care and cunning writ, They lik'd the Piece for which themselves did sit. You then, that would the Comic Lawrels wear, To study Nature be your only care : Who e're knows man, and by a curious art Discerns the hidden secrets of the heart ; He who observes, and naturally can Paint The Jealous Fool, the fawning Sycophant, A Sober Wit, an enterprising Ass, A humorous Otter , or a Hudibras ; May safely in these noble Lists ingage, And make 'em Act and Speak upon the Stage : Strive to be natural in all you Write, And paint with Colours that may please the Sight. Nature in various Figures does abound ; And in each mind are diff'rent Humors found : A glance, a touch, discovers to the wise ; But every man has not discerning eyes. All-changing Time does also change the mind ; And diff'rent Ages, diff'rent pleasures find : Youth, hot and furious, cannot brook delay, By flattering Vice is eas'ly led away ; Vain in discourse, inconstant in desire, In Censure, rash ; in pleasures, all on fire. The Manly age does steadier thoughts enjoy ; Pow'r, and Ambition do his Soul employ : Against the turns of Fate he sets his mind ; And by the past the future hopes to find. Decrepit Age, still adding to his Stores, For others heaps the Treasure he adores. In all his actions keeps a frozen pace ; Past Times extols, the present to debase : Incapable of pleasures Youth abuse, In others blames, what age does him refuse. Your Actors must by Reason be control'd ; Let young men speak like young, old men like old : Observe the Town, and study well the Court ; For thither various Characters resort : Thus 'twas great Johnson purchas'd his renown, And in his Art had born away the Crown ; If less desirous of the Peoples praise, He had not with low Farce debas'd his Playes ; Mixing dull Buffoonry with Wit refin'd, And Harlequin with noble Terence joyn'd. When in the Fox I see the Tortois hist, I lose the Author of the Alchymist. The Comic Wit, born with a smiling Air, Must Tragic grief, and pompous Verse forbear ; Yet may he not, as on a Market-place, With Baudy jests amuse the Populace : With well-bred Conversation you must please, And your Intrigue unravel'd be with ease : Your Action still should Reason's Rules obey, Nor in an empty Scene may lose its way. Your humble Stile must sometimes gently rise ; And your Discourse Sententious be, and Wise : The Passions must to Nature be confin'd, And Scenes to Scenes with Artful weaving joyn'd Your Wit must not unseasonably play ; But follow Bus'ness, never lead the way. Observe how Terence does this error shun; A careful Father chides his Am'orous Son : Then see that Son, whom no advice can move, Forget those Orders, and pursue his Love : 'Tis not a well-drawn Picture we discover ; Tis a true son, a Father, and a Lover. I like an Author that Reforms the Age ; And keeps the right Decorum of the Stage, That alwayes pleases by just Reason's Rule : But for a tedious Droll, a Quibling Fool, Who with low nauseous Baudry fills his Plays ; Let him begon and on two Tressels raise Some Smithfield Stage, where he may act his Pranks And make Jack Puddings speak to Mountebanks.

      <field name="fulltext">Chuse a sure Judge to Censure what you Write,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whose Reason leads, &amp; Knowledge gives you light,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whose steady hand will prove your Faithful Guide,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And touch the darling follies you would hide :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He, in your doubts, will carefully advise,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And clear the Mist before your feeble eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis he will tell you, to what noble height</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A generous Muse may sometimes take her flight ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When, too much fetter'd with the Rules of Art,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May from her stricter Bounds and Limits part :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But such a perfect Judge is hard to see,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And every Rhymer knows not Poetry ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nay some there are, for Writing Verse extol'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who know not Lucan's Dross from Virgil's Gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you in this great Art acquire Renown ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authors, observe the Rules I here lay down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In prudent Lessons every where abound;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With pleasant, joyn the useful and the sound :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Sober Reader, a vain Tale will flight ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seeks as well Instruction, as Delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let all your Thoughts to Virtue be confin'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still off'ring noble Figures to our Mind :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I like not those loose Writers, who employ</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their guilty Muse, good Manners to destroy ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who with false Colours still deceive our Eyes,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And show us Vice dress'd in a fair Disguise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet do I not their sullen Muse approve</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who from all modest Writings banish Love ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That strip the Play-house of its chief Intrigue,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And make a Murderer of Roderigue :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* The lightest Love, if decently exprest,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Will raise no Vitious motions in our brest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dido in vain may weep, and ask relief;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I blame her Folly, whil'st I share her Grief .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">* The Cid . Translated into English .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Virtuous Author, in his Charming Art,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To please the Sense needs not corrupt the Heart ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His heat will never cause a guilty Fire :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To follow Virtue then be your desire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In vain your Art and Vigor are exprest ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Th' obscene expression shows th' Infected breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But above all,, base Jealousies avoid,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In which detracting Poets are employ'd :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A noble Wit dares lib'rally commend ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And scorns to grudge at his deserving Friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Base Rivals, who true Wit and Merit hate,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Caballing still against it with the Great ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let not your only bus'ness be to Write ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Be Virtuous, Just, and in your Friends delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis not enough your Poems be admir'd ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But strive your Conversation be desir'd :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write for immortal Fame ; nor ever chuse</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gold for the object of a gen'erous Muse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I know a noble Wit may, without Crime,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Receive a lawful Tribute for his time :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet I abhor those Writers, who despise</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their Honor ; and alone their Profit prize ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who their Apollo basely will degrade,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And of a noble Science, make a Trade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before kind Reason did her Light display,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Government taught Mortals to obey,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Men, like wild beasts, did Nature's Laws pursue,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They fed on Herbs, and drink from Rivers drew ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their Brutal force, on Lust and Rapine bent,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Committed Murders without Punishment :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reason at last, by her all-conquering Arts,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reduc'd these Savages, and Tun'd their hearts ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mankind from Bogs, and Woods and Caverns calls,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Towns and Cities fortifies with Walls :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus fear of Justice made proud Rapine cease,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And shelter'd Innocence by Laws and Peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These benefits from Poets we receiv'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From whence are rais'd those Fictions since believ'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That Orpheus , by his soft Harmonious strains</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tam'd the fierce Tigers of the Thracian Plains ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Amphion's Notes, by their melodious pow'rs,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Drew Rocks &amp; Woods, and rais'd the Theban Tow'rs :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These Miracles from numbers did arise,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since which, in Verse Heav'n taught his Mysteries,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And by a Priest, possess'd with rage Divine,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Apollo spoke from his Prophetick Shrine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Soon after Homer the old Heroes prais'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And noble minds by great Examples rais'd ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Hesiod did his Græcian Swains incline</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To till the Fields, and prune the bounteous Vine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus useful Rules were by the Poets aid,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In easy numbers, to rude men convey'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And pleasingly their Precepts did impart ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First Charm'd the Ear, and then ingag'd the Heart :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Muses thus their Reputation rais'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And with just Gratitude in Greece were prais'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With pleasure Mortals did their Wonders see,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Sacrific'd to their Divinity :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Want, at last base Flatt'ry entertain'd,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And old Parnassus with this Vice was stain'd :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Desire of gain dazling the Poets Eyes,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Works were fill'd with fulsome flatteries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus needy Wits a vile revenue made,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Verse became a mercenary Trade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Debase not with so mean a Vice thy Art :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If Gold must be the Idol of thy heart,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fly, fly th' unfruitful Heliconian strand,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Those streams are not inrich'd with Golden Sand :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Great Wits, as well as Warriors, only gain</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurels and Honors for their Toyl and Pain :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, what ? an Author cannot live on Fame,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or pay a Reck'ning with a lofty Name :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Poet to whom Fortune is unkind,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who when he goes to bed has hardly din'd ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Takes little pleasure in Parnassus Dreams,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or relishes the Heliconian streams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Horace had Ease and Plenty when he writ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And free from cares for money or for meat,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did not expect his dinner from his wit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis true ; but Verse is cherish'd by the Great,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And now none famish who deserve to eat :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What can we fear, when Virtue, Arts, and Sence</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Receive the Stars propitious Influence ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When a sharp-sighted Prince, by early Grants</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rewards your Merits, and prevents your Wants ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sing then his Glory, Celebrate his Fame ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your noblest Theme is his immortal Name,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let mighty Spencer raise his reverend head,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cowley and Denham start up from the dead ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Waller his age renew, and Off'rings bring,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Monarch's praise let bright-ey'd Virgins sing ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let Dryden with new Rules our Stage refine,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And his great Models form by this Design :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But where's a Second Virgil , to Rehearse</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Hero's Glories in his Epic Verse ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What Orpheus sing his Triumphs o'er the Main,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And make the Hills and Forests move again ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Show his bold Fleet on the Batavian shore,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Holland trembling as his Canons roar;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paint Europe's Balance in his steady hand,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whilst the two Worlds in expectation stand</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of Peace or War, that wait on his Command ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, as I speak, new Glories strike my Eyes,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Glories, which Heav'n it Self does give, and prize,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Blessings of Peace ; that with their milder Rayes</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Adorn his Reign, and bring Saturnian Dayes:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now let Rebellion, Discord, Vice, and Rage,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That have in Patriots Forms debauch'd our Age,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vanish, with all the Ministers of Hell ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His Rayes their poys'nous Vapors shall dispel :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">'Tis He alone our safety did create,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His own firm Soul secur'd the Nation's Fate,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oppos'd to all the boutseaus of the State.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Authors, for Him your great indeavours raise ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The loftiest Numbers will but reach his praise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For me, whose Verse in Satyr has been bred,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And never durst Heroic Measures tread ;</field>
