      <field name="heading_text">A FRIENDLY WARNING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary Adams, you're a fool!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The single dimple in a smooth red cheek smiled in answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're repeating yourself, Jane — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't give him one hour's time for just three sittings?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a second for one sitting — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hopeless!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary smiled provokingly, her white teeth gleaming in obstinate good humor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's the most distinguished artist in America — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've heard so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would be a liberal education for a girl of your training to know such a man — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll omit that course of instruction."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The younger woman was silent a moment, and a flush of anger slowly mounted her temples. The blue eyes were fixed reproachfully on her friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You really thought that I would pose?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hoped so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Alone with a man in his studio for hours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane Anderson lifted her dark brows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no, I hardly expected that! I'm sure he would take his easel and palette out into the square in front of the Plaza Hotel and let you sit on the base of the Sherman monument. The crowds would cheer and inspire him — bah! Can't you have a little common-sense? There are a few brutes among artists, as there are in all professions — even among the superintendents of your schools. Gordon's a great creative genius. If you'd try to flirt with him, he'd stop his work and send you home. You'd be as safe in his studio as in your mother's nursery. I've known him for ten years. He's the gentlest, truest man I've ever met. He's doing a canvas on which he has set his whole heart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He can get professional models."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For his usual work, yes — but this is the head of the Madonna. He saw you walking with me in the Park last week and has been to my studio a half-dozen times begging me to take you to see him. Please, Mary dear, do this for my sake. I owe Gordon a debt I can never pay. He gave me the cue to the work that set me on my feet. He was big and generous and helpful when I needed a friend. He asked nothing in return but the privilege of helping me again if I ever needed it. You can do me an enormous favor — please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary Adams rose with a gesture of impatience, walked to her window and gazed on the torrent of humanity pouring through Twenty-third Street from the beehives of industry that have changed this quarter of New York so rapidly in the last five years. She turned suddenly and confronted her friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How could you think that I would stoop to such a thing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stoop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," she snapped, " — pose for an artist! I'd as soon think of rushing stark naked through Twenty-third Street at noon!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The older woman looked at her flushed face, suppressed a sharp answer, broke into a fit of laughter and threw her arms around Mary's neck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honey, you're such a hopeless little fool, you're delicious! You know that I love you — don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pretty lips quivered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could I possibly ask you to do a thing that would harm a single brown hair of your head?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The firm hand of the older girl touched a rebellious lock with tenderness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not, from your point of view, Jane dear," the stubborn lips persisted. "But you see it's not my point of view. You're older than I — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hoity toity, Miss! I'm just twenty-eight and you're twenty-four. Age is not measured by calendars these days."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean that," the girl apologized. "But you're an artist. You're established and distinguished. You belong to a different world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane Anderson laid her hand softly on her friend's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just it, dear. I do belong to a different world — a big new world of whose existence you are not quite conscious. You are living in the old, old world in which women have groped for thousands of years. I don't mind confessing that I undertook this job of getting you to pose for Gordon for a double purpose. I wished to do something to repay the debt I owe him — but I wished far more to be of help to you. You're living in the Dark Ages, and it's a dangerous thing for a pretty girl to live in the Dark Ages and date her letters from New York to-day — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't understand you in the least."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'm afraid you never will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused suddenly and changed her tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me now, are you happy in your work?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm earning sixty dollars a month — my position is secure — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But are you happy in it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't expect to teach school all my life," was the vague answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly. You loathe the sight of a school-room. You do the task they set you because your father's a clergyman and can't support his big family. You're waiting and longing for the day of your deliverance — isn't it so?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that day of deliverance?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will come when I meet my Fate!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll meet him, too!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane Anderson shook her fine head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And may the Lord have mercy on your poor little soul when you do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why, pray?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because you're the most helpless and defenseless of all the things He created."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've managed to take pretty good care of myself so far."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you will — until the thunderbolt falls."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The thunderbolt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Until you meet your Fate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll have someone to look after me then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll hope so anyhow," was the quick retort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But can't you see, Jane dear, that we look at life from such utterly different angles. You glory in your work. It's your inspiration — the breath you breathe. I don't believe in women working for money. I don't believe God ever meant us to work when He made us women. He made us women for something more wonderful. I don't see anything good or glorious in the fact that half the torrent of humanity you see down there pouring through the street from those factories and offices is made up of women. They are wage-earners — so much the worse. They are forcing the scale of wages for men lower and lower. They are paying for it in weakened bodies and sickly, hopeless children. We should not shout for joy; we should cry. God never meant for woman to be a wage-earner!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sob caught her voice and she paused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The artist watched her emotion with keen interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Neither do I believe that God means to force woman at last to do the tasks of man. But she's doing them, dear — and it must be so until a brighter day dawns for humanity. The new world that opens before us will never abolish marriage, but it has opened our eyes to know what it means. You refuse to open yours. You refuse to see this new world about you. I've begged you to join one of my clubs. You refuse. I beg you to meet and know such men of genius as Gordon — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As an artist's model!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the only way on earth you can meet him. You stick to your narrow, hide-bound conventional life and dream of the Knight who will suddenly appear some day out of the mists and clouds. You dream of the Fate God has prepared for you in His mysterious Providence. It's funny how that idea persists even today in novels. As a matter of fact we know that the old-fashioned girl met her Fate because her shrewd mother planned the meeting — planned it with cunning and stratagem. You're alone in a great modern city, with all the conditions of the life of the old regime reversed or blotted out. Your mother is not here. And if she were, her schemes to bring about the mysterious meeting of the Fates would be impossible. You outgrew the limits of your village life. Your highly trained mind landed you in New York. You've fought your way to a competent living in five years and kept yourself clean and unspotted from the world. Granted. But how many men have you met who are your equals in culture and character?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane paused and held Mary's gaze with steady persistence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many — honest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None as yet," she confessed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you live in the one fond, imperishable hope! It's the only thing that keeps you alive and going — this idea of your Fate. It's an obsession — this mysterious Knight somewhere in the future riding to meet you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll find him, never fear," the girl laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you will. You'll make him out of whole cloth if it's necessary. Our ideals are really the same when you come to analyze my wider outlook."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The artist paused and laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The same?" the girl asked incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly. Mine is based on intelligence, however — yours on blind instinct perverted and twisted by the idiotic fiction you read morning, noon and night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see it," Mary answered emphatically. "Your ideal is fame, achievement, the applause of the world — mine just a home and a baby — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that's all you know about me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't it true?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been in this room five years, haven't you?" the older girl asked musingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And though you've kept your lamp trimmed and burning, you haven't yet seen a man whom you could recognize as your equal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm only twenty-four."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In these five years I've met a hundred men my equal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And smashed the conventions of Society whenever you saw fit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Without breaking a single law of reason or common-sense. In the meantime I've met two men who have really made love to me. I thought I loved one of them — until I met the other. The second proved himself to be an unprincipled scoundrel. If I had held your views of life and hated my work, I would have married this man and lived to awake in a prison whose only door was Death. But I loved my work. Life meant more than one man who was not worth an hour's tears. I turned to my studio and he slipped back into the gutter where he belonged. I'll meet my Fate some day, too, dear. I'm waiting and watching — but with clear eyes and unafraid. I'll know mine when he comes, I shall not be blinded by passion or the fear of drudgery. Can't you see this bigger world of realities?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dimple flashed again in the smooth red cheek.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's not for me, Jane. I'm just a modest little home body. I'll bide my time — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And eat your foolish heart out here between the narrow walls of this cell you've built for yourself. I should think you'd die living here alone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl flushed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not lonely — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't fib! I know better. Your birds and kitten occupy daily about thirty minutes of the time that's your own. What do you do with the rest of it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit by my window, watch the crowds stream through the streets below, read and dream and think — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — read love stories and dream about your Knight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's morbid and unhealthy. You've hedged yourself about with the old conventions and imagine you're safe — and you are — until you meet him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll know how to behave — never fear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean you'll know how instantly to blindfold, halter and lead him to the Little Church Around the Corner?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary moved uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what else should I do with him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Compare him with other men. Weigh him in the balances of a remorseless common-sense. Study him under a microscope and keep your reason clear. The girl who rushes into marriage in a great city under the conditions in which you and I live is a fool. More girls are ruined in New York by marriage than by any other process. The thunderbolt out of the blue hasn't struck you yet, but when it does — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you, Jane."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you, honestly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question was asked with wistful tenderness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I promise. And you mustn't think I don't appreciate this visit and the chance you've given again to enter the `big world' you're always telling me about. I just can't do it, dear. It's not my world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, my little foolish virgin, have it your own way. When you're lonely, run up to my studio to see me. I won't ask you to pose or meet any of the dangerous men of my circle. We'll lock the doors and have a snug time all by ourselves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll remember."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clock in the Metropolitan Tower chimed the hour of five, and Jane Anderson rose with a quick, business-like movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't hurry," Mary protested. "I know I've been stubborn, but I've been so happy in your coming. I do get lonely — frightfully lonely, sometimes — don't think I'm ungrateful — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're dangerously beautiful, child," the artist said, with enthusiasm. "And remember that I love you — no matter how silly you are — good-by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't stay for a cup of tea? I meant to ask you an hour ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I've an engagement with a dreadful man whom I've no idea of ever marrying. I'm going to dinner with him — just to study the animal at dose range."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a jolly laugh and quick, firm step she was gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary snatched the kitten from his snug bed between the pillows of the window-seat and pressed his fuzzy head under her chin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She tempted us terribly, Kitty darling, but we didn't let her find out — did we? You know deep down in your cat's soul that I was just dying to meet the distinguished Gordon — but such high honors are not for home bodies like you and me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She dropped on the seat and closed her eyes for a long time. The kitten watched her wonderingly sure of a sudden outbreak with each passing moment. Two soft paws at last touched her cheeks and two bright eyes sought in vain for hers. The little nose pressed closer and kissed the drooping eyelids until they opened. He curled himself on her bosom and began to sing a gentle lullaby. For a long while she lay and listened to the music of love with which her pet sought to soothe the ache within.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clock in the tower chimed six.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her body and placed her head on a pillow beside the window. The human torrent below was now at its flood. Two streams of humanity flowed eastward along each broad sidewalk. Hundreds were pouring in endless procession across Madison Square. The cars in Broadway north and South were jammed. Every day she watched this crowd hurrying, hurrying away into the twilight — and among all its hundreds of thousands not an eye was ever lifted to hers — not one man or woman among them cared whether she lived or died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was horrible, this loneliness of the desert in an ocean of humanity! For the past year it had become an increasing horror to look into the silent faces of this crowd of men and women and never feel the touch of a friendly hand or hear the sound of a human voice in greeting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet this endless procession held for her a supreme fascination. Somewhere among its myriads of tramping feet, walked the one man created for her. She no more doubted this than she doubted God Himself. It was His law. He had ordained it so. She had grown so used to the throngs below her window and so loved the little park with its splashing fountain that she had refused to follow her landlady uptown when the brownstone boarding-house facing the Square had been turned into a studio building.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instead of moving she had wheedled the landlord into allowing her to cut off a small space from her room for a private bath and kitchenette, built a box couch across the window large enough for a three-quarter mattress and covered it with velour. For five dollars a week she had thus secured a little home in which was combined a sitting-room, bed-room, bath and kitchenette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It had its drawbacks, of course. The Professor downstairs who taught music sometimes gave a special lesson at night, and the Italian sculptor who worked on the top floor used a hammer at the most impossible hours. But on the whole she liked it better than the tiresome routine of boarding. She was not afraid at night. The stamp-and-coin man who occupied the first floor, lived with his wife and baby in the rear. The janitress had a room on the floor above hers. Two elderly women workers of ability in the mechanical arts occupied the rear of her floor, and a dear little fat woman of fifty who drew designs for the New England weavers of cotton goods lived in the room adjoining hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had never spoken to any of these people, but Ella, the janitress, who cleaned up her place every morning, had told her their history. Ella was a sociable soul, her face an eternal study and an inscrutable mystery. She spoke both German and English and yet never a word of her own life's history passed her lips. She had loved Mary from the moment she cocked her queer drawn face to one side and looked at her with the one good eye she possessed. She was always doing little things for her comfort — and never asked tips for it. If Mary offered to pay she smiled quietly and spoke in the softest drawl: "Oh, that's nothing, child — Ach, Gott im Himmel — nein!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This one-eyed, homely woman who cleaned up her room for three dollars a month, and Jane Anderson, were the only friends she had among the six million people whose lives centered on Manhattan Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Man had yet to darken her door. The little room had been carefully fitted, however, to receive her Knight when the great event of his coming should be at hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The box couch was built of hard wood paneling and was covered with pillows of soft leather and silk. The bed-clothes were carefully stored in the locker beneath the mattress cushion. No one would ever suspect its use as a bed. The bathroom was fitted with a bureau and no signs of a sleeping apartment disfigured the effect of her one library, parlor, and reception-room. A desk and bookcase stood at either end of the box couch. The bookcase was filled with fiction — love stories exclusively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A large birdcage swung from a staple in the window and two canaries peered cautiously from their perches at the kitten in her lap. She had trained him to ignore this cage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The crowds below were thinning down. A light snow was falling. The girl lifted her pet and kissed his cold nose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must get our own dinner tonight, Mr. Thomascat — it's snowing outside. And did you hear what she said, Kitty dear — `More girls are ruined by marriage in New York than by any other process!' A good joke, Kitty! — You and I know better than that if we do live in our own tiny world! We'll risk it some day, anyhow, won't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kitten purred his assent and Mary bustled over the little gas stove humming an old love song her mother had taught her in a far-off village in Kentucky.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TEMPTATION</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her kitchenette was a model of order and cleanliness. The carpenter who built its neat cupboard and fitted the drawers beneath the tiny gas range, had outdone himself in its construction. He had given the wood-work four coats of immaculate white paint without extra charge. Mary had insisted on paying for it, but he waved the proffered money aside with a gesture that spoke louder than words:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pooh! That's nothing to what I'd like to do for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was not surprised when he called the following Saturday and stood at her door awkwardly fumbling his hat, trying to ask her to spend the afternoon and evening at Coney Island with him. There was no mistaking the manner in which he made this request.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had refused him as gently as possible — a big, awkward, good-natured, ignorant boy he was, with the eyes of a St. Bernard dog. He apologized for his presumption and never repeated the offense.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somehow her conquests had all been in this class.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tall, blushing German youth from the butcher's around the corner had been slipping extra cuts into her bundle and making awkward advances until she caught him red-handed with a pound of lamb chops which he failed to explain. She read him a lecture on honesty that discouraged him. It was not so much what she said, as the way she said it, that wounded his sensitive nature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ice man she had not yet entirely subdued. Tony Bonelli had the advantage of pretending not to understand her orders of dismissal. He merely smiled in his sad Italian way and continued to pack her ice-box so full the lid would never close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was reminded at every turn tonight of these futile conquests of the impossible. They all smelled of the back stairs and the kitchen. Her people had been slaveholders in the old regime of southern Kentucky. A kindly tolerant contempt for the pretensions of a servant class was bred in the bone of her being.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet their tribute to her beauty had its compensations. It was the promise of triumph when he for whom she waited should step from the throng and lift his hat. Just how he was going to do this without a breach of the proprieties of life, she couldn't see. It would come. It must come. It was Fate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In twenty minutes her coffee-pot was boiling, the lamb chops broiled to perfection and she was seated before the dainty, snow-white table, the kitten softly begging at her feet. Half an hour later, every dish and pot and pan was back in its place in perfect order. She prided herself on her mastery of the details of cooking and the most economical administration of every dollar devoted to housekeeping. She studied cooking in the best schools the city afforded. She meant to show her Knight a thing or two in this line when the time came. His wife would not be an ignorant slattern, the victim of incompetent servants. No servant could fool her. She would know the business of the house down to its minutest detail.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not that she loved dish-washing and pot-polishing and scrubbing. It was simply a part of the Game of Life she must play in the ideal home she would build. There was no drudgery in it for this reason. She was a soldier on the drill grounds preparing for the battle on the successful issue of which hung her happiness and the happiness of the one of whom she dreamed. She might miss some of the dangerous fun which Jane Anderson could enjoy without a scratch, but she would make sure of the fundamental things which Jane would never stop to consider.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She threw herself on the couch in her favorite position against the pillows, drew the kitten into her arms and hugged him violently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all right, Mr. Thomascat; we'll show them," she purred softly. "We'll see who wins at last, the eagle who soars or the little wren in the hedge close beside the garden wall — we'll see, Kitty — we'll see!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room was still, the noise of the street-cars below muffled with the first soft blanket of snow. The street lamps flickered in the wind with a pale subdued light that scarcely brought out the furnishings of her nest. She was in the habit of dreaming in this window for hours with only the light from the lamps on the street.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Square, deserted by its tramp lovers, lay white and still and cold. The old battle with the Blue Devils was on again within. The fight with Jane had been easy. She had always found it easy to face temptation in the concrete. The moment Satan appeared in human shape she was up in arms and ready for the fray. It was this silent hour she dreaded when the defenses of the soul were down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no use to lie to herself. She was utterly lonely and heartsick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had guarded the portals of life with religious care — with a care altogether unnecessary as events had proved. There had been no crush of rude men to assault her. Only an awkward carpenter, a butcher's boy and the ice man! It was incredible. Of all the men whose restless feet pressed the pavements of New York, not one, save these three, had apparently cared whether she lived or died.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The men whom she met in her duties in the schoolroom she had found utterly devoid of imagination and beneath contempt. They had each been obviously on guard against the machinations of the female of the species. They had, each of them, shown plainly their fear and hatred of women teachers. The feeling was mutual. God knows she had no desire to encroach on their domain any longer than absolutely necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps she was making a mistake. The thought was strangling. Only the girl who waived conventions in the rushing tide of the modern city's life seemed to live at all. The others merely existed. Jane Anderson lived! There could be no mistake about that. She had mastered the ugly mob. Its cruel loneliness was to her a thing unknown. But Jane was an exception — the one woman in a thousand who could defy conventions and yet keep her soul and body clean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The offer she had made had proved a terrible temptation. The artist who had asked with such eagerness to use her head for his portrait of the Madonna on the canvas he was executing for the new cathedral, had long appealed to her vivid imagination. Two prints of his famous work hung on her walls. She had always wished to know him. He had married a Southern girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That was just the point — he was married!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No girl could afford to be shut up alone in a studio with a fascinating married man for three hours — or half an hour. What if she should fall in love with him at first sight! Such things had happened. They could happen again. Only tragedy could be the end of such an event. It was too dangerous to consider for a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would have consented had it been possible for Jane to chaperon her. That would have been obviously ridiculous. No artist with any self-respect would tolerate such a reflection on his honesty. No girl could afford to confess her fears in this brazen fashion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The necessity for her refusal had depressed her beyond any experience she had passed through in the dreary desert of the past five years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted the sleeping kitten and whispered passionately:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Am I a silly fool, Kitty? Am I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tears came at last. She lay back on the pillows and let them pour down her cheeks without protest or effort at self-control. Every nerve of her strong, healthy body ached for the love and companionship of men which she had denied herself with an iron will. At nineteen it had been easy. The sheer animal joy in life had been enough. With the growth of each year the ache within had become more and more insistent. With each ripening season of body and mind, the hunger of love had grown more and more maddening. How long could she keep up this battle with every instinct of her being?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose at last, determined to go to Jane, confess that she had been a fool, and step out into the new world, New York's world, and begin to live.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seized her hat and furs and put them on with feverish haste.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God knows it's time I began — I'll be an old maid in another year and dry up — ugh!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked in the quaint oval mirror that hung beside her door and lifted her head with a touch of pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had reached the street and started for the Broadway car before she suddenly remembered that Jane was "dining with a dangerous man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She couldn't turn back to that little room tonight without new courage. Her decision was instantaneous. She couldn't surrender to the flesh and the devil by yielding to Jane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would go to prayer-meeting!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Religion had always been a very real thing in her life. Her father was a Methodist presiding elder. She would have gone to the meeting tonight in the first place but for the snow. Dr. Craddock, the new sensational pastor of the Temple, was giving a series of Wednesday-night talks that had aroused wide interest and drawn immense crowds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His theme tonight was one that promised all sorts of sensations — "The Woman of the Future." The only trouble with the Doctor was that the substance of his discourses sometimes failed to make good the startling suggestions of his titles. No matter — she would go. She felt a sense of righteous pride in fighting her way to the church through the first storm of the winter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the snow the church was crowded. The subject announced had evidently touched a vital spot in modern life. More people were thinking about "The Woman of the Future" than she had suspected. The crowd sat with eager, upturned faces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first half-hour's prayer and song service had just begun. Mary joined in the singing of the stirring evangelistic hymns with enthusiasm. Something in their battle-cry melody caught her spirit instantly tonight and her whole being responded. In ten minutes she was a good shouting Methodist and supremely happy without knowing why. She never paused to ask. Her nature was profoundly religious and she had been born and bred in the atmosphere of revivals. Her father was an aggressive evangelist both in his character and methods of work, and she was his own daughter — a child of emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The individuals in the eager crowd which packed the popular church meant nothing to her personally. They had passed before her unseeing eyes Sunday after Sunday the past five years as mere shadows of an unknown world which swallowed them up the moment they reached the street. She had never seen the inside of one of their homes. Not one of them had drawn close enough to her to venture an invitation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two of the stewards she knew personally — one a bricklayer, the other a baker on Eighth Avenue. The preacher she had met in a purely formal way as the bishop of the flock. She liked Dr. Craddock. He was known in the ministry as a live wire. He was a man of vigorous physique — just turning fifty, magnetic, eloquent and popular with the masses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary was curious tonight as to what the preacher would say on "The Woman of the Future." The Methodist Church had been a pioneer in the modern Feminist movement, having long ago admitted women to the full ordination of the ministry. Craddock, however, had been known for his conservatism in the woman movement. He abhorred the idea of woman's suffrage as a dangerous revolution and the fact that he consented to treat the topic at all was a reluctant confession of its menacing importance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With keen interest, the girl saw him rise at last. A breathless hush fell on the crowd. He walked deliberately to the edge of the platform and gazed into the faces of the people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have often been asked," he slowly began, "where I get my sermons." He paused and laughed. "I'll be perfectly honest with you. Sometimes I get them from the Bible — sometimes from the book of life. The genesis of this talk tonight is very definite. I found it in the liquid depths of a little girl's eyes. She asked a simple question that set me thinking — not only about the subject of her query but on the vaster issues that grew out of it. She looked up into my face the other night after my call for volunteers for the new mission we are beginning in the slums of the East Side, and asked me if the girls were not going to be given the chance to do something worth while in this church's work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't honestly answer her off-hand and in my groping I forgot the child and her question. I saw a vision — a vision of that broader, nobler future toward which human civilization is now swiftly moving.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say deliberately that it is swiftly moving, because the progress of the world during the last fifty years has been greater than in any five hundred years of the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The older I grow the stronger becomes my conviction that the problems of the age in which we now live cannot be solved by masculine brain and brawn alone. The problems of the city and the nation and the great fundamental social questions that involve the foundations of modern life will find no solution until the heart and brain of woman are poured into the crucible of our test.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They talk about a woman's sphere</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As though it had a limit:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's not a place in earth or heaven,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's not a task to mankind given,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's not a blessing or a woe,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's not a whisper yes or no,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There's not a life, or death, or birth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That has a feather's weight of worth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without a woman in it!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The difference between a man and a woman is one that makes them the complementary parts of a perfect unit. God made man in His own image — male and female. The person of God therefore combines these two elements unseparated. The mind of God is both male and female. In man we have the strength which lifts and tugs and fights the elements. This is the aspect turned primarily toward matter. In woman we have the finer qualities of the Spirit turned toward the source of all spirit in God. The idea of a masculine deity is a false assumption of the Dark Ages. God is both male and female.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I used to wonder why Jesus Christ was a man, until I realized that the Incarnation expressed the depth of human need. God stooped lower in assuming the form of man. The form of the divine revelation through Jesus Christ was determined solely by this depth of human need — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For half an hour in impetuous eloquence, in telling incidents wet with tears and winged with hope, he held his listeners in a spell. It was not until the burst of applause which greeted his closing sentence had died away that Mary Adams realized that another landmark had toppled before the onrushing flood of modern Feminism. The conservatism of Doctor Craddock had yielded at last to the inevitable. He, too, had joined the ranks of the prophets who preach of a Woman's Day of Emancipation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet it never occurred to her that this fact had the slightest bearing on her personal outlook on life. On the contrary she felt in the spiritual elation of the triumphant eloquence of her favorite preacher a renewal of her simple religious faith. At the bottom of that religion lay the foundation of life itself — her conception of marriage as the supreme and only expression of woman's power in the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She walked back to her home on the Square, in a glow of ecstatic emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Surely God had miraculously saved her this night from the wiles of the Devil! No matter what this eloquent discourse had meant to others, it had renewed her faith in the old-fashioned woman and the old-fashioned ways of the old-fashioned home. Her vision was once more clear. She was glad Jane Anderson had come to put her to the test. She had been tried in the fires of hell and came forth unscorched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood beside her window dreaming again of the home she would build when her Knight should stand before her revealed in beauty no words could describe. The moon was shining now in solemn glory on the white-shrouded Square. Temptation had only strengthened the fiber of her soul. She knelt in the moonlight beside her couch and prayed that God should ever keep her faith serene. She rose with a sense of peace and joy. God would hear and answer the cry of her heart. The City might be the Desert — it was still God's world and not a sparrow that twittered in those bare trees or chattered on her window-ledge in the morning could fall to the ground without His knowledge. God had put this deathless passion in her heart; He could not deny it expression. She could bide His time. If the day of her deliverance were near, it was good. If God should choose to try her faith in loneliness and tears, it was His way to make the revelation of glory the more dazzling when it came.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew the covering about her warm young body with the firm faith that her hour was close at hand, and fell asleep to dream of her Knight.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">FATE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary waked next morning with the delicious sense of impending happiness. A wonderful dream had come to thrill her half-conscious moments, repeating itself in increasing vividness and beauty with each awakening. The vision had been interrupted by the unusual noise of the snow machines on the car tracks, and yet she had fallen asleep after each break and picked up the rapturous scene at the exact moment of its interruption.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was married and madly in love with her husband. His face she could never see quite clearly. His business kept him away from home on long trips. But his baby was always there — a laughing, wonderful boy whose chubby hands persisted in pulling her hair down into her face each time she bent over his cradle to kiss him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella was chattering in German to someone on the stairs. She wondered again for the hundredth time how this poor, slovenly, one-eyed, ill-kempt creature, scrub-woman and janitress, could speak two languages with such ease. Her English, except in excitement, seemed equally fluent with her German. How did such a woman fall so low? She was industrious and untiring in her work. She never touched liquor or drugs. She was kind and thoughtful and watched over her tenants with a motherly care for which no landlord could pay in dollars and cents. She was on her knees on the stairs now, scrubbing down the steps to be crowded again with muddy feet from the street below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lay for half an hour snuggling under the warm blankets, weaving a romance about Ella's life. A great love for some heroic man who died and left her in poverty could alone explain the mystery that hung about her. She never spoke of her life or people. Mary had ventured once to ask her. A wan smile flitted across the haggard face for a moment, and she answered in low tones that closed the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't any people, dear," she said slowly. "They are dead long ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl wondered if it were really true. In her joy this morning she felt her heart go out to the pathetic, drooping figure on the stairs. She wished that every living creature might share the secret joy that filled her soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew the kitten from his nest beside her pillow and rubbed her cheek against his little cold nose. He always waked her with a kiss on her eyelids and then coiled himself back for a tiny cat-nap until she could make up her mind to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang from the couch with sudden energy and stretched her dainty figure with a prodigious yawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gracious, Kitty, we must hurry!" she cried, thrusting her bare feet into a pair of embroidered slippers and throwing her blue flannel kimono on over her night-dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The coffee-pot was boiling busily when she had bathed and dressed. Each detail of her domestic schedule was given an extra care this morning. The stove was carefully polished, each pot and pan placed in its rack with a precision that spoke an unusual joy within the heart of the housewife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And through it all she hummed a lullaby that haunted her from the memories of a happy childhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Breakfast over, the kitten fed, the birds given their bath, their sand and seed, she couldn't stop until the whole place had been thoroughly cleaned and dusted. Exactly why she had done this on Thursday morning it was impossible to say. Some hidden force within had impelled her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then back into the dream world her mind flew on joyous wings. It was a sign from God in answer to prayer. Why not? The Bible was full of such revelations in ancient times. God was not dead because the world was modern and we had steam and electricity. The routine of school was no longer dull. Around each commonplace child hung a halo of romance. They were love-children today. She wove a dream of tenderness, of chivalry, and heroic deeds about them all. She searched each face for some line of beauty caught in the vision of her own baby who had looked into her heart from the mists of eternity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days passed in a sort of trance. Never had she felt surer of life and the full fruition of every hope and faith. Just how this marvelous blossoming would come, she could not guess. Her chances of meeting her Fate were no better than at any moment of the past years of drab disillusionment, and yet, for some reason, her foolish heart kept singing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There could be but one answer. The event was impending. Such things could be felt — not reasoned out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She applied herself to her teaching with a new energy and thoroughness. She must do this work well and carry into the real life that must soon begin the consciousness of every duty faithfully performed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A boy asked her a question about a little flower which grew in a warm crevice of the stone wall on which the iron fence of the school yard rested. She blushed at her failure to enlighten him and promised to tell him on Monday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Botany was not one of her tasks but she felt the tribute to her personality in his question, and she would take pains to make her answer full and interesting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday afternoon she hurried to the Public Library, on Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street, to look up every reference to this flower.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boulevard of the Metropolis was thronged with eager thousands. Handsome men and beautifully dressed women passed each other in endless procession on its crowded pavements. The cabs and automobiles, two abreast on either side, moved at a snail's pace, so dense were the throngs at each crossing. Her fancy was busy weaving about each throbbing tonneau and limousine a story of love. Not a wheel was turning in all that long line of shining vehicles that didn't carry a woman or was hurrying to do a woman's bidding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her hero was coming, too, somewhere in the crowd with his gloved hand on one of those wheels. She could feel his breath on her cheek as he handed her into the seat by his side and then the sudden leap of the car into space and away on the wings of lightning into the future!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She ascended the broad steps of the majestic building with quick, springing strength. She loved this glorious library, with its lofty, arched ceilings. The sense of eternity that brooded over it and filled the stately rooms rested and inspired her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides, she forgot her poverty in this temple of all time. Within its walls she belonged to the great aristocracy of brains and culture of which this palace was the supreme expression. And it was hers. Andrew Carnegie had given the millions to build it and the city of New York granted the site on land that was worth many millions more. But it was all built for her convenience, her comfort and inspiration. Every volume of its vast and priceless collection was hers — hers to hold in her hands, read and ponder and enjoy. Every officer and manager in its inclosure was her servant — to come at her beck and call and do her bidding. The little room on Twenty-third Street was the symbol of the future. This magnificent building was the realization of the present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled pleasantly to the polite assistant who received her order slip, and took her seat on the waiting line until her books were delivered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This magnificent room with its lofty ceilings of golden panels and drifting clouds had always brought to her a peculiar sense of restful power. The consciousness of its ownership had from the first been most intimate. No man can own what he cannot appreciate. He may possess it by legal documents, but he cannot own it unless he has eyes to see, ears to hear, and a heart to feel its charm. This appreciation Mary Adams possessed by inheritance from her student father who devoured books with an insatiate hunger. Nowhere in all New York's labyrinth did she feel as perfectly at home as in this reading-room. The quiet which reigned without apparent sign or warning seemed to belong to the atmosphere of the place. It was unthinkable that any man or woman should be rude or thoughtless enough to break it by a loud word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This room was hers day or night, winter or summer, always heated and lighted, and a hundred swift, silent servants at hand to do her bidding. Around the room on serried shelves, dressed in leather aprons, stood twenty-five thousand more servants of the centuries of the past ready to answer any question her heart or brain might ask of the world's life since the dawn of Time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the stack-room below, on sixty-three miles of shelves, stood a million others ready to come at her slightest nod. She loved to dream here of the future, in the moments she must wait for these messengers she had summoned. In this magic room the past ceased to be. These myriads of volumes made the past a myth. It was all the living, throbbing present — with only the golden future to be explored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her number flashed in red letters on the electric blackboard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose and carried her books to the seat number assigned her near the center of the southern division of the room on the extreme left beside the bookcases containing the dictionaries of all languages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her seat was on the aisle which skirted the shelves. She found the full description of the flower in which she was interested, made her notes and closed the volume with a lazy movement of her slender, graceful hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her eyes and they rested on a remarkable-looking young man about her own age who stood gazing in an embarrassed, helpless sort of way at the row of ponderous volumes marked "The Century Dictionary."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was evidently a newcomer. By his embarrassment she could easily tell that it was the first time he had ever ventured into this room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked at the books, apparently puzzled by their number. He raised his hand and ran his fingers nervously through the short, thick, red hair which covered his well-shaped head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl's attention was first fixed by the strange contrast between his massive jaw and short neck which spoke the physical strength of an ox, and the slender gracefully tapering fingers of his small hand. The wrist was small, the fingers almost feminine in their lines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He caught her look of curious interest and to her horror, smiled and walked straight to her seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no mistaking his determination to speak. It was useless to drop her eyes or turn aside. He would certainly follow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She blushed and gazed at him in a timid, helpless fashion while he bent over her seat and whispered awkwardly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look kind and obliging, miss — could you help me a little?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His tone was so genuine in its appeal, so distressed and hesitating, it was impossible to resent his question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I can — yes," was the prompt answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't mind?" he asked, fumbling his hat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — what is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary had recovered her composure as his distress had increased and looked steadily into his steel blue eyes inquiringly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see," he went on, in low hurried tones, "I'm all worked up about the mountains of North Carolina — thinkin' o' goin' down there to Asheville in a car, an' I want to look the bloomin' place up and kind o' get my bearin's before I start. A lawyer friend o' mine told me to come here and I'd find all the maps in the Century Dictionary. The man at the desk out there told me to come in this room and look in the shelves on the left and take it right out. Gee, the place is so big, I get all rattled. I found the Century Dictionary on that shelf — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and smiled helplessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought a dictionary was one book — there's a dozen of 'em marked alike. I'm afraid to pull 'em all down an' I don't know where to begin — could you help me — please?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, with pleasure," she answered, quickly rising and leading the way back to the shelf at which he had been gazing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You want the atlas volume," she explained, drawing the book from the shelf and returning to the seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He followed promptly and bent over her shoulder while she pointed out the map of North Carolina, the position of Asheville and the probable route he must follow to get there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks!" he exclaimed gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all," she replied simply. "I'm only too glad to be of service to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her answer emboldened him to ask another question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't happen to know anything about that country down there, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes. I know a great deal about it — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure enough?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've been through Asheville many times and spent a summer there once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His tones implied that he plainly regarded her as a prodigy of knowledge. His whole attitude suggested at once the mind of an alert, interested boy asking his teacher for information on a subject near to his heart. It was impossible to resist his appeal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes," Mary went on in low, rapid tones. "My people live in the Kentucky mountains."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent low and gently touched her arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, we can't talk in here — I'm afraid. Would it be asking too much of you to come out in the park, sit down on a bench and tell me about it? I'll never know how to thank you, if you will?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was absurd, of course, such a request, and yet his interest was so keen, his deference to her superior knowledge so humble and appealing, to refuse seemed ungracious. She hesitated and rose abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a moment — I'll return my books and then we'll go. You can replace this volume on the shelf where we got it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank yoo, miss," he responded gratefully. "You're awfully kind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't mention it," she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a moment she was walking by his side down the smooth marble stairs and out through the grand entrance into Fifth Avenue. The strange part about it was, she was not in the least excited over a very unconventional situation. She had allowed a handsomely groomed, young, red-haired adventurer to pick her up without the formality of an introduction, in the Public Library. She hadn't the remotest idea of his name — nor had he of hers — yet there was something about him that seemed oddly familiar. They must have known one another somewhere in childhood and forgotten each other's faces.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun was shining in clear, steady brilliancy in a cloudless sky. The snow had quickly melted and it was unusually warm for early December. They turned into the throng of Fifth Avenue and at the corner of Forty-second Street he paused and hesitated and looked at her timidly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say," he began haltingly, "there's an awful crowd of bums on those seats in the Square behind the building — you know Central Park, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quite well — I've spent many happy hours in its quiet walks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know that place the other side of the Mall — that ragged hill covered with rocks and trees and mountain laurel?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've been there often."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you mind going there where it's quiet — I've such a lot o' things I want to ask you — you won't mind the walk, will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not — we'll go there," Mary responded in even, business-like tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because, if you don't want to walk I'll call a cab, if you'll let me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all," was the quick answer. "I love to walk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was impossible for the girl to repress a smile at her ridiculous situation! If any human being had told her yesterday that she, Mary Adams, an old-fashioned girl with old-fashioned ideas of the proprieties of life, would have allowed herself to be picked up by an utter stranger in this unceremonious way, she would have resented the assertion as a personal insult — yet the preposterous and impossible thing had happened and she was growing each moment more and more deeply interested in the study of the remarkable youth by her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was not handsome in the conventional sense. His features were too strong for that. An enemy might have called them coarse. Their first impression was of enormous strength and exhaustless vitality. He walked with a quick, military precision and planted his small feet on the pavement with a soft, sure tread that suggested the strength of a young tiger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The one feature that puzzled her was the size of his hands and feet. They were remarkably small and remarkable for their slender, graceful lines.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His eyes were another interesting feature. The lids drooped with a careless Oriental languor, as though he would shut out the glare of the full daylight, and yet the pupils flashed with a cold steel-blue fire. One look into his eyes and there could be no doubt that the man behind them was an interesting personality.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She wondered what his business could be. Not a lawyer or doctor or teacher certainly. His timidity in handling books was clear proof on that point. He was well groomed. His clothes were made by a first-class tailor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her heart thumped with a sudden fear. Perhaps he was some sort of criminal. His questions may have been a trick to lure her away. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had just crossed the broad plaza at Fifty-ninth Street and entered the walkway that leads to the Mall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's too far to the hill beyond the Mall," she began hesitatingly. "We'll find a seat in one of the little rustic houses along the Fifty-ninth Street side — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, if you say so," he agreed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He accepted the suggestion so simply, she regretted her suspicions, instantly changed her mind and said, smiling:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, we'll go on where we started. The long walk will do me good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," he laughed; "whatever you say's the law. I'm the little boy that does just what his teacher says."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She blushed and shot him a surprised look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who told you that I was a teacher?" she asked, with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord, nobody! I had no idea of such a thing. It never popped into my head that you do anything at all. You know, I was awful scared when I spoke to you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Were you?" she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Surest thing you know! I'd 'a' never screwed up my courage to do it if you hadn't 'a' looked so kind and gentle and sweet. I just knew you couldn't turn me down — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no mistaking the genuineness of the apology for his presumption. She smiled a gracious answer, and threw the last ugly suspicion to the winds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He broke into a laugh and lifted his hand in the sudden gesture of a traffic policeman commanding a halt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know I was so excited I clean forgot to introduce myself! What do you think o' that? You'll excuse me, won't you? My name's Jim Anthony. I'm sorry I can't give you any references to my folks. I haven't any — I'm a lost sheep in New York — no father or mother. That's why I'm so excited about this trip I'm plannin' down South. I hear I've got some people down there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped suddenly as if absorbed in the thought. Her heart went out to him in sympathy for this confession of his orphaned life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm Mary Adams," she smiled in answer. "I'm a teacher in the public schools."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee — that accounts for it! I thought you looked like you knew everything in those books. And you've been to Asheville, too?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose it's not as big a burg as New York?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hardly — it's just a hustling mountain town of about twenty-five thousand people."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lot o' swells from around New York live down there, they tell me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, the Vanderbilts have a beautiful castle just outside."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some mountains near Asheville?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hundreds of square miles."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mountains in every direction?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As far as the eye can reach, one blue range piled above another until they're lost in the dim skies on the horizon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, it may be pretty hard to find your folks if they just live in the mountains near Asheville?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Unless your directions are more explicit — I should think so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know, I thought the mountains near Asheville was a bunch o' hills off one side like the Palisades, that you couldn't miss if you tried. I've never been outside of New York — since I can remember. I'd love to see real mountains."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last sentence was spoken in a wistful pathos that touched Mary with its irresistible appeal. Her mother instincts responded to it in quick sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've missed a lot," she answered gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll bet I have. It's a rotten old town, this New York — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused, and a queer light flashed from his steel eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Until you get your hand on its throat," he added, bringing his square jaws together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted her face with keen interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you've got it by the throat?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what — little girl!" he cried, with a ring of pride. "You see, I'm an inventor and I won a little pile on my first trick. I've got a machine-shop in a room eight-by-ten over on the East Side."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A machine-shop all your own?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to see it some day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shook his head emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's too dirty. I couldn't let a pretty girl like you in such a place." He paused and resumed the tone of his narrative where she interrupted him. "You see, I've just put a new crimp in a carburetor for the automobile folks. They're tickled to death over it and I've got automobiles to burn. Will you go to ride with me tomorrow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The teacher broke into a joyous laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why do you laugh?" he asked awkwardly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, in the language of New York, that would be going some, wouldn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not, I'd like to know?" he cried with scorn. "Who's to tell us we can't? You've no kids to bother you tomorrow. I'm my own boss. You've seen Asheville, but you've never seen New York until you sit down beside me in a big six-cylinder racing car I'm handlin' next week. Let me show it to you. I'll swing her around to your door at eight o'clock. In twenty-five minutes we'll clear the Bronx and shoot into New Rochelle. There'll be no cops out to bother us, and not a wheel in sight. It'll do you good. Let me take you! I owe you that much for bein' so nice to me today. Will you go with me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll think it over and let you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got a telephone?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you'll have to tell me before I go — won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose so," she answered demurely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They passed the big fountain beyond the Mall and skirted the lake to the bridge, crossed, walked along the water's edge to the laurel-covered crags and found a seat alone in the summer house that hides among the trees on its highest point.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The roar of the city was dim and far away. The only sounds to break the stillness were the laughter of lovers along the walks below and the distant cry of steamers in the harbor and rivers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd almost think you're in the mountains up here, now wouldn't you?" he asked, after a moment's silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I call this park my country estate. It costs me nothing to keep it in perfect order. The city pays for it all. But I own it. Every tree and shrub and flower and blade of grass, every statue and bird and animal in it is mine. I couldn't get more joy out of them if I had them inclosed behind an iron fence, and the deed to the land in my pocket — not half as much, for I'd be lonely and miserable without someone to see and enjoy it all with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, that's so, ain't it? I never looked at it like that before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gazed at her a long time in silent admiration, and then spoke briskly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now tell me about this North Carolina and all those miles and square miles of mountains."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've a piece of paper and pencil?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hand school-boy fashion:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Johnny on the spot, teacher!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A blank-book and pencil he threw in her lap and leaned close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tear the leaves out, if you like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I'll just draw the maps on the pages and leave them for you to study."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With deft touch she outlined in rough on the first page, the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina, tracing his possible route by Trenton, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Dover, Norfolk and Raleigh, or by Washington, Richmond, and Danville to Greensboro.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Either route you see," she said softly, "leads to Salisbury, where you strike the foothills of the mountains. It's about two hundred miles from there to Asheville and `The Land of the Sky.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For two hours she answered his eager, boyish questions about the country and its people, his eyes wide with admiration at her knowledge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun was sinking in a sea of scarlet and purple clouds behind the tall buildings beside the Park before she realized that they had been talking for more than two hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang to her feet, blushing and confused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mercy, I had no idea it was so late."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why — is it late?" he asked incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must hurry — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She brushed the stray ringlets of hair from her forehead, laughed and hurried down the pathway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They crossed the Park and took the Madison Avenue line to Twenty-third Street. They were silent in the car. The roar of the traffic was deafening after the quiet of the summer house among the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can see you home?" he inquired appealingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We get off at Twenty-third Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They stood on the steps at her door beside the Square and there was a moment's awkward silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hat with a little chivalrous bow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tomorrow morning at eight o'clock in my car?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled and hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have a bully time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's Sunday," she stammered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, that's why I asked you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like to miss my church."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You go to church every Sunday?" he asked in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, just this once then. It'll do you good. And I'll drive as careful as a farmer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," she said in low tones, and extended her hand:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night, teacher!" he responded with a boyish wave of his slender hand and quickly disappeared in the crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rushed up the stairs, her cheeks aflame, her heart beating a tattoo of foolish joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She snatched the kitten from sleep and whispered in his tiny ear:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Kitty dear, I've had such an adventure! I've spent the happiest, silliest afternoon of my life! I'm going to have a more wonderful day tomorrow. I just feel it. In a big racing automobile if you please, Mr. Thomascat! Sorry I can't take you but the dust would blind you, Kitty dear. I'm sorry to tell you that you'll have to stay at home all day alone and keep house. It's too bad. But I'll fix your milk and bread before I go and you must promise me on your sacred Persian cat's honor not to look at my birds!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She hugged him violently and he purred his soft answer in song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Kitty, I'm so happy — so foolishly happy!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">DOUBTS AND FEARS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary attempted no analysis of her emotions. It was all too sudden, too stunning. She was content to feel and enjoy the first overwhelming experience of life. Hour after hour she lay among the pillows of her couch in the dim light of the street lamps and lazily watched the passing Saturday evening crowds. The world was beautiful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She undressed at last and went to bed, only to toss wide-eyed for hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A hundred times she reenacted the scene in the Library and recalled her first impression of Jim's personality. What could such an utterly unforeseen and extraordinary meeting mean except that it was her Fate? Certainly he could not have planned it. Certainly she had not foreseen such an event. It had never occurred to her in the wildest flights of fancy that she could meet and speak to a man under such conditions, to say nothing of the walk in the Park and the hours she spent in the little summer house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the strangest part of it all was that she could see nothing wrong in it from beginning to end. It had happened in the simplest and most natural way imaginable. By the standards of conventional propriety her act was the maddest folly; and yet she was still happy over it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was one disquieting trait about him that made her a little uneasy. He used the catch-words of the street gamins of New York without any consciousness of incongruity. She thought at first that he did this as the Southern boy of culture and refinement unconsciously drops into the tones and dialect of the negro, by daily association. His constant use of the expressive and characteristic "Gee" was startling, to say the least. And yet it came from his lips in such a boyish way she felt sure that it was due to his embarrassment in the unusual position in which he had found himself with her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His helplessness with the dictionary was proof, of course, that he was no scholar. And yet a boy might have a fair education in the schools of today and be unfamiliar with this ponderous and dignified encyclopedia of words. It was impossible to believe that he was illiterate. His clothes, his carriage, even his manners made such an idea preposterous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Besides, no inventor could be really illiterate. He may have been forced to work and only attended night schools. But if he were a mechanic, capable of making a successful improvement on one of the most delicate and important parts of an automobile, he must have studied the principles involved in his inventions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His choice of a profession appealed to her imagination, too. It showed independence and initiative. It opened boundless possibilities. He might be an obscure and poorly educated boy today. In five years he could be a millionaire and the head of some huge business whose interests circled the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tired brain wore itself out at last in eager speculations, and she fell into a fitful stupor. The roar of the street-cars waked her at daylight, and further sleep was out of the question. She rose, dressed quickly and got her breakfast in a quiver of nervous excitement over the adventure of the coming automobile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the hour of eight drew nearer, her doubts of the propriety of going became more acute.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What on earth has come over me in the past twenty-four hours?" she asked of herself. "I've known this man but a day. I don't know him at all, and yet I'm going to put my life in his hands in that racing machine. Have I gone crazy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was not in the least afraid of him. His face and voice and personality all seemed familiar. Her brain and common-sense told her that such a trip with an utter stranger was dangerous and foolish beyond words. In his automobile, unaccompanied by a human soul and unacquainted with the roads over which they would travel, she would be absolutely in his power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She set her teeth firmly at last, her mind made up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's too mad a risk. I was crazy to promise. I won't go!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had scarcely spoken her resolution when the soft call of the auto-horn echoed below. She stood irresolute for a moment, and the call was repeated in plaintive, appealing notes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tried to hold fast to her resolutions, but the impulse to open the window and look out was resistless. She turned the old-fashioned brass knob, swung her windows wide on their hinges and leaned out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His keen eyes were watching. He lifted his cap and waved. She answered with the flutter of her handkerchief — and all resolutions were off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, I'll go," she cried, with a laugh. "It's a glorious day — I may never have such a chance again."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">WINGS OF STEEL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She threw on her furs and hurried downstairs. Her surrender was too sudden to realize that she was being driven by a power that obscured reason and crushed her will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reason made one more vain cry as she paused at the door below to draw on her gloves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have refused every invitation to see or know the unconventional world into which thousands of women in New York, clear-eyed and unafraid, enter daily. You'd sooner die than pose an hour in Gordon's studio, and on a Sabbath morning you cut your church and go on a day's wild ride with a man you have known but fifteen hours!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the voice inside quickly answered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But that's different! Gordon's a married man. My chevalier is not! I have the right to go, and he has the right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was settled anyhow before this little controversy arose at the street door, but the ready answer she gave eased her conscience and cleared the way for a happy, exciting trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaped from the big, ugly racer to help her in, stopped and looked at her light clothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's your heaviest coat?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. It isn't cold."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've one for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew an enormous fur coat from the car and held it up for her arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think I'll need that?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His white teeth gleamed in a friendly smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take it from me, Kiddo, you certainly will!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She winced just a little at the common expression, but he said it with such a quick, boyish enthusiasm, she wondered whether he were quoting the expression from the Bowery boy's vocabulary or using it in a facetious personal way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I knew you'd need it. So I brought it for you," he added genially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks," she murmured, lifting her arms and drawing the coat about her trim figure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He helped her into the car and drew from his pocket a light pair of goggles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now these, and you're all hunky-dory!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will I need these, too?" she asked incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you!" he cried. "You wouldn't ask that question if you knew the horse we've got hitched to this benzine buggy today. He's got wings — believe me! It's all I can do to hold him on the ground sometimes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll drive carefully?" she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With you settin' beside me, my first name's `Caution.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She fumbled the goggles in a vain effort to lift her arms over her head to fasten them on. He sprang into the seat by her side and promptly seized them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me fix 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His slender, skillful fingers adjusted the band and brushed a stray ringlet of hair back under the furs. The thrill of his touch swept her with a sudden dizzy sense of excitement. She blushed and drew her head down into the collar of the shaggy coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched the wheel, and the gray monster leaped from the curb and shot down the street. The single impulse carried them to the crossing. He had shut off the power as the machine gracefully swung into Fourth Avenue. The turn made, another leap and the car swept up the Avenue and swung through Twenty-sixth Street into Fifth Avenue. Again the power was off as he made the turn into Fifth Avenue at a snail's pace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't let her out yet," he whispered apologetically. "Had to make these turns. There's no room for her inside of town."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary had no time to answer. He touched the wheel, and the car shot up the deserted Avenue. She gasped for breath and braced her feet, her whole being tingling with the first exhilarating consciousness that she too was possessed of the devil of speed madness. It was glorious! For the first time in her life, space and distance lost their meaning. She was free as the birds in the heavens. She was flying on the wings of this gray, steel monster through space. The palaces on the Avenue whirled by in dim ghost-like flashes. They flew through Central Park into Seventy-second Street and out into the Drive. The waters of the river, broad and cool, flashing in the morning sun, rested her eyes a moment and then faded in a twinkling. They had leaped the chasm beyond Grant's Tomb, plunged into Broadway and before she could get her bearings, swept up the hill at One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street, slipped gracefully across the iron bridge and in a jiffy were lost in a gray cloud of dust on the Boston Turnpike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the first intoxicating joy of speed had spent itself, she found herself shuddering at the daring turns he made, missing a curb by a hair's breadth — grazing a trolley by half an inch. Her fears were soon forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hand on the wheel was made of steel, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The throbbing demon encased within the hood obeyed his slightest whim. She glanced at the square, massive jaw with furtive admiration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without turning his head he laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You like it, teacher?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm in Heaven!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't worry about church then, will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not today."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They stopped at a road-house, and he put in more gasoline, lifted the casing from the engine, touched each vital part, examined his tires, and made sure that his machine was at its best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She watched him with a growing sense of his strength of character, his poise and executive ability. He was an awkward, stammering boy in the Library yesterday. Today with this machine in his hand he was the master of Time and Space.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She yielded herself completely to the delicious sense of his protection. The extraordinary care he was giving the machine was a plain avowal of his deep regard for her comfort and happiness. She had been in one or two moderately moving cars driven by careful chauffeurs through Central Park. She had always felt on those trips with Jane Anderson like a poor relation from the country imposing on a rich friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This trip was all her own. The car and its master were there solely for her happiness. Her slightest whim was law for both. It was sweet, this sense of power. She began to lift her body with a touch of pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She laughed now at fears. What nonsense! No Knight of the Age of Chivalry could treat her with more deference. He had tried already to get her to stop for a bite of lunch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you want a thing to eat?" he persisted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a thing. I've just had my breakfast. It's only nine o'clock — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know, but we've come thirty miles and the air makes you hungry. We ought to eat about six good meals a day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — not yet. I'm too happy with these new wings. I want to fly some more — come on — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hand in his favorite gesture of obedience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Nuff said — we'll streak it back now by another road, hump it through town and jump over the Brooklyn Bridge. I'll show you Coney Island and then I know you'll want a hot dog anyhow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He crossed the country and darted into Broadway. Before she could realize it, the last tree and field were lost behind in a cloud of dust, and they were again in the crowded streets of the city. The deep growl of his horn rang its warnings for each crossing and Mary watched the timid women scramble to the sidewalks five and six blocks ahead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was delicious. She had always been the one to scramble before. Her heart went out in a wave of tenderness to the man by her side, strong, daring, masterful, her chevalier, her protector and admirer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, her admirer! There was no doubt on that point. The moment he relaxed the tension of his hand on the wheel, his deep, mysterious eyes beneath the drooping lids were fixed on hers in open, shameless admiration. Their cold fire burned into her heart and thrilled to her finger-tips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of his deference and his obedience to her whim, she felt the iron grip of his personality on her imagination. Whatever his education, his origin or his environment, he was a power to be reckoned with.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No other type of man had ever appealed to her. Her conception of a real man had always been one who did his own thinking and commanded rather than asked the respect of others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had thrown the spell of her beauty over this headstrong, masterful man. He was wax in her hands. A delicious sense of power filled her. She had never known what happiness meant before. She floated through space. The spinning lines of towering buildings on Broadway passed as mists in a dream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the velvet feet of the car touched the great bridge she lazily opened her eyes for a moment and gazed through the lace-work of steel at the broad sweep of the magnificent harbor. The dark blue hills of Staten Island framed the picture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was right. She had never seen New York before. Never before had its immense panorama been swept within two hours. Never before had she realized its dimensions. She had always felt stunned and crushed in the effort to conceive it. Today she had wings. The city lay at her feet, conquered. She was mistress of Time and Space.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again her sidelong glance swept the lines of Jim Anthony's massive jaw. She laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing. I'm just happy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She blushed and wondered if he had read her thoughts by some subtle power of clairvoyance. She was speculating on the effects of love at first sight on such a man. Would he hesitate, back and fill and hang on for months trying in vain to gain the courage to speak? Or would he spring with the leap of a young tiger the moment he realized what he wanted?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her own attitude was purely one of joyous expectancy. It would, of course, be a long time before her feelings could take any definite attitude toward a man. For the moment she was supremely happy. It was enough. She made no effort to probe her feelings. She might return to earth tomorrow. Today she was in Heaven. She would make the most of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They skimmed the wooded cliffs of Bay Ridge, her heart beating in ecstasy at the revelation of beauty of whose existence she had not dreamed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I bet you never saw this drive before, now did you?" he asked with boyish enthusiasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — it's wonderful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some view — eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Entrancing!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know when I make my pile, I'd like a palace of white marble perched on this cliff with the windows on the south looking out over Sandy Hook, and the windows on the west looking over that fort on the top of Staten Island with its black eyes gazing over the sea. How would you like that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned away to mask the smile she couldn't repress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That would be splendid, wouldn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like the water, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Water and hills both right together! I reckon my father must 'a' been a sea-captain and my mother from the mountains — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He said this with a pathos that found the girl's heart. What a pitiful, lonely life, a boy's without even the memory of a mother or father! The mother instinct rose in a resistless flood of pity. Her eyes grew suddenly dim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," he said briskly, "now for the dainty job! I've got to jump my way through that Coney Island bunch. You see my low speed's a racing pace for an everyday car. All I can do in a crowd is to jump from one crossing to the next and cut her power off every time. You can bet I'll make a guy or two jump with me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't hurt anyone?" she pleaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord, no! I wouldn't dare to put her through that mob in the afternoon. I'd kill a regiment of 'em. But it's early — just the shank of the morning. There's nobody down here yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car suddenly leaped into the Avenue that runs through the heart of Coney Island, the deep-throated horn screaming its warning. The crowd scattered like sheep before a lion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl laughed in spite of her effort at self-control.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Watch 'em hump!" Jim grunted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's funny, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When you're in the car — yes. It don't seem so funny when you're on foot. Well, some people were made to walk and some to ride. I had to hoof it at first. I like riding better — don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be perfectly honest — yes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car leaped forward again, the horn screaming. The wheel passed within a foot of a fat woman's skirt. With a cry of terror she fled to the sidewalk and shook her fist at Jim, her face purple with anger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waved his hand back at her:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never touched you, dearie! Never touched you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lost all fear of accident and watched him handle the machine with the skill of a master. She could understand now the spirit of deviltry in a chauffeur who knows his business. It seemed a wicked, cruel thing from the ground — this swift plunge of a car as if bent on murder. But now that she felt the sure, velvet grip of the brake in a master's hand, she saw that the danger was largely a myth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was fun to see people jump at the approach of an avalanche of steel that always stopped just short of harm. Of course, it took a steady nerve and muscle to do the trick. The man by her side had both. He was always smiling. Nothing rattled him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her trust was now implicit. She relaxed the tension of the first two hours of doubt and fear, and yielded to the spell of his strength. It seemed inseparable from the throbbing will of the giant machine. He was its incarnate spirit. She was being swept through space now on the wings of omnipotent power — but power always obedient to her whim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With steady, even pulse they glided down the long, broad Avenue to Prospect Park, swung through its winding lanes, on through the streets of Brooklyn and once more into the open road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now for Long Beach and a good lunch!" he cried. "I'll show you something — but you'll have to shut your eyes to see it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sudden bound, the car leaped into the air, and shot through the sky with the hiss and shriek of a demon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl caught her breath and instinctively gripped his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look out, Kiddo!" he shouted. "Don't touch me — or we'll both land in Kingdom Come. I ain't ready for a harp just yet. I'd rather fool with this toy for a while down here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She braced her feet and gripped the sides of the car, gasping for breath, steadied herself at last and crouched low among the furs to guard her throat from the icy daggers of the wind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The landscape whirled in a circle of trees and sky, while above the dark line of hills hung the boiling cauldron of cloud-banked heavens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you game?" he called above the roar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," she gasped. "Don't stop — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her soul had risen at last to the ecstasy of the mania for speed that fired the man's spirit and nerved his hand. It was inconceivable until experienced — this awful joy! Her spirit sank with childish disappointment as he slowly lowered the power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got to take a sharp curve down there," he explained. "We turn to the right for the meadows and the Beach — how was that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wonderful," she cried, with dancing eyes. "Let her go again if you want to — I'm game — now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little rattled at first?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we can't let her out on this road. It's too narrow — have to take a ditch sometimes to pass. That wouldn't do for an eighty-mile clip, you know — now would it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hardly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might risk it alone — but my first name's `Old Man Caution' today — you get me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary nodded and turned her head away again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got you the first time, sir," she answered playfully taking his tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He ran the car into the garage at the Beach, sprang out and lifted Mary to the ground with quick, firm hand. They threw off their heavy coats and left them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look out for this junk now, sonny," he cried to the attendant, tossing him a half dollar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, Mike!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fill her up to the chin by the time we get back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Righto!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quickly they walked to the hotel and in five minutes were seated beside a window in the dining-room, watching the lazy roll of the sea sweep in on the sands at low tide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm hungry as a wolf!" he whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll eat everything in sight — start at the top and come down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He handed her the menu card and watched her from the depths beneath the drooping eyelids.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conscious of his gaze and rejoicing in its frank admiration, she ordered the dinner with instinctive good taste. No effort at conversation was made by either. They were both too hungry. As Jim lighted his cigarette when the coffee was served, he leaned back in his chair and watched the breakers in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the best dinner I ever had in my life," he said slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was good. We were hungry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've been hungry before, many a time. It was something else, too." He paused and rose abruptly. "Let's walk up the Beach."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd love to," she answered, slowly rising.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">BESIDE THE SEA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They strolled leisurely along the board-walk, found the sand, walked in the firm, dry line of the high-water mark for a mile to the east, and sat down on a clump of sea-grass on the top of a sand dune.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like this!" she cried joyously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So do I," he answered soberly, and lapsed into silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sun was warm and genial. The wind had died, and the waves of the rising tide were creeping up the long, sloping stretches of the sand with a lazy, soothing rush. A winter gull poised above their heads and soared seaward. The smoke of an ocean liner streaked the horizon as she swept toward the channel off Sandy Hook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim looked at the girl by his side and tried to speak. She caught the strained expression in his strong face and lowered her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He began to trace letters in the sand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She knew with unerring instinct that he had made his first desperate effort to speak his love and failed. Would he give it up and wait for weeks and possibly months — or would he storm the citadel in one mad rush at the beginning?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found his voice at last. He had recovered from the panic of his first impulse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, how do you like my idea of a good day as far as you've gone?" he asked lightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She met his gaze with perfect frankness. "The happiest day I ever spent in my life," she confessed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honest?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, shucks — what's the use!" he cried, with sudden fierce resolution. "You've got me, Kiddo, you've got me! I've been eatin' out of your hand since the minute I laid my eyes on you in that big room. I'm all yours. You can do anything you want with me. For God's sake, tell me that you like me a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The blood slowly mounted to her cheeks in red waves of tremulous emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like you very much," she said in low tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized her hand and held it in a desperate grip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love you, Kiddo," he went on passionately. "You don't mind me calling you Kiddo? You're so dainty and pretty and sweet, and that dimple keeps coming in your cheek, it just seems like that's the word — you don't mind?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know how I've been starvin' all my life for the love of a pure girl like you. You're the first one I ever spoke to. I was scared to death yesterday when I saw you. But I'd 'a' spoke to you if it killed me in my tracks. I couldn't help it. It just looked like an angel had dropped right down out of the gold clouds from that ceilin'. I was afraid I'd lose you in the crowd and never see you again. It didn't seem you were a stranger anyhow — I didn't seem strange to you, did I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her lips quivered, and she was silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you feel like you'd known me somewhere before?" he pleaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just felt you did, and that's what give me courage. Oh, Kiddo, you've got to love me a little — I've never been loved by a human soul in all my life. The first thing I remember was hidin' under a stoop from a brute who beat me every night. I ran away and slept in barrels and crawled into coal shutes till I was big enough to earn a livin' sellin' papers. For years I never knew what it meant to have enough to eat. I just scratched and fought my way through the streets like a little hungry wolf till I got in a blacksmith's shop down on South Street and learned to handle tools. I was quick and smart, and the old man liked me and let me sleep in the shop. I had enough to eat then and got strong as an ox. I went to the night schools and learned to read and write. I don't know anything, but I'm quick and you can teach me — you will, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try," was the low answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You do like me, Kiddo? Say it again!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose to her feet and looked out over the sea, her face scarlet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I do," she said at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sudden resistless sweep he clasped her in his arms and kissed her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her heart leaped in mad response to the first kiss a lover had ever given. Her body quivered and relaxed in his embrace. It was sweet — it was wonderful beyond words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He kissed her again, and she clung to him, lifting her eyes to his at last in a long, wondering gaze and then pressed her own lips to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, my God, Kiddo, you love me! It beats the world, don't it? Love at first sight for both of us!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I've heard about it, but I didn't think it would ever happen to me like this — did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook her head and bit her lips as the tears slowly dimmed her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It takes my breath," she murmured. "I can't realize what it all means. It seems too wonderful to be true."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you won't turn me down because I don't know who my father and mother was?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — my heart goes out to you in a great pity for your lonely, wretched boyhood."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't help that — now could I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not. It's wonderful that you've made your way alone and won the fight of life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gripped her hands and held her at arms' length, devouring her with his deep, slumbering eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, but you're a brick, little girl! I thought you were an angel when I first saw you. Now I know it. Just watch me work for you! I'll show you a thing or two. You'll marry me right away, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent close, his breath on her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes drooped under his passionate gaze, and the tears slowly stole down her cheeks. Her hour of life had struck! So suddenly, so utterly unexpectedly, it rang a thunderbolt from the clear sky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will, won't you?" he pleaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled at him through her tears and slowly said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't say yes today."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why — why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've swept me off my feet — I — I can't think."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want you to think — I want you to marry me right now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must have a little time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His face fell in despair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, little girl, don't turn me down — you'll kill me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not turning you down," she protested tenderly. "I only want time to see that I'm not crazy. I have to pinch myself to see if I'm awake. It all seems a dream" — she paused and lifted her radiant face to his — "a beautiful dream — the most wonderful my soul has ever seen. I must be sure it's real!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew her into his arms, and her body again relaxed in surrender as his lips touched hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't that the real thing?" he laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lay very still, her eyes closed, her face a scarlet flame. She was frightened at the swift realization of its overwhelming reality. The touch of his hand thrilled to the last fiber and nerve of her body. Her own trembling fingers clung to him with desperate longing tenderness. She roused herself with an effort and drew away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's enough now. I must have a little common-sense. Let's go — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He clung to her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll let me come to see you, tomorrow night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And the next night — and every night this week — what's the difference? There's nobody to say no, is there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll let me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tomorrow sure. Maybe you won't want to come the next night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I won't! Just wait and see!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized both hands again and held her at arms' length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't go yet — just let me look at you a minute more! The only girl I ever had in my life — and she's the prettiest thing God ever made on this earth. Ain't I the lucky boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must go now," she cried, blushing again under his burning eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dropped her hands suddenly and saluted military fashion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, teacher! I'm the little boy that does exactly what he's told."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They strolled leisurely along the shining sands in silence. Now and then his slender hand caught hers and crushed it. The moment he touched her a living flame flashed through her body — and through every moment of contact her nerves throbbed and quivered as if a musician were sweeping the strings of a harp. If this were not love, what could it be?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her whole being, body and soul, responded to his. Her body moved instinctively toward his, drawn by some hidden, resistless power. Her hands went out to meet his; her lips leaped to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She must test it with time, of course. And yet she knew by a deep inner sense that time could only fan the flame that had been kindled into consuming fire that must melt every barrier between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had asked him nothing of himself, his business or his future, and knew nothing except what he had told her in the first impetuous rush of his confession of love. No matter. The big thing today was the fact of love and the new radiance with which it was beginning to light the world. The effect was stunning. Their conversation had been the simplest of commonplace questions and answers — and yet the day was the one miracle of her life — her happiness something unthinkable until realized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had not asked time in order to know him better. She had only asked time to see herself more clearly in the new experience. Not for a moment did she raise the question of the worthiness of the man she loved. It was inconceivable that she should love a man not worthy of her. The only questions asked were soul-searching ones put to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the sweet, cool drive homeward, a hundred times she asked within:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this love?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And each time the answer came from the depths:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — yes — a thousand times yes. It's the voice of God. I feel it and I know it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He throttled the racer down to the lowest speed and took the longest road home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again and again he slipped his left hand from the wheel and pressed hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't let anybody knock me behind my back, now will you, little girl?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pressed his hand in answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't got a single friend in all God's world to stand up for me but just you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't need anyone," she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll give me a chance to get back at 'em if any of your friends knock me, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why should they dislike you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I ain't exactly one o' the high-flyers now am I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you're not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure enough?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then it's me for you, Kiddo, for this world and the next."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car swung suddenly to the curb and Mary lifted her eyes with a start to find herself in front of her home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim sprang to the ground and lifted her out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep this coat," he whispered. "We'll need it tomorrow. What time is your school out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At three o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can come at four?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't have to work tomorrow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hesitated a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I'm on a vacation till after Christmas. They're putting through my new patent."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He followed her inside the door and held her hand in the shadows of the hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, at four," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll be here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stooped and kissed her, turned and passed quickly out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood for a moment in the shadows and listened to the throb of the car until it melted into the roar of the city's life, her heart beating with a joy so new it was pain.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A VAIN APPEAL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A week passed on the wings of magic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every day at four o'clock the car was waiting at her door. The drab interior of the school-room had lost its terror. No annoyance could break the spell that reigned within. Her patience was inexhaustible, her temper serene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Walking with swift step down the Avenue to her home she wondered vaguely how she could have been lonely in all the music and the wonder of New York's marvelous life. The windows of the stores were already crowded with Christmas cheer, and busy thousands passed through their doors. Each man or woman was a swift messenger of love. Somewhere in the shadows of the city's labyrinth a human heart would beat with quickened joy for every step that pressed about these crowded counters. Love had given new eyes to see, new ears to hear and a new heart to feel the joys and sorrows of life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She hadn't given her consent yet. She was still asking her silly heart to be sure of herself. Of her lover, the depth and tenderness, the strength and madness of his love, there could be no doubt. Each day he had given new tokens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For Saturday afternoon she had told him not to bring the car.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they reached Fifth Avenue, across the Square, he stopped abruptly and faced her with a curious, uneasy look:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, tell me why you wanted to walk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had a good reason," she said evasively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, but why? It's a sin to lay that car up a day like this. Look here — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped and tried to gulp down his fears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here — you're not going to throw me down after leading me to the very top of the roof, are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked up with tender assurance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not today — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then why hoof it? Let me run round to the garage and shoot her out. You can wait for me at the Waldorf. I've always wanted to push my buzz-wagon up to that big joint and wait for my girl to trip down the steps."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I've a plan of my own today. Let me have my way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All righto — just so you're happy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am happy," she answered soberly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the foot of the broad stairs of the Library she paused and looked up smilingly at its majestic front.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come in a moment," she said softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He followed her wonderingly into the vaulted hall and climbed the grand staircase to the reading-room. She walked slowly to the shelf on which the Century Dictionary rested and looked laughingly at the seat in which she sat Saturday afternoon a week ago at exactly this hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim smiled, leaned close and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got you, Kiddo — I got you! Get out of here quick or I'll grab you and kiss you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She started and blushed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you dare!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beat it then — beat it — or I can't help it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned quickly and they passed through the catalogue room and lightly down the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held her soft, round arm with a grip that sent the blood tingling to the roots of her brown hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You understand now?" she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet! We walk the same way up the Avenue, through the Park to the little house on the laurel hill. And you're goin' to be sweet to me today, my Kiddo — I just feel it. I — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't be too sure, sir!" she interrupted, solemnly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laughed aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't fool me now — and I'm crazy as a June bug! You know I like to walk — if I can be with you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the Park entrance she stopped again and smiled roguishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll find a seat in one of the summer houses along the Fifty-ninth Street side."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," he responded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — we'll go on where we started!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a laugh, she slipped her hand through his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were a little scared of me last Saturday about this time, weren't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a little — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It hurt me, too, but I didn't let you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all right now — it's all right. Gee I but we've traveled some in a week, haven't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've known you more than a week," she protested gayly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure — I've known you since I was born."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They walked through the stately rows of elms on the Mall in joyous silence. Crowds of children and nurses, lovers and loungers, filled the seats and thronged the broad promenade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scarcely a word was spoken until they reached the rustic house nestling among the trees on the hill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a week by the calendar," she murmured. "And I've lived a lifetime."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all right then — little girl? You'll marry me right away? When — tonight?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hardly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tomorrow, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew the glove from her hand and held the slender fingers up before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can get the ring — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee! I do have to get a ring, don't I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why didn't you tell me? You know I never got married before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should hope not!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized her hand and kissed it, drew her into his arms, held her crushed and breathless and released her with a quick, impulsive movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll help me get it?" he asked eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A big white sparkler?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — no — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A plain little gold band."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me get you a big diamond!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — a plain gold band."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all settled then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're engaged. You're my fiance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But for God's sake, Kiddo — how long do I have to be a fiance?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A ripple of laughter rang through the trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you think we've done pretty well for seven days?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I could have settled it in seven minutes after we met," he answered complainingly. "You won't tell me the day yet?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not yet — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, we'll just have to take blessings as they come, then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the beautiful afternoon they sat side by side with close-pressed hands and planned the future which love had given. A modest flat far up among the trees on the cliffs overlooking the Hudson, they decided on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll begin with that," he cried enthusiastically, "but we won't stay there long. I've got big plans. I'm going to make a million. The white house down by the sea for me, a yacht out in the front yard and a half-dozen thundering autos in the garage. If this deal I'm on now goes through, I'll make my pile in a year — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They rose as the shadows lengthened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must go home and feed my pets," she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," he responded heartily. "I'll get the car and be there in a jiffy. We'll take a spin out to a road-house for dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her eyes tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can come right up to my room — now that we're engaged."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He swept her into his arms again, and held her in unresisting happiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was dark when he swung the gray car against the curb and sprang out. He didn't blow his horn for her to come down. The privilege she had granted was too sweet and wonderful. He wouldn't miss it for the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stairs were dark. Ella was late this afternoon getting back to her work. His light footstep scarcely made a sound. He found each step with quick, instinctive touch. The building seemed deserted. The tenants were all on trips to the country and the seashore. The day was one of rare beauty and warmth. Someone was fumbling in the dark on the third floor back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made his way quickly to her room, and softly knocked, waited a moment and knocked again. There was no response. He couldn't be mistaken. He had seen her lean out of that window every day the past week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps she was busy in the kitchenette and the noise from the street made it impossible to hear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He placed his hand on the doorknob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the darkness of the hall, in a quick, tiger leap, Ella threw herself on him and grappled for his throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you doing at that door, you dirty thief?" she growled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here! Here! What'ell — what's the matter with you?" he gasped, gripping her hands and tearing them from his neck. "I'm no thief!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are! You are, too!" she shrieked. "I heard you sneak in the door downstairs — heard you slippin' like a cat upstairs! Get out of here before I call a cop!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was savagely pushing him back to the landing of the stairs. With a sudden lurch, Jim freed himself and gripped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cut it! Cut it! Or I'll knock your block off! I've come to take my girl to ride — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew a match and quickly lighted the gas as Mary's footstep echoed on the stairs below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, she's coming now — we'll see," was the sullen answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella surveyed him from head to foot, her one eye gleaming in angry suspicion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary sprang up the last step and saw the two confronting each other. She had heard the angry voices from below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Ella, what's the matter?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He was trying to break into your room — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim threw up his hands in a gesture of rage, and Mary broke into a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, nonsense, Ella, I asked him to come! This is Mr. Anthony," — her voice dropped, — "my fiance."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella's figure relaxed with a look of surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, ja?" she murmured, as if dazed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — come in," she said to Jim. "Sorry I was out. I had to run to the grocer's for the Kitty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella glared at Jim, turned and began to light the other hall lamps without any attempt at apology.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim entered the room with a look of awe, took in its impression of sweet, homelike order and recovered quickly his composure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, you're the dandy little housekeeper! I could stay here forever."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You like it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a bird's nest " He glanced in the mirror and saw the print of Ella's fingers on his collar. "Will you look at that?" he growled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's too bad," she said, sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know I thought a she-tiger had got loose from the Bronx and jumped on me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm awfully sorry," she apologized. "Ella's very fond of me. She was trying to protect me. She couldn't see who it was in the dark."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; I reckon not," Jim laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've changed our plans for the evening," she announced. "We won't go to ride tonight. I want you to bring my best friend to dinner with us at Mouquin's. Go after her in the car. I want to impress her — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got you, Kiddo! She's goin' to look me over — eh? All right, I'll stop at the store and get a clean collar. I wouldn't like her to see the print of that tiger's claw on my neck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's her address the Gainsborough Studios. Drop me at Mouquin's and I'll have the table set in one of the small rooms upstairs. I'll meet you at the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim glanced at the address, put it in his pocket and helped her draw on her heavy coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll be nice to Jane? I want her to like you. She's the only real friend I've ever had in New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll do my best for you, little girl," he promised.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dropped her at the wooden cottage-front on Sixth Avenue near Twenty-eighth Street, and returned in twenty minutes with Jane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the tall artist led the way upstairs, Jim whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, for God's sake, let me out of this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's a frost. If I have to sit beside her an hour I'll catch cold and die. I swear it; save me! Save my life!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sh! It's all right. She's fine and generous when you know her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had reached the door and Mary pushed him in. There was no help for it. He'd have to make the most of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dinner was a dismal failure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane Anderson was polite and genial, but there was a straight look of wonder in her clear gray eyes that froze the blood in Jim's veins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary tried desperately for the first half-hour to put him at his ease. It was useless. The attack of Ella had upset his nerves, and the unexpressed hostility of Jane had completely crushed his spirits. He tried to talk once, stammered and lapsed into a sullen silence from which nothing could stir him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two girls at last began to discuss their own affairs and the dinner ended in a sickening failure that depressed and angered Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The agony over at last, she rose and turned to Jim:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can go now, sir — I'll take Jane home with me for a friendly chat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank God!" he whispered, grinning in spite of his effort to keep a straight face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tomorrow?" he asked in low tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At eight o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim bowed awkwardly to Jane, muttered something inarticulate and rushed to his car.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two girls walked in silence through Twenty-eighth Street to Broadway and thence across the Square.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seated in her room, Mary could contain her pent-up rage no longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jane Anderson, I'm furious with you! How could you be so rude — so positively insulting!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Insulting?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. You stared at him in cold disdain as if he were a toad under your feet!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I assure you, dear — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why did you do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The artist rose, walked to the window, looked out on the Square for a moment, extended her hand and laid it gently on Mary's shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've made up your mind to marry this man, honey?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I certainly have," was the emphatic answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane paused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And all in seven days?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seven days or seven years — what does it matter? He's my mate — we love — it's Fate."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's incredible!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's incredible?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Such madness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps love is madness — the madness that makes life worth the candle. I've never lived before the past week."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you, the dainty, cultured, pious little saint, will marry this — this — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say it! I want you to be frank — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perfectly frank?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Absolutely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This coarse, ugly, illiterate brute — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jane Anderson, how dare you!" Mary sprang to her feet, livid with rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I asked if I might be frank. Shall I lie to you? Or shall I tell you what I think?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say what you please; it doesn't matter," Mary interrupted angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I only speak at all because I love you. Your common-sense should tell you that I speak with reluctance. But now that I have spoken, let me beg of you for your father's sake, for your dead mother's sake, for my sake — I'm your one disinterested friend and you know that my love is real — for the sake of your own soul's salvation in this world and the next — don't marry that brute! Commit suicide if you will — jump off the bridge — take poison, cut your throat, blow your brains out — but, oh dear God, not this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why, may I ask?" was the cold question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's in no way your equal in culture, in character, in any of the essentials on which the companionship of marriage must be based — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's a diamond in the rough," Mary staunchly asserted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's in the rough, all right! The only diamond about him is the one in his red scarf — `Take it from me, Kiddo! Take it from me!'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her last sentence was a quotation from Jim, her imitation of his slang so perfect Mary's cheeks flamed anew with anger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll teach him to use good English — never fear. In a month he'll forget his slang and his red scarf."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean that in a month you'll forget to use good English and his style of dress will be yours. Oh, honey, can't you see that such a man will only drag you down, down to his level? Can it be possible that you — that you really love him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I adore him and I'm proud of his love!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now listen! You believe in an indissoluble marriage, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the first article of your creed — that marriage is a holy sacrament, that no power on earth or in hell can ever dissolve its bonds? Fools rush in where angels fear to tread, my dear! They always have — they always will, I suppose. This is peculiarly true of your type of woman — the dainty, clinging girl of religious enthusiasm. You're peculiarly susceptible to the physical power of a brutal lover. Your soul glories in submission to this force. The more coarse and brutal its attraction the more abject and joyful the surrender. Your religion can't save you because your religion is purely emotional — it is only another manifestation of your sex emotions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How can you be so sacrilegious!" the girl interrupted with a look of horror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It may shock you, dear, but I'm telling you one of the simplest truths of Nature. You'd as well know it now as later. The moment you wake to realize that your emotions have been deceived and bankrupted, your faith will collapse. At least keep, your grip on common-sense. Down in the cowardly soul of every weak woman — perhaps of every woman — is the insane desire to be dominated by a superior brute force. The woman of the lower classes — the peasant of Russia, for example, whose sex impulses are of all races the most violent — refuses with scorn the advances of the man who will not strike her. The man who can't beat his wife is beneath contempt — he is no man at all — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary broke into a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Really, Jane, you cease to be serious you're a joke. For Heaven's sake use a little common-sense yourself. You can't be warning me that my lover is marrying me in order to use his fists on me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps not, dear," — the artist smiled; "there might be greater depths for one of your training and character. I'm just telling you the plain truth about the haste with which you're rushing into this marriage. There's nothing divine in it. There's no true romance of lofty sentiment. It's the simplest and most elemental of all the brutal facts of animal life. That it is resistless in a woman of your culture and refinement makes it all the more pathetic — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl rose with a gesture of impatience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's no use, Jane dear; we speak a different language. I don't in the least know what you're talking about, and what's more, I'm glad I don't. I've a vague idea that your drift is indecent. But we're different. I realize that. I don't sit in judgment on you. You're wasting your breath on me. I'm going into this marriage with my eyes wide open. It's the fulfillment of my brightest hopes and aspirations. That I shall be happy with this man and make him supremely happy I know by an intuition deeper and truer than reason. I'm going to trust that intuition without reservation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, honey," the artist agreed with a smile. "I won't say anything more, except that you're fooling yourself about the depth of this intuitive knowledge. Your infatuation is not based on the verdict of your deepest and truest instincts."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On what, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The crazy ideals of the novels you've been reading — that's all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ridiculous!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're absolutely sure, for instance, that God made just one man the mate of one woman, aren't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As sure as that I live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you learn it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So long ago I can't remember."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not in your Bible?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Sunday school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Craddock didn't tell you that, did he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hardly — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought not. He has too much horse-sense in spite of his emotional gymnastics. You learned it in the first dime-novel you read."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never read a dime-novel in my life," she interrupted, indignantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know — you paid a dollar and a quarter for it — but it was a dime-novel. The philosophy of this school of trash you have built into a creed of life. How can you be so blind? How can you make so tragic a blunder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just it, Jane: I couldn't if your impressions of his character were true. I couldn't make a mistake about so vital a question. I couldn't love him if he really were a coarse, illiterate brute. What you see is only on the surface. He hasn't had his chance yet — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is he? What does he do? Who are his people?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has no people — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love him all the more deeply," she went on firmly, "because of his miserable childhood. I'll do my best to make up for the years of cruelty and hunger and suffering through which he passed. What right have you to sit in judgment on him without a hearing? You've known him two hours — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane shrugged her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Two minutes was quite enough."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you judge by what standard?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My five senses, and my sixth sense above all. One look at his square bulldog jaw, his massive neck and the deformity of his delicate hands and feet! I hear the ignorant patois of the East Side underworld. I smell the brimstone in his suppressed rage at my dislike. There's something uncanny in the sensuous droop of his heavy eyelids and the glitter of his steel-blue eyes. There's something incongruous in his whole personality. I was afraid of him the moment I saw him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary broke into hysterical laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And if my five senses and my intuitions contradict yours? Who is to decide? If I loved him on sight — If I looked into his eyes and saw the soul of my mate? If their cold fires thrill me with inexpressible passion? If I see in his massive neck and jaw the strength of an irresistible manhood, the power to win success and to command the world? If I see in his slender hands and small feet lines of exquisite beauty — am I to crush my senses and strangle my love to please your idiotic prejudice?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane threw up her hands in despair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not! If you're blind and deaf I can't keep you from committing suicide. I'd lock you up in an asylum for the insane if I had the power to save you from the clutches of the brute."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary drew herself erect and faced her friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please don't repeat that word in my hearing — there's a limit to friendship. I think you'd better go — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jane rose and walked quickly to the door, her lips pressed firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As you like — our lives will be far apart from tonight. It's just as well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She closed the door with a bang and reached the head of the stairs before Mary threw her arms around her neck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please, dear, forgive me — don't go in anger."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The older woman kissed her tenderly, glad of the dim light to hide her own tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, it's all right, honey — I won't remember it. Forgive me for my ugly words."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love him, Jane — I love him! It's Fate. Can't you understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear, I understand, and I'll love you always — good-by."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll come to my wedding?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll let you know — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another kiss, and Jane Anderson strode down the stairs and out into the night with a sickening, helpless fear in her heart.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">JIM'S TRIAL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The quarrel had left Mary in a quiver of exalted rage. How dare a friend trample her most sacred feelings! She pitied Jane Anderson and her tribe — these modern feminine leaders of a senseless revolution against man — they were crazy. They had all been disappointed in some individual and for that reason set themselves up as the judges of mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank God my soul has not been poisoned!" she exclaimed aloud with fervor. "How strange that these women who claim such clear vision can be so stupidly blind!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She busied herself with her little household, and made up her mind once and for all time to be done with such friendships. The friendship of such women was a vain thing. They were vicious cats at heart — not like her gentle Persian kitten whose soul was full of sleepy sunlight. These modern insurgents were wild, half-starved stray cats that had been hounded and beaten until they had lapsed into their elemental brute instincts. They were so aggravating, too, they deserved no sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again she thanked God that she was not one of them — that her heart was still capable of romantic love — a love so sudden and so overwhelming that it could sweep life before it in one mad rush to its glorious end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She woke next morning with a dull sense of depression. The room was damp and chilly. It was storming. The splash of rain against the window and the muffled roar from the street below meant that the wind was high and the day would be a wretched one outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They couldn't take their ride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a double disappointment. She had meant to have him dash down to Long Beach and place the ring on her finger seated on that same bright sand-dune overlooking the sea. Instead, they must stay indoors. Jim was not at his best indoors. She loved him behind the wheel with his hand on the pulse of that racer. The machine seemed a part of his being. He breathed his spirit into its steel heart, and together they swept her on and on over billowy clouds through the gates of Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no help for it. They would spend the time together in her room planning the future. It would be sweet — these intimate hours in her home with the man she loved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Should she spend a whole day alone there with him? Was it just proper? Was it really safe? Nonsense! The vile thoughts which Jane had uttered had poisoned her, after all. She hated her self that she could remember them. And yet they filled her heart with dread in spite of every effort to laugh them off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How could Jane Anderson dare say such things?" she muttered angrily. "`A coarse, illiterate brute!' It's a lie! a lie! a lie!" She stamped her foot in rage. "He's strong and brave and masterful — a man among men — he's my mate and I love him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet the frankness with which her friend had spoken had in reality disturbed her beyond measure. Through every hour of the day her uneasiness increased. After all she was utterly alone and her life had been pitifully narrow. Her knowledge of men she had drawn almost exclusively from romantic fiction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was just a little strange that Jim persisted in living so completely in the present and the future. He had told her of his pitiful childhood. He had told her of his business. It had been definite — the simple statement he made — and she accepted it without question until Jane Anderson had dropped these ugly suspicions. She hated the meddler for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the light of such suspicions the simplest, bravest man might seem a criminal. How could her friend be blind to the magnetism of this man's powerful personality? Bah! She was jealous of their perfect happiness. Why are women so contemptible?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She began a careful study of every trait of her lover's character, determined to weigh him by the truest standards of manhood. Certainly he was no weakling. The one abomination of her soul was the type of the city degenerate she saw simpering along Broadway and Fifth Avenue at times. Jim was brave to the point of rashness. No man with an ounce of cowardice in his being could handle a car in every crisis with such cool daring and perfect control. He was strong. He could lift her body as if it were a feather. His arms crushed her with terrible force. He could earn a living for them both. There could be no doubt about that. His faultless clothes, the ease with which he commanded unlimited credit among the automobile manufacturers and dealers — every supply store on Broadway seemed to know him — left no doubt on that score.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was just a bit of mystery and reserve about his career as an inventor. His first success that had given him a start he had not explained. The big deal about the new carburetor she could, of course, understand. He had a workshop all his own. He had told her this the first day they met. She would ask him to take her to see it this afternoon. The storm would prevent the trip to the Beach. She would ask this, not because she doubted his honesty, but because she really wished to see the place in which he worked. It was her workshop now, as well as his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment her suspicions were sickening. Suppose he had romanced about his workshop and his room? Supposed he lived somewhere in the squalid slums of the lower East Side and his people, after all, were alive? Perhaps a drunken father and a coarse, brutal mother — and sisters —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped with a frown and clenched her fists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would ask Jim to show her his workshop. That would be enough. If he had told her the truth about that she would make up to him in tender abandonment of utter trust for every suspicion she harbored.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car was standing in front of her door. He waved for her to come down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jump right in!" he called gayly. "I've got an extra rubber blanket for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the storm, Jim?" she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Surest thing you know. It's great to fly through a storm. You can just ride on its wings. Throw on your raincoat and come on quick! I'm going to run down to the Beach. Who's afraid of an old storm with this thing under us?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her heart gave a bound. Her longing had reached her lover and brought him through the storm to do her bidding. It was wonderful — this oneness of soul and body.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was happy again — supremely, divinely happy. The man by her side knew and understood. She knew and understood. She loved this daring spirit that rose to the wind — this iron will that brooked no interference with his plans, even from Nature, when it crossed his love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sting of the raindrops against her cheek was exhilarating. The car glided over the swimming roadway like a great gray gull skimming the beach at low tide. Her soul rose. The sun of a perfect faith and love was shining now behind the clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She nestled close to his side and watched him tenderly from the corners of her half-closed eyes, her whole being content in his strength. The idea of dashing through a blinding rain to the Beach on such a day would have been to her mind an unthinkable piece of madness. She was proud of his daring. It would be hers to shield from the storms of life. She loved the rugged lines of his massive jaw in profile. How could Jane be such a fool as to call him ugly!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weather, of course, prevented them from walking up the Beach to their sand-dune. The walk would have been all right — but it was out of the question to sit down there and give her the ring in the pouring rain. She knew this as well as he. She knew, too, that he had the ring in his pocket, though he had carefully refrained from referring to it in any way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led her to a secluded nook behind a pillar in the little parlor. The hotel was deserted. They had the building almost to themselves. A log fire crackled in the open fireplace, and he drew a settee close. The wind had moderated and the rain was pouring down in straight streams, rolling in soft music on the roof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew the ring from his pocket. "Well, Kiddo, I got it. The fellow said this was all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held the tiny gold band before her shining eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Slip it on!" she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which one?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This one, silly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She extended her third finger, as he pressed the ring slowly on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Seems to me a mighty little one and a mighty cheap one, but he said it was the thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's all right, dear," she whispered. "Kiss me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pressed his lips to hers and held them until she sank back and lifted her hand in warning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be careful!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whose afraid?" Jim muttered, glancing over his shoulder toward the door. "Now tell me what day — tomorrow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense, man!" she cried. "Give me time to breathe — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just to realize that I'm engaged — to plan and think and dream of the wonderful day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're losing time — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll never live these wonderful hours over again, dear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's face fell and his voice was pitiful in its funereal notes: "Lord, I thought the ring settled it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And so it does, dear — it does —" "She extended her third finger, as he pressed the ring slowly on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not if that long-legged spider that took dinner with us the other night gets in her fine work. I'll bet that she handed me a few when you got home?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary was silent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now didn't she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To the best of her ability — yes — but I didn't mind her silly talk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, but I'd love to give her a bouquet of poison ivy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We had an awful quarrel — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you stood up for me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know I did!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, I don't give a tinker's damn what anybody says if you stand by me! In all this world there's just you — for me. There's never been anybody else — and there never will be. I'm that kind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I love you for it!" she cried, with rapture pressing his hand in both of hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did she say about me, anyhow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing worth repeating. I've forgotten it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim held her gaze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's funny how you love anybody the minute you lay eyes on 'em — or hate 'em the same way. I wanted to choke her the minute she opened her yap to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forget it, dear," she broke in briskly. "I want you to take me to see your workshop tomorrow — will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A flash of suspicion shot from the depths of his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did she tell you to ask me that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not! I'm just interested in everything you do. I want to see where you work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's no place for a sweet girl to go — that part of town."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I'll be with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want you to go down there," he sullenly maintained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But why, dear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a low, dirty place. I had to locate the shop there to get the room I needed for the rent I could pay. It's not fit for you. I'm going to move uptown in a little while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please let me go," she pleaded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shook his head emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned away to hide the tears. The first real, hideous fear she had ever had about him caught her heart in spite of every effort to fight it down. His workshop might be a myth after all. He had failed in the first test to which she had put him. It was horrible. All the vile suggestions of Jane Anderson rushed now into her memory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She struggled bravely to keep her head and not break down. It was beyond her strength. A sob strangled her, and she buried her face in her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim looked at her in helpless anguish for a moment, started to gather her in his arms and looked around the room in terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaned over her and whispered tensely:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For God's sake, Kiddo — don't — don't do that! I didn't mean to hurt you — honest, I didn't. Don't cry any more and I'll take you right down to the black hole, and let you sleep on the floor if you want to. Gee! I'll give you the whole place, tools, junk and all — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you, Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure I will! We start this minute if you want to go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She glanced over his shoulder to see that no one was looking, threw her arms around his neck and kissed him again and again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was the first time you ever said no, dear, and it hurt. I'm happy again now. If you'll just let me see you in the shop for five minutes I'll never ask you again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right — tomorrow when you get out of school. I'll take you down. Holy Mike, that was a dandy kiss! Let's quarrel again — start something else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose laughing and brushed the last trace of tears from her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's eat dinner now — I'm hungry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By George, I'd forgot all about the feed!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By eight o'clock the storm had abated; the rain suddenly stopped, and the moon peeped through the clouds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drove the big racer back at a steady, even stride on her lowest notch of speed — half the time with only his right hand on the wheel and his left gripping hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the lights of Manhattan flashed from the hills beyond the Queensborough Bridge, he leaned close and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Happy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perfectly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The car was waiting the next day at half-past three.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's not far," he said, nodding carelessly. "You needn't put on the coat. Be there in a jiffy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down Twenty-third Street to Avenue A, down the avenue to Eighteenth Street, and then he suddenly swung the machine through Eighteenth into Avenue B and stopped below a low, red brick building on the corner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He set his brakes with a crash, leaped out and extended his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't like to take you up these stairs at the back of that saloon, little girl, but you would come. Now don't blame me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pressed his arm tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I won't blame you. I'm proud and happy to share your life and help you. I'm surprised to see everything so quiet down here. I thought all the East Side was packed with crowded tenements."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," he answered, in a matter-of-fact way. "About the only excitement we have in this quarter is an occasional gas explosion in the plant over there, and the noise of the second-hand material men unloading iron. The tenements haven't been built here yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led her quickly past the back door of the saloon and up two narrow flights of stairs to the top of the building, drew from his pocket the key to a heavy padlock and slipped the crooked bolt from the double staples. He unlocked the door with a second key and pushed his way in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All righto," he cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The straight, narrow hall inside was dark. He fumbled in his pocket and lit the gas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The workshop first, or my sleeping den?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The workshop first!" she whispered excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had made the reality of this shop the supreme test of Jim's word and character. She was in a fever of expectant uncertainty as to its equipment and practical use.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He unlocked the door leading to the front.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's my den — we'll come back here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He passed quickly to the further end of the hall and again used two keys to open the door, and held it back for her to enter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sorry it's so dirty — if you get your pretty dress all ruined — it's not my fault, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary surveyed the room with an exclamation of delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, what a wonderful place! Why, Jim, you're a magician!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There could be no doubt about the practical use to which the shop was being put. Its one small window opened on a fire escape in the narrow court in the rear. A skylight in the middle opened with a hinge on the roof and flooded the space with perfect light. An iron ladder swung from the skylight and was hooked up against the ceiling by a hasp fastened to a staple over a work-bench. On one side of the room was a tiny blacksmith's forge, an anvil, hammers and a complete set of tools for working in rough iron. A small gasoline engine supplied the power which turned his lathe and worked the drills, saw and plane. On the other side of the room was arranged a fairly complete chemical laboratory with several retorts, and an oxyhydrogen blow-pipe capable of developing the powerful heat used in the melting and brazing of metals. Beneath the benches were piled automobile supplies of every kind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know how to use all these machines, Jim?" she asked in wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, and then some!" he answered with a wave of his slender hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a wizard — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now the den?" he said briskly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She followed him through the hall and into the large front corner room overlooking Avenue B and Eighteenth Street. The morning sun flooded the front and the afternoon sun poured into the side windows. The furniture was solid mahogany — a bed, bureau, chiffonier, couch and three chairs. The windows were fitted with wood-paneled shutters, shades and heavy draperies. A thick, soft carpet of faded red covered the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a nice room, Jim, but I'd like to dust it for you," she said with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. I'm for giving you the right to dust it every morning, Kiddo, beginning now. Let's find a preacher tonight!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She blushed and moved a step toward the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a little while. You know it's been only ten days since we met — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But we've lived some in that time, haven't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An eternity, I think," she said reverently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to marry right now, girlie!" he pleaded desperately. "If that spider gets you in her den again, I just feel like it's good night for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense. You can't believe me such a silly child. I'm a woman. I love you. Do you think the foolish prejudice of a friend could destroy my love for the man whom I have chosen for my mate?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, but I want it fixed and then it's fixed — and they can say what they please. Marry me tonight! You've got the ring. You're going to in a little while, anyhow. What's the use to wait and lose these days out of our life? What's the sense of it? Don't you know me by this time? Don't you trust me by this time?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She slipped her hand gently into his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I trust you utterly. And I feel that I've known you since the day I was born — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then why — why wait a minute?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't understand a girl's feelings, dear — only a little while and it's all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat down on the couch in silence, rose and walked to the window. She watched him struggling with deep emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look here, Kiddo, I've got to leave on that trip to the mountains of North Carolina. I've got to get down there before Christmas. I must be back here by the first of the year. Gee — I can't go without you! You don't want to stay here without me, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sudden pallor overspread her face. For the first time she realized how their lives had become one in the sweet intimacy of the past ten days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must go now?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I've made my arrangements. I've business back here the first of the year that can't wait. Marry me and go with me. We'll take our honeymoon down there. By George, we'll go together in the car! Every day by each other's side over hundreds and hundreds of miles! Say, ain't you game? Come on! It's a crime to send me away without you. How can you do it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't — I'm afraid," she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll marry me, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes!" she whispered. "What is the latest day you can start?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Next Saturday, if we go in the car — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," — she was looking straight into the depths of his soul now — "next Saturday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He clasped her in his arms and held her with desperate tenderness.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">ELLA'S SECRET</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The consummation of her life's dream was too near, too sweet and wonderful for Jane's croakings to distress Mary Adams beyond the moment. She had, of course, wished her friend to be present at the wedding — yet the curt refusal had only aroused anew her pity at stupid prejudices. It was out of the question to ask her father to leave his work in the Kentucky mountains and come all the way to New York. She would surprise him with the announcement. After all, she was the one human being vitally concerned in this affair, and the only one save the man whose life would be joined to hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In five minutes after the painful scene with Jane she had completely regained her composure, and her face was radiant with happiness when she waved to Jim. He was standing before the door in the car, waiting to take her to the City Hall to get the marriage license.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee!" he cried, "you're the prettiest, sweetest thing that ever walked this earth, with those cheeks all flaming like a rose! Are you happy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gloriously."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She motioned him to keep his seat and sprang lightly to his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aren't you happy, sir?" she added gayly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am, yes — but to tell you the truth, I'm beginning to get scared. You know what to do, don't you, when we get before that preacher?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, silly — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never saw a wedding in my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pressed his hand tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honestly, Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I swear it. You'll have to tell me how to behave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll rehearse it all tonight. I'll show you. I've seen hundreds of people married. My father's a preacher, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I know that," he went on solemnly; "that's what gives me courage. I knew you'd understand everything. I'm counting on you, Kiddo — if you fall down, we're gone. I'll run like a turkey."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's easy," she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And this license business — how do we go about that? What'll they do to us?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing, goose! We just march up to the clerk and demand the license. He asks us a lot of questions — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Questions! What sort of questions?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The names of your father and mother — whether you've been married before and where you live and how old you are — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ask you about your business?" he interrupted, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. They think if you can pay the license fee you can support your wife, I suppose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, here. It used to be two dollars in Kentucky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's cheap — must come higher in this burg. I brought along a hundred."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a lot of graft in this town. I'll be ready. I've got to get 'em — don't care how high they come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There'll be no graft in this, Jim," she protested gayly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it'll be the first time I ever got by without it — believe me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ease with which the license was obtained was more than Jim could understand. All the way back from the City Hall he expected to be held up at every corner. He kept looking over his shoulder to see if they were being followed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arrived in her room, they discussed their plans for the day of days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll come round soon in the morning, and we'll spend the whole day at the Beach," he suggested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her hands in protest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — no!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not on our wedding-day, Jim!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's not good form. The groom should not see the bride that day until they meet at the altar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's change it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir, the old way's the best. I'll spend the day in saying good-by to the past. You'll call for me at six o'clock. We'll go to Dr. Craddock's house and be married in time for our wedding dinner."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lover smiled, and his drooping eyelids fell still lower as he watched her intently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want that dinner here in this little place, Kiddo — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She blushed and protested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought we'd go to the Beach and spend the night there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, girlie, here! I love this little place — it's so like you. Get the old wild-cat who cleans up for you to fix us a dinner here all by ourselves — wouldn't she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She'd do anything for me — yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then fix it here — I want to be just with you — don't you understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," she whispered. "But I'd rather spend that first day of our new life in a strange place — and the Beach we both love — hadn't you just as leave go there, Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. The waiters will stare at us, and hear us talk — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can have our meals served in our room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is better," he insisted. "I want to spend one day here alone with you, before we go — just to feel that you're all mine. You see, if I walk in here and own the place, I'll know that better than any other way. I've just set my heart on it, Kiddo — what's the difference?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her lips to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, dear. It shall be as you wish. Tomorrow I will be all yours — in life, in death, in eternity. Your happiness will be the one thing for which I shall plan and work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella was very happy in the honor conferred on her. She was given entire charge of the place, and spent the day in feverish preparation for the dinner. She insisted on borrowing a larger table from the little fat woman next door, to hold the extra dishes. She dressed herself in her best. Her raven black hair was pressed smooth and shining down the sides of her pale temples.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The work was completed by three o'clock in the afternoon, and Mary lay in her window lazily watching the crowds scurrying home. The offices closed early on Saturday afternoons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella was puttering about the room, adding little touches here and there in a pretense of still being busy. As a matter of fact, she was watching the girl from her one eye with a wistful tenderness she had not dared as yet to express in words. Twice Mary had turned suddenly and seen her thus. Each time Ella had started as if caught in some act of mischief and asked an irrelevant question to relieve her embarrassment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary could feel her single eye fixed on her now in a deep, brooding look. It made her uncomfortable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned slowly and spoke in gentle tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been so sweet to me today, Ella — father and mother and best friend. I'll never forget your kindness. You'd better rest awhile now until we go to Dr. Craddock's. I want you to be there, too — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To see the marriage — ja?" she asked softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, my dear, no — I stay here and wait for you to come. I keep the lights burning bright. I welcome the bride and groom to their little home — ja ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A quick glance of suspicion shot from Mary's blue eyes. Could it be possible that this forlorn scrubwoman would carry her hostility to her lover to the same point of ungracious refusal to witness the ceremony? It was nonsense, of course. Ella would feel out of place in the minister's parlor, that was all. She wouldn't insist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Ella; you can receive us here with ceremony. You'll be our maid, butler, my father, my mother and my friends!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a moment's silence and still no move on Ella's part to go. The girl felt her single eye again fixed on her in mysterious, wistful gaze. She would send her away if it were possible without hurting her feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted her eyes suddenly, and Ella stirred awkwardly and smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope you are very happy, meine liebe — ja?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't be happier if I were in Heaven," was the quick answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm so glad — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again an awkward pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was once young and pretty like you, meine liebe ," she began dreamily, " — slim and straight and jolly — always laughing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary held her breath in eager expectancy. Ella was going to lift the veil from the mystery of her life, stirred by memories which the coming wedding had evoked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you had a thrilling romance — Ella? I always felt it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again silence, and then in low tones the woman told her story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ja — a romance, too. I was so young and foolish — just a baby myself — not sixteen. But I was full of life and fun, and I had a way of doing what I pleased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The man was older than me — Oh, a lot older — with gray hairs on the side of his head. I was wild about him. I never took to kids. They didn't seem to like me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused as if hesitating to give her full confidence, and quickly went on:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My folks were German. They couldn't speak English. I learned when I was five years old. They didn't like my lover. We quarrel day and night. I say they didn't like him because they could not speak his language. They say he was bad. I fight for him, and run away and marry him — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again she paused and drew a deep breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, I was one happy little fool that year! He make good wages on the docks — a stevedore. They had a strike, and he got to drinking. The baby came — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had a little baby, Ella?" the girl asked in a tender whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ja — ja" she sobbed — "so sweet, so good — so quiet — so beautiful she was. I was very happy — like a little girl with a doll — only she laugh and cry and coo and pull my hair! He stop the drink a little while when she come, and he got work. And then he begin worse and worse. It seem like he never loved me any more after the baby. He curse me, he quarrel. He begin to strike me sometimes. I laugh and cry at first and make up and try again — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again she paused as if for courage to go on, and choked into silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — and then?" the girl asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And then he come home one night wild drunk. He stumble and fall across the cradle and hurt my baby so she never cry — just lie still and tremble — her eyes wide open at first and then they droop and close and she die!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He laugh and curse and strike me, and I fight him like a tiger. He was strong — he throw me down on the floor and gouge my eye out with his big claw — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, my God," Mary sobbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella sprang to her feet and bent over the girl with trembling eagerness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You keep my secret, meine liebe?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I never tell a soul on earth what I tell you now — I just eat my heart out and keep still all the years, I can tell you — ja?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I'll keep it sacred — go on — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I know he gouge my eye out, I go wild. I get my hand on his throat and choke him still. I drag him to the stairs and throw him head first all the way down to the bottom. He fall in a heap and lie still. I run down and drag him to the door. I kick his face and he never move. He was dead. I kick him again — and again. And then I laugh — I laugh — I laugh in his dead face — I was so glad I kill him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sank in a paroxysm of sobs on the floor, and the girl touched her smooth black hair tenderly, strangled with her own emotions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella rose at last and brushed the tears from her hollow cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, you know, meine liebe! Why I tell you this today, I don't know — maybe I must! I dream once like you dream today — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl slipped her arms around the drooping, pathetic figure and stroked it tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The sunshine is for some, maybe," Ella went on pathetically; "for some the clouds and the storms. I hope you are very, very happy today and all the days — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will be, Ella, I'm sure. I'll always love you after this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe I make you sad because I tell you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — no! I'm glad you told me. The knowledge of your sorrow will make my life the sweeter. I shall be more humble in my joy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It never occurred to the girl for a moment that this lonely, broken woman had torn her soul's deepest secret open in a last pathetic effort to warn her of the danger of her marriage. The wistful, help less look in her eye meant to Mary only the anguish of memories. Each human heart persists in learning the big lessons of life at first hand. We refuse to learn any other way. The tragedies of others interest us as fiction. We make the application to others — never to ourselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's familiar footstep echoed through the hall, and Mary sprang to the door with a cry of joy.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WEDDING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella hurried into the kitchenette and busied herself with dinner. Jim's unexpectedly early arrival broke the spell of the tragedy to which Mary had listened with breathless sympathy. Her own future she faced without a shadow of doubt or fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her reproaches to Jim were entirely perfunctory, on the sin of his early call on their wedding-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Naughty boy!" she cried with mock severity. "At this unseemly hour!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He glanced about the room nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anybody in there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He nodded toward the kitchenette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only Ella — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Send her away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Quick, Kiddo — quick!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary let Ella out from the little private hall without her seeing Jim, and returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For heaven's sake, man, what ails you?" she asked excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say — I forgot that thing already. We got to go over it again. What if I miss it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The ceremony?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He mopped his brow and looked at his watch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the time we get to that preacher's house, I won't know my first name if you don't help me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary laughed softly and kissed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can't miss it. All you've got to do is say, `I will' when he asks you the question, put the ring on my finger when he tells you, and repeat the words after him — he and I will do the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say my question over again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"`Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked at him and laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't you answer?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — that's the end of the question. Say, `I will.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I will all right! What scares me is that I'll jump in on him and say `I will' before he gets halfway through. Seems to me when he says, `Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife?' I'll just have to choke myself there to keep from saying, `You bet your life I will, Parson!'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It won't hurt anything if you say, `I will' several times," she assured him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It wouldn't queer the job?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not in the least. I've often heard them say, `I will' two or three times. Wait until you hear the words, `so long as ye both shall live — '"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"`So long as ye both shall live,'" he repeated solemnly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The other speech you say after the minister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't bite off more than I can chew at one time, will he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, silly — just a few words — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because if he does, I'll choke."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim drew his watch again, mopped his brow, and gazed at Mary's serene face with wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, Kiddo, you're immense — you're as cool as a cucumber!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course. Why not? It's my day of joy and perfect peace — the day I've dreamed of since the dawn of maidenhood. I'm marrying the man of my choice — the one man God made for me of all men on earth. I know this — I'm content."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let me hang around here till time — won't you?" he asked helplessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must have Ella come back to fix the table."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. I just didn't want her to hear me tell you that I had cold feet. I'm better now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ella moved about the room with soft tread, watching Jim with sullen, concentrated gaze when he was not looking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lovers sat on the couch beside the window, holding each other's hands and watching in silence the hurrying crowds pass below. Now that his panic was over, Jim began to breathe more freely, and the time swiftly passed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the shadows slowly fell, they rang the bell at the parson's house beside the church, and his good wife ushered them into the parlor. The little Craddocks crowded in — six of them, two girls and four boys, their ages ranging from five to nineteen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sweet memories crowded the girl's heart from her happy childhood. She had never missed one of these affairs at home. Her father was a very popular minister and his home the Mecca of lovers for miles around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Craddock, like her father, was inclined to be conservative in his forms. Marriage he held with the old theologians to be a holy sacrament. He never used the new-fangled marriage vows. He stuck to the formula of the Book of Common Prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When she stood before the preacher in this beautiful familiar scene which she had witnessed so many times at home, Mary's heart beat with a joy that was positively silly. She tried to be serious, and the dimple would come in her cheek in spite of every effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Craddock's musical voice began the opening address, the memory of a foolish incident in her father's life flashed through her mind, and she wondered if Jim in his excitement had forgotten his pocket-book and couldn't pay the preacher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dearly beloved," he began, "we are gathered together here in the sight of God — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary tried to remember that she was in the sight of God, but she was so foolishly happy she could only remember that funny scene. A long-legged Kentucky mountain bridegroom at the close of the ceremony had turned to her father and drawled:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, parson, I ain't got no money with me — but I want to give ye five dollars. I've got a fine dawg. He's worth ten. I'll send him to ye fur five — if it's all right?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The children had giggled and her father blushed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's all right," he had answered. "Money's no matter. Forget the five. I hope you'll be very happy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two weeks later a crate containing the dog had come by express. On the tag was scrawled:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Parson: — I like Nancy so well, I send ye the hole dawg, anyhow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She hadn't a doubt that Jim would feel the same way — but she hoped he hadn't forgotten his pocketbook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The scene had flashed through her mind in a single moment. She had bitten her lips and kept from laughing by a supreme effort. Not a word of the solemn ceremonial, however, had escaped her consciousness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And in the face of this company," the preacher's rich voice was saying, "to join together this Man and this Woman in holy Matrimony; which is commended of St. Paul to be honorable among all men: and therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvisedly or lightly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy estate these two persons present come now to be joined. If any man can show just cause, why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter for ever hold his peace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Craddock paused, and his piercing eyes searched the man and woman before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I require to charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in Matrimony, ye do now confess it — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again he paused. The perspiration stood in beads on Jim's forehead, and he glanced uneasily at Mary from the corners of his drooping eyes. A smile was playing about her mouth, and Jim was cheered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For be ye well assured," the preacher continued, "that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as God's Word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned with deliberation to Jim and transfixed him with the first question of the ceremony. The groom was hypnotized into a state of abject terror. His ears heard the words; the mind recorded but the vaguest idea of what they meant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wilt thou have this Woman to thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor, and keep her in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's mouth was open; his lower jaw had dropped in dazed awe, and he continued to stare straight into the preacher's face until Mary pressed his arm and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will — yes, I will — you bet I will!" he hastened to answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The children giggled, and the preacher's lips twitched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned quickly to Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wilt thou have this Man to thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance, in the holy estate of Matrimony? Wilt thou obey him, and serve him, love, honor, and keep him in sickness and in health; and, forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With quick, clear voice, Mary answered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please join your right hands and repeat after me:"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He fixed Jim with his gaze and spoke with deliberation, clause by clause:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I, James, take thee, Mary, to my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I plight thee my troth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's throat at first was husky with fear, but he caught each clause with quick precision and repeated them without a hitch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He smiled and congratulated himself: "I got ye that time, old cull!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The preacher's eyes sought Mary's:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I, Mary, take thee, James, to my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death do us part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the sweetest musical voice, quivering with happiness, the girl repeated the words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again the preacher's eyes sought Jim's:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the Man shall give unto the Woman a ring —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The groom fumbled in his pocket and found at last the ring, which he handed to Mary. The minister at once took it from her hand and handed it back to Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bride lifted her left hand, deftly extending the fourth finger, and the groom slipped the ring on, and held it firmly gripped as he had been instructed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With this ring I thee wed — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With this ring I thee wed — " Jim repeated firmly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and with all my worldly goods I thee endow — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and with all my worldly goods I thee endow — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the Name of the Father — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the Name of the Father — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and of the Son — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and of the Son — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and of the Holy Ghost — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" — and of the Holy Ghost — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Amen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Amen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The voice of the preacher's prayer that followed rang far-away and unreal to the heart of the girl. Her vivid imagination had leaped the years. Her spirit did not return to earth and time and place until the minister seized her right hand and joined it to Jim's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forasmuch as James Anthony and Mary Adams have consented together in holy wedlock, and have witnessed the same before God and this company, and thereto have given and pledged their troth, each to the other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving a Ring, and by joining hands; I pronounce that they are Man and Wife, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The preacher lifted his hands solemnly above their heads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with His favor look upon you, and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace; that ye may so live together in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The preacher took Mary's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your father is my friend, child. This is for him — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent quickly and kissed her lips, while Jim gasped in astonishment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The minister's wife congratulated them both. The two older children smilingly advanced and added their voices in good wishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary whispered to Jim:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't forget the preacher's fee!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord, how much? Will fifty be enough? It's all I've got."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give him twenty. We'll need the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not until they were seated in the waiting cab and sank back among the shadows, that Jim crushed her in his arms and kissed her until she cried for mercy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The gall of that preacher, kissing you!" he muttered savagely. "You know, I come within an ace of pasting him one on the nose!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">"UNTIL DEATH"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The lights burned in the hall with unusual brightness. Ella stood in the open door of the room, through which the light was streaming. With its radiance came the perfume of roses — the scrub-woman's gift of love. The room was a bower of gorgeous flowers. She had spent her last cent in this extravagance. Mary swept the place with a look of amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Ella," she cried, "how could you be so silly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You like them, ja?" Ella asked softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're glorious — but you should not have made such a sacrifice for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For myself, maybe, I do it — all for myself to make me happy, too, tonight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She dismissed the subject with a wave of her hand and placed the chairs beside the beautifully set table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinner is all ready," she announced cheerfully. "And shall I go now and leave you? Or will you let me serve your dinner first?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sudden panic seized the bride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stay and serve the dinner, Ella, if you will," she quickly answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim frowned, but seated himself in business-like fashion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right; I'm ready for it, old girl!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With soft tread and swift, deft touch, Ella served the dinner, standing prim and stiff and ghost-like behind Jim's chair between the courses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bride watched her, fascinated by the pallor of her haggard face and the queer suggestion of Death which her appearance made in spite of the background of flowers. She had dressed herself in a simple skirt and shirtwaist of spotless white. The material seemed to be draped on her tall figure, thin to emaciation. The chalk-like pallor of her face brought out with startling sharpness the deep, hollow caverns beneath her straight eyebrows. Her single eye shone unusually bright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gradually the grim impression grew that Death was hovering over her bridal feast — a foolish fancy which persisted in her highly-wrought nervous state. Yet the idea, once fixed, could not be crushed. In vain she used her will to bring her wandering mind back to the joyous present. Each time she lifted her eyes they rested upon the silent, white figure with its single eye piercing the depths of her soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She could endure it no longer. She nodded and smiled wanly at Ella.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may go now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman gazed at the bride in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shall come again — yes?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tomorrow morning, Ella, you may help me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The white figure paused uncertainly at the door, and her drawling voice breathed her parting word tenderly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bride closed her eyes and answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night, Ella!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door closed. Jim rose quickly and bolted it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank God!" he exclaimed fervently. He fixed his slumbering eyes on his wife for a moment, saw the frightened look, walked quickly back to the table and took his seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Kiddo, we can eat in peace."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I'd rather be alone," she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must say," Jim went on briskly, "that parson of yours did give us a run for our money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I like the old, long ceremony best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you see, I ain't never had much choice — but do you know what I thought was the best thing in it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Until death do us part! Gee how he did ring out on that! His voice sounded to me like a big bell somewhere away up in the clouds. Did you hear me sing it back at him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary smiled nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You had found your voice then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet I had! I muffed that first one, though, didn't I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little. It didn't matter." She answered mechanically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He fixed his eyes on her again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hungry, Kiddo?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the use!" he cried in low, vibrant tones, springing to his feet. "I don't want to eat this stuff — I just want to eat you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary rose tremblingly and moved instinctively to meet him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He clasped her form in his arms and crushed with cruel strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Until death do us part!" he whispered passionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She answered with a kiss.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE LOTOS-EATERS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was eleven o'clock next morning before Ella ventured to rap softly on the door. They had just finished breakfast. The bride was clearing up the table, humming a song of her childhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim caught her in his arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once more before she comes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't kill me!" she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim lounged in the window and smoked his cigarette while Ella and Mary chattered in the kitchenette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In half an hour the scrub-woman had made her last trip with the extra dishes, and the little home was spick and span.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary sprang on the couch and snuggled into Jim's arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've changed our plans — " he began thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We won't give up our honeymoon trip?" she cried in alarm. "That's one dream we must live, Jim, dear. I've set my heart on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure we will — sure," he answered quickly. "But not in that car."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim grinned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I like you better — you get me, Kiddo?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pressed close and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see, that fool car might throw a tire or two. Believe me, it'll be a job to have her on my hands for a thousand miles. Of course, if I didn't know you, little girl, it would be all sorts of fun. But, honest to God, this game beats the world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent low and kissed her again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where'll we go, then?" she murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I'm tryin' to dope out. I like the sea. It lulls me just like whisky puts a drunkard to sleep. I wish we could get where it's bright and warm and the sun shines all the time. We could stay two weeks and then jump on the train and be in Asheville the day before Christmas."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary sprang up excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have it! We'll go to Florida — away down to the Keys. It's the dream of my life to go there!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Keys what's that?" he asked, puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Keys are little sand islands and reefs that jut out into the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The railroad takes us right there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's warm and sunny there now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just like summer up here. We can go in bathing in the surf every day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim sprang to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got a bathing suit?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes — a beauty. I've never worn it here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seemed so bold."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. Maybe we can get a Key all by ourselves for two weeks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't it be glorious!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll try it, anyhow. I'll buy the doggoned thing if they don't ask too much. Pack your traps. I'll go down to the shop and get my things. We'll be ready to start in an hour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By four o'clock they were seated in the drawing-room of a Pullman car on the Florida Limited, gazing entranced at the drab landscape of the Jersey meadows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Three days later, Jim had landed his boat on a tiny sand reef a half-mile off the coast of Florida with a tent and complete outfit for camping. Like two romping children, they tied the boat to a stake and rushed over the sand-dunes to the beach. They explored their domain from end to end within an hour. Not a tree obscured the endless panorama of sea and bay and waving grass on the great solemn marshes. Piles of soft, warm seaweed lay in long, dark rows along the high-tide mark.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary selected a sand-dune almost exactly the height and shape of the one on which they sat at Long Beach the day he told her of his love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here's the spot for our home!" she cried. "Don't you recognize it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't say I've ever been here before. Oh, I got you — I got you! Long Beach — sure! What do you think of that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hurried to the boat and brought the tent. Mary carried the spade, the pole and pegs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In half an hour the little white home was shining on the level sand at the foot of their favorite dune. The door was set toward the open sea, and the stove securely placed beneath an awning which shaded it from the sun's rays.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Kiddo, a plunge in that shining water the first thing. I'll give you the tent. I'll chuck my things out here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a fever of joyous haste she threw off her clothes and donned the dainty, one-piece bathing suit. She flew over the sand and plunged into the water before Jim had finished changing to his suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was swimming and diving like a duck in the lazy, beautiful waters of the Gulf when he reached the beach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on! Come on!" she shouted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waved his hand and finished his cigarette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's glorious! It's mid-summer!" she called.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a quick plunge he dived into the water, disappeared and stayed until she began to scan the surface uneasily. With a splash he rose by her side, lifting her screaming in his arms. Her bathing-cap was brushed off, and he seized her long hair in his mouth, turned and with swift, strong beat carried her unresisting body to the beach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew her erect and looked into her smiling face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the way I'd save you if you had called for help. How'd you like it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It was sweet to give up and feel myself in your power, dear!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His drooping eyes were devouring her exquisite figure outlined so perfectly in the clinging suit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was afraid to wear this in New York," she said demurely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't blame you. If you'd ever have gone on the beach at Coney Island in that, there'd have been a riot."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted her in his arms and kissed her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you're all mine, Kiddo! It's too good to be true! I'm afraid to wake up mornings now for fear I'll find I've just been dreaming."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They plunged again in the water, and side by side swam far out from the shore, circled gracefully and returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hours they spent snuggling in the warm sand. Not a sound of the world beyond the bay broke the stillness. The music of the water's soft sighing came on their ears in sweet, endless cadence. The wind was gentle and brushed their cheeks with the softest caress. Far out at sea, white-winged sails were spread — so far away they seemed to stand in one spot forever. The deep cry of an ocean steamer broke the stillness at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must dress for dinner, Jim!" she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Kiddo?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must eat, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But why dress? I like that style on you. It's too much trouble to dress."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" she cried gayly. "We'll have a little informal dinner this evening. I love to feel the sand under my feet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He gathered the wood from the dry drifts above the waterline and kindled a fire. The salt-soaked sticks burned fiercely, and the dinner was cooked in a jiffy — a fresh chicken he had bought, sweet potatoes, and delicious buttered toast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They sat in their bathing suits on camp-stools beside the folding table and ate by moonlight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dinner finished, Mary cleared the wooden dishes while Jim brought heaps of the dry, spongy sea grass and made a bed in the tent. He piled it two feet high, packed it down to a foot, and then spread the sheets and blankets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All ready for a stroll down the avenue, Kiddo?" he called from the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fifth Avenue or Broadway?" she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, the Great White Way — you couldn't miss it! Just look at the shimmer of the moon on the sands! Ain't it great?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hand in hand, they strolled on the beach and bathed in the silent flood of the moonlit night — no prying eyes near save the stars of the friendly southern skies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The moon seems different down here, Jim!" she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is different," he answered with boyish enthusiasm. "It's all so still and white!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could we stay here forever?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shook his head emphatically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not on your life. This little boy has to work, you know. Old man John D. Rockefeller might, but it's early for a young financier to retire."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A whole week, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure! For a week we'll forget New York."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They sat down on the sand-dune behind the tent and watched the waters flash in the silvery light, the world and its fevered life forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're the only thing real tonight, Jim!" she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you're the world for me, Kiddo!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She waked at dawn, with a queer feeling of awe at the weird, gray light which filtered through the cotton walls. A sense of oneness with Nature and the beat of Her eternal heart filled her soul. The soft wash of the water on the sands seemed to be keeping time to the throb of her own pulse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She peered curiously into the face of her sleeping lover. She had never seen him asleep before. She started at the transformation wrought by the closing of his heavy eyelids and the complete relaxation of his features. The strange, steel-blue coloring of his eyes had always given his face an air of mystery and charm. The complete closing of the heavy lids and the slight droop of the lower jaw had worked a frightful change. The romance and charm had gone, and instead she saw only the coarse, brutal strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She frowned like a spoiled child, put her dainty hand under his chin and pressed his mouth together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wake up, sir!" she whispered. "I don't like your expression!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He refused to stir, and she drew the tips of her fingers across his ears and eyelids.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rubbed his eyes and muttered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What t'ell?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's take a bath in the sea before sunrise — come on!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sleeper groaned heavily, turned over, and in a moment was again dead to the world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary's eyes were wide now with excitement. The hours were too marvelous to be lost in sleep. She could sleep when they must return to the tiresome world with its endless crowds of people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose softly, ran barefoot to the beach, threw her night-dress on the sand and plunged, her white, young body trembling with joy, into the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was marvelous — this wonderful hush of the dawn over the infinite sea. The air and water melted into a pearl gray. Far out toward the east, the waters began to blush at the kiss of the coming sun. The pearl gray slowly turned into purple. So startling was the vision, she swam in-shore and stood knee-deep in the shallows to watch the magic changes. In breathless wonder she saw the sea and sky and shore turn into a trembling cloud of dazzling purple. A moment before, she had caught the water up in her hand and poured it out in a stream of pearls. She lifted a handful and poured it out now, each drop a dazzling amethyst. And even while she looked, the purple was changing to scarlet — the amethyst into rubies!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A great awe filled her in the solemn hush. She stood in Nature's vast cathedral, close to God's heart — her life in harmony with His eternal laws.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How foolish and artificial were the ways of the far-away, drab, prosaic world of clothes and houses and furnishings! If she could only live forever in this dream-world!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even while the thought surged through her heart, she lifted her head and saw the red rim of the sun suddenly break through the sea, and started lest the white light of day had revealed her to some passing boatman hurrying to his nets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her keen eye quickly swept the circle of the wide, silent world of sand-dunes, marsh and waters. No prying eye was near. Only the morning star still gleaming above saw. And they were twin sisters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Four days flew on velvet wings before the first cloud threw its shadow across her life. Jim always slept until nine o'clock, and refused with dogged good-natured indifference to stir when she had asked him to get the wood for breakfast. It was nothing, of course, to walk a hundred yards to the beach and pick up the wood, and she did it. The hurt that stung was the feeling that he was growing indifferent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She felt for the first time an impulse to box his lazy jaws as he yawned and turned over for the dozenth time without rising. He looked for all the world like a bulldog curled up on his bed of grass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook him at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim, dear, you must get up now! Breakfast is almost ready and it won't be fit to eat if you don't come on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened his heavy eyelids and gazed at her sleepily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All righto — ! Just as you say — just as you say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurry! Breakfast will be ready before you can dress."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee! Breakfast all ready! You're one smart little wifie, Kiddo."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The compliment failed to please. She was sure that he had been fully awake twice before and pretended to be asleep from sheer laziness and indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The thought hurt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they sat down at last to breakfast, she looked into his half-closed eyes with a sudden start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Jim, your eyes are red!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're ill — what is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He grinned sheepishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You couldn't guess now, could you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't been drinking!" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," he drawled lazily, "I wouldn't say drinking — I just took one big swallow last night — makes you sleep good when you're tired. Good medicine! I always carry a little with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sickening wave went over her. Not that she felt that he was going to be a drunkard. But the utter indifference with which he made the announcement was a painful revelation of the fact that her opinion on such a question was not of the slightest importance. That he was now master of the situation he evidently meant that she should see and understand at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She refused to accept the humiliating position without a struggle and made up her mind to try at once to mold his character. She would begin by getting him to cut the slang from his conversation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You remember the promise you made me one day before we were married, Jim?" she asked brightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which one? You know a fellow's not responsible for what he promises to get his girl. All's fair in love and war, they say — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to hold you to this one, sir," she firmly declared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, little bright eyes," he responded cheerfully as he lit a cigarette and sent the smoke curling above his red head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat for a while in silence, studying the man before her. The task was delicate and difficult. And she had thought it a mere pastime of love! As her fiance, he had been wax in her hands. As her husband, he was a lazy, headstrong, obstinate young animal grinning good-naturedly at her futile protests. How long would he grin and bear her suggestions with patience? The transition from this lazy grin to the growl of an angry bulldog might be instantaneous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would move with the utmost caution — but she would move and at once. It would be a test of character between them. She edged her chair close to his, drew his head down in her lap and ran her fingers through his thick, red hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still love me, Jim?" she smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Crazier over you every day — and you know it, too, you sly little puss," he answered dreamily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will make good your promises?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, I will — surest thing you know!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You see, Jim dear," she went on tenderly, "I want to be proud of you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ain't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I am, silly. I know you and understand you. But I want all the world to respect you as I do." She paused and breathed deeply. "They've got to do it, too, they've got to — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, I'll knock their block off — if they don't!" he broke in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised her finger reprovingly and shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just the trouble: you can't do it with your fists. You can't compel the respect of cultured men and women by physical force. We've got to win with other weapons."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, Kiddo — dope it out for me," he responded lazily. "Dope it out — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her lips quivered with the painful recognition of the task before her. Yet when she spoke, her voice was low and sweet and its tones even. She gave no sign to the man whose heavy form rested in her arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then from today we must begin to cut out every word of slang — it's a bargain?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure, Mike — I promised!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cut `Sure Mike!'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised her finger severely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, teacher," he drawled. "What'll we put in Sure Mike's place? I've found him a handy man!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say `certainly.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim grinned good-naturedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aw hell, Kiddo — that sounds punk!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And hell , Jim, isn't a nice word — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, Kid, now look here — can't get along with out hell — leave me that one just a little while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And punk is expressive, but not suited to parlor use."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right — t'ell with punk!" He turned and looked. "What's the matter now?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you realize what you've just said?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did I say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned away to hide a tear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He threw his arms around her neck and drew her lips down to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, don't worry, Kiddo — I'll do better next time. Honest to God, I will. That's enough for today. Just let's love now. T'ell with the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled in answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You promise to try honestly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He raised his hand in solemn vow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"S'help me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each day's trial ended in a laugh and a kiss until at last Jim refused to promise any more. He grinned in obstinate, good-natured silence and let her do the worrying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She watched him with growing wonder and alarm. He gradually lapsed into little coarse, ugly habits at the table. She tried playfully to correct them. He took it good-naturedly at first and then ignored her suggestions as if she were a kitten complaining at his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She studied him with baffling rage at the mystery of his personality. The long silences between them grew from hour to hour. She could see that he was restless now at the isolation of their sand-island home. The queer lights and shadows that played in his cold blue eyes told only too plainly that his mind was back again in the world of battle. He was fighting something, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was glad of it. She could manage him better there. She would throw him into the company of educated people and rouse his pride and ambition. She heard his announcement of their departure on the eighth day with positive joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Kiddo," he began briskly, "we've got to be moving. Time to get back to work now. The old town and the little shop down in Avenue B have been calling me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Today, Jim?" she asked quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right away. We'll catch the first train north, stop two days, Christmas Eve and Christmas, in Asheville, and then for old New York!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The journey along the new railroad built on concrete bridges over miles of beautiful waters was one of unalloyed joy. They had passed over this stretch of marvelous engineering at night on their trip down and had not realized its wonders. For hours the train seemed to be flying on velvet wings through the ocean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat beside her lover and held his hand. In spite of her enthusiasm, he would doze. At every turn of entrancing view she would pinch his arm:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look, Jim! Look!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He would lift his heavy eyelids, grunt good-naturedly and doze again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the dining-car she was in mortal terror at first lest he should lapse into the coarse table manners into which he had fallen in camp. She laid his napkin conspicuously on his plate and saw that he had opened and put it in place across his lap before ordering the meals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The moment he found himself in a crowd, the lights began to flash in his eyes, his broad shoulders lifted and his whole being was at once alert and on guard. He followed his wife's lead with unerring certainty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She renewed her faith in his early reformation, though his character was a puzzle. He seemed to be forever watching out of the corners of his slumbering eyes. She wondered what it meant.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE REAL MAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They arrived in Asheville the night before Christmas Eve. Jim listened to his wife's prattle about the wonderful views with quiet indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They stopped at the Battery Park Hotel, and she hoped the waning moon would give them at least a glimpse of the beautiful valley of the French Broad and Swannanoa rivers and the dark, towering ranges of mountains among the stars. She made Jim wait on the balcony of the room for half an hour, but the clouds grew denser and he persisted in nodding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His head dipped lower than usual, and she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor old sleepy-head!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the love o' Mike, Kiddo — me for the hay. Won't them mountains wait till morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right!" she answered cheerily. "I'll pull you out at sunrise. The sunrise from our window will be glorious."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He rose and stretched his body like a young, well fed tiger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it's prettier from the bed. But have it your own way — have it your own way. I'll agree to anything if you lemme go to sleep now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose as the first gray fires of dawn began to warm the cloud-banks on the eastern horizon, stood beside her window and watched in silent ecstasy. Jim was sleeping heavily. She would not wake him until the glory of the sunrise was at its height. She loved to watch the changing lights and shadows in sky and valley and on distant mountain peaks as the light slowly filtered over the eastern hills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had recovered from the depression of the last days of their camp. The journey back into the world had improved Jim's manners. There could be no doubt about his ambitions. His determination to be a millionaire was the lever she now meant to work in raising his social aspirations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why should she feel depressed?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their married life had just begun. The two weeks they had passed on their honeymoon had been happy beyond her dreams of happiness. Somehow her imagination had failed to give any conception of the wonder and glory of this revelation of life. His little lapses of selfishness on their sand island no doubt came from ignorance of what was expected of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For one thing she felt especially thankful. There had been no ugly confessions of a shady past to cloud the joy of their love. Her lover might be ignorant of the ways of polite society. He was equally free of its sinister vices. She thanked God for that. The soul of the man she had married was clean of all memories of women. The love he gave was fierce in its unrestrained passion — but it was all hers. She gloried in its strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made up her mind, standing there in the soft light of the dawn, that she would bend his iron will to her own in the growing, sweet intimacy of their married life and threw her fears to the winds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The thin, fleecy clouds that hung over the low range of the eastern foreground were all aglow now, with every tint of the rainbow, while the sun's bed beyond the hills was flaming in scarlet and gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She clapped her hands in ecstasy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim! Jim, dear!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made no response, and she rushed to his side and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must see this sunrise — get up quick, quick, dear. It's wonderful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he muttered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The sunrise over the mountains — quick — it's glorious."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His heavy eyelids drooped and closed. He dropped on the pillow and buried his face out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, Jim dear, do come — just to please me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm dead, Kiddo — dead to the world," he sighed. "Don't like to see the sun rise. I never did. Come on back and let's sleep — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His last words were barely audible. He was breathing heavily as his lips ceased to move.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She gave it up, returned to the window and watched the changing colors until the white light from the sun's face had touched with life the last shadows of the valleys and flashed its signals from the farthest towering peaks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her whole being quivered in response to the beauty of this glorious mountain world. The air was wine. She loved the sapphire skies and the warm, lazy, caressing touch of the sun of the South.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sense of bitterness came, just for a moment, that the man she had chosen for her mate had no eye to see these wonders and no ear to hear their music. During the madness of his whirlwind courtship she had gotten the impression that his spirit was sensitive to beauty — to the waters of the bay, the sea and the wooded hills. She must face the facts. Their stay on the island had convinced her that he had eyes only for her. She must make the most of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was ten o'clock before Jim could be persuaded to rise and get breakfast. She literally pulled him up the stairs to the observatory on the tower of the hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the game, Kiddo? What's the game?" he grumbled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ask me no questions. But do just as I tell you; come on!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her face was radiant, her hair in a tangle of riotous beauty about her forehead and temples, her eyes sparkling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't look till I tell you!" she cried, as they emerged on the little minaret which crowns the tower.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now open and see the glory of the Lord!" she cried with joyous awe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The day was one of matchless beauty. The clouds that swung low in the early morning had floated higher and higher till they hung now in shining billows above the highest balsam-crowned peaks in the distance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In every direction, as far as the eye could reach, north, south, east, west, the dark ranges mounted in the azure skies until the farthest dim lines melted into the heavens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim dear, isn't it wonderful! We're lucky to get this view on our first day. It's such a good omen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim opened his eyes lazily and puffed his cigarette in a calm, patronizing way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tough sledding we'd have had with an automobile over those hills," he said. "We'll try it after lunch, though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll go for a ride?" she cried joyfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep. Got to hunt up the folks. The mountains near Asheville!" he said with disgust. "I should say they are near — and far, too. Holy smoke, I'll bet we get lost!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where's the Black Mountains, I wonder?" he asked suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Over there!" She pointed to the giant peaks projecting here and there in dim, blue waves beyond the Great Craggy Range in the foreground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Holy Moses! Do we have to climb those crags before we start?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To go to Black Mountain?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. That's where the lawyer said they lived, under Cat-tail Peak in the Black Mountain Range — wherever t'ell that is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no! You don't climb the Great Craggy; you go around this end of it and follow the Swannanoa River right up to the foot of Mount Mitchell, the highest peak this side of the Rockies. The Cat-tail is just beyond Mount Mitchell."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been there?" he asked in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once, with a party from Asheville. We spent three days and slept in caves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you'd know the way now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We couldn't miss it. We follow the bed of the Swannanoa to its source — -"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then that settles it. We'll go by ourselves. I don't want any mutt along to show us the way. We couldn't get lost nohow, could we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not — all the roads lead to Asheville. We can ask the way to the house you want, when we reach the little stopping place at the foot of Mount Mitchell."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, Kid, you're a wonder!" he exclaimed admiringly. "Couldn't get along without you, now could I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope not, sir!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet I couldn't! We'll start right away. The roads will give us a jolt — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned suddenly to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait — wait a minute, dear," she pleaded. "You haven't seen this gorgeous view to the southwest, with Mount Pisgah looming in the center like some vast cathedral spire — look, isn't it glorious?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fine! Fine!" he responded in quick, businesslike tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You can look for days and weeks and not begin to realize the changing beauty of these mountains, clothed in eternal green! Just think, dear, Mount Pisgah, there, is forty miles away, and it looks as if you could stroll over to it in an hour's walk. And there are twenty-three magnificent peaks like that, all of them more than six thousand feet high — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused with a frown. He was neither looking nor listening. He had fallen into a brown study; his mind was miles away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're not listening, Jim — nor seeing anything," she said reproachfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — Kiddo, we must get ready for that trip. I've got a letter for a lawyer downtown. I'll find him and hire a car. I'll be back here for you in an hour. You'll be ready?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Right away, in half an hour — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just pack a suit-case for us both. We'll stay one night. I'll take a bag, too, that I have in my trunk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was noon before he returned with a staunch touring car ready for the trip. He opened the little steamer trunk which he had always kept locked and took from it a small leather bag. He placed it on the floor, and, in spite of careful handling, the ring of metal inside could be distinctly heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What on earth have you got in that queer black bag?" she asked in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, just a lot o' junk from the shop. I thought I might tinker with it at odd times. I don't want to leave it here. It's got one of my new models in it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He carried the bag in his hand, refusing to allow the porter who came for the suit-case to touch it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He threw the suit-case in the bottom of the tonneau. The bag he stowed carefully under the cushions of the rear seat. The moment he placed his hand on the wheel of the machine, he was at his best. Every trace of the street gamin fell from him. Again he was the eagle-eyed master of time and space. The machine answered his touch with more than human obedience. He knew how to humor its mood. He conserved its power for a hill with unerring accuracy and threw it over the grades with rarely a pause to change his speeds. He could turn the sharp curves with such swift, easy grace that he scarcely caused Mary's body to swerve an inch. He could sense a rough place in the road and glide over it with velvet touch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A tire blew out, five miles up the stream from Asheville, and the easy, business-like deliberation with which he removed the old and adjusted the new, was a revelation to Mary of a new phase of his character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He never once grunted, or swore, or lost his poise, or manifested the slightest impatience. He set about his task coolly, carefully, skillfully, and finished it quickly and silently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His long silences at last began to worry her. An invisible barrier had reared itself between them. The impression was purely mental — but it was none the less real and distressing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a look of aloof absorption about him she had never seen before. At first she attributed it to the dread of meeting his kinsfolk for the first time, his fear of what they might be like or what they might think of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He answered her questions cheerfully but mechanically. Sometimes he stared at her in a cold, impersonal way and gave no answer, as if her questions were an impertinence and she were not of sufficient importance to waste his breath on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Unable at last to endure the strain, she burst out impatiently:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What on earth's the matter with you, Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?" he asked softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't spoken to me in half an hour, and I've asked you two questions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just studying about something, Kiddo, something big. I'll tell you sometime, maybe — not now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly a great fear began to shape itself in her heart. The real man behind those slumbering eyes she had never known. Who was he?</field>
      <field name="heading_text">UNWELCOME GUESTS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While she was yet puzzling over the strange mood of absorbed brooding into which Jim had fallen, his face suddenly lighted, and he changed with such rapidity that her uneasiness was doubled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They had reached the stretches of deep forest at the foot of the Black Mountain ranges. The Swannanoa had become a silver thread of laughing, foaming spray and deep, still pools beneath the rocks. The fields were few and small. The little clearings made scarcely an impression in the towering virgin forests.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great guns, Kiddo!" he exclaimed, "this is some country! By George, I had no idea there was such a place so close to New York!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked at him with uneasy surprise. What could be in his mind? The solemn gorge through which they were passing gave no entrancing views of clouds or sky or towering peaks. Its wooded cliffs hung ominously overhead in threatening shadows. The scene had depressed her after the vast sunlit spaces of sky, of shining valleys and cloud-capped, sapphire peaks on which they had turned their backs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You like this, Jim?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's great — great!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought that waterfall we just passed was very beautiful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't see it. But this is something like it. You're clean out of the world here — and there ain't a railroad in twenty miles!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The deeper the shadows of tree and threatening crag, the higher Jim's strange spirit seemed to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She watched him with increasing fear. How little she knew the real man! Could it be possible that this lonely, unlettered boy of the streets of lower New York, starved and stunted in childhood, had within him the soul of a great poet? How else could she explain the sudden rapture over the threatening silences and shadows of these mountain gorges which had depressed her? And yet his utter indifference to the glories of beautiful waters, his blindness at noon before the most wonderful panorama of mountains and skies on which she had ever gazed, contradicted the theory of the poetic soul. A poet must see beauty where she had seen it — and a thousand wonders her eyes had not found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His elation was uncanny. What could it mean?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was driving now with a skill that was remarkable, a curious smile playing about his drooping, Oriental eyelids. A wave of fierce resentment swept her heart. She was a mere plaything in this man's life. The real man she had never seen. What was he thinking about? What grim secret lay behind the mysterious smile that flickered about the corners of those eyes? He was not thinking of her. The mood was new and cold and cynical, for all the laughter he might put in it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She asked herself the question of his past, his people, his real life-history. The only answer was his baffling, mysterious smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A frown suddenly clouded his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello! Ye're running right into a man's yard!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted her head with quick surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why yes, it's the stopping place for the parties that climb Mount Mitchell. I remember it. We stayed all night here, left our rig, and started next morning at sunrise on horseback to climb the trail."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty near the jumping-off place, then," he remarked. "We'll ask the way to Cat-tail Peak."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped the car in front of the low-pitched, weather-stained frame house and blew the horn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A mountain woman with three open-eyed, silent children came slowly to meet them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled pleasantly, and without embarrassment spoke in a pleasant drawl:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you 'light and look at your saddle?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The expression caught Jim's fancy, and he broke into a roar of laughter. The woman blushed and laughed with him. She couldn't understand what was the matter with the man. Why should he explode over the simple greeting in which she had expressed her pleasure at their arrival?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Anyhow, she was an innkeeper's wife, and her business was to make folks feel at home — so she laughed again with Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know that's the funniest invitation I ever got in a car," he cried at last. "We fly in these things sometimes. And when you said, `Won't you 'light,'" — he paused and turned to his wife — "I could just feel myself up in the air on that big old racer's back."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't you-all stay all night with us?" the soft voice drawled again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, not tonight," Mary answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She waited for Jim to ask the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — not tonight," he repeated. "You happen to know an old woman by the name of Owens who lives up here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nance Owens?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's her name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord, everybody knows old Nance!" was the smiling answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She ain't got good sense!" the tow-headed boy spoke up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sh!" the mother warned, boxing his ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's a little queer, that's all. Everybody knows her in Buncombe and Yancey counties. Her house is built across the county line. She eats in Yancey and sleeps in Buncombe — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," broke in the boy joyously, "an' when the Sheriff o' Yancey comes, she moves back into Buncombe. She's some punkin's on a green gourd vine, she is — if she ain't got good sense."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His mother struck at him again, but he dodged the blow and finished his speech without losing a word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could you tell us the way to her house?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep right on this road, and you can't miss it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How far is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, not far."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; right at the bottom o' the Cat's-tail," the boy joyfully explained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He means the foot o' Cat-tail Peak!" the mother apologized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many miles?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a little ways — ye can't miss it; the third house you come to on this road."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll be there in three shakes of a sheep's tail — in that thing!" the boy declared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim waved his thanks, threw in his gear, and the car shot forward on the level stretch of road beyond the house. He slowed down when out of sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee! I'd love to have that kid in a wood-shed with a nice shingle all by ourselves for just ten minutes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The people spoil him," Mary laughed. "The people who stop there for the Mount Mitchell climb. He was a baby when I was there six years ago" — she paused and a rapt look crept into her eyes — "a beautiful little baby, her first-born, and she was the happiest thing I ever saw in my life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her voice sank to a whisper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A vision suddenly illumined her own soul, and she forgot her anxiety over Jim's queer moods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Deeper and deeper grew the shadows of crag, gorge, and primeval forest. The speedometer on the foot-board registered five miles from the Mount Mitchell house. They had passed two cabins by the way, and still no sign of the third.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why couldn't she tell us how many miles, I'd like to know?" Jim grumbled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the way of the mountain folk. They're noncommittal on distances."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped the car and lighted the lamps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Going to be dark in a minute," he said. "But I like this place," he added.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He picked his way with care over the narrow road. They crossed the little stream they were trailing, and the car crawled over the rocks along the banks at a snail's pace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An owl called from a dead tree-top silhouetted against an open space of sky ahead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Must be a clearing there," Jim muttered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped the car and listened for the sounds of life about a house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A vast, brooding silence filled the world. A wolf howled from the edge of a distant crag somewhere overhead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For God's sake!" Jim shivered. "What was that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only a mountain wolf crying for company."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wolves up here?" he asked in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A few — harmless, timid, lonesome fellows. It makes me sorry for them when I hear one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great country! I like it!" Jim responded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again she wondered why. What a queer mixture of strength and mystery — this man she had married!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He started the car, turned a bend in the road, and squarely in front, not more than a hundred yards away, gleamed a light in a cabin window — four tiny panes of glass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By Geeminy, we come near stopping in the front yard without knowing it!" he exclaimed. "Didn't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad she's at home!" Mary exclaimed. "The light shines with a friendly glow in these deep shadows."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Afraid, Kiddo?" he asked lightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like these dark places."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right when you get used to 'em — safer than daylight."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again her heart beat at his queer speech. She shivered at the thought of this uncanny trait of character so suddenly developed today. She made an effort to throw off her depression. It would vanish with the sun tomorrow morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He picked his way carefully among the trees and stopped in front of the cabin door. The little house sat back from the road a hundred feet or more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He blew his horn twice and waited.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A sudden crash inside, and the light went out. He waited a moment for it to come back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only darkness and dead silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose she dropped dead and kicked over the lamp?" Jim laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She probably took the lamp into another room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; it went out too quick — and it went out with a crash."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He blew his horn again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still no answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello! Hello!" he called loudly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Someone stirred at the door. Jim's keen ear was turned toward the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I heard her bar the door, I'll swear it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How foolish, Jim!" Mary whispered. "You couldn't have heard it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All the same I did. Here's a pretty kettle of fish! The old hellion's not even going to let us in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized the lever of his horn and blew one terrific blast after another, in weird, uncanny sobs and wails, ending in a shriek like the last cry of a lost soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't, Jim!" Mary cried, shivering. "You'll frighten her to death."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go up and speak to her — and knock on the door."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waited again in silence, scrambled out of the car, and fumbled his way through the shadows to the dark outlines of the cabin. He found the porch on which the front door opened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His light foot touched the log with sure step, and he walked softly to the cabin wall. The door was not yet visible in the pitch darkness. His auto lights were turned the other way and threw their concentrated rays far down into the deep woods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He listened intently for a moment and caught the cat-like tread of the old woman inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say — hello, in there!" he called.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again the sound of her quick, furtive step told him that she was on the alert and determined to defend her castle against all comers. What if she should slip an old rifle through a crack and blow his head off?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She might do it, too!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He must make her open the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, what's the matter in there?" he asked persuasively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A moment's silence, and then a gruff voice slowly answered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They ain't nobody at home!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The hell they ain't!" Jim laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She hesitated and then growled back:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None o' your business. Who are you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're strangers up here — lost our way. It's cold — we got to stop for the night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ye can't — they's nobody home, I tell ye!" she repeated with sullen emphasis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim broke into a genial laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah! Come on, old girl! Open up and be sociable. We're not revenue officers or sheriffs. If you've got any good mountain whiskey, I'll help you drink it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who are ye?" she repeated savagely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, just a couple o' gentle, cooing turtle-doves — a bride and groom. Loosen up, old girl; it's Christmas Eve — and we're just a couple o' gentle cooin' doves — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim kept up his persuasive eloquence until the light of the candle flashed through the window, and he heard her slip the heavy bar from the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lost no time in pushing his way inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance threw a startled look at his enormous, shaggy fur coat — at the shining aluminum goggles almost completely masking his face. She gave a low, breathless scream, hurled the door-bar crashing to the floor and stared at him like a wild, hunted animal at bay, her thin hands trembling, the iron-gray hair tumbling over her forehead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, my God!" she wailed, crouching back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim gazed at her in amazement. He had forgotten his goggles and fur coat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he asked in high-keyed tones of surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance made no answer but crouched lower and attempted to put the table between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What t'ell Bill ails you — will you tell me?" he asked with rising wrath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you wuz the devil," the old woman panted. "Now I know it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim suddenly remembered his goggles and coat, and broke into a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He removed his goggles and cap, threw back his big coat and squared his shoulders with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance glowered at him with ill-concealed rage, looked him over from head to foot, and answered with a snarl:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tain't much better — ef ye ax me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee! But you're a sociable old wild-cat!" he exclaimed, starting back as if she had struck him a blow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His eye caught the dried skin of a young wildcat hanging on the log wall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No wonder you skinned your neighbor and hung her up to dry," he added moodily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took in the room with deliberate insolence while the old woman stood awkwardly watching him, shifting her position uneasily from one foot to the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In all his miserable life in New York he could not recall a room more bare of comforts. The rough logs were chinked with pieces of wood and daubed with red clay. The door was made of rough boards, the ceiling of hewn logs with split slabs laid across them. An old-fashioned, tall spinning wheel, dirty and unused, sat in the corner. A rough pine table was in the middle of the floor and a smaller one against the wall. On this side table sat two rusty flat-irons, and against it leaned an ironing board. A dirty piece of turkey-red calico hung on a string for a portiere at the opening which evidently led into a sort of kitchen somewhere in the darkness beyond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The walls were decorated at intervals. A huge bunch of onions hung on a wooden peg beside the wild-cat skin. Over the window was slung an old-fashioned muzzle-loading musket. The sling which held it was made of a pair of ancient home-made suspenders fastened to the logs with nails. Beneath the gun hung a cow's horn, cut and finished for powder, and with it a dirty game-bag. Strings of red peppers were strung along each of the walls, with here and there bunches of popcorn in the ears. A pile of black walnuts lay in one corner of the cabin and a pile of hickory nuts in another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A three-legged wooden stool and a split-bottom chair stood beside the table, and a haircloth couch, which looked as if it had been saved from the Ark, was pushed near the wall beside the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Across this couch was thrown a ragged patchwork quilt, and a pillow covered with calico rested on one end, with the mark of a head dented deep in the center.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim shrugged his shoulders with a look of disgust, stepped quickly to the door and called:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come on in, Kid!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance fumbled her thin hands nervously and spoke with the faintest suggestion of a sob in her voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't got nothin' for ye to eat — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We've had dinner," he answered carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stepped to the door and called:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bring that little bag from under the seat, Kiddo."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held the door open, and the light streamed across the yard to the car. He watched her steadily while she raised the cushion of the rear seat, lifted the bag and sprang from the car. His keen eye never left her for an instant until she placed it in his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mercy, but it's heavy!" she panted, as she gave it to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took it without a word and placed it on the table in the center of the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance glared at him sullenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's no place for ye, I tell ye — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim faced her with mock politeness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For them kind words — thanks!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bowed low and swept the room with a mocking gesture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain't no room for ye," the old woman persisted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim raised his voice to a squeaking falsetto with deliberate purpose to torment her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got ye the first time, darlin'!" he exclaimed, lifting his hands above her as if to hold her down. "We must linger awhile for your name — anyhow, we mustn't forget that. This is Mrs. Nance Owens?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman started and watched him from beneath her heavy eyebrows, answering with sullen emphasis:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again Jim lifted his hands above his head and waved her to earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well! Don't blame me! I can't help it, you know — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned to his wife and spoke with jolly good humor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the place, all right. Set down, Kiddo — take off your hat and things. Make yourself at home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance flew at him in a sudden frenzy at his assumption of insolent ownership of her cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's no place for ye to sleep!" she fairly shrieked in his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again Jim's arms were over her head, waving her down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sweetheart! We're from New York. We don't sleep. We've come all the way down here to the mountains of North Carolina just to see you. And we're goin' to sit up all night and look at ye — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sat down deliberately, and Nance fumbled her hands with a nervous movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary's heart went out in sympathy to the forlorn old creature in her embarrassment. Her dress was dirty and ragged, an ill-fitting gingham, the elbows out and her bare, bony arms showing through. The waist was too short and always slipping from the belt of wrinkled cloth beneath which she kept trying to stuff it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary caught her restless eye at last and held it in a friendly look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please let us stay!" she pleaded. "We can sleep on the floor — anywhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet!" Jim joined in. "Married two weeks — and I don't care whether it rains or whether it pours or how long I have to stand outdoors — if I can be with you, Kid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman hesitated until Mary's smile melted its way into her heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her lips trembled, and her watery blue eyes blinked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well," she began grumblingly, "thar's a little single bed in that shed-room thar for you — ef he'll sleep in here on the sofy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim leaped to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do ye think of that? Bully for the old gal! Kinder slow at first. As the poet sings of the little bed-bug, she ain't got no wings — but she gets there just the same!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew the electric torch from his pocket and advanced on Nance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By Golly — I'll have another look at you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance backed in terror at the sight of the revolver-like instrument.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just a little Gatlin' gun!" he cried jokingly. He pressed the button, and the light flashed squarely in the old woman's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God 'lmighty — don't shoot!" she screamed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim doubled with laughter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the love o' Mike!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance leaned against the side table and wiped the perspiration from her brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord! I thought you'd kilt me!" she panted, still trembling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, don't be foolish!" Jim said persuasively. "It can't hurt you. Here, take it in your hand — I'll show you how to work it. It's to nose round dark places under the buzz-wagon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held it out to Nance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, take it and press the button."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman drew back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — no — I'm skeered! No — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim thrust the torch into her hand and forced her to hold it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, come on, it's easy. Push your finger right down on the button."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance tried it gingerly at first, and then laughed at the ease with which it could be done. She flashed it on the floor again and again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it's like a big lightnin' bug, ain't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned the end of it up to examine more closely, pushed the button unconsciously, and the light flashed in her eyes. She jumped and handed it quickly to Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Or a jack o' lantern — here, take it," she cried, still trembling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim threw his hands up with a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can you beat it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Backing quickly to the door, Nance called nervously to Mary:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll get your room ready in a minute, ma'am." She paused and glanced at Jim.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And thar's a shed out thar you can put your devil wagon in — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She slipped through the dirty calico curtains, and Mary saw her go with wondering pity in her heart.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A LITTLE BLACK BAG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary watched Nance, with a quick glance at Jim. Again he had forgotten that he had a wife. She had studied this strange absorption with increasing uneasiness. During the long, beautiful drive of the afternoon beside laughing waters, through scenes of unparalleled splendor, through valleys of entrancing peace, the still, sapphire skies bending above with clear, Southern Christmas benediction, he had not once pressed her hand, he had not once bent to kiss her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each time the thought had come, she fought back the tears. She had made excuses for him. He was absorbed in the memories of his miserable childhood in New York, perhaps. The approaching meeting with his relatives had awakened the old hunger for a mother's love that had been denied him. The scenes through which they were passing had perhaps stirred the currents of his subconscious being.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet why should such memories estrange his spirit from hers? The effect should be the opposite. In the remembrance of his loneliness and suffering, he should instinctively turn to her. The love with which she had unfolded his life should redeem the past.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was standing now with his heavy chin silhouetted against the flickering light of the candle on the table. His hand closed suddenly on the handle of the bag with the swift clutch of an eagle's claw. She started at the ugly picture it made in the dim rays of the candle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What were the thoughts seething behind the mask of his face? She watched him, spellbound by his complete surrender to the mood that had dominated him from the moment he had touched the deep forests of the Black Mountain range. A grim elation ruled even his silences. The man standing there rigid, his face a smiling, twitching mask, was a stranger. This man she had never known, or loved. And yet they were bound for life in the tenderest and strongest ties that can hold the human soul and body.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tossed her head and threw off the ugly thought. It was morbid nonsense! She was just hungry for a kiss, and in his new environment he had forgotten himself as many thoughtless men had forgotten before and would forget again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim!" she whispered tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made no answer. His thick lips were drawn in deep, twisted lines on one side, as if he had suddenly reached a decision from which there could be no appeal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised her voice slightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not a muscle of his body moved. The drawn lines of the mouth merely relaxed. His answer was scarcely audible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's gone!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She moved toward him wistfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aren't you forgetting something?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His square jaw still held its rigid position silhouetted in sharp profile against the candle's light. He answered slowly and mechanically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His indifference was more than the sore heart could bear. The pent-up tears of the afternoon dashed in flood against the barriers of her will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You — haven't — kissed — me — today," she stammered, struggling with each word to save a break.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still he stood immovable. This time his answer was tinged with the slightest suggestion of amusement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She staggered against the table beside the door and gripped its edge desperately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh — " she gasped. "Don't you love me any more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With his sullen head still holding its position of indifference, his absorption in the idea which dominated his mind still unbroken, he threw out one hand in a gesture of irritation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cut it, Kid! Cut it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His tones were not only indifferent; they were contemptuously indifferent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sob, she sank into the chair and buried her face in her arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're tired! I see it now; you've tired of me. Oh — it's not possible — it's not possible!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The torrent came at last in a flood of utter abandonment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim turned, looked at her and threw up his hands in temporary surrender.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, for God's sake!" he muttered, crossing deliberately to her side. He stood and let her sob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a quick change of mood, he drew her to her feet, swept her swaying form into his arms, crushed her and covered her lips with kisses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How's that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled through her tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I feel better — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For better or worse — `until Death do us part' — that's what you said, Kid, and you meant it, too, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized both of her arms, held them firmly and gazed into her eyes with steady, stern inquiry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked up with uneasy surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course — I meant it," she answered slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held her arms gripped close and said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well — we'll see!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His hands relaxed, and he turned away, rubbing his square chin thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She watched him in growing amazement. What could be the mystery back of this new twist of his elusive mind?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He laid his hand on the black bag again, smiled, and turned and faced her with expanding good humor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great scheme, this marryin', Kid! And you believe in it exactly as I do, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you mean?" she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That it binds and holds both our lives as only Almighty God can bind and hold?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — nothing else is marriage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I say, too!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He placed his hands on her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Great scheme!" he repeated. "I get a pretty girl to work for me for nothing for the balance of my life." He paused and lifted the slender forefinger of his right hand. "And you pledged your pious soul — I memorized the words, every one of them: `I, Mary, take thee, James, to my wedded husband — to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse , for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish and obey, till death do us part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereunto I give thee my troth — '"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused, lifted his head and smiled grimly: "That's some promise, believe me, Kiddo! ` And obey ' — you meant it all, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would have hedged lightly over that ugly old word which still survived in the ceremony Craddock had used, but for the sinister suggestion in his voice back of the playful banter. He had asked it half in jest, half in earnest. She had caught by the subtle sixth sense the tragic idea in that one word that he was going to hold her to it. The thought was too absurd!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Obey — you meant it, didn't you?" he repeated grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A smile played about the corners of her mouth as she answered dreamily:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — I — I — promised!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's why I set my head on you from the first — you're good and sweet — you're the real thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again she caught the sinister suggestion in his tone and threw him a startled look.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What has come over you today, Jim?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hesitated and answered carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, nothing, Kiddo — just been thinking a little about business. Got to go to work, you know." He returned to the table and touched the bag lightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Watch out now for this bag while I put up the car — and don't forget that curiosity killed the cat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quick as a flash, she asked:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's in it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim threw up his hands and laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't I tell you that curiosity killed a cat?" He pointed to the skin on the wall. "That's what stretched that wild-cat's hide up there! She got too near the old musket!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anyhow, I'm not afraid of her end — what's in it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim scratched his red head and looked at her thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You asked me that once before today, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it's a little secret of mine. Take my advice — put your hand on it, but not in it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again the sinister look and tone chilled her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't like secrets between us, Jim," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked at the bag reproachfully, and he watched her keenly — then laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd as well tell you and be done with it; you'll go in it anyhow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tossed her head with a touch of angry pride. He took her hand, led her across the room and placed it on the valise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got five thousand dollars in gold in that bag."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew back, surprised beyond the power of speech.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'm going to give it to this old woman — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To her — why?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's my mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — I — thought — you told me she was dead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I said that I didn't know who she was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused, and a queer brooding look crept into his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I haven't seen her since I was a little duffer three years old. This room and these wild crags and trees come back to me now — just a glimpse of them here and there. I've always remembered them. I thought I'd dreamed it — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You remember — how wonderful!" she breathed reverently. She understood now, and the clouds lifted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The skunk I called my daddy," Jim went on thoughtfully, "took me to New York. He said that my mother deserted me when I was a kid. I believed him at first. But when he beat me and kicked me into the streets, I knew he was a liar. When I got grown I began to think and wonder about her. I hired a lawyer that knew my daddy, and he found her here — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a cry of joy, she seized his arms:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell her quick! Oh, you're big and fine and generous, Jim — and I knew it! They said that you were a brute. I knew they lied. Tell her quick!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hand in protest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nope — I'm going to put up a little job on the old girl — show her the money tonight, get her wild at the sight of it — and give it to her Christmas morning. We've only a few hours to wait — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, give it to her now — Jim! Give it to her now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He shook his head and walked to the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want to say something to her first and give her time to think it over. Look out for the bag, and I'll bring in the things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He swung the rough board door wide, slammed it and disappeared in the darkness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young wife watched the bag a moment with consuming curiosity. She had fiercely resented his insulting insinuations at her curiosity, and yet she was wild to look at that glowing pile of gold inside and picture the old woman's joyous surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her hand touched the lock carelessly and drew back as if her finger had been burned. She put her hands behind her and crossed the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't be so weak and silly!" she cried fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She heard Jim cranking the car. It would take him five minutes more to start it, get it under the shed and bring in the suit-case and robes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why shouldn't I see it!" she exclaimed. "He has told me about it." She hesitated and struggled for a moment, quickly walked back to the bag and touched the spring. It yielded instantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it's not even locked!" she cried in tones of surprise at her silly scruples.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her hand had just touched the gold when Nance entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She snapped the bag and smiled at the old woman carelessly. What a sweet surprise she would have tomorrow morning!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance crossed slowly, glancing once at the girl wistfully as if she wanted to say something friendly, and then, alarmed at her presumption, hurried on into the little shed-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary waited until she returned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Room's all ready in thar, ma'am," she drawled, passing into the kitchen without a pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right — thank you," Mary answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She quickly opened the bag, thrust her hand into the gold and withdrew it, holding a costly green-leather jewelry-case of exquisite workmanship. There could be no mistake about its value.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a cry of joy, she started back, staring at the little box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Another surprise! And for me! Oh, Jim, man, you're glorious! My Christmas present, of course! I mustn't look at it — I won't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She pushed the case from her toward the bag and drew it back again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the difference? I'll take one little, tiny peep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She touched the spring and caught her breath. A string of pearls fit for the neck of a princess lay shining in its soft depths. She lifted them with a sigh of delight. Her eye suddenly rested on a stanza of poetry scrawled on the satin lining in the trembling hand of an old man she had known.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She dropped the pearls with a cry of terror. Her face went white, and she gasped for breath. The jewel-case in her hand she had seen before. It had belonged to the old gentleman who lived in the front room on the first floor of her building in the days when it was a boarding house. The wife he had idolized was long ago dead. This string of pearls from her neck the old man had worshiped for years. The stanza from "The Rosary" he had scrawled in the lining one day in Mary's presence. He had moved uptown with the landlady. Two months ago a burglar had entered his room, robbed and shot him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's impossible — impossible!" she gasped. "Oh, dear God — it's impossible! Of course the burglar pawned them, and Jim bought them without knowing. Of course! My nerves are on edge today — how silly of me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's footsteps suddenly sounded on the porch, and she thrust the jewel-case back into the bag with desperate effort to pull herself together.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE AWAKENING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment she felt the foundations of the moral and physical world sinking beneath her feet. Dizziness swept her senses. She gripped the table, leaning heavily against it, her eye watching the door with feverish terror for Jim's appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had never fainted in her life. It was absurd, but the room was swimming now in a dim blur. Again she gripped the table and set her teeth. She simply would not give up. Why should she leap to the worst possible explanation of the jewels? The hatred of old Ella for Jim and the furious antagonism of Jane Anderson had poisoned her mind, after all. It was infamous that she could suspect her husband of crime merely because two silly women didn't like him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He could explain the jewels. He, of course, asked no questions of the pawn-broker. They were probably sold at auction and he bought them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It seemed an eternity from the time Jim's foot step echoed on the little porch until he pushed the door open and hastily entered, his arms piled with lap-robes, coats and the dress-suit case in his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked with quick, firm step, threw the coats and robes on the couch and placed the suit-case at its head. He hadn't turned toward her and his face was still in profile while he removed the gloves from his pockets, threw them on the robes, and drew the scarlet woolen neckpiece from his throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was studying him now with new terror-stricken eyes. Never had she seen his jaw look so big and brutal. Never had the droop of his eyelids suggested such menace. Never had the contrast of his slender hands and feet suggested such hideous possibilities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Merciful God! No! No!" she kept repeating in her soul while her dilated eyes stared at him in sheer horror of the suggestion which the jewels had roused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew a deep breath and strangled the idea by her will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll at least be as fair as a jury," she thought grimly. "I'll not condemn him without a hearing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim suddenly became aware of the menace of her silence. She had not moved a muscle, spoken or made the slightest sound since he had entered. He had merely taken in the room at a glance and had seen her standing in precisely the same place beside the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He saw now that she was leaning heavily against it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He raised his head and faced her with a sudden, bold stare, and his voice rang in tones of sharp command.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tried to speak and failed. She had not yet sufficiently mastered her emotions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he growled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim — " she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He took a step toward her with set teeth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been in that bag — Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her face was white, her voice husky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Those jewels, Jim — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A cunning smile played about his mouth and he shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tried to keep my little secret from you till Christmas morning; but you're on to my curves now, Kiddo, and I'll have to 'fess up — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bought them for me?" she asked with trembling eagerness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who else do you reckon I'd buy 'em for? I was going to surprise you, too, tomorrow morning. You've spoiled the fun."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had slipped close to his side and he could hear her quick intake of breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's — so — sweet of you, Jim. I'm sorry — I — spoiled the surprise — you'd — planned — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, what's the difference!" he broke in carelessly. "It's all the same five minutes after, anyhow. Well, don't you like 'em? Why don't you say something?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're wonderful, Jim. Where — where — did you buy them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held her gaze in silence for an instant and fenced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't that a funny question, Kiddo?" he said in low tones. "I once heard the old man I worked with in the shop say that you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just want to know," she insisted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not going to tell you!" he said with a dry laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because you keep asking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You wish to tease me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why do you want to know? Are you afraid they're fakes?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, they're beautiful — they're wonderful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you don't want them," he broke in angrily, "I'll keep them. I'll sell them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't tease me, Jim!" she begged. "I don't mind if you bought them at a pawn-shop — if that's why you won't tell me. That is the reason, isn't it? Honestly, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She asked the question with eager intensity. She had persuaded herself that it was so and the horror had been lifted. She pressed close with smiling, trembling lips:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't mind that, Jim! You got them from a pawn-broker, of course, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked at her with a puzzled expression and hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you?" she repeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — I didn't!" was the curt answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't?" she echoed feebly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a quick breath she unconsciously drew back and he glared at her angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, what'ell's the matter with you, anyhow? Have you gone crazy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You — won't — tell me — where you bought them?" she asked slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He faced her squarely and spoke with deliberate contempt:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's — none — of your business!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She held his gaze with steady determination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That string of pearls belongs to the man who once lived in the front room of my old building in New York. He moved uptown with my landlady. A few months ago a burglar robbed and shot him — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped, seized his arm and cried with strangling horror:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jim! Jim! Where did you get them?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now I know you've gone crazy! You don't suppose that's the only string of pearls in the world, do you? Did you count 'em? Did you weigh 'em?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where did you get them?" she demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What put it into your head that that string of pearls belonged to your old boarder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I saw him write the stanza of poetry on the satin lining of that case. I've heard him recite it over and over again in his piping voice: `Each bead a pearl — my rosary!' I know that they belonged to him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His mouth twitched angrily and he faced her, speaking with cold, brutal frankness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I might keep on lying to you, Kiddo, and get away with it. But what's the use? You've got to know. It's just as well now — I did that job — Yes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her face blanched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You — a — burglar — a murderer!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim followed her with quick, angry gestures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I wanted was his money! He fought — it was his life or mine — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A murderer!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just went after his money — I tell you — besides, he didn't die; he got well. If he'd kept still he wouldn't have lost his pearls and he wouldn't have been hurt — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I stood up for you against them all!" she answered in a dazed whisper. "They told me — Jane Anderson with brutal frankness, Ella with the heart-rending, timid confession of her own tragic life — they told me that you were bad. I said they were liars. I said that they envied our happiness. I believed that you were big and brave and fine. I stood by you and married you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused and looked at him steadily. In a rush of suppressed passion she seized his arm with a violence that caused his heavy eyelids to lift in amused surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim — it's not true! It's not true — it's not true! For God's sake, tell me that you're joking! — that you're teasing me! You can't mean it! I won't believe it — I won't believe it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her head sank until it rested piteously against his breast. He stood with his face turned awkwardly away and then moved his body until she was forced to stand erect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched her shoulder gently and spoke soothingly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, now, Kid, don't take on so. I'll quit the business when I make my pile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew back instinctively and he followed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll never touch another penny of yours. There's blood on it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rot!" he went on soothingly. "It's good Wall Street cash — got it exactly like they got theirs — got it because I was quicker and smarter than the fellow that had it. I use a jimmy, they use a ticker — that's all the difference."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew her figure to its full height.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going — Jim — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His voice rasped like a file against steel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Home!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your home's with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't live with a thief!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stepped squarely before her and spoke with deliberate menace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're — not — going!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get out of my way!" she cried defiantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His big jaw closed with a snap and his figure became rigid. The candle's yellow light threw a strange glare on his face, convulsed. The blue flames of hell were in the glitter of his steel eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her heart sank in a dull wave of terror. She tried to gauge the depth of his brutal rage. There was no standard by which to measure it. She had never seen that look in his face before. His whole being was transformed by some sinister power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was afraid to move, but her mind was alert in this moment of supreme trial. She hadn't used her last weapon yet. The fact that he held her with such terrible determination was proof of the spell she had cast over him. She might save him. He couldn't have been a criminal long. She formed her new battle-line with quick decision.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE SURRENDER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How long she gazed into the convulsed face of the man who had squared himself before her, mattered little measured by the tick of the watch in her belt. Into the mental anguish endured a life's agony had been pressed. It could not have been more than twenty seconds, and yet it marked the birth of a new being within the soul of a woman. She had been searching only for her own happiness. The search had entangled another in the meshes of her life. Too much had been lived in the past two weeks to be undone by a word and forgotten in a day. She had attempted, coward-like, to run.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She saw now in the consuming flame of a great sorrow that the man before her had some rights which the purest woman must reckon with. He might be a burglar. At least it was her duty to try to save him from himself. Her surrender of the past weeks was a tie that would bind them through all eternity. There was no chemistry of earth or heaven or hell that could erase its memories. Her life was no longer her own — this man's was bound with hers. She must face the facts. She would make one honest, brave effort to save him. To do this she would give all without reservation — pride must be cast to the winds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her voice suddenly changed to tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim, you do love me, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His body slowly relaxed, his eyes shifted, and he shrugged his square shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'ell did I marry you for?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me — do you?" she demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know that I love you. What do you ask me such a fool question for? I love you with a love that can kill. Do you hear me? That's why you're not going anywhere without me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no mistaking the depth of his passion. She trembled to realize its power and yet it was the lever by which she must move him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you've got to give this life up. You're young and brave and strong. You can earn an honest living. You haven't been in this long — I feel it, I know it. Have you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How long?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eight months."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim, dear, you must give it up now for my sake. I'll work with you and work for you. I'll teach, I'll sew, I'll scrub, I'll slave for you day and night — if you're only clean and honest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned on her fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cut it, Kid — cut it! I'm out for the stuff now. I'm going to get rich and I'm going to get rich quick — that's all that's the matter with me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Jim," she broke in tenderly — "you did earn an honest living. Your workshop proves that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've used that to improve my tools and melt the swag the past year. The shop's all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you did make a successful invention?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet I did," he answered savagely, "and that's why I quit the business. Three years ago I took down a big automobile and worked out an improvement in the transmission that settled the question of heavy draft machines. I took it to a lawyer in Wall Street and he took it to a man that had money. Between the two of 'em, they didn't do a thing to me! They were going to put my patent on the market and make me a millionaire. God, I was crazy — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and squared his shoulders with a deep breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They put it on the market all right and they made some millionaires — but I wasn't one of 'em, Kiddo! They got me to sign a paper that skinned me out of every dollar as slick as you can pull an eel through your fingers. I hired another lawyer and gave him half he could get to beat 'em. He fought like a tiger and two days before I met you he got his verdict and they paid it — just ten thousand dollars. Think of it — ten thousand dollars! And each of them got a million cash. They sold it outright for two millions and a half. My lawyer got five thousand dollars, and I got five thousand dollars. That's mine, anyhow. It's in that bag there. I'm working on a new set of tools now in my shop. I'm going to get that money back from the two thieves who stole it from me by law. I'll take it by force, the way they took it. If I can croak them both in the fight — well, there'll be two thieves less to rob honest men and women, that's all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim!" Mary gasped, lifting a trembling hand to her throat as if to tear open her collar. "You're mad. You don't know what you're saying — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't fool yourself, Kiddo," he interrupted fiercely. "My eyes are open now, and I've got a level head back of 'em, too. I've doped it all out. You ought to 'a' heard that lawyer give me a few lessons in business when he'd skinned me and salted my hide. He was good-natured and confidential. He seemed to love me. `Business is war, sonny,' he piped, between the puffs of the big Havana cigar he was smoking — `war! war to the knife! We got you off your guard and put the knife into you at the right minute — that's all. Don't take it so hard! Invent something else and keep your eyes peeled. You ought to love us for giving you an education in business early in life. You're young. You won't have to learn your lesson again. Go to work, sonny, in your shop, and turn out another new tool for the advancement of trade!'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and smiled grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've done it, too! I've just finished a little invention that'll crack any safe in New York in twenty minutes after I touch it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He broke into a dry laugh, sat down and deliberately lighted a fresh cigarette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She studied his face with beating heart. Was he lost beyond all hope of reformation? Or was this the boyish bravado of an amateur criminal poisoned by the consciousness of wrong? She tried to think. She felt the red blood pounding through her heart and beating against her brain in suffocating waves of despair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In vivid flashes the scene of her marriage but two weeks ago, came back in tormenting memories. The solemn words she had spoken kept ringing like the throb of a funeral bell far up in the star-lit heavens —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I, Mary Adams, take thee, James Anthony, to my wedded husband, to have and to hold . . . for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death do us part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I give thee my troth ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last solemn prayer kept ringing its deep-toned message over all —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, bless, preserve, and keep you; the Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you, and fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace; that ye may so live together in this life, that in the world to come ye may have life everlasting. Amen ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a sudden rush of desperate pity for herself and the man to whom she was bound, she dropped on her knees by his side, slipped her arms about his neck and clung to him, sobbing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim, Jim, man," she whispered hoarsely. "I can't see you sink into hell like this! Have you no real love in your heart for the woman who has given all? Have mercy on me! Have mercy! You can't mean the hideous things you've just said! You've been crazed by your losses. You're just a boy yet. Life is all before you. You're only twenty-four. I'm just twenty-four. We can both begin anew. I've never lived until these past weeks — neither have you. You couldn't drag me down into a life of crime — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her head sank and her voice choked into silence. He made no movement of his hand to soothe her. His voice was not persuasive. It was hard and cold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not asking you to help me on any of my jobs," he said. "I'm the financier of the family. You can say the prayers and keep house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Knowing that you are a criminal? That your hands are stained with human blood?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?" he snapped, the blue blaze flashing again in his eyes. "Suppose you were the wife of the gentlemanly lawyer-thief who robbed me, using the law instead of a jimmy — would you bother your little head about my business? Does his wife ask him where he got it? Does anybody know or care? He lives on Fifth Avenue now. He bought a palace up there the day after he got my money. We passed it on the way to the Park the day I met you. A line of carriages was standing in front and finely dressed women were running up the red carpet that led down the stoop and under the canopy to the curb. Did any of the gay dames who smiled and smirked at that thief's wife ask how he got the money to buy the house? Not much. Would they have cared if they had known? They'd have called him a shrewd lawyer — that's all! Do you reckon his wife worries about such tricks of trade? Why should mine worry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She gripped his hand with desperate pleading.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim, dear, you can't be a criminal at heart! I wouldn't have loved you if it had been true. I can't believe it! I won't believe it. You're posing. You don't mean this. You can't mean it. You're going to return every dishonest dollar that you've taken."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know what you're talking about!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He closed his jaw with a snap and leaned close in eager, tense excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know how much junk I've piled into a little box in my shop the past three months?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't care — I don't want to know!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've got to care — you've got to know now! It's worth a hundred thousand dollars, do you hear? A hundred thousand dollars! It would take me a life-time to earn that on a salary. In two weeks after we get back to New York with my new invention that lawyer advised me to make, I'll go through his house — I'll open his safe, I'll take every diamond, every pearl and every scrap of stolen jewelry his wife's wearing. And I won't leave a fingerprint on the window sill. I've got two of his servants working for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In six months I'll be worth half a million. In a year I'll pull off the big haul I'm planning and I'll be a millionaire. We'll retire from business then — just like they did. We'll build our marble palace down at Bay Ridge and our yacht will nod in the harbor. We'll spend our summers in Europe when we like and every snob and fool in New York will fall over himself to meet me. And every woman will envy my wife. I'm young, Kiddo, but I've cut my eye teeth. You've just been born. I'm running the business end of this thing. You think you can reform me. You can — after I've made our pile . I'll join the church then and sing louder than that lawyer. But if you think you're going to stop my business career at this stage of the game — forget it, forget it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He sprang up with a quick movement of his tense body and threw her off. She rose and watched his restless steps as he paced the floor. Her mind was numb as if from a mortal blow. She brushed the tangled ringlets of brown hair back from her forehead, drew the handkerchief from her belt and wiped the perspiration from her brow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before she could gather the strength to speak, he wheeled suddenly and confronted her:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've known from the first, Kiddo, that you're not the kind to help in this business. I don't expect it. I don't ask it. I need a ranch like this down here for storage. I'm going to take the old woman into partnership with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She started back in an instinctive recoil of horror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your mother?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew a step nearer and peered into his set face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will make your own mother a criminal?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure!" he growled. "That's what I came down here for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She won't do it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She won't, eh?" he sneered. "Look at this hog pen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He swept the bare, wretched cabin with a gesture of contempt and shrugged his shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look at the rags she's wearing," he went on savagely. "When we talk it over tonight with that five thousand dollars in gold shining in her eyes — I'm going to show her a lot o' things she never saw before, Kiddo — take it from me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She answered in slow, even tones:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't live with you, Jim."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The blue flames beneath the drooping eyelids were leaping now in the yellow glare of the candle's rays. The muscles of his body were knotted. His voice came from his throat a low growl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know who you're fooling with?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The blood of a clean life flamed in her cheeks and nerved her with reckless daring. Her figure stiffened and her voice rang with defiant scorn:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I know at last — a thief who would drag his own mother down to hell with him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not a muscle of his powerful body moved; his face was a stolid mask. He threw his words slowly through his teeth:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now you listen to me. You're my wife. I didn't invent this marriage game. I played it as I found it. And that's the way you're going to play it. You're good and sweet and clean — I like that kind, and I won't have no other. You're mine. Mine , do you hear! Mine for life — body and soul — ` for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish ' — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and thrust his massive jaw squarely into her face:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"` — and obey! '" he hissed, "` until death do us part, according to God's holy ordinance ' — you said it, didn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned from him with sudden aversion:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know what you were — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody ever knows before they're married!" he broke in savagely. "You took your chances. I took mine — ` for better for worse .' We'll just say now it's for worse and let it go at that!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little body stiffened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll die first!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held her gaze without words, searching the depths of her being with the cold, blue flame in his drooping eyes. If she were bluffing, it was easy. She could talk her head off for all he cared. If she meant it, he might have his hands full unless he mastered the situation at once and for all time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no sign of yielding to his iron will. An indomitable soul had risen in her frail body and defied him. His decision was instantaneous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you'll die sooner than live with me — eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something hideous in the cold venom with which he drawled the words. Her heart fairly stopped its beating. With the last ounce of courage left, she held her place and answered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the sudden crouch of a tiger he drew his clenched fist to strike.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forget it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang back with terror, her body trembling in pitiful weakness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You snivelling little coward!" he growled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jim, Jim," she faltered, — "you — you — couldn't strike me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A step nearer and he stood over her, his big, flat head thrust forward, his eyes gleaming, his muscles knotted in blind rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — I won't strike you," he whispered. "I'll just kill you — that's all!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the leap of an infuriated beast he sprang on her and his sharp fingers gripped her throat. "The world went black and she felt herself sinking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The world went black and she felt herself sinking into a bottomless abyss. With maniac energy she tore his hands from her throat and the warm blood streamed from the gash his nails had torn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim! Jim! For God's sake!" she moaned in abject terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a sullen growl, his fingers, sharp as a leopard's claw, found her neck again and closed with a grip that sent the blood surging to her brain and her eyes starting from their sockets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The one hideous thought that flashed through her mind was that he was going to plunge his claws into her eyes and blind her for life. He could hold her his prisoner then. She made a last desperate struggle for breath, her hands relaxed, she drooped and sank to the couch toward which he had hurled her in the first rush of his assault.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted her and choked the slender neck again to make sure, loosed his hands and the limp body dropped on the couch and was still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stood watching her in silence, his arms at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Damned little fool!" he muttered. "I had to give you that lesson. The sooner the better!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waited with contemptuous indifference until she slowly recovered consciousness. She lay motionless for a long time and then slowly opened her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thank God! They had not been gouged out as poor Ella's. She didn't mind the warm blood that soaked her collar and ran down her neck. If he would only spare her eyes. Blindness had been her one unspeakable terror. She closed her eyes again and silently prayed for strength. Her strength was gone. Wave after wave of sickening, cowardly terror swept her prostrate soul. She could feel his sullen presence — his body with its merciless strength towering above her. She dared not look. She knew that he was watching her with cruel indifference. A single cry, a single word and he might thrust his claw into her eyes and the light of the world would go out forever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her terror was too hideous; she could endure it no longer. She must move. She must try to save herself. She lifted her head and caught his steady, venomous gaze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A quick, sliding movement of abject fear and she was erect, facing him and backing away silently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He followed with even step, his gaze holding her as the eyes of a snake its victim. She would not let him know her terror of blindness. She preferred death a thousand times. If he would only kill her outright it was all the mercy she would ask.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You — won't — kill — me — Jim!" she sobbed. "Please — please, don't kill me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his sharp finger and followed her toward the shed-room door, his voice the triumphant cry of an eagle above his prey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"` For better, for worse — until death do us port! '"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her heart gave a bound of cowardly joy. He had relented. He would not blind her. She could live. She was young and life was sweet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tried to smile her surrender through her tears as she backed slowly away from his ominous finger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I'll try — Jim. I'll try — ` until death do us part — until death — until death — '"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her voice broke into a flood of tears as she blindly felt her way through the door and into the darkened room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused on the threshold, held the creaking board shutter in his hand and broke into a laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The world ain't big enough for you to get away from me, Kiddo. Good night — a good little wife now and it's all right!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TO THE NEW GOD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim closed the door of the little shed-room with a bang, and stood listening a moment to the sobs inside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"` Until death do us part ,' Kiddo!" he laughed grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He turned back into the room and saw Nance standing at the opposite entrance between the calico curtains, an old, battered, flickering lantern in her hand. A white wool shawl was thrown over the gray head and fell in long, filmy waves about her thin figure. Her deep-sunken eyes were exaggerated in the dim light of lantern and candle. She smiled wanly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped short at the apparition; a queer shiver of superstitious fear shook him. The white form of Death suddenly and noiselessly appearing from the darkness could not have been more uncanny. He had wondered vaguely while the quarrel with his wife was progressing, what had become of his mother. As the fight had reached its height, he had forgotten her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked at him, blinking her eyes and trying to smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where the devil have you been, old gal?" he asked nervously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nowhere," she answered evasively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been mighty quiet on the trip anyhow. I see you've brought something back from nowhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance glanced down at the jug she carried in her left hand and laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin' — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin' from nowhere sounds pretty good to me when I see it in a brown jug on Christmas Eve. You're all right, old gal! I was just going to ask if you had a little mountain dew. You're a mind reader. I'll bet the warehouse you keep that stored in is some snug harbor — eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They ain't never found it yit!" she giggled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'll bet they won't — bully for you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She took down a tin cup from a shelf and placed it beside the jug.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Another glass, sweetheart — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman stared at him in surprise, walked to the shelf and brought another tin cup.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do ye want with two?" she asked in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim moved toward the stool beside the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sit down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure. Let's be sociable. It's Christmas Eve, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah!" Nance answered cheerfully, taking her seat and glancing timidly at her guest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim seized the jug, poured out two drinks of corn whiskey, handed her one and raised his:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, here's lookin' at you, old girl."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused, lowered his cup and smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But say, give me a toast." He nodded toward the shed-room. "I'm on my honeymoon, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His hostess laughed timidly and glanced at him from the corners of her eyes. She wished to be sociable and make up as best she could for her rudeness on their arrival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't never heard but one fur honeymooners," she said softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let's have it. I've never heard a toast for honeymooners in my life. It'll be new to me — fire away!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance fumbled her faded dress with her left hand and laughed again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'May ye live long and prosper an' all yer troubles be little ones! '"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She laughed aloud at the old, worm-eaten joke and Jim joined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bully! Bully, old girl — bully!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his cup and drained it at one draught and Nance did the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized the jug and poured another drink for each.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once more — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaned across the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And here's one for you." He squared his body and lifted his cup:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To all your little ones — no matter how big they are!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim drained his liquor without apparently noticing her agitation, though he was watching her keenly from the corner of his eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cup she held was lowered slowly until the whiskey poured over her dress and on the floor. Her thin figure drooped pathetically and her voice was the faintest sob:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — I — ain't got — none!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I heard you had a boy," Jim said carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The drooping figure shot upright as if a bolt of lightning had swept her. She stared at him in tense silence, trying to gather her wits before she answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who told you anything about me?" she demanded sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A fellow in New York," Jim continued with studied carelessness — "said he used to live down here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He lived down here?" she repeated blankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep — come now, loosen up and tell us about the kid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain't nuthin' ter tell — he's dead," she cried pathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said you deserted the child and left him to starve."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He said that?" she growled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was silent again and watched her keenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She fumbled her dress and glanced nervously across the table as if afraid to ask more. Unable to wait for him to speak, she cried nervously at last:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well — well — what else did he say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That he took the little duffer to New York and raised him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Raised him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She fairly screamed the words, springing to her feet trembling from head to foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Till he was big enough to kick into the streets to shuffle for himself."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The scoundrel said he was dead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her voice was far away and sank into dreamy silence. She was living the hideous, lonely years again with a heart starved for love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's voice broke the spell:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you didn't desert him?" The man's eyes held hers steadily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stared at him blankly and spoke with rushing indignation:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Desert him — my baby — my own flesh and blood? There's never been a minute since I looked into his eyes that I wouldn't 'a' died fur him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused and sobbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He had such pretty eyes, stranger. They looked like your'n — only they wuz puttier and bluer."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her faded dress, brushed the tears from her cheeks and went on rapidly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I found his drunken brute of a daddy was a liar and had another wife, I wouldn't live with him. He tried to make me but I kicked him out of the house — and he stole the boy to get even with me." Her voice broke, she dropped her head and choked back the tears. "He did get even with me, too — he did," she sobbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim watched her in silence until the paroxysm had spent itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think you'd know this boy now if you found him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She bent close, her breath coming in quick gasps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My God, mister, do you think I could find him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He lives in New York; his name is Jim Anthony."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — yes?" she said in a dazed way. "He called hisself Walter Anthony — he wuz a stranger from the North and my boy's name was Jim." She paused and bent eagerly across the table. "New York's an awful big place, ain't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Some town, old gal, take it from me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Could I find him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you've got money enough. You said you'd know him. How?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd know him!" she answered eagerly. "The last quarrel we had was about a mark on his neck. He wuz a spunky little one. You couldn't make him cry. His devil of a daddy used to stick pins in him and laugh because he wouldn't cry. The last dirty trick he tried was what ended it all. He pushed a live cigar agin his little neck until I smelled it burnin' in the next room. I knocked him down with a chair, drove him from the house and told him I'd kill him if he ever put his foot inside the door agin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stole my boy the next night — but he'll carry that scar to his grave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'd love this boy now if you found him in New York as bad as his father ever was?" Jim asked with a curious smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — he's mine!" was the quick, firm answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim watched her intently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I looked Death in the face for him," she went on fiercely. "I'd dive to the bottom o' hell to find him if I knowed he wuz thar — But what's the use to talk; that devil killed him! I've waked up many a night stranglin' with a dream when I seed the drunken brute burnin' an' beatin' an' torturin' him to death. The feller you've heard about ain't him. 'Tain't no use to make me hope an' then kill me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's not dead, I tell you. I know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's voice rang with conviction so positive the old woman's breath came in quick gasps and she smiled through her eager tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I might find him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you've got money enough! Money can do anything in this world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He opened the black bag, thrust both hands into it and threw out a handful of yellow coin which he allowed to pour through his fingers and rattle into a tin plate which had been left on the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes sparkled with avarice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's your'n — all your'n?" she breathed hungrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm taking it down South to invest for a fool who thinks" — he stopped and laughed — "who thinks it's bad luck to keep money that's stained with blood — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance started back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got blood on it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim spoke in confidential appeal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That wouldn't make any difference to you, would it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook her gray locks and glanced at the pile of yellow metal, hungrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — I wouldn't like it with blood marks!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted a handful of coin, clinked it musically in his hands and held it in his open palms before her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look! Look at it close! You don't see any blood marks on it, do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes devoured it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seized her hand, thrust a half-dozen pieces into it and closed her thin fingers over it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Feel of it — look at it!" "`Look! Look at it close!' Her eyes devoured it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her hands gripped the gold. She breathed quickly, broke into a laugh, caught herself in the middle of it, and lapsed suddenly into silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Feels good, don't it?" he laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance grinned, her uneven, discolored gleaming ominously in the flicker of the candle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't it?" he repeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted another handful and threw it in the air, catching it again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the stuff that makes the world go 'round. There's your only friend, old girl! Others promise well — but in the scratch they fail."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah — when the scratch comes they fail!" Nance echoed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Money never fails!" Jim continued eagerly. "It's the god that knows no right or wrong — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched the pile in the plate and drew the bag close for her to see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How much do you guess is there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance gazed greedily into the open bag and looked again at the shining heap in the plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dunno — a million, I reckon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not quite that much! But enough to make you rich for life — if you had it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman turned away pathetically and shook her gray head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't have to work no more, would I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her thin hands touched the faded, dirty dress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I could buy me a decent dress," her voice sank to a whisper, "and I could find my boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet you could!" Jim exclaimed. "There's just one god in this world now, old girl — the Almighty Dollar!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and leaned close, persuasively:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose now, the man that got that money had to kill a fool to take it — what of it? You don't get big money any other way. A burglar watches his chance, takes his life in his hands and drills his way into a house. He finds a fool there who fights. It's not his fault that the man was born a fool, now is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mebbe not — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not. A burglar kills but one to get his pile, and then only because he must, in self-defence. A big gambling capitalist corners wheat, raises the price of bread and starves a hundred thousand children to death to make his. It's not stained with blood. Every dollar is soaked in it! Who cares?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah — who cares?" Nance growled fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim smiled at his easy triumph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's dog eat dog and the devil take the hindmost now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so — ain't it?" she agreed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet! Business is business and the best man's the man that gets there. Steal a hundred dollars, you go to the penitentiary — foolish! Don't do it. Steal a million and go to the Senate!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah!" Nance laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Money — money for its own sake," he rushed on savagely — "right or wrong. That's all there is in it today, old girl — take it from me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and his smile ended in a sneer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Man shall eat bread in the sweat of his brow? Only fools sweat!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance turned her face away, sighed softly, glancing back at Jim furtively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon that's so, too. Have another drink, stranger?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She poured another cup of whiskey and one for herself. She raised hers as if to drink and deftly threw the contents over her shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim seized the jug and poured again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Once more. Come, I've another toast for you. You'll drink this one I know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his cup and rose a little unsteadily. Nance stood with uplifted cup watching him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As the poet sings," he began with a bow to the old woman:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"France has her lily, England the rose,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Everybody knows where the shamrock grows —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scotland has her thistle flowerin' on the hill,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the American Emblem — is a One Dollar Bill!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He broke into a boisterous laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How's that, old girl?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's bully, stranger!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted high his cup.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We drink to the Almighty Dollar!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To the Almighty Dollar!" Nance echoed, clinking her cup against his."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drained it while she again emptied hers over her shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By golly, you're all right, old girl. You're a good fellow!" he cried jovially.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah — have another?" she urged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She filled his cup and placed it on his side of the table. His eye had rested on the gold. He ignored the invitation, lifted a handful of gold and dropped it with musical clinking into the plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Blood marks — tommyrot!" he sneered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah — tommyrot!" she echoed. "That's what I say, too!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim wagged his head sagely:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now you're talking sense, old girl!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaned across the table and pointed his finger straight into her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And don't you forget what I'm tellin' ye tonight — get money, get money!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stopped suddenly and a sneer curled his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh I Get it `fairly' — get it `squarely' — but whatever you do — by God! — Get it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His uplifted hand crashed downward and gripped the gold. His fingers slowly relaxed and the coin clinked into the plate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance watched him eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah, that's it — get it," she breathed slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim lifted his drooping eyes to hers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you've got it, you're a god — you can do no wrong. Nobody's goin' to ask you how you got it; all they want to know is have you got it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yeah, nobody's goin' to ask you how you got it, Nance repeated, "they just want to know have you got it! Yeah — yeah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's head sank in the first stupor of liquor and he dropped into the chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman leaned eagerly over the plate of gold and clutched the coin with growing avarice. Her fingers opened and closed like a bird of prey. She touched it lovingly and held it in her hands a long time watching Jim's nodding head with furtive glances. She dropped a handful of coin into the plate and watched its effect on the drooping head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked up and his eyes fell again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bed-time, I reckon," Nance said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yep — pretty tired. I'll turn in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman glided sidewise to the table near the kitchen door, picked up the lantern and started to feel her way backwards through the calico curtains.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See you in the mornin', old gal," Jim drawled — "Christmas mornin' — an' I got somethin' else to tell ye in the mornin' — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again his head sank to the table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, mister — good night!" Nance answered, slowly feeling her way through the opening, watching him intently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim lifted his head and nodded heavily for a moment. His hand slipped from the table and he drew himself up sharply and rose, holding to the table for support.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He picked up the plate of coin, poured it back in the bag, snapped the lock and walked with the bag unsteadily to the couch. He placed the bag under the pillow and pressed the soft feathers down over it, turned back to the table and extinguished the candle by a quick, square blow of his open palm on the flame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He staggered to the couch, pushed the coats to the floor, dropped heavily, drew the lap-robe over him and in five minutes was sound asleep.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">NANCE'S STOREHOUSE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cabin was still. Only the broken sobbing of the woman in the little shed-room came faint and low on old Nance's ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She slipped from the kitchen into the shadows of a tree near the house and listened until the sobbing ceased.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She crept close to the shed and stood silent and ghost-like beside its daubed walls. Immovable as a cat crouching in the hedge to spring on her prey, she waited until the waning moon had sunk behind the crags. She laid her ear close to a crack in the logs from which she had once pushed the red mud to let in the light. All was still at last. The sobbing had stopped. The young wife was sound asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had wondered vaguely at first about the crying, but quickly made up her mind that it was only a lover's quarrel. She was glad of it. The girl would bar her door and sulk all night. So much the better. There would be no danger of her entering the living-room where Jim slept.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would wait a little longer to make sure she was asleep. A half hour passed. The white-shrouded figure stood immovable, her keen ears tuned for the slightest sounds from within.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stars were shining in unusual brilliance. She could see her way through the shadows even better than in full moon. A wolf was crying again for his mate from a distant crag. She had grown used to his howls. He had come close to her cabin once in the day-time. She had tried to creep on him and show her friendliness. But he had fled in terror at the first glimpse of her dress through the parting underbrush.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An owl was calling from his dead tree-top down the valley. She smiled at his familiar, tremulous call. Her own eyes were wide as his tonight. No sight or sound of Nature among the crags about her cabin had for her spirit any terror. The night was her mantle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She added to the meager living which she had wrung from her mountain farm by trading with the illicit distillers of the backwoods of Yancey County. Too ignorant to run a distillery of her own, she had stored their goods with such skill that the hiding- place had never been discovered. She loved good whiskey herself. She had tried to find in its fiery depths the dreams of happiness life had so cruelly denied her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hiding-place of this whiskey had puzzled the revenue officers of every administration for years. They had watched her house day and night. Not one of them had ever struck the trail to her storehouse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The game had excited her imagination. She loved its daring and danger. That there was the slightest element of wrong or crime in her association with the moonshiners of her native heath had never for a moment entered her mind. It was no crime to make whiskey. This was the first article of the creed of the true North Carolina mountaineer. They had from the first declared that the tax levied by the Federal Government on the product of their industry was an infamous act of tyranny. They had fought this tyranny for two generations. They would fight it as long as there was breath in their bodies and a single load of powder and buckshot for their rifles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance considered herself a heroine in the pride of her soul for the shrewd and successful defiance she had given the revenue officers for so many years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had been too cunning to even allow one of her own people to know the secret of her store house. For that reason it had never been discovered. She always stored the whiskey temporarily in the potato shed or under the cabin floor until night and then alone carried it to the place she had discovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She laughed softly at the thought of this deep hiding-place tonight. Its temperature never varied winter or summer. Not a track had ever been left at its door. She might live a hundred years and, unless some spying eye should see her enter, its existence could never be suspected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tipped softly into the kitchen, walked to the door of the living-room and listened to the even, heavy breathing of the man on the couch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more the faint echo of a sob in the shed beyond came to her keen ears. She stood for five minutes. It was not repeated. She had only imagined it. The girl was still asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned noiselessly back into the kitchen, put a box of matches in her pocket, felt her way to the low shelf on which she had placed the battered lantern, picked it up and shook it to make sure the oil was sufficient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stepped lightly into the yard, pushed open the gate of the split-board garden fence, walked along the edge to the corner and selected a spade from the tools that leaned against the boards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carrying the spade and unlighted lantern in her left hand, she glided from the yard into the woods. Her right hand before her to feel for underbrush or overhanging bough, she made her way rapidly to the swift-flowing mountain brook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Arrived at the water whose musical ripple had guided her steps, she removed her shoes and placed them beside a tree. She wore no stockings. The faded skirt she raised and tucked into her belt. She could wade knee deep now without hindrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seizing the spade and lantern, she made her way slowly and carefully downstream for three hundred yards and paused beside a shelving ledge which projected half-way across the brook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused and listened again for full ten minutes, immovable as the rock on which her thin, bony hand rested. The stars were looking, but they could only peep through the network of overhanging trees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Feeling her way along the rock until the ledge rose beyond her reach, she bent low and waded through a still pool of eddying water straight under the mountain-side for more than a hundred feet. Her extended right hand had felt for the stone ceiling above her head until it ran abruptly out of reach.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She straightened her body and took a deep breath. Ten steps she counted carefully and placed her bare feet on the dry rock beyond the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carefully picking her way up the sloping bank until she reached a stretch of soft earth, she sank to her hands and knees and crawled through an opening less than three feet in height.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thar now!" she laughed. "Let 'em find me if they can!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lighted her lantern and seated herself on a boulder to rest — one hundred and fifty feet in the depths of a mountain. The cavern was ten feet in height and fifty feet in length. The projecting ledges of rock made innumerable shelves on which a merchant might have displayed his wares.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman was too shrewd for that. Her jugs were carefully planted in the ground behind two fallen boulders, and their hiding-place concealed by a layer of drift which she had gathered from the edge of the water. She had taken this precaution against the day when some curious explorer might stumble on her secret as she had found it hunting ginsing roots in the woods overhead. Her foot had slipped suddenly through a hole in the soft mould. She peered cautiously below and could see no bottom. She dropped a stone and heard it strike in the depths. She made her way down the side of the crag and found the opening through the still eddying waters. The hole through the roof she had long ago plugged and covered with earth and dry leaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She carried her lantern and spade to the further end of her storehouse and dug a hole in the earth about two feet in depth. The earth she carefully placed in a heap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the place!" she giggled excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She left her lantern burning, dropped again on the soft, mould-covered earth and quickly emerged on the stone banks of the wide, still pool. Her hand high extended above her head, she waded through the water until she touched the heavy ceiling, lowered her body again to a stooping position and rapidly made her way out into the bed of the brook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She passed eagerly along the babbling path and stopped with sure instinct at the tree beside whose trunk she had placed her shoes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In five minutes she had made her way through the woods and reached the house. She tipped into the kitchen and stood in the doorway or the living-room watching her sleeping guest. The even breathing assured her that all was well. Her plan couldn't fail. She listened again for the sobs in the shed-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was sure once that she heard them. Five minutes passed and still she was uncertain. To avoid any possible accident she tipped back through the kitchen, circled the house and placed her ear against the crack in the logs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl was sobbing — or was she praying? She crouched beside the wall, waited and listened. The night wind stirred the dead leaves at her feet. She lifted her head with a sudden start, laughed softly and bent again to listen.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">TRAPPED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sobbing in the little room was the only sound that came from one of the grimmest battle-fields from which the soul of a woman ever emerged alive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the first rush of cowardly tears Mary had yielded utterly. She had fallen across the high-puffed feather mattress of the bed, shivering in humble gratitude at her escape from the horror of blindness. The grip of his claw-like fingers on her throat came back to her now in sickening waves. The blood was still trickling from the wound which his nails had made when she tore them loose in her first mad fight for breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her body and breathed deeply to make sure her throat was free. God in heaven! Could she ever forget the hideous sinking of body and soul down into the depths of the black abyss! She had seen the face of Death and it was horrible. Life, warm and throbbing, was sweet. She loved it. She hated Death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes — she was a coward. She knew it now, and didn't care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang to her feet with sudden fear. He might attack her again to make sure that her soul had been completely crushed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She crept to the door and felt its edges.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, thank God, there's a place for the bar!" She shivered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She ran her trembling fingers carefully along the rough logs and found it in the corner. She slipped it cautiously into the iron sockets, staggered to the bed and dropped in grateful assurance of safety for the moment. She buried her face in the pillow to fight back the sobs. How great her fall! She could crawl on her hands and knees to Jane Anderson now and beg for protection. The last shred of pretense was gone. The bankrupt soul stood naked and shivering, the last rag torn from pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a miserable fight she had made, too, when put to the test! Ella had at least proved herself worthy to live. The scrub-woman had risen in the strength of desperation and killed the beast who had maimed her. She had only sunk a limp mass of shivering, helpless cowardice and fled from the room whining and pleading for mercy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She could never respect herself again. The scene came back in vivid flashes. His eyes, glowing like two balls of blue fire, froze the blood in her veins — his voice the rasping cold steel of a file. And this coarse, ugly beast had held her in the spell of love. She had clung to him, kissed him in rapture and yielded herself to him soul and body. And he had gripped her delicate throat and choked her into insensibility, dropping her limp form from his hands like a strangled rat. She could remember the half-conscious moment that preceded the total darkness as she felt his grip relax.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He would choke and beat her again, too. He had said it in the sneering laughter at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A good little wife now and it's all right!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if you're not obedient to my whims I'll choke you until you are! That was precisely what he meant. That he was capable of any depth of degradation, and that he meant to drag her with him, there could be no longer the shadow of a doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She could not endure another scene like that. She sprang to her feet again, shivering with terror. She could hear the hum of the conversation in the next room. He was persuading his mother to join in his criminal career. He was busy with his oily tongue transforming the simple, ignorant, lonely old woman into an avaricious fiend who would receive his blood-stained booty and rejoice in it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He was laughing again. She put her trembling hands over her ears to shut out the sound. He had laughed at her shame and cowardice. It made her flesh creep to hear it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would escape. The mountain road was dark and narrow and crooked. She would lose her way in the night, perhaps. No matter. She could keep warm by walking. At dawn she would find her way to a cabin and ask protection. If she could reach Asheville, a telegram would bring her father. She wouldn't lose a minute. Her hat and coat were in the living-room. She would go bareheaded and without a coat. In the morning she could borrow one from the woman at the Mount Mitchell house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She crept cautiously along the walls of the room searching for a door or window. There must be a way out. She made the round without discovering an opening of any kind. There must be a window of some kind high up for ventilation. There was no glass in it, of course. It was closed by a board shutter — if she could reach it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She began at the door, found the corner of the room and stretched her arms upward until they touched the low, rough joist. Over every foot of its surface she ran her fingers, carefully feeling for a window. There was none!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She found an open crack and peered through. The stars were shining cold and clear in the December sky. The twinkling heavens reminded her that it was Christmas Eve. The dawn she hoped to see in the woods, if she could escape, would be Christmas morning. There was no time for idle tears of self-pity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The one thought that beat in every throb of her heart now was to escape from her cell and put a thousand miles between her body and the beast who had strangled her. She might break through the roof! As a rule the shed-rooms of these rude mountain cabins were covered with split boards lightly nailed to narrow strips eighteen inches apart. If there were no ceiling, or if the ceiling were not nailed down and she should move carefully, she might break through near the eaves and drop to the ground. The cabin was not more than nine feet in height.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised herself on the footrail of the bed and felt the ceiling. There could be no mistake. It was there. She pressed gently at first and then with all her might against each board. They were nailed hard and fast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sank to the bed again in despair. She had barred herself in a prison cell. There was no escape except by the door through which the beast had driven her. And he would probably draw the couch against it and sleep there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then came the crushing conviction that such flight would be of no avail in a struggle with a man of Jim's character. His laughing words of triumph rang through her soul now in all their full, sinister meaning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The world ain't big enough for you to get away from me, Kiddo!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It wasn't big enough. She knew it with tragic and terrible certainty. In his blind, brutal way he loved her with a savage passion that would halt at nothing. He would follow her to the ends of the earth and kill any living thing that stood in his way. And when he found her at last he would kill her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How could she have been so blind! There was no longer any mystery about his personality. The slender hands and feet, which she had thought beautiful in her infatuation, were merely the hands and feet of a thief. The strength of jaw and neck and shoulders had made him the most daring of all thieves — a burglar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His strange moods were no longer strange. He laughed for joy at the wild mountain gorges and crags because he saw safety for the hiding-place of priceless jewels he meant to steal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There could be no escape in divorce from such a brute. He was happy in her cowardly submission. He would laugh at the idea of divorce. Should she dare to betray the secrets of his life of crime, he would kill her as he would grind a snake under his heel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A single clause from the marriage ceremony kept ringing its knell — "until death do us part!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She knelt at last and prayed for Death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, dear God, let me die, let me die!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suicide was a crime unthinkable to her pious mind. Only God now could save her in his infinite mercy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lay for a long time on the floor where she had fallen in utter despair. The tears that brought relief at first had ceased to flow. She had beaten her bleeding wings against every barrier, and they were beyond her strength.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out of the first stupor of complete surrender, her senses slowly emerged. She felt the bare boards of the floor and wondered vaguely why she was there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hum of voices again came to her ears. She lay still and listened. A single terrible sentence she caught. He spoke it with such malignant power she could see through the darkness the flames of hell leaping in his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody's going to ask you how you got it — all they want to know is have you got it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She laughed hysterically at the idea of reformation that had stirred her to such desperate appeal in the first shock of discovery. As well dream of reforming the Devil as the man who expressed his philosophy of life in that sentence! Blood dripped from every word, the blood of the innocent and the helpless who might consciously or unconsciously stand in his way. The man who had made up his mind to get rich quick, no matter what the cost to others, would commit murder without the quiver of an eyelid. If she had ever had a doubt of this fact, she could have none after her experience of tonight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She wondered vaguely of the effects he was producing on his ignorant old mother. Her words were too low and indistinct to be heard. But she feared the worst. The temptation of the gold he was showing her would be more than she could resist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She staggered to her feet and fell limp across the bed. The iron walls of a life prison closed about her crushed soul. The one door that could open was Death and only God's hand could lift its bars.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DEVIL'S DISCIPLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hour after hour Nance stood beside the wall of the shed-room and with the patience of a cat waited for the sobs to cease and the girl to be quiet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary had risen from the bed once and paced the floor in the dark for more than an hour, like a frightened, wild animal, trapped and caged for the first time in life. With growing wonder, Nance counted the beat of her foot-fall, five steps one way and five back — round after round, round after round, in ceaseless repetition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Goddlemighty, is she gone clean crazy!" she exclaimed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The footsteps stopped at last and the low sobs came once more from the bed. The old woman crouched down on a stone beside the log wall and drew the shawl about her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A rooster crowed for midnight. Still the restless thing inside was stirring. Nance rose uneasily. Her lantern was still burning in her storehouse under the cliff. The wick might eat so low it would explode. She had heard that such things happened to lamps. It was foolish to have left it burning, anyhow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She glided noiselessly from the house into the woods, entered her hidden door exactly as she had done before, extinguished the lantern, placed it on a shelving rock and put a dozen matches beside it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In ten minutes she had returned to the house and crouched once more against the wall of the shed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The low, pleading voice was praying. She pressed her ear to the crack and heard distinctly. She must be patient. Her plan was sure to succeed if she were only patient. No woman could sob and pray and walk all night. She must fall down unconscious from sheer exhaustion before day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman slipped into the kitchen, took up the quilt which she had spread on the floor for her bed, wrapped it about her thin shoulders and returned to her watch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again and again she rose, believing her patience had won, and placed her ear to the crack only to hear a sound within which told her only too plainly that the girl was yet awake. Sometimes it was a sigh, sometimes she cleared her throat, sometimes she tossed restlessly. One spoken sentence she heard again and again:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, dear God, have mercy on my lost soul!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What can be the matter with the fool critter!" Nance muttered. "Is she moanin' for sin? To be shore, they don't have no revival meetings this time o' year!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had known sinners to mourn through a whole summer sometimes, but never in all her experience in religious revivals had a mourner carried it over into winter. The dancing had always eased the tension and brought a relapse to sinful thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hours dragged until the roosters began to crow for day. It would soon be light.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She must act now. There was no time to lose. She pressed her ear to the crack once more and held it five minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not a sound came from within. The broken spirit had yielded to the stupor of exhaustion at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With swift, cat's tread Nance circled the cabin and entered the kitchen. The quilt she carefully spread on the floor leading to the entrance to the living-room, crossed it softly and stood in the doorway with her long hands on the calico hangings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For five minutes she remained immovable and listened to the deep, regular breathing of the sleeping man. Her wits were keen, her eyes wide. She could see the dim outlines of the furniture by the starlight through the window. Small objects in the room were, of course, invisible. To light a candle was not to be thought of. It might wake the sleeper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She knew how to make the light without a noise or its rays reaching his face. He had startled her with the electric torch because of its novelty. She was no longer afraid. She would know how to press the button. He had left the thing lying on the table beside the black bag. He might have hidden the gold. He would not remember in his drunken stupor to move the electric torch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She glided ghost-like into the room. Her bare feet were velvet. She knew every board in the floor. There was one near the table that creaked. She counted her steps and cleared the spot without a sound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her thin fingers found the edge of the table and slipped with uncanny touch along its surface until her hand closed on the rounded form of the torch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without moving in her tracks she turned the light on the table and in every nook and corner of the room beyond. She slowly swung her body on a pivot, flashing the light into each shadow and over every inch of floor, turning always in a circle toward the couch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Satisfied that the object she sought was nowhere in the circle she had covered, she moved a step from the table and winked the light beneath it. She squatted on the floor and flashed it carefully over every inch of its boards from one corner of the room to the other and under the couch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rose softly, glided behind the head of the sleeping man and stood back some six feet, lest the flash of the torch might disturb him. She threw its rays behind the couch and slowly raised them until they covered the dirty pillow on which Jim was sleeping. There beneath the pillow lay the bag with its precious treasure. He was sleeping on it. She had feared this, but felt sure that the whiskey he had drunk would hold him in its stupor until late next morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She crouched low and fixed the light's ray slowly on the bag that her hand might not err the slightest in its touch. She laid her bony fingers on it with a slow, imperceptible movement, held them there a moment and moved the bag the slightest bit to test the sleeper's wakefulness. To her surprise he stirred instantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What'ell!" he growled sleepily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stood motionless until he was breathing again with deep, even, heavy throb. Gliding back to the table, she flashed the light again on the bag and studied its position. His big neck rested squarely across it. To move it without waking him was a physical impossibility.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here was a dilemma she had not fully faced. She had not believed it possible for him to place the bag where she could not get it. Her only purpose up to this moment had been to take it and store it safely beneath the soft earth in the inner recess of the cave. He would miss it in the morning, of course. She would express her amazement. The bar would be down from the front door. Someone had robbed him. The money could never be found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had made up her mind to take it the moment he had convinced her that his philosophy of life was true. His eloquence had transformed her from an ignorant old woman, content with her poverty and dirt, into a dangerous and daring criminal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no such thing as failure to be thought of now for a moment. The spade in the inner room of her store-house could be put to larger use if necessary. With the strength of the madness now on her she could carry his body on her back through the woods. The world would be none the wiser. He had quarreled with his wife, and left her in a rage that night. That was all she knew. The sheriff of neither county could afford to bother his head long over an insolvable mystery. Besides, both sheriffs were her friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her decision was instantaneous when once she saw that it was safe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled over the grim irony of the thing — his words kept humming in her ears, his voice, low and persuasive:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose now the man that got that money had to kill a fool to take it — what of it? You don't get big money any other way!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the shelf beside the door was a butcher knife which she also used for carving. She had sharpened its point that night to carve her Christmas turkey next day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised the torch and flashed its rays on the shelf to guide her hand, crept to the wall, took down the knife and laid the electric torch in its place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Steadying her body against the wall, her arms outspread, she edged her way behind the couch and bent over the sleeping man until by his breathing she had located his heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She raised her tall figure and brought the knife down with a crash into his breast. With a sudden wrench she drew it from the wound and crouched among the shadows watching him with wide-dilated eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The stricken sleeper gasped for breath, his writhing body fairly leaped into the air, bounded on the couch and stood erect. He staggered backward and lurched toward her. The crouching figure bent low, gripping the knife and waiting for her chance to strike the last blow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Strangling with blood, Jim opened his eyes and saw the old woman creeping nearer through the gray light of the dawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He threw his hands above his head and tried to shout his warning. She was on him, her trembling hand feeling for his throat, before he could speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Struggling, in his weakened condition, to tear her fingers away, he gasped:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here! Here! Great God! Do you know what you're doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just want yer money," she whispered. "That's all, and I'm a-goin' ter have it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her fingers closed and the knife sank into his neck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang back and watched him lurch and fall across the couch. His body writhed a moment in agony and was still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Holding the knife in her hand, she tore open the bag and thrust her itching fingers into the gold, gripping it fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nobody's goin' to ask ye how ye got it — they just want to know have ye got it — yeah! Yeah — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last word died on her lips. The door of the shed-room suddenly opened and Mary stood before her.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">DELIVERANCE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first dim noises of the tragedy in the living-room Mary's stupefied senses had confused with a nightmare which she had been painfully fighting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The torch in Nance's hand had flashed through a crack into her face once. It was the flame of a revolver in the hands of a thief in Jim's den in New York. She merely felt it. Her eyes had been gouged out and she was blind. A gang of his coarse companions were holding a council, cursing, drinking, fighting. Jim had sprung between two snarling brutes and knocked the revolver into the air. The flame had scorched her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With an oath he had slapped her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get out, you damned little fool!" he growled. "You're always in the way when you're not wanted. Nobody can ever find you when there's work to be done — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I can't see, Jim dear," she pleaded. "I do not know when things are out of place — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a liar!" he roared. "You know where every piece of junk stands in this room better than I do. I can't bring a friend into that door that you don't know it. You can hear the swish of a woman's skirt on the stairs four stories below — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I only asked you who the woman was who came in with you, Jim — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His fingers gripped her throat and stopped her breath. Through the roar of surging blood she could barely hear the vile words he was dinning into her ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know you just asked me, you nosing little devil, and it's none of your business! She's a pal of mine, if you want to know, the slickest thief that ever robbed a flat. She's got more sense in a minute than you'll ever have in a lifetime. She's going to live here with me now. You can sleep on the cot in the kitchen. And you come when she calls, if you know what's good for your lazy hide. I've told her to thrash the life out of you if you dare to give her any impudence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had cowered at his feet and begged him not to beat her again. The fumes of whiskey and stale beer filled the place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim turned from her to quell a new fight at the other end of the room. Another woman was there, coarse, dirty, beastly. She drew a knife and demanded her share of the night's robberies. She was trying to break from the men who held her to stab Jim. They were all fighting and smashing the furniture —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang from the bed with a cry of horror. The noise was real! It was not a dream. The beast inside was stumbling in the dark. His passions fired by liquor, he was fumbling to find his way into her room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rushed to the door and put her shoulder against the bar, panting in terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She heard his strangling cry:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here! Here! Great God! Do you know what you're doing?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And then his mother's voice, mad with greed, cruel, merciless:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just want yer money — that's all, an' I'm goin' to have it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She heard the clinch in the struggle and the dull blow of the knife. In a sudden flash she saw it all. He had succeeded in rousing Nance's avarice and transforming her into a fiend. Without knowing it she was stabbing her own son to death in the room in which he had been born!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tried to scream and her lips refused to move. She tried to hurry to the rescue and her knees turned to water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gasping for breath, she drew the bar from her prison door and walked slowly into the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance's tall, bony figure was still crouched over the open bag, her left hand buried in the gold, her right gripping the knife, her face convulsed with greed — avarice and murder blended into perfect hell-lit unity at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim lay on his back, limp and still, obliquely across the couch, his breast bared in the struggle, the blood oozing a widening scarlet blot on his white shirt. His head had fallen backward over the edge and could not be seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without moving a muscle, her body crouching, Nance spoke:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You wuz awake — you heered?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The gleaming eyes burned through the gray dawn, two points of scintillating, hellish light fixed in purpose on the intruder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had only meant to take the money. The fool had fought. She killed him because she had to. And now the sobbing, sniveling little idiot who had kept her waiting all night had stuck her nose into some thing that didn't concern her. If she opened her mouth, the gallows would be the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She would open it too. Of course she would. She was his wife. They had quarreled, but the simpleton would blab. Nance knew this with unerring instinct. It was no use to offer her half the money. She didn't have sense enough to take it. She knew those pious, baby faces — well, there was room for two in the cave under the cliff. It was daylight now. No matter; it was Christmas morning. No man or woman ever darkened her door on Christmas day. She could hide their bodies until dark, and then it was easy. She would be in New York herself before anyone could suspect the meaning of that automobile in the shed or the owners would trouble themselves to come after it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again her decision was quick and fierce. Her hand was on the bag. She would hold it against the world, all hell and heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the leap of a tigress she was on the girl, the bag gripped in her left hand, the knife in her right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To her amazement the trembling figure stood stock still gazing at her with a strange look of pity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well!" Nance growled. "I ain't goin' ter be took now I've got this money — I'm goin' to New York ter find my boy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted the knife and stopped in sheer stupor of surprise at the girl's immovable body and staring eyes. Had she gone crazy? What on earth could it mean? No girl of her youth and beauty could look death in the face without a tremor. No woman in her right senses could see the body of her dead husband lying there red and yet quivering without a sign. It was more than even Nance's nerves could endure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lowered the knife and peered into the girl's set face and glanced quickly about the room. Could she have called help? Was the house surrounded? It was impossible. She couldn't have escaped. What did it mean?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman drew back with a terror she couldn't understand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are you looking at me like that for?" she panted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary held her gaze in lingering pity. Her heart went out now to the miserable creature trembling in the presence of her victim. The blow must fall that would crush the soul out of her body at one stroke. The gray hair had tumbled over her distorted features, the ragged dress had been torn from her throat in the struggle and her flat, bony breast was exposed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't — have — to — go — to — New York — to — find — your — boy!" the strained voice said at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance frowned in surprise and flew back at her in rage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes I do, too — he lives thar!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little figure straightened above the crouching form.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's here!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance sank slowly against the table and rested the bag on the edge of the chair. Its weight was more than she could bear. She tried to glance over her shoulder at the body on the couch and her courage failed. The first suspicion of the hideous truth flashed through her stunned mind. She couldn't grasp it at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whar?" she whispered hoarsely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted her arm slowly and pointed to the couch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance glared at her a moment and broke into a hysterical laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's a lie — a lie — a lie!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's true — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yer're just a lyin' ter me ter get away an give me up — but ye won't do it — little Miss — old Nance is too smart for ye this time. Who told you that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He told me tonight!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He told you?" she repeated blankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a liar!" she growled. "And I'll prove it — you move out o' your tracks an' I'll cut your throat. My boy's got a scar on his neck — I know right whar to look for it. Don't you move now till I see — I know you're a liar — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned and with the quick trembling fingers of her right hand tore the shirt back from the neck and saw the scar. She still held the bag in her left hand. The muscles slowly relaxed and the bag fell endwise to the floor, the gold crashing and rolling over the boards. She stared in stupor and threw both hands above her streaming gray hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord God Almighty!" she shrieked. "Why didn't I think that he wuz somebody else's boy if he weren't mine!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The thin body trembled and crumpled beside the couch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl lifted her head in a look of awe as if in prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And God has set me free! free! free!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE DOCTOR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary stood overwhelmed by the tragedy she had witnessed. For the time her brain refused to record sensations. She had seen too much, felt too much in the past eight hours. Soul and body were numb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The first impressions of returning consciousness were fixed on Nance. She had risen suddenly from the floor and smoothed the hair back from Jim's forehead with tender touch as if afraid to wake him. She drew the quilt from the kitchen floor, spread it over the body, and lifted her eyes to Mary's. It was only too plain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Reason had gone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She tipped close and put her fingers on her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sh! We mustn't wake him. He's tired. Let him sleep. It's my boy. He's come home. We'll fix him a fine Christmas dinner. I've got a turkey. I'll bake a cake — " she paused and laughed softly. "I've got eggs too, fresh laid yesterday. We'll make egg-nog all day and all night. I ain't had no Christmas since that devil stole him. We'll have one this time, won't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girl's wits were again alert. She must run for help. A minute to humor the old woman's delusion and she might return before any harm came to her. Jim had not moved a muscle. It was plain that he was beyond help.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," Mary answered cheerfully. "You fix the cake — and I'll get the wood to make a fire."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance laughed again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll have the dinner all ready for him when he wakes, won't we?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I'll be back in a few minutes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance hurried into the kitchen humming an old song in a faltering voice that sent the cold chills down the girl's spine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary slipped quietly through the door and ran with swift, sure foot down the narrow road along which the machine had picked its way the afternoon before. The cabin they had passed last could not be more than a mile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made no effort to find the logs for pedestrians when the road crossed the brook. She plunged straight through the babbling waters with her shoes, regardless of skirts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Panting for breath, she saw the smoke curling from the cabin chimney a quarter of a mile away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank God!" she cried. "They're awake!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was so glad to have reached her goal, her strength suddenly gave way and she dropped to a boulder by the wayside to rest. In two minutes she was up and running with all her might.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She rushed to the door and knocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A mountaineer in shirt-sleeves and stockings answered with a look of mild wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For God's sake come and help me. I must have a doctor quick. We spent the night at Mrs. Owens'. She's lost her mind completely — a terrible thing has happened — you'll help me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cose I will, honey," the mountaineer drawled. "Jest ez quick ez I get on my shoes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is there a doctor near?" she asked breathlessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He answered without looking up:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The best one that God ever sent to a sick bed. He don't charge nobody a cent in these parts. He just heals the sick because hit's his callin'. Come from somewhar up North and built hisself a fine log house up on the side of the mountains. Hit's full of all the medicines in the world, too — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you ask him to come for me?" Mary broke in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll jump on my hoss an' have him thar in half a' hour. You can run right back, honey, and look out for the po' ole critter till we get thar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you! Thank you!" she answered grate fully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not at all, not at all!" he protested as he swung through the door and hurried to the low-pitched sheds in which his horse and cow were stabled. "Be thar in no time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Mary returned, Nance was still busy in the kitchen. She had built a fire and put the turkey in the oven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary was counting the minutes now until the doctor should come. The old woman's prattle about the return of her lost boy, so big and strong and handsome, had become unendurable. She felt that she should scream and collapse unless help came at once. She looked at her watch. It was just thirty-five minutes from the time she had left the cabin in the valley below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang to her feet with a smothered cry of joy. The beat of a horse's hoof at full gallop was ringing down the road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In two minutes the Doctor's firm footstep was heard at the kitchen door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance turned with a look of glad surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, fur the land sake, ef hit ain't Doctor Mulford! Come right in!" she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor seized her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And how is my good friend, Mrs. Owens, this morning?" he asked cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary was studying him with deep interest. She had asked herself the question a hundred times how much she could tell him — what to say and what to leave unsaid. One glance at his calm, intellectual face was enough. He was a man of striking appearance, six feet tall, forty-five years of age, hair prematurely gray and a slight stoop to his broad shoulders. His brown eyes seemed to enfold the old woman in their sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance was chattering her answer to his greeting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm feelin' fine, Doctor — " she dropped her voice confidentially — "and you're just in time for a good dinner. My boy that was lost has come home. He's a great big fellow, wears fine clothes and come up the mountain all the way in a devil wagon." She put her hand to her mouth. "Sh! He's asleep! We won't wake him till dinner! He's all tired out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor nodded understandingly and turned toward Mary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And this young lady?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's his wife from New York — ain't she purty?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor saw the delicate hands trembling and extended his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No word was spoken. None was needed. There was healing in his touch, healing in his whole being. No man or woman could resist the appeal of his personality. Their secrets were yielded with perfect faith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come with me quickly," Mary whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand," he answered carelessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Turning again to Nance, he said with easy confidence:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll not disturb you with your cooking, Mrs. Owens. Go right on with it. I'll have a little chat with your son's wife. If she's from New York I want to ask her about some of my people up there — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," Nance answered, "but don't you wake him! Go with her inter the shed-room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll go on tip-toe!" the Doctor whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nance nodded, smiled and bent again over the oven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary led him quickly through the living-room, head averted from the couch, and into the prison cell in which she had passed the night. The physician glanced with a startled look at the gold still scattered on the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seized his hand and swayed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched the brown hair of her bared head gently and pressed her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Steady, now, child, tell me quickly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes," she gasped, "I'll tell you the truth — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He held her gaze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And the whole truth — it's best."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary nodded, tried to speak and failed. She drew her breath and steadied herself, still gripping his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will," she began faintly. "He's dead — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused and nodded toward the living-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The man — her son?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. We came last night from Asheville. We were on our honeymoon. We haven't been married but three weeks. I never knew the truth about his life and character until last night when he told me that this old woman was his mother. I found a case of jewels in the bag he carried — jewels that belonged to a man in New York who was robbed and shot. I recognized the case. He confessed to me at last in cold, brutal words that he was a thief. I couldn't believe it at first. I tried to make him give up his criminal career. He laughed at me. He gloried in it. I tried to leave him. He choked me into insensibility and drove me into this cell, where I spent the night. He brought the gold that you saw on the floor which he had honestly made to give to his old mother — but for a devilish purpose. He showed it to her last night to rouse her avarice and make her first agree to hide his stolen goods. He succeeded too well. Before he had revealed himself she slipped into the room at daylight while he slept in a drunken stupor, murdered him and took the money. The struggle waked me and I rushed in. She gripped her knife to kill me. I told her that she had murdered her own son and she went mad — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused for breath and her lips trembled piteously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know what to do, Doctor?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you'll help me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He smiled tenderly and nodded his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God knows you need it, child!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nerves snapped at last, and she sank a limp heap at his feet.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE CALL DIVINE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor threw off his coat and took charge of the stricken house. He sent his waiting messenger for a faithful nurse, a mountain woman whom he had trained, and began the fight for Mary's life. The collapse into which she had fallen would require weeks of patient care. There was no immediate danger of death, and while he awaited the arrival of help, he turned into the living-room to examine the body of the slain husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The head had fallen backward over the side of the lounge and a pool of blood, still warm and red, lay on the floor in a widening circle beneath it. His quick eye took in its significance at a glance. He sprang forward, ripped the shirt wide open and applied his ear to the breast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's still alive!" he cried excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He examined the ugly wound in the left side and found that the knife had penetrated the lung. The heart had not been touched. The blow on the neck had not been fatal. The shock of the final stroke had merely choked the wounded man into collapse from the hemorrhage of the left lung. The position into which the body had fallen across the couch had gradually cleared the accumulated blood. There was a chance to save his life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In ten minutes he had applied stimulants and restored respiration, but the deep wheeze from the stricken lung told only too plainly the dangerous character of the wound. It would be a bitter fight. His enormous vitality might win. The chances were against him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's lips moved and he tried to speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor placed his hand on his mouth and shook his head. The drooping eyelids closed in grateful obedience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The beat of horses' hoofs echoed down the mountain road. His nurse and messenger were coming. He decided at once to move Mary to his own house. She must regain consciousness in new surroundings or her chance of survival would be slender. To awake in this miserable cabin, the scene of the tragedy she had witnessed, might be instantly fatal. Besides she must not yet know that the brute who had choked her was alive and might still hold the power of life and death over her frail body. She believed him dead. It was best so. He might be dead and buried before she recovered consciousness. The fever that burned her brain would completely cloud reason for days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He hastily improvised a stretcher with a blanket and two strong quilting-poles which stood in the corner of the room. Nance helped him without question. She obeyed his slightest suggestion with childlike submission.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He placed Mary on the stretcher, wrapped her body in another warm blanket and turned to his nurse and messenger:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Carry her to my house. Walk slowly and rest whenever you wish. Don't wake her. Tell Aunt Abbie to put her to bed in the south room overlooking the valley. Don't leave her a minute, Betty. She's in the first collapse of brain fever. You know what to do. I'll be there in an hour. You come back here, John. I want you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The mountaineer nodded and seized one end of the stretcher. The nurse took up the other and the Doctor held wide the cabin door as they passed out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For three weeks he fought the grim battle with Death for the two young lives the Christmas tragedy had thrust into his hands. He gave his entire time day and night to the desperate struggle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When pneumonia had developed and Jim's life hung by a hair, he slept on the couch in the living-room of the cabin and had Nance make for herself a bed on the floor of the kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman remained an obedient child. She cooked the Doctor's meals and did the work about the house and yard as if nothing had disturbed her habits of lonely plodding. She believed implicitly all that was told her. Her son had pneumonia from cold he had taken in the long drive from Asheville. The house must be kept quiet. John Sanders was helping her nurse him. She was sure the Doctor would save him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even the knife with which she had stabbed him made no impression on her numbed senses. The Doctor had scoured every trace of blood from the blade and put it back in its place on the shelf, lest she should miss it and ask questions. She used it daily without the slightest memory of the frightful story it might tell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each morning before going to the cabin the Doctor watched with patience for the first signs of returning consciousness in Mary's fever-wracked body. The day she lifted her grateful eyes to his and her lips moved in a tremulous question he raised his hand gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sh! Child — don't talk! It's all right. You're getting better. I've been with you every day. You're in my house now. You'll soon be yourself again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled wanly, put her delicate hand on his and pressed it gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand. You thank me — you say that I am good to you. But I'm not. This is my life. I heal the sick because I must. I love this battle royal with Death. He beats me sometimes — but I never quit. I'm always tramping on his trail, and I've won this fight!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The calm brown eyes held her in a spell and she smiled again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sleep now," he said soothingly. "Sleep day and night. Just wake to take a little food — that's all and Nature will do the rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stroked her hand gently until her eyelids closed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two days later Jim clung to the Doctor's hand and insisted on talking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better wait a little longer, boy," the physician answered kindly. "You're not out of the woods yet — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't wait — Doc — " Jim pleaded. "I've just got to ask you something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. You can talk five minutes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My wife, Doc, how is she? You took her to your house, John told me. She'll get well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. She's rapidly recovering now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does she say about me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She thinks you're dead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You haven't told her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She had all she could stand — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim stared in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think she'd be sorry to know I am alive?" he asked slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It would be a great shock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The steel blue eyes slowly filled with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God! I am rotten, ain't I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's no doubt about that, my son," was the firm answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why did you fight so hard to save me — I wonder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An old feud between Death and me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim suddenly seized the Doctor's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, you can't fool me — you're a good one, Doc. You've been a friend to me and you've got to help now — you've just got to. You're the only one on earth who can. You've a great big heart and you can't go back on a fellow that's down and out. Give me a chance! You will — won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The hot fingers gripped the Doctor's hand with pleading tenderness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The brown eyes searched Jim's soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you can show me it's worth while — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fingers tightened their grip in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just give me a chance, Doc," he said at last, "and I'll show you! I ain't never had a chance to really know what was right and what was wrong. If I'd a lived here with my old mother she'd have told me. You know what it is to be a stray dog on the streets of New York? Even then, I'd have kept straight if I hadn't been robbed by a lawyer and his pal. I didn't know what I was doin' till that night here in this cabin — honest to God, I didn't — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused for breath and a tear stole down his cheek. He fought for control of his emotions and went on in low tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't know — till I saw my old mother creepin' on me in the shadows with that big knife gleamin' in her hand! I tried to stop her and I couldn't. I tried to yell and strangled with blood. I saw the flames of hell in her eyes and I had kindled them there — God! I never knew until that minute! I'm broken and bruised lyin' on the rocks now in the lowest pit — Give me your hand, Doc! You're my only friend — I'm goin' straight from now on — so help me God!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused again for breath and sought the actor's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll stand by me, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A friendly grip closed on the trembling fingers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — I'll help you — if I can."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE MOTHER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary was resting in the chair beneath the southern windows of the sun-parlor of the Doctor's bungalow. He had built his home of logs cut from the mountainside. Its rooms were supplied with every modern convenience and comfort. Clear spring water from the cliff above poured into the cypress tank constructed beneath the roof. An overflow pipe sent a sparkling, bubbling and laughing through the lawn, refreshing the wild flowers planted along its edges.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The view from the window looking south was one of ravishing beauty and endless charm. Perched on a rising spur of the Black Mountain the house commanded a view of the long valley of the Swannanoa opening at the lower end into the wide, sunlit sweep of the lower hills around Asheville. Upward the balsam-crowned peaks towered among the clouds and stars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No two hours of the day were just alike. Some times the sun was raining showers of diamonds on the trembling tree-tops of the valleys while the blackest storm clouds hung in ominous menace around Mount Mitchell and the Cat-tail. Sometimes it was raining in the valley — the rain cloud a level sheet of gray cloth stretching from the foot of the lawn across to the crags beyond, while the sun wrapped the little bungalow in a warm, white mantle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary had never tired of this enchanted world during the days of her convalescence. The Doctor, with firm will, had lifted every care from her mind. She had gratefully submitted to his orders, and asked no questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She began to wonder vaguely about his life and people and why he had left the world in which a man of his culture and power must have moved, to bury himself in these mountain wilds. She wondered if he had married, separated from his wife and chosen the life of a recluse. He volunteered no information about himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When not attending his patients he spent his hours in the greenhouse among his flowers or in the long library extension of the bungalow. More than five thousand volumes filled the solid shelves. A massive oak table, ten feet in length and four feet wide, stood in the center of the room, always generously piled with books, magazines and papers. At the end of this table he kept the row of books which bore immediately on the theme he was studying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beside the window opening on the view of the valley stood his old-fashioned desk — six feet long, its top a labyrinth of pigeon-holes and tiny drawers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He pursued his studies with boyish enthusiasm and chattered of them to Mary by the hour — with never a word passing his lips about himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Abbie, the cook, brought her a cup of tea, and Mary volunteered a question.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know the Doctor's people, Auntie?" she asked hesitatingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lord, child, he's a mystery to everybody! All we know is that he's the best man that ever walked the earth. He won't talk and the mountain folks are too polite to nose into his business. He saved my boy's life one summer, and when he was strong and well and went back to Asheville to his work, I had nothin' to do but to hold my hands, and I come here to cook for him. He tries to pay me wages but I laugh at him. I told him if he could save my boy's life for nothin' I reckon I could cook him a few good meals without pay — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes filled with tears. She brushed them off, laughed and added:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He lets me alone now and don't pester me no more about money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her tea and toast finished, Mary placed the tray on the table, rose with a sudden look of pain, and made her way slowly to the library.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A warm fire of hardwood logs sparkled in the big stone fireplace. The Doctor was out on a visit to a patient. He had given her the freedom of the place and had especially insisted that she use his books and make his library her resting place whenever her mind was fagged. She had spent many quiet hours in its inspiring atmosphere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seated herself at his desk and studied the calendar which hung above it. A sudden terror overwhelmed her; she buried her face in her arms and burst into tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was still lying across the desk, sobbing, when the Doctor walked into the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched her hair reproachfully with his firm hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what's this? My little soldier has disobeyed orders?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't want to live now," she sobbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — I — am going to be a mother," she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The mother of a criminal! Oh, Doctor, it's horrible! Why did you let me live? The hell I passed through that night was enough — God knows! This will be unendurable. I've made up my mind — I'll die first — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rubbish, child! Rubbish!" he answered with a laugh. "Where did you get all this misinformation?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know what my husband was. How can you ask?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I happen to know also his wife — the mother-to-be of this supposed criminal who has just set sail for the shores of our planet — and I know that she is one of the purest and sweetest souls who ever lost her way in the jungles of the world. If you were the criminal, dear heart, the case might be hopeless. But you're not. You are only the innocent victim of your own folly. That doesn't count in the game of Nature — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you mean?" she asked breathlessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Simply this: The part which the male plays in the reproduction of the race is small in comparison with the role of the female. He is merely a supernumerary who steps on the stage for a moment "`Rubbish, child! Rubbish! . . . Where did you get all this misinformation?'" and speaks one word announcing the arrival of the queen. The queen is the mother. She plays the star role in the drama of Heredity. She is never off the stage for a single moment. We inherit the most obvious physical traits from our male ancestors but even these may be modified by the will of the mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Modified by the will of the mother?" she repeated blankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly. There are yet long days and weeks and months before your babe will be born — at least seven months. There's not a sight or sound of earth or heaven that can reach or influence this coming human being save through your eyes and ears and touch and soul. Almighty God can speak His message only through you. You are his ambassador on earth in this solemn hour. What your husband was, is of little importance. There is not a moment, waking or sleeping, day or night, that does not bring to you its divine opportunity. This human life is yours — absolutely to mold and fashion in body and mind as you will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're just saying this to keep me from suicide," Mary interrupted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am telling you the simplest truth of physical life. You can even change the contour of your baby's head if you like. You think in your silly fears that the bull neck and jaw of the father will reappear in the child. It might be so unless you see fit to change it. All any father can do is to transmit general physical traits unless modified by the will of the mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean that I can choose even the personal appearance of my child?" she asked in blank amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly that. Choose the type of man you wish your babe to be and it shall be so. Who in all the world would you prefer that he resemble?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You," she answered promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He smiled gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That pays me for all my trouble, child! No doctor ever got a bigger fee than that. Banks may fail, but I'll never lose it. Your choice simplifies that matter very much. You won't need a picture in your room — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A picture could determine the features of an unborn babe?" she asked incredulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beyond a doubt, and it will determine character sometimes. I knew a mother in the mountains of Vermont who hung the picture of a ship under full sail in her living-room. She bore seven sons. Not one of them ever saw the ocean until he was grown and yet all of them became sailors. This was not an accident. In her age and loneliness she blamed God for taking her children from her. Yet she had made sailors of them all by the selection of a single piece of furniture in her room. Nature has a way of starting her children on their journey through this world very nearly equal — each a bundle of possibilities in the hands of a mother. A father may transmit physical disease, if his body is unsound. Such marriages should be prohibited by law. But nine-tenths of the spiritual traits out of which character is formed are the work of the mother. A criminal mother will bring into the world only criminals. A criminal male may be the father of a saint. The responsibility of shaping the destiny of the race rests with the mother — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor sprang to his feet and paced the floor, his arms gripped behind his back in deep thought. He paused before the enraptured listener and hesitated to speak the thought in his mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his hand suddenly, his decision apparently made.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is of the utmost importance to the race that our mothers shall be pure. Better certainly if both father and mother are so. It is indispensable that the mother shall be! On this elemental fact rests the dual standard of sex morals. On this fact rests the hope of a glorified humanity through the development of an intelligent motherhood. Stay here with me until your child is born and I'll prove the truth of every word I've spoken — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, if I only could!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't impose such a burden on you!" she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You would confer on me the highest honor, if you will allow me to direct you in this experiment."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no mistaking his honesty and earnestness. There was no refusing the appeal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You really wish me to stay?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I beg of you to stay! You will bring to me a new inspiration — new faith — new courage to fight. Will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She extended her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you will agree to follow my instructions?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Absolutely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good. We begin from this moment. I give you my first orders. Forget that James Anthony ever lived. Forget the tragedy of Christmas Eve. You are going to be a mother. All other events in life pale before this fact. God has conferred on you the highest honor He can give to mortal. Keep your soul serene, your body strong. You are to worry about nothing — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must pay you for this extra expense I impose, Doctor. I have a thousand dollars in bank in New York," she interrupted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, if you will be happier. My home is now your sanitarium. You are my patient. Your board will cost me about eight dollars a week. All right. You can pay that if you wish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take no thought now except on the business of being a mother. I will make myself your father, your brother, your guardian, your physician, your friend and companion. I will give you at once a course of reading. You are to think only beautiful thoughts, see beautiful things, dream beautiful dreams, hear beautiful music. I'm going to make you climb these mountain peaks with me for the next three months and live among the clouds. I'm going to refit your room with new furniture and pictures and place in it a phonograph with the best music. When you are strong enough you can work for me three hours a day as my secretary. You use the typewriter?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm an expert — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good! I'm writing a book which I'm going to call `The Rulers of the World.' It is a study of Motherhood. I am one who believes that the redemption of humanity awaits the realization by woman of her divine call. When woman knows that she is really a co-creator with God in the reproduction of the race, a new era will dawn for mankind. You promise me faithfully to obey my instructions?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Faithfully."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're a wonderful subject on which to make an experiment. You are young — in the first dawn of the glory of womanhood. Your body is beautiful, your mind singularly pure and sweet. You must give me at once the full power of your will in its concentration on Truth and Beauty. The success or failure of this experiment will depend almost entirely on your mentality and the use you make of it during these months in which your babe is being formed. Whatever the shape of the body there is one eternal certainty — only your mind can reach the soul of this child. If the father were the veriest fiend who ever existed and should concentrate his mind to the task, not one thought from his darkened soul could reach your babe! Your mind will be the ever-brooding, enfolding spirit forming and fashioning character."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and his deep brown eyes flashed with enthusiasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Think of it! You are now creating an immortal being whose word may bend a million wills to his. And you are doing this mighty work solely by your mind. The physical processes are simple and automatic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The first lesson you must learn and hold with deathless grip is that thoughts are things. A thought can kill the body. A thought can heal the body. If I am successful as a physician it is because I use this power with my patients. With some I use drugs, with others none. With all I use every ounce of mental power which God has given me. You will remember this?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked to the shelves and drew down a volume of poetry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Read these poems until you are tired today — then sleep. I'll give you a good novel tomorrow and when you've read it, a volume of philosophy. When we climb the peaks, I'll give you a study of these rocks that will tell you the story of their birth, their life, and their coming death. We'll learn something of the birds and flowers next spring. We'll dream great dreams and think great thoughts — you and I — in these wonderful days and weeks and months which God shall give us together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She looked up at him through her tears:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Doctor, you have not only saved a miserable life: you have saved my soul!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">A SOUL IS BORN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was more than a month after the experiment began before the Doctor ventured to hint of Jim's survival. He had waited patiently until Mary's strength had been fully restored and her mind filled with the new enthusiasm for motherhood. He could tell her now with little risk. And yet he ventured on the task with reluctance. He found her seated at her favorite window overlooking the deep blue valley of the Swannanoa, a volume of poetry in her lap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He touched her shoulder and she smiled in cheerful response.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are content?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A strange peace is slowly stealing into my heart," she responded reverently. "I shall learn to love life again when my baby comes to help me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You remember your solemn promise?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have I not kept it?" she murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Faithfully — and I remind you of it that you may not forget today for a moment that your work is too high and holy to allow a shadow to darken your spirit even for an hour. I have something to tell you that may shock a little unless I warn you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her eyes with a quick look of uneasiness, and studied his immovable face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You couldn't guess?" he laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shook her head in puzzled silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose I were to tell you," he went on evenly, "that I found a spark of life in your husband's body that morning and drew him back from the grave?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes closed and she stretched her hand toward the Doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He clasped the fingers firmly between both his palms, held and stroked them gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did save him?" she breathed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank God his poor old mother is not a murderer! But he is dead to me. I shall never see him again — never!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you would feel that way," the Doctor quietly replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't let him come here?" she asked suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't try unless you consent — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary shuddered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know him — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid you don't know him now, my child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He has changed?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The old, old miracle over again. He has been literally born again — this time of the spirit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's incredible!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's true. He's a new man. I think his reformation is the real thing. He's young. He's strong. He has brains. He has personality — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All I ask of him is to keep out of my sight. The world is big enough for us both. The past is now a nightmare. If I live to be a hundred years old, with my dying breath I shall feel the grip of his fingers on my throat — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused and closed her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forget it! Forget it!" the Doctor laughed. "We have more important things to think of now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wishes to see me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Begs every day that I ask you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you have hesitated these long weeks?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your strength and peace of mind were of greater importance than his happiness, my dear. Let him wait until you please to see him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He'll wait forever," was the firm answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim smiled grimly when his friend bore back the message.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll never give up as long as there's breath in my body," he cried, bringing his square jaws together with a snap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the way to talk, my boy," the Doctor responded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Anyhow you believe in me, Doc, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you'll help me a little on the way if it gets dark — won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If I can — you may always depend on me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim clasped his outstretched hand gratefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm going to make good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was something so genuine and manly in the tones of his voice, he compelled the Doctor's respect. A smaller man might have sneered. The healer of souls and bodies had come to recognize with unerring instinct the true and false note in the human voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His heart went out in a wave of sympathy for the lonely, miserable young animal who stood before him now, trembling with the first sharp pains of the immortal thing that had awaked within. He slipped his arm about Jim's shoulders and whispered:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you something that may help you when the way gets dark — the wife is going to bear you a child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God! — That's great, ain't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim choked into silence and looked up at the Doctor with dimmed eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, Doc, you hit me hard when you brought what she said — but that's good news! Watch me work my hands to the bone — you know it's my kid and she can't keep me from workin' for it if she tries now can she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's just one thing that'll hang over me like a black cloud," he mused sorrowfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know, boy — your mother's darkened mind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I see that queer glitter in her eyes it goes through me like a knife. Will she ever get over it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can't tell yet. It takes time. I believe she will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll do the best you can for her, Doc?" he pleaded pathetically. "You won't forget her a single day? If you can't cure her, nobody can."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll do my level best, boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim pressed his hand again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee, but you've been a friend to me! I didn't know that there were such men in the world as you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For six months the Doctor watched the transplanted child of the slums grow into a sturdy manhood in his new environment. He snapped at every suggestion his friend gave and with quick wit improved on it. He not only discovered and developed a mica mine on his mother's farm, he invented new machinery for its working that doubled the market output. Within six weeks from the time he began his shipments the mine was paying a steady profit of more than five hundred dollars a month. He had made just one trip to New York and secretly returned to the police every stolen jewel and piece of plunder taken, with a full confession of the time and place of the crime. He had shipped his tools and machinery from the workshop on the east side before his sensational act and made good his departure for the South.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tools and machinery he installed in a new workshop which he built in the yard of Nance's cabin. Here he worked day and night at his blacksmith forge making the iron hinges, and irons, shovels, tongs, fire sets and iron work complete for a log bungalow of seven rooms which he was building on the sunny slope of the mountain which overlooks the valley toward Asheville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor had lent Jim the blue-prints of his own home and he was quietly duplicating it with loving care. His wife might refuse to see him but he could build a home for their boy. For his sake she couldn't refuse it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With childlike obedience Nance followed him every day and watched the workmen rear the beautiful structure under Jim's keen eyes and skillful hands. The man's devotion to his mother was pathetic. Only the Doctor knew the secret of his pitiful care, and he kept his own counsel.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE BABY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last roses of summer were bursting their topmost buds into full bloom on the lawn of the Doctor's bungalow. The martins that built each year in the little boxes he had set on poles around his garden were circling and chattering far up in the sapphire skies of a late September day. Their leaders had sensed the coming frost and were drilling for their long march across the world to their winter home. The chestnut burrs were bursting in the woods. The silent sun-wrapped Indian Summer had begun. Not a cloud flecked the skies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A quiet joy filled the soul of the woman who smiled and heard her summons.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not afraid?" the Doctor asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned her grateful eyes to his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The peace of God fills the world — and I owe it all to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense. Your sturdy will and cultivated mind did the work. I merely made the suggestion."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are not going to give me an anesthetic, are you?" she said evenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why did you ask that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because I wish to feel and know the pain and glory of it all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't wish to take it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not unless you say I should."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a wonderful patient you are, child! What a beautiful spirit!" He looked at her intently. "Well, I'm older and wiser in experience than you. I'm glad you added that clause `unless you say I should.' I'm going to say it. After all my talks to you on our return to the truths and simplicity of Nature you are perhaps surprised. You needn't be. I'm going to put you into a gentle sleep. Nature will then do her physical work automatically. I do this because our daughters are the inheritors of the sins of their mothers for centuries. The over-refinement of nerves, the hothouse methods of living, and the maiming of their bodies with the inventions of fashion have made the pains of this supreme hour beyond endurance. This should not be. It will not be so when our race has come into its own. But it will take many generations and perhaps many centuries before we reach the ideal. No physician who has a soul could permit a woman of your physique, your culture and refinement to walk barefoot and blindfolded into such a hell of physical torture. I will not permit it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He walked quietly into his laboratory, prepared the sleeping powders and gave them to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Six hours later she opened her eyes with eager wonder. Aunt Abbie was busy over a bundle of fluffy clothes. The Doctor was standing with his arms folded behind his back, his fine, clean-shaven face in profile looking thoughtfully over the sun-lit valley. There was just one moment of agonized fear. If they had failed! If her child were hideous — or deformed! Her lips moved in silent prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Doctor?" she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a moment he was bending over her, a look of exaltation in his brown eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell me quick!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A wonderful boy, little mother! The most beautiful babe I have ever seen. He didn't even cry — just opened his big, wide eyes and grunted contentedly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Give him to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Abbie laid the warm bundle in her arms and she pressed it gently until the sweet, red flesh touched her own. She lay still for a moment, a smile on her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lift him and let me look!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a funny little pug nose," she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — exactly like his mother's!" the Doctor replied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She gazed with breathless reverence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He is beautiful, isn't he?" she sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you have observed the chin and mouth?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly like yours. It's wonderful!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">WHAT IS LOVE?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eighteen months swiftly passed with the little mother and her boy still in Dr. Mulford's sanitarium. She had allowed herself to be persuaded that he had the right to be her guide and helper in the first year's training of the child.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy had steadily grown in strength and beauty of body and mind. The Doctor persuaded her to spend one more winter basking in his sun-parlor and finishing the final chapters of his book. Her mind was singularly clever and helpful in the interpretation of the experiences and emotions of motherhood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had stubbornly resisted every suggestion to see her husband or allow him to see the child. The Doctor had managed twice to give Jim an hour with the baby while she had gone to Asheville on shopping trips. He was rewarded for his trouble in the devotion with which the young father worshiped his son. The Doctor watched the slumbering fires kindle in the man's deep blue eyes with increasing wonder at the strength and tenderness of his newfound soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim had completed the furnishing of the bungalow with the advice and guidance of his friend, and every room stood ready and waiting for its mistress. He had insisted on making every piece of furniture for Mary's room and the nursery adjoining. The Doctor was amazed at the mechanical genius he displayed in its construction. He had taken a month's instruction at a cabinet maker's in Asheville and the bed, bureau, tables and chairs which he had turned out were astonishingly beautiful. Their lines were copied from old models and each piece was a work of art. The iron work was even more tastefully and beautifully wrought. He had toiled day and night with an enthusiasm and patience that gave the physician a new revelation in the possibility of the development of human character.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His friend came at last with a cheering message. He began smilingly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm going to make the big fight today, boy, to get her to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You think she will?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's a good chance. Her savings have all been used up from her bank account in New York. She is determined to go to her father in Kentucky. I'll have a talk with her, bring her over to the bungalow, show her through it on the pretext of its model construction and then you can tell her that you built it with your own hands for her and the baby. You might be loafing around the place about that time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim's hand was suddenly lifted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I got ye, Doc, I got ye! I'll be there — all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't let her see you until I give the signal."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Caution's my name."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll see what happens."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim pressed close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, Doc, if you know how to pray, I wish you'd send up a little word for me while you're talkin' to her. Could ye now?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll do my best for you, boy — and I think you've got a chance. She's been watching the blue eyes of that baby lately with a rather curious look of unrest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're just like mine, ain't they?" Jim broke in with pride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Time has softened the old hurt," the Doctor went on. "The boy may win for you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The square jaw came together with a smash.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gee — I hope so. I'll wait there all day for you and I'm goin' to try my own hand at a little prayer or two on the side while I'm waiting. Maybe God'll think He's hit me hard enough by this time to give me another trial."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a friendly wave of his hand the Doctor hurried home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He found Mary seated under the rose trellis beside the drive, watching for his coming. The day was still and warm for the end of April. Birds were singing and chattering in every branch and tree. A quail on the top fence-rail of the wheat field called loudly to his mate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy was screaming his joy over a new wagon to which Aunt Abbie had hitched his goat. He drove by in style, lifted his chubby hand to his mother and shouted:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dood-by, Doc-ter!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor waved a smiling answer, and lapsed into a long silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He waked at last from his absorption to notice that Mary was day-dreaming. The fair brow was drawn into deep lines of brooding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why shadows in your eyes a day like this, little mother?" he asked softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just thinking — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About a past that you should forget?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes and no," she answered thoughtfully. "I was just thinking in this flood of spring sunlight of the mystery of my love for such a man as the one I married. How could it have been possible to really love him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are sure that you loved him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did you know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By all the signs. I trembled at his footstep. The touch of his hand, the sound of his voice thrilled me. I was drawn by a power that was resistless. I was mad with happiness those wonderful days that preceded our marriage. I was madder still during our honeymoon — until the shadows began to fall that fatal Christmas Eve." She paused and her lips trembled. "Oh, Doctor, what is love?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The drooping shoulders of the man bent lower. He picked up a pebble from the ground and flicked it carelessly across the drive, lifted his head at last and asked earnestly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I tell you the truth?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — your own particular brand, please — the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try," he began soberly. "If I were a poet, naturally I would use different language. As I'm only a prosaic doctor and physiologist I may shock your ideals a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No matter," she interrupted. "They couldn't well get a harder jolt than they have had already."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He nodded and went on:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There are two elemental human forces that maintain life — hunger and love. They are both utterly simple, otherwise they could not be universal. Hunger compels the race to live. Love compels it to reproduce itself. There has never been anything mysterious about either of these forces and there never will be — except in the imagination of sentimentalists.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nature begins with hunger. For about thirteen years she first applies this force to the development of the body before she begins to lay the foundation of the second. Until this second development is complete the passion known as love cannot be experienced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is this second development? Very simple again. At the base of the brain of every child there is a vacant space during the first twelve or fifteen years. During the age of twelve to fourteen in girls, thirteen to fifteen in boys, this vacant space is slowly filled by a new lobe of the brain and with its growth comes the consciousness of sex and the development of sex powers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This new nerve center becomes on maturity a powerful physical magnet. The moment this magnet comes into contact with an organization which answers its needs, as certain kinds of food answer the needs of hunger, violent desire is excited. If both these magnets should be equally powerful, the disturbance to both will be great. The longer the personal association is continued the more violent becomes this disturbance, until in highly sensitive natures it develops into an obsession which obscures reason and crushes the will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The meaning of this impulse is again very simple — the unconscious desire of the male to be a father, of the female to become a mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And there is but one man on earth who could thus affect me?" Mary asked excitedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Rubbish! There are thousands."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thousands?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Literally thousands. The reason you never happen to meet them is purely an accident of our poor social organization. Every woman has thousands of true physical mates if she could only meet them. Every man has thousands of true physical mates if he could only meet them. And in every such meeting, if mind and body are in normal condition, the same violent disturbance would result — whether married or single, free or bound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Marriage therefore is not based merely on the passion of love. It is a crime for any man or woman to marry without love. It is the sheerest insanity to believe that this passion within itself is sufficient to justify marriage. All who marry should love. Many love who should not marry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The institution of marriage is the great social ordinance of the race. Its sanctity and perpetuity are not based on the violence of the passion of love, but something else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and listened to the call of the quail again from the field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You hear that bob white calling his mate?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes — and she's answering him now very softly. I can hear them both."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They have mated this spring to build a home and rear a brood of young. Within six months their babies will all be full grown and next spring a new alignment of lovers will be made. Their marriage lasts during the period of infancy of their offspring. This is Nature's law.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It happens in the case of man that the period of infancy of a human being is about twenty-four years. This is the most wonderful fact in nature. It means that the capacity of man for the improvement of his breed is practically limitless. A quail has a few months in which to rear her young. God gives to woman a quarter of a century in which to mold her immortal offspring. Because the period of infancy of one child covers the entire period of motherhood capacity, marriage binds for life, and the sanctity of marriage rests squarely on this law of Nature."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused again and looked over the sunlit valley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish our boys and girls could all know these simple truths of their being. It would save much unhappiness and many tragic blunders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were swept completely off your feet by the rush of the first emotion caused by meeting a man who was your physical mate. You imagined this emotion to be a mysterious revelation which can come but once. Your imagination in its excited condition, of course, gave to your first-found mate all sorts of divine attributes which he did not possess. You were `in love' with a puppet of your own creation, and hypnotized yourself into the delusion that James Anthony was your one and only mate, your knight, your hero.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In a very important sense this was true. Your intuitions could not make a mistake on so vital an issue. But you immediately rushed into marriage and your union has been perfected by the birth of a child. Whether you are happy or unhappy in marriage does not depend on the reality of love. Happiness in marriage is based on something else."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"On what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The joy and peace that comes from oneness of spirit, tastes, culture and character. I know this from the deepest experiences of life and the widest observation."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have loved?" she asked softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Twice — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A silence fell between them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall I tell you, little mother?" he finally asked quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He seated himself and looked into the skies beyond the peaks across the valley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ten years ago I met my first mate. The meeting was fortunate for both. She was a woman of gentle birth, of beautiful spirit. Our courtship was ideal. We thought alike, we felt alike, she loved my profession even — an unusual trait in a woman. She thought it so noble in its aims that the petty jealousy that sometimes wrecks a doctor's life was to her an unthinkable crime. The first year was the nearest to heaven that I had ever gotten down here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And then, little mother, by one of those inexplicable mysteries of nature she died when our baby was born. For a while the light of the world went out. I quit New York, gave up my profession and came here just to lie in the sun on this mountainside and try to pull myself together. I didn't think life could ever be worth living again. But it was. I found about me so much of human need — so much ignorance and helplessness — so much to pity and love, I forgot the ache in my own heart in bringing joy to others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had money enough. I gave up the ambitions of greed and strife and set my soul to higher tasks. For nine years I've devoted my leisure hours to the study of Motherhood as the hope of a nobler humanity. But for the great personal sorrow that came to me in the death of my wife and baby I should never have realized the truths I now see so clearly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And then the other woman suddenly came into my life. I never expected to love again — not because I thought it impossible, but because I thought it improbable in my little world here that I could ever again meet a woman I would ask to be my wife. But she dropped one day out of the sky."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and took a deep breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I recognized her instantly as my mate, gentle and pure and capable of infinite joy or infinite pain. She did not realize the secret of my interest in her. I didn't expect it. I knew that under the conditions she could not. But I waited."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and searched for Mary's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you married her?" she asked in even tones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have never allowed her to know that I love her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She was married."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary threw him a startled look and he went on evenly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I could have used my power over mind and body to separate her from her husband. I confess that I was tempted. But there was a child. Their union had been sealed with the strongest tie that can bind two human beings. I have never allowed her to realize that she might love me. Had I chosen to break the silence between us I could have revealed this to her, taken her and torn her from the man to whom she had borne a babe. I had no right to commit that crime, no matter how deep the love that cried for its own. Marriage is based on the period of infancy of the child which spans the maternal life of woman. God had joined these two people together and no man had the right to put them asunder!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you gave her up?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had to, little mother. On the recognition of this eternal law the whole structure of our civilization rests."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary bent her gaze steadily on his face for a moment in silence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you are telling me that I should be reconciled to the man who choked me into insensibility?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am telling you that he is the father of your son — that he has rights which you cannot deny; that when you gave yourself to him in the first impulse of love a deed was done which Almighty God can never undo. Your tragic blunder was the rush into marriage with a man about whose character you knew so little. It's the timid, shrinking, home-loving girl that makes this mistake. You must face it now. You are responsible as deeply and truly as the man who married you. That he happened at that moment to be a brute and a criminal is no more his fault than yours. It was your business to know before you made him the father of your child."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I tried to appeal to his better nature that awful night," Mary interrupted, "but he only laughed at me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You owe him another trial, little mother — you owe it to his boy, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary shook her head bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't — I just can't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You won't see him once?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sprang to her feet trembling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No — no!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think it's fair."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid of him! You can't understand his power over my will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, come, this is sheer cowardice — give the devil his dues. Face him and fight it out. Tell him you're done forever with him and his life, if you will — but don't hedge and trim and run away like this. I'm ashamed of you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I won't see him — I've made up my mind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor threw up both hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. If you won't, you won't. We'll let it go at that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused and changed his tones to friendly personal interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you're determined to leave me and take my kid away tomorrow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We must go. I've no money to pay my board. I can't impose on you — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's going to be awfully lonely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He looked at her with a strange, deep gaze, lifted his stooping shoulders with sudden resolution and changed his manner to light banter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose I couldn't persuade you to give me that boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She smiled tenderly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know his father did leave his mark on him after all! The eyes are all his. Of course, I will admit that those drooping lids have often been the mark of genius — perhaps a genius for evil in this case. If you don't want to take the risk — now's your chance. I will — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary shook her head in reproachful protest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't tease me, dear doctor man. I've just this one day more with you. I'm counting each precious hour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forgive me!" he cried gayly. "I won't tease you any more. Come, we'll run over now and see our neighbor's new bungalow before you go. You admire this one and threaten to duplicate it. He has built a better one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you wish it — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good. We'll take the boy, too. He can drive his new wagon the whole way. It's only half a mile.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE NEW MAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door of the bungalow stood wide open. Mary paused in rapture over the rich beds of wood violets that carpeted the spaces between the drive and the log walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aren't they beautiful!" she cried. "A perfect carpet of dazzling green and purple!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come right in," the Doctor urged from the steps. "My neighbor's a patient of mine. He hasn't moved in yet but he told me always to make myself at home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary lifted the boy from his wagon, tied the goat and led the child into the house. The Doctor showed her through without comment. None was needed. The woman's keen eye saw at a glance the perfection of care with which the master builder had wrought the slightest detail of every room. The floors were immaculate native hard-wood — its grain brought out through shining mirrors of clean varnish. There was not one shoddy piece of work from the kitchen sink to the big open fireplace in the spacious hall and living-room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's exquisite!" she exclaimed at last. "It seems all hand-made — doesn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is, too. The owner literally built it with his own hands — a work of love."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For himself?" Mary asked with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the woman he loves, of course! My neighbor's a sort of crank and insisted on expressing himself in this way. Come, I want you to see two rooms upstairs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He led her into the room Jim had built for his wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Observe this furniture, if you please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't tell me that he built that too?" she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's exactly what I'm going to tell you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Impossible!" she protested. "Why, the line and finish would do credit to the finest artisan in America."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I say. Look at the perfect polish of that table! It's like the finish of a rosewood piano." He touched the smooth surface.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you're joking?" Mary answered. "No amateur could have done such work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I'd have said if I had not seen him do it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What on earth possessed him to undertake such a task?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The love of a beautiful woman — what else?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He learned a trade — just to furnish this room with his own hand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"His love must be the real thing," she mused.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I've said. Look at this iron work, too — the stately andirons in that big fireplace, the shovel, the tongs, and the massive strop-hinges on the doors."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He did that, too?" she asked in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Every piece of iron on the place he beat out with his own hand at his forge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And all for the love of a woman? The age of romance hasn't passed after all, has it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary paused before the window looking south.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What a glorious view!" she cried. "It's even grander than yours, Doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I claim some of the credit, though, for that. I helped him lay out the grounds."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is this remarkable man?" she asked at last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A friend of mine. I'll introduce him directly. He should be here at any moment now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We're intruding," Mary whispered. "We must go. I mustn't look any more. I'll be coveting my neighbor's house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Illustration missing from print text, titled, "`I'll show you, little girl — I'll show you!" he whispered tensely."]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor turned to the window and signaled to someone on the lawn, as Mary hurried down the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She fairly ran into Jim, who was being pulled into the house by the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Ook, Mamma! 'Ook! I found a Daddy! He says he be my Daddy if you let him. Please let him. I want a Daddy, an' I like him. Please!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jim blushed and trembled and lifted his eyes appealingly, while Mary stood white and still watching him in a sort of helpless terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The child moved on to his wagon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, little girl," Jim began in low tones, "it's been a thousand years since I saw you. Don't drive me away — just give me one chance for God's sake and this baby's that He sent us! I've gone straight. I've sent back every dishonest dollar. I'm earning a clean living down here and a good one. I've practiced for two years cutting out the slang, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He paused for breath and she turned her head away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just listen a minute! I know I was a beast that night. I'm not the same now. I've been through the fires of hell and I've come out a cleaner man. Let me show you how much I love you! Life's too short, but just give me a chance. If I could undo that awful hour when I hurt you so, I'd crawl 'round the world on my hands and knees — and I'll show you that I mean it! I built this house for you and the baby."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mary turned suddenly with wide dilated eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You — you built this house?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've worked on it every hour, day and night, the past two years when I wasn't earning a living in the mine. I made every stick of that furniture in the rooms up there — for you and my boy. The house is yours — whether you let me stay or not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I — I can't take it, Jim," she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've got to, girlie. You can't throw a gift like this back in a fellow's face — it cost too much! Your money's all gone. You've got to bring up that kid. He's mine, too. I'm man enough to support my wife and baby and I'm going to do it. I don't care what you say. You've got to let me. I'm going to work for you, live for you and die for you — whether you stay with me or not. I've got the right to do that, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She lifted her head and faced him squarely for the first time, amazed at the new dignity and strength of his quiet bearing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have changed, Jim — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her eyes sought the depths of his soul in a moment's silence, and she slowly extended her hand:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll try again!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent and kissed the tips of her fingers reverently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They stood for a moment hand in hand and looked over the sunlit valley of the Swannanoa shimmering in peace and beauty between its sheltering walls of blue mountains. The bees were humming spring music among the flowers at their feet and the faint odor of fruit trees in blossom came from the orchard Jim had planted two years before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll show you, little girl — I'll show you!" he whispered tensely. THE END</field>
