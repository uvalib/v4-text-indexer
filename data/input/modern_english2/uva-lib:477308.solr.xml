      <field name="fulltext">Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, adorned with red smoking-jacket reads his paper. A dragonfly dances on his toe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE water was all slippy- sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, adorned with red smoking-jacket walks through his water-covered home with china plates and watering pitcher and says hello to a snail on his wall.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, adorned with red smoking-jacket walks out of his french-doors into his garden. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HE was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I WILL get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. "If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.''</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, digs up worms for bait with a shovel. Blank Page. Blank Page. Illustration of Jeremy Fisher, the frog, hopping from lily-pad to lily-pad with fishing rod and bait in hand. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JEREMY put on a macintosh, and a pair of shiny goloshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, unties his lily-pad boat from a water plant. A water lily is also in the foreground. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, uses a reed to punt upon the water on his lily-pad boat. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JEREMY took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. "I know a good place for minnows,'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JEREMY stuck his pole into the mud and fastened his boat to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sitting cross-legged, Jeremy Fisher, the frog, ties a float onto his fishing rod. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, sits hunched over on his lily-pad boat with his fishing-line in the water. Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HE punted back again amongst the water- plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, sits on his lily-pad boat and relaxes eating a sandwich. In the background are white water-lilies. Blank Page. Blank Page. Illustration of a black water-beetle coming up under the lily-pad to nibble on Jeremy Fisher's toe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A GREAT big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his goloshes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONCE or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I trust that is not a rat,'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; "I think I had better get away from here.'' Illustration of water-rats: one swimming rat and one rat on the bank eating water reeds. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, bends over on his lily-pad because he has a tug on his fishing-pole.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JEREMY shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!'' cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BUT what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback, covered with spines!

Illustration of Jeremy Fisher, the frog, taken aback by the flopping stickleback fish he has just caught.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher. Jeremy Fisher sitting on his lily-pad with his back to abounding fish. Blank Page. Blank Page. Sucking his fingers, Mr. Jeremy Fisher sits on his lily-pad dangling his foot over the edge while a large fish emerges to bite it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat—sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water—a much worse thing happened; a really frightful thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a macintosh!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A GREAT big enormous trout came up—ker- pflop-p-p-p! with a splash— and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, "Ow! Ow! Ow!''— and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond! The large fish takes Jeremy Fisher under the water in his mouth. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, struggles to get free from the large fish and swims fretfully to the surface of the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BUT the trout was so displeased with the taste of the macintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. JEREMY bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond. With head emerged, Jeremy Fisher the frog makes his way to his lily-pad and the flower that sits upon it. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, makes his way out of the water with his mackintosh all in tatters and scampers ashore to get home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HE scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WHAT a mercy that was not a pike!'' said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. "I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!'' Frantic, Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, bounds over flowers to get to the refuge of home. Blank Page. Blank Page. Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, greets Mr. Alderman Ptolemy, the tortoise, and Sir Isaac Newton, the newt, at his front gate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HE put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIR ISAAC NEWTON wore his black and gold waistcoat, Illustration of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, the frog, gesticulating to Sir Isaac Newton, the newt—both dressed to the hilt. Blank Page. Blank Page.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Text Page.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND instead of a nice dish of minnows—they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but I think it must have been nasty!</field>
