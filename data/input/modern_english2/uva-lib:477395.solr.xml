      <field name="heading_text">The generall argument of the whole booke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIttle I hope, needeth me at large to discourse the first Originall of Æglogues, hauing alreadie touched the same. But for the word Æglogues I know is vnknowen to most, and also mistaken of some the best learned (as they think) I wyll say somewhat thereof, being not at all impertinent to my present purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were first of the Greekes the inuentours of them called Aeglogaj as it were aigon or aigonomon . logoi . that is Goteheards tales. For although in Virgile and others the speakers be most [more] shepheards, and [then] Goteheards, yet Theocritus in whom is more ground of authoritie, then in Virgile, this specially from that deriuing, as from the first head and welspring the whole Inuencion of his Æglogues, maketh Goteheards the persons and authors of his tales. This being, who seeth not the grossenesse of such as by colour of learning would make vs beleeue that they are more rightly termed Eclogai, as they would say, extraordinary discourses of vnnecessarie matter, which definition albe in substaunce and meaning it agree with the nature of the thing, yet no whit answereth with the [analysis] and interpretation of the word. For they be not termed Eclogues, but Æglogues. Which sentence this author very well obseruing, vpon good iudgement, though indeede few Goteheards have to doe herein, nethelesse doubteth not to cal them by the vsed and best knowen name. Other curious discourses hereof I reserue to greater occasion. These xij. Æclogues euery where answering to the seasons of the twelue monthes may be well deuided into three formes or ranckes. For eyther they be Plaintiue, as the first, the sixt, the eleuenth, and the twelfth, or recreatiue, such as al those be, which conceiue matter of loue, or commendation of special personages, or Moral: which for the most part be mixed with some Satyricall bitternesse, namely the second of reuerence dewe to old age, the fit of coloured deceipt, the seuenth and ninth of dissolute shepheards &amp; pastours, the tenth of contempt of Poetrie &amp; pleasaunt wits. And to this diuision may euery thing herein be reasonably applyed: A few onely except, whose speciall purpose and meaning I am not priuie to. And thus much generally of these xij. Æclogues. Now will we speake particularly of all, and first of the first. Which he calleth by the first monethes name Ianuarie. wherein to some he may seeme fowly to have faulted, in that he erroniously beginneth with that moneth, which beginneth not the yeare. For it is wel known, and stoutely mainteyned with stronge reasons of the learned, that the yeare beginneth in March. for then the sonne reneweth his finished course, and the seasonable spring refresheth the earth, and the pleasaunce thereof being buried in the sadnesse of the dead winter now worne away, reliueth. This opinion maynteine the olde Astrologers and Philosophers, namely the reuerend Andalo, and Macrobius in his holydayes of Saturne, which accoumpt also was generally observed both of Grecians and Romans. But sauing the leaue of such learned heads, we mayntaine a custome of coumpting the seasons from the moneth Ianuary, vpon a more speciall cause, then the heathen Philosophers euer coulde conceiue, that is, for the incarnation of our mighty Sauior and eternall redeemer the L. Christ, who as then renewing the state of the decayed world, and returning the compasse of expired yeres to theyr former date and first commencement, left to vs his heires a memoriall of his birth in the ende of the last yeere and beginning of the next. which reckoning, beside that eternall monument of our saluation, leaneth also vppon good proofe of special iudgement. For albeit that in elder times, when as yet the coumpt of the yere was not perfected, as afterward it was by Iulius Caesar, they began to tel the monethes from Marches beginning, and according to the same God (as is sayd in Scripture) comaunded the people of the Iewes to count the moneth Abil [Abib], that which we call March, for the first moneth, in remembraunce that in that moneth he brought them out of the land of Ægipt: yet according to tradition of latter times it hath bene otherwise obserued, both in gouernmrnt of the church, and rule of Mightiest Realmes. For from Iulius Caesar who first obserued the leape yeere which he called Bissextilem Annum, and brought in to a more certain course the odde wandring dayes which of the Greekes were called hyperBainontes . Of the Romanes intercalares (for in such matter of learning I am forced to vse the termes of the learned) the monethes haue bene nombred xij. which in the first ordinaunce of Romulus were but tenne, counting but CCCiiij. dayes in euery yeare, and beginning with March. But Numa Pompilius, who was the father of al the Romain ceremonies and religion, seeing that reckoning to agree neither with the course of the sonne, nor of the Moone, therevnto added two monethes, Ianuary and February: wherin it seemeth, that wise king minded vpon good reason to begin the yeare at Ianuarie, of him therefore so called tanquam Ianua anni the gate and entraunce of the yere, or of the name of the god Ianus, to which god for that the old Paynims attributed the byrth &amp; beginning of all creatures new comming into the worlde, it seemeth that he therfore to him assigned the beginning and first enrraunce [entrance] of the yeare. which account for the most part hath hetherto continued. Notwithstanding that the Ægiptians beginne theyr yeare at September, for that according to the opinion of the best Rabbins, and very purpose of the scripture selfe, God made the worlde in that Moneth, that is called of them Tisri. And therefore he commaunded them, to keepe the feast of Pauilions in the end of the yeare, in the xv. day of the seuenth moneth, which before that time was the first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But our Authour respecting nether the subtiltie of thone parte, nor the antiquitie of thother, thinketh it fittest according to the simplicitie of commen vnderstanding, to begin with Ianuarie, wening it perhaps no decorum, that Shepheard should be seene in a matter of so deepe insight, or canuase a case of so doubtful iudgment. So therefore beginneth he, &amp; so continueth he throughout.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">To the most excellent and learned both Orator and Poete, Mayster Gabriell Haruey, his verie special and singular good friend E.K. comend- deth the good lyking of this his labour, and the patronage of the new Poete.('.')</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VNCOVTHE VNKISTE, Sayde the olde famous Poete Chaucer: whom for his excellencie and wonderfull skil in making, his scholler Lidgate, a worthy scholler of so excellent a maister, calleth the Loadstarre of our Language: and whom our Colin clout in his Æglogue calleth Tityrus the God of shepheards, comparing hym to the worthines of the Roman Tityrus Virgile. Which prouerbe, myne owne good friend Ma. Haruey, as in that good old Poete it serued well Pandares purpose, for the bolstering of his baudy brocage, so very well taketh place in this our new Poete, who for that he is vncouthe (as said Chaucer) is vnkist, and vnknown to most men, is regarded but of few. But I doubt not, so soone as his name shall come into the knowledg of men, and his worthines be sounded in the tromp of fame, but that he shall be not only kiste, but also beloued of all, embraced of the most, and wondred at of the best. No lesse I thinke, deserueth his wittinesse in deuising, his pithinesse in vttering, his complaints of loue so louely, his discourses of pleasure so pleasantly, his pastorall rudenesse, his morall wiseness, his dewe obseruing of Decorum euerye where, in personages, in seasons, in matter, in speach, and generally in al seemely simplicitie of handeling his matter, and framing his words: the which of many thinges which in him be straunge, I know will seeme the straungest, the words them selues being so auncient, the knitting of them so short and intricate, and the whole Periode and compasse of speache so delightsome for the roundnesse, and so graue for the straungenesse. And firste of the wordes to speake, I graunt they be something hard, and of most men vnused, yet both English, and also vsed of most Authors and most famous Poetes. In whom whenas this our Poet hath bene much traueiled and throughly redd, how could it be, (as that worthy Oratour sayde) but that walking in the sonne although for other cause he walked, yet needes he mought be sunburnt: and hauing the sound of those auncient Poetes still ringing in his eares, he mought needes in singing hit out some of theyr tunes. But whether he Vseth them by such casualtye and custome, or of set purpose and choyse, as thinking them fittest for such rusticall rudenesse of shepheards, eyther for that theyr rough sounde would make his rymes more ragged and rusticall, or els because such olde and obsolete wordes are most vsed of country folke, sure I think, and think I think not amisse, that they bring great grace and, as one would say, auctoritie to the verse. For albe amongst many other faultes it specially be obiected of Valla against Liuie, and of other against Saluste, that with ouer much studie they affect antiquitie, as courting thereby credence and honor of elder yeeres, yet I am of opinion, and eke the best learned are of the lyke, that those auncient solemne wordes are a great ornament both in the one and in the other; the one labouring to set forth in hys worke an eternall image of antiquitie, and the other carefully discoursing matters of grauitie and importaunce. For if my memory fayle not, Tullie in that booke, wherein he endeuoureth to set forth the paterne of a perfect Oratour, sayth that ofttimes an auncient worde maketh the style seeme graue, and as it were reuerend: no otherwise then we honour and reuerence gray heares for a certein religious regard, which we haue of old age. Yet nether euery where must old words be stuffed in, nor the commen Dialecte and maner of speaking so corrupted therby, that as in old buildings it seme disorderly and ruinous. But all as in most exquisite pictures they vse to blaze and portraict not onely the daintie lineaments of beautye, but also rounde about it to shadow the rude thickets and craggy clifts, that by the baseness of such parts, more excellency may accrew to the principall; for oftimes we fynde ourselues, I knowe not how, singularly delighted with the shewe of such naturall rudenesse, and take great pleasure in that disorderly order. Euen so doe those rough and harsh termes enlumine and make more clearly to appeare the brightnesse of braue and glorious words. So oftentimes a dischorde in Musick maketh a comely concordaunce: so great delight tooke the worthy Poete Alceus to behold a blemish in the ioynt of a wel shaped body. But if any will rashly blame such his purpose in choyse of old and vnwonted words, him may I more iustly blame and condemne, or of witlesse headinesse in iudging, or of heedlesse hardinesse in condemning for not marking the compasse of hys bent, he wil judge of the length of his cast. For in my opinion it is one special prayse, of many which are dew to this Poete, that he hath laboured to restore, as to theyr rightfull heritage such good and naturall English words, as have ben long time out of vse and almost cleane disinherited. Which is the onely cause, that our Mother tonge, which truely of it selfe is both ful enough for prose and stately enough for verse, hath long time ben counted most bare and barrein of both. Which default when as some endeuoured to salue and recure, they patched vp the holes with peces and rags of other languages, borrowing here of the french, there of the Italian, euery where of the Latine, not weighing how il those tongues accorde with themselues, but much worse with ours: So now they have made our English tongue, a gallimaufray or hodgepodge of al other speches. Other some not so wel seene in the English tonge as perhaps in other languages, if they happen to here an olde word albeit very naturall and significant, crye out streight way, that we speak no English, but gibbrish, or rather such, as in old time Euanders mother spake. Whose first shame is, that they are not ashamed, in their own mother tonge straungers to be counted and alienes. The second shame no lesse then the first, that what they so vnderstand not, they streight way deeme to be sencelesse, and not at al to be vnderstode. Much like to the Mole in Æsopes fable, that being blynd her selfe, would in no wise be perswaded, that any beast could see. The last more shameful then both, that of their owne country and natural speach, which together with their Nources milk they sucked, they have so base regard and bastard iudgement that they will not onely themselues not labor to garnish and beautifie it, but also repine, that of other it should be embellished. Like to the dogge in the maunger, that him selfe can eate no hay, and yet barketh at the hungry bullock, that so faine would feede: whose currish kind though it cannot be kept from barking, yet I conne them thanke that they refrain from byting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now for the knitting of sentences, whych they call the ioynts and members therof, and for al the compasse of the speach, it is round without roughnesse, and learned wythout hardnes, such indeede as may be perceiued of the leaste, vnderstode of the moste, but iudged onely of the learned. For what in most English wryter vseth to be loose, and as it were vngyrt, in this Author it is well grounded, finely framed, and strongly trussed vp together. In regard whereof, I scorne and spue out the rakehellye route of our ragged rymers (for so themselues vse to hunt the letter) which without learning boste, without iudgement iangle, without reason rage and fome, as if some instinct of Poeticall spirite had newly rauished them above the meanenesse of common capacitie. And being in the midest of all their brauery, sodenly eyther for want of matter, or of ryme, or hauing forgotten theyr former conceipt, they seeme to be so pained and trauelied in theyr remembrance, as it were a woman in childebirth or as that same Pythia, when the traunce came vpon her. Os rabidum fera corda domans &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nethelesse let them a Gods name feede on theyr owne folly, so they seeke not to darken the beames of others glory. As for Colin, vnder whose person the Author selfe is shadowed, how furre he is from such vaunted titles and glorious shewes, both him selfe sheweth, where he sayth. Of Muses Hobbin. I conne no skill. And, Enough is me to paint out my vnrest, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And also appeareth by the basenesse of the name, wherein, it seemeth, he chose rather to vnfold great matter of argument couertly, then professing it, not suffice thereto accordingly. Which moued him rather in Æglogues, then other wise to write, doubting perhaps his habilitie, which he little needed, or mynding to furnish our tongue with this kinde, wherein it faulteth, or following the example of the best &amp; most auncient Poetes, which deuised this kind of wryting, being both so base for the matter, and homely for the manner, at the first to trye theyr habilities? and as young birdes, that be newly crept out of the nest, by little first to proue theyr tender wyngs, before they make a greater flyght. So flew Theocritus, as you may percieue he was all ready full fledged. So flew Virgile, as not yet well feeling his winges So flew Mantuane, as being not full somd. So Petrarque. So Boccace; So Marot, Sanazarus, and also diuers other excellent both Italian and French Poetes, whose foting this Author euery where followeth, yet so as few, but they be well sented can trace him out. So finally flyeth this our new Poete, as a bird, whose principals be scarce growen out, but yet as that in time shall be hable to keepe wing with the best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now as touching the generall dryft and purpose of his Æglogues, I mind not to say much, him selfe labouring to conceale it. Onely this appeareth, that his vnstayed yougth had long wandred in the common Labyrinth of Loue, in which time to mitigate and allay the heate of his passion, or els to warne (as he sayth) the young shepheards .s. his equalls and companions of his vnfortunate folly, he compiled these xij. Æglogues, which for that they be proportioned to the state of the xij. monethes, he termeth the SHEPHEARDS CALENDAR, applying an olde name to a new worke. Hereunto haue I added a certain Glosse or scholion for thexposition of old wordes &amp; harder phrases: which maner of glosing and commenting, well I wote, wil seeme straunge &amp; rare in our tongue: yet for somuch as I knew many excellent &amp; proper deuises both in wordes and matter would passe in the speedy course of reading, either as vnknowen, or as not marked, and that in this kind, as in other we might be equal to the learned of other nations, I thought good to take the paines vpon me, the rather for that by meanes of some familiar acquaintaunce I was made privy to his counsell and secret meaning in them, as also in sundry other works of his. Which albeit I know he nothing so much hateth, as to promulgate, yet thus much haue I aduentured vpon his frendship, him selfe being for long time furre estraunged, hoping that this will the rather occasion him, to put forth diuers other excellent works of his, which slepe in silence, as his Dreames, his Legendes, his Court of Cupide, and sondry others; whose commendations to set out, were verye vayne; the thinges though worthy of many, yet being knowen to few. These my present paynes if to any they be pleasurable or profitable, be you iudge, mine own good Maister Haruey, to whom I have both in respect of your worthinesse generally, and otherwyse vpon some particular &amp; special considerations voued this my labour, and the maydenhead of this our commen frends Poetrie, himselfe hauing already in the beginning dedicated it to the Noble and worthy Gentleman, the right worshipfull Ma. Phi. Sidney, a special fauourer &amp; maintainer of all kind of learning. Whose cause I pray you Sir, yf Enuie shall stur vp any wrongful accusasion, defend with your mighty Rhetorick &amp; other your rare gifts of learning, as you can, &amp; shield with your good wil, as you ought, against the malice and outrage of so many enemies, as I know wilbe set on fire with the sparks of his kindled glory. And thus recommending the Author vnto you, as vnto his most special good frend, and my selfe vnto you both, as one making singular account of two so very good and so choise frends, I bid you both most hartely farwel, and commit you &amp; your most commendable studies to the tuicion of the greatest.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Post scr</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOw I trust M. Haruey, that vpon sight of your speciall frends and fellow Poets doings, or els for enuie of so many vnworthy Quidams, which catch at the garlond, which to you alone is dewe, you will be perswaded to pluck out of the hateful darknesse, those so many excellent English poemes of yours, which lye hid, and bring them forth to eternall light. Trust me you doe both them great wrong, in depriuing them of the desired sonne, annd also your selfe, in smoothering your deserued prayses, and all men generally, in withholding from them so diuine pleasures, which they might conceive of your gallant English verses, as they haue already doen of your Latine Poemes, which in my opinion both for inuention and Elocution are very delicate, and superexcellent. And thus againe, I take my leaue of my good Mayster Haruey. From my lodging at London thys 10. of Aprill 1579.</field>

In thys place seemeth to be some sauour of disorderly loue, which the learned call paederastice: but it is gathered beside his meaning. For who that hath red Plato his dialogue called Alcibiades, Xenophon and Maximus Tyrius of Socrates opinions, may easily perceiue, that such loue is muche to be alowed and liked of, specially so meant, as Socrates vsed it: who sayth, that in deede he loued Alcybiades extremely, yet not Alcybiades person, but hys soule, which is Alcibiades owne selfe. And so is pederastice much to be praeferred before gynerastice, that is the loue whiche enflameth men with lust toward woman kind. But yet let no man thinke, that herein I stand with Lucian or hys deuelish disciple Vnico Aretino, in defence of execrable and horrible sinnes of forbidden and vnlawful fleshlinesse. Whose abominable errour is fuully confuted of Perionius, and others. lloue) a prety Epanorthosis in these two verses, and withall a Paronomasia or playing with the word, where he sayth (I loue thilke lasse (alas &amp;c. Rosalinde) is also a feigned name, which being wel ordered, wil bewray the very name of hys loue and mistresse, whom by that name he coloureth. So as Ouide shadoweth hys loue vnder the name of Corynna, which of some is supposed to be Iulia, themperor Augustus his daughter, and wyfe to Agryppa. So doth Aruntius Stella euery where call his Lady Asteris and Ianthis, albe it is well knowen that her right name was Violantilla: as witnesseth Statius in his Epithalamium. And so the famous Paragone of Italy, Madonna Coelia in her letters enuelopeth her selfe vnder the name of Zima: and Petron vuder [vnder] the name of Bellochia. And this generally hath bene a common custome of counterfeicting the names of secret Personages. Auail) bring downe. Embleme. Overhaile) drawe over. His Embleme or Poesye is here vnder added in Italian, Anchora speme: the meaning wherof is, that notwithstande his extreme passion and lucklesse loue, yet leaning on hope, he is some what recomforted.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THis Æglogue is rather morall and generall, then bent to any secrete or particlar purpose. It specially conteyneth a discourse of old age, in the persone of Thenot an olde Shepheard, who for his crookednesse and vnlustinesse, is scorned of Cuddie an vnhappy Heardmans boye. The matter very well accordeth with the season of the moneth, the yeare now drouping, &amp; as it were, drawing to his last age. For as in this time of yeare, so then in our bodies there is a dry &amp; withering cold, which congealeth the crudled blood, and frieseth the wetherbeaten flesh, with stormes of Fortune, &amp; hoare frosts of Care. To which purpose the olde man telleth a tale of the Oake and the Bryer, so lively, and so feelingly, as if the thing were set forth in some Picture before our eyes, more plainly could not appeare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CVDDIE. THENOT. AH for pittie, wil ranke Winters rage, These bitter blasts neuer ginne tasswage? The keene cold blowes throug my beaten hyde, All as I were through the body gryde. My ragged rontes all shiver and shake, As doen high Towers in an earthquake: They wont in the wind wagge their wrigle tailes, Perke as Peacock: but nowe it auales.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THENOT. Lewdly complainest thou laesie ladde, Of Winters wracke, for making thee sadde. Must not the world wend in his commun course From good th badd, and from badde to worse, From worse vnto that is worst of all, And then returne to his former fall? Who will not suffer the stormy time, Where will he liue tyll the lusty prime? Selfe haue I worne out thrise threttie yeares, Some in much ioy, many in many teares: Yet never complained of cold nor heate, Of Sommers flame, nor of Winters threat: Ne euer was to Fortune foeman, But gently tooke, that vngently came. And euer my flocke was my chiefe care, Winter or Sommer they mought well fare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CVDDIE. No marueile Thenot, if thou can not beare Cherefully the Winters wrathfull cheare: For Age and Winter accord full nie, This chill, that cold, this crooked, that wrye. And as the lowring Wether lookes downe, So semest thou like good fryday to frowne. But my flowring youth is foe to frost, My shippe vnwont in stormes to be tost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THENOT. The soueraigne of seas he blames in vaine, That once seabeate, will to sea againe. So loytring liue you little heardgroomes, Keeping your beastes in the budded broomes: And when the shining sunne laugheth once, You deemen, the Spring is come attonce. Tho gynne you, fond flyes, the cold to scorn, And crowing in pypes made of greene corne, You thinken to be Lords of the yeare. But eft, when ye count you freed from feare, Comes the breme winter with chamfred browes, Full of wrinckles and frostie furrowes: Drerily shooting his stormy darte, Which cruddles the blood, and pricks the harte. Then is your carelesse corage accoied, Your carefull heards with cold bene annoied. Then paye you the price of your surqedrie, With weeping, and wayling, and misery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CVDDIE. Ah foolish old man, I scorne thy skill, That wouldest me, my springing yougth to spil. I deeme, thy braine emperished bee Through rusty elde, that hath rotted thee: Or sicker thy head veray tottie is, So on thy corbe shoulder it leanes amisse. Now thy selfe hast lost both lopp and topp, Als my budding branch thou wouldest cropp: But were thy yeares greene, as now bene myne, To other delights they would encline. Tho wouldest thou learne to caroll of Loue, And hery with hymnes thy lasses gloue. Tho wouldest thou pype of Phyllis prayse: But Phyllis is myne for many dayes: I wonne her with a girdle of gelt, Embost with buegle about the belt. Such an one shepeheards woulde make full faine: Such an one would make thee younge againe.</field>

Seemeth thy flock thy counsell can, So lustlesse bene they, so weake so wan, Clothed with cold, and hoary wyth frost. Thy flocks father his corage hath lost: Thy Ewes, that wont to haue blowen bags, Like wailful widdowes hangen their crags: The rather Lambes bene starued with cold, All for their Maister is lustlesse and old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THENOT. Cuddie, I wote thou kenst little good, So vainely taduance thy headlesse hood. For Youngth is a bubble blown vp with breath, Whose witt is weakenesse, whose wage is death, Whose way is wildernesse, whose ynne Penaunce, And stoopegallaunt Age the hoste of Greeuance. But shall I tel thee a tale of truth, Which I cond of Tityrus in my youth, Keeping his sheepe on the hils of Kent?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CVDDIE. To nought more, Thenot, my mind is bent, Then to heare nouells of his deuise: They bene so well thewed, and so wise, What euer that good old man bespake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THENOT. Many meete tales of youth did he make, And some of loue, and some of cheualrie: But none fitter than this to applie. Now listen a while, and hearken the end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THere grewe an aged Tree on the greene, A goodly Oake sometime had it bene, With armes full strong and largely displayd, But of their leaues they were disarayde: The bodie bigge, and mightily pight, Throughly rooted, and of wonderous hight: Whilome had bene the King of the field, And mochell mast to the husband did yielde, And with his nuts larded many swine. But now the gray mosse marred his rine, His bared boughes were beaten with stormes, His toppe was bald, &amp; wasted with wormes, His honor decayed, his braunches sere. Hard by his side grew a bragging brere, Which proudly thrust into Thelement, And seemed to threat the Firmament. Yt was embellisht with blossomes fayre, And thereto aye wonned to repayre The shepheards daughters, to gather flowres, To peinct thir girlonds with his colowres. And in his small bushes vsed to shrowde The sweete Nightingale singing so lowde: Which made this foolish Brere wexe so bold, That on a time he cast him to scold, And snebbe the good Oake, for he was old. Why standst there (quoth he) thou brutish blocke? Nor for fruict, nor for shadowe serues thy stocke: Seest, how fresh my flowers bene spredde, Dyed in Lilly white, and Cremsin redde, With leaves engrained in lusty greene, Colours meete to clothe a mayden Queene. Thy wast bignes but combers the grownd, And dirks the beauty of my blossomes rownd. The mouldie mosse, which thee accloieth, My Sinnamon smell too much annoieth. Wherefore soone I rede thee, hence remove, Least thou the price of my displeasure proue. So spake this bold brere with great disdaine: Little him answered the Oake againe, But yielded, with shame and greefe adawed, That of a weede he was ouerawed. Yt chaunced after vpon a day, The Hus-bandman selfe to come that way, Of custome to seruewe his grownd, And his trees of state in compasse rownd. Him when the spitefull brere had espyed, Causlesse complained, and lowdly cryed Vnto his Lord, stirring vp sterne strife: O my liege Lord, the God of my life, Pleaseth you ponder your Suppliants plaint, Caused of wrong, and cruell constraint, Which I your poore Vassall dayly endure: And but your goodnes the same recure, Am like for desperate doole to dye, Through felonous force of mine enemie. Greatly aghast with this piteous plea, Him rested the goodman on the lea, And badde the Brere in his plaint proceede. With painted words tho gan this proude weede, (As most vsen Ambitious folke:) His colowred crime with craft to cloke. Ah my soueraigne, Lord of creatures all, Thou placer of plants both humble and tall, Was not I planted of thine owne hand, To be the primrose of all thy land, With flowring blossomes, to furnish the prime, And scarlot berries in Sommer time? How falls it then, that this faded Oake, Whose bodie is sere, whose braunches broke, Whose naked Armes stretch vnto the fyre, Vnto such tyrannie doth aspire: Hindering with his shade my louely light, And robbing me of the swete sonnes sight? So beate his old boughes my tender side, That oft the bloud springeth from wounds wyde: Vntimely my flowres forced to fall, That bene the honor of your Coranall. And oft he lets his cancker wormes light Vpon my braunches, to worke me more spight: And oft his hoarie locks downe doth cast, Where with my fresh flowretts bene defast. For this, and many more such outrage, Crauing your goodlihead to aswage The ranckorous rigour of his might, Nought aske I, but onely to hold my right: Submitting me to your good sufferance, And praying to be garded from greeuance. To this the Oake cast him to replie Well as he couth: but his enemie Had kindled such coles of displeasure, That the good man noulde stay his leasure, But home him hasted with furious heate, Encreasing his wrath with many a threate. His harmefull Hatchet he hent in hand, (Alas, that it so ready should stand) And to the field alone he speedeth. (Ay little helpe to harme there needeth) Anger nould let him speake to the tree, Enaunter his rage mought cooled bee: But to the roote bent his sturdy stroke, And made many wounds in the wast Oake. The Axes edge did oft turne againe, As if halfe vnwilling to cutte the graine: Semed, the sencelesse yron dyd feare, Or to wrong holy eld did forbeare. For it had bene an auncient tree, Sacred with many a mysteree, And often crost with the priestes crewe, And often halowed with holy water dewe. But sike fancies weren foolerie, And broughten this Oake to this miserye. For nought mought they quitten him from decay: For fiercely the good man at him did laye. The blocke oft groned vnder the blow, And sighed to see his neare ouerthrow. In fine the steele had pierced his pitth, Tho downe to the earth he fell forthwith: His wonderous weight made the grounde to quake, Thearth shronke vnder him, and seemed to shake. There lyeth the Oake, pitied of none. Now stands the Brere like a Lord alone, Puffed vp with pryde and vaine pleasaunce: But all this glee had no continuaunce. For eftsones Winter gan to approche, The blustring Boreas did encroche, And beate vpon the solitarie Brere: For nowe no succoure was seene him nere. Now gan he repent his pryde to late: For naked left and disconsolate, The byting frost nipt his stalke dead, The watrie wette weighed downe his head, And heaped snowe burdned him so sore, That nowe vpright he can stand no more: And being downe, is trodde in the durt Of cattell, and brouzed, and sorely hurt. Such was thend of this Ambitious brere, For scorning Eld</field>

Embleme. This embleme is spoken of Thenot, as a moral of his former tale: namelye, that God, which is himselfe most aged, being before al ages, and without beginninge, maketh those, whom he loueth like to himselfe, in heaping yeares vnto theyre dayes, and blessing them wyth longe lyfe. For the blessing of age is not giuen to all, but vnto those, whom God will so blesse: and albeit that many euil men reache vnto such fulnesse of yeares, and some also wexe olde in myserie and thraldome, yet therefore is not age euer the lesse blessing. For euen to such evill men such number of yeares is added, that they may in their last dayes repent, and come to their first home. So the old man checketh the rashheaded for despysing his gray and frosty heares. Whom Cuddye doth counterbuff with a byting and bitter prouerbe, spoken indeede at the first in contempt of old age generally. for it was an old opinion, and yet is continued in some mens conceipt, that men of yeares have no feare of god at al, or not so much as younger folke. For that being rypened with long experience, and hauing passed many bitter brunts and blastes of vengeaunce, they dread no stormes of Fortune, nor wrathe of Gods, nor daunger of menne, as being eyther by longe and ripe wisedome armed against all mischaunces and aduersitie, or with much trouble hardened against all troublesome tydes: lyke vnto the Ape, of which is sayd in Æsops fables, that oftentimes meeting the Lyon, he was at first sore aghast &amp; dismayed at the grimnes and austeritie of hys countenance, but at last being acquianted with his lookes, he was so furre from fearing him, that he would familiarly gybe and iest with him: Suche long experience breedeth in some men securitie. Although it please Erasimus a great clerke and good old father, more fatherly and fauourablye to construe it in his Adages for his own behoofe, That by the prouerbe Nemo Senex metuit Iouem, is not meant, that old men haue no feare of God at al, but that they be furre from superstition and Idolatrous regard of false Gods, as is Iupiter. But his greate learning notwithstanding, it is to plaine, to be gainsayd, that olde men are muche more enclined to such fond fooleries, then younger heades.</field>

The speciall meaning hereof is, to giue certaine markes and tokens, to know Cupide the Poets God of Loue. But more particularlye I thinke, in the person of Thomalin is meant some secrete freend, who scorned Loue and his knights so long, till at length him selfe was entangled, and unwares wounded with the dart of some beautifull regard, which is Cupides arrowe.</field>

Long wandring vp and downe the land, With bowe and bolts in either hand, For birds in bushes tooting: At length within an Yuie todde (There shrouded was the little God) I heard a busie bustling. I bent my bow against the bush, Listening if any thing did rushe, But then heard no more rustling. Tho peeping close into the thicke, Might see the mouing of some quicke. Whose shape appeared not: But were it faerie, feend, or snake, My courage earnd it to awake, And manfully thereat shotte. With that sprong forth a naked swayne, With spotted winges like Peacocks trayne, And laughing lope to a tree. His gylden quiuer at his backe, And silver bowe, which was but slacke, Which lightly he bent at me. That seeing, I leuelde againe, And shott at him with might and maine, As thicke, as it had hayled. So long I shott, that al was spent: Tho pumie stones I hastly hent, And threwe: but nought availed: He was so wimble, and so wight, From bough to bough he lepped light, And oft the pumies latched. Therewith affrayd I ranne away: But he, that earst seemd but to playe, A shaft in earnest snatched, And hit me running in the heele: For then I little smart did feele: But soone it sore encreased. And now it ranckleth more and more, And inwardly it festreth sore, Ne wote I, how to cease it.</field>

For once I heard my father say, How he him caught vpon a day, (Whereof he wilbe wroken) Entangled in a fowling net, Which he for carrion Crowes had set, That in our Peeretree haunted. Tho sayd, he was a winged lad, But bowe and shafts as then none had: Els had he sore be daunted.

Ouerwent) overgone. Alegge) to lessen or aswage. To quell) to abate. Welkin) the skie. The swallow) which bird vseth to be counted the messenger, as it were, the fore runner of springe. Flora) the Goddesse of flowres, but indede (as saith Tacitus) a famous harlot, which with the abuse of her body hauing gotten great riches, made the people of Rome her heyre: who in remembraunce of so great beneficence, appointed a yearely feste for the memoriall of her, calling her, not as she was, nor as some doe think, Andronica, but Flora: making her the Goddesse of all floures, and doing yerely to her solemne sacrifice. Maias bowre) that is the pleasaunt fielde, or rather the Maye bushes. Maia is a Goddes and the mother of Mercurie, in honour of whome the moneth of Maye is of her name so called, as sayth Macrobius. Lettice) the name of some country lasse. Ascaunce) askewe or asquint. For thy) therefore. Lethe) is a lake in hell, which the Poetes call the lake of forgetfulnes. For Lethe signifieth forgetfulnes. Wherein the soules being dipped, did forget the cares of their former lyfe. So that by loue sleeping in Lethe lake, he meaneth he was almost forgotten and out of knowledge, by reason of winters hardnesse, when al pleasures, as it were, sleepe and weare out of mynde.

Spell) is a kind of verse or charme, that in elder tymes they vsed often to say ouer euery thing, that they would haue preserued, as the Nightspel for theeues, and the woodspell. And herehence I thinke is named the gospell, as it were Gods spell or worde. And so sayth Chaucer, Listeneth Lordings to my spell. Gange) goe An Yuie todde) a thicke bushe. Swaine) a boye: for so he is described of the Poetes, to be a boye .s. alwayes freshe and lustie: blindfolded, because he maketh no difference of Personages: wyth diuers coloured winges, .s. ful of flying fancies: with bowe and arrow, that is with glaunce of beautye, which prycketh as a forked arrowe. He is sayd also to haue shafts, some leaden, some golden: that is, both pleasure for the gracious and loued, and sorow for the louer that is disdayned or forsaken. But who liste more at large to behold Cupids colours and furniture, let him reade ether Propertius, or Moschus his Idyllion of wandring loue, being now most excellently translated into Latine by the singuler learned man Angelus Politianus: Whych worke I haue seene amongst other of thys Poets doings, very wel translated also into Englishe Rymes. Wimble and wighte) Quicke and deliuer. In the heele) is very Poetically spoken, and not without speciall iudgement. For I remember, that in Homer it is sayd of Thetis, that shee tooke her young babe Achilles being newely borne, and holding him by the heele, dipped him in the River of Styx. The vertue whereof is, to defend and keepe the bodyes washed therein from any mortall wound. So Achilles being washed al ouer, saue anely his hele, by which his mother held, was in the rest invnluerable [invulnerable]: therfore by Paris was feyned to bee shotte with a poysoned arrowe in the heele, whiles he was busie about the marying of Polyena in the temple of Apollo. Which mysticall fable Eustathius vnfolding, sayth: that by wounding in the hele, is meant lustfull loue. For from the heele (as say the best Phisitions) to the preuie partes there passe certaine veines and slender synnewes, as also the like come from the head, and are carryed lyke little pypes behynd the eares: so that (as sayth Hippocrates) yf those veynes there be cut a sonder, the partie straighte becometh cold and vnfruiteful. which reason our Poete wel weighing, maketh this shepheards boye of purpose to be wounded by Loue in the heele. Latched) caught. Wroken) reuenged. For once) In this tale is sette out the simplicitye of shepheards opinion of Loue. Stouping Phaebus) Is a Periphrasis of the sunne setting. Embleme. Hereby is meant, that all the delights of Loue, wherein wanton youth walloweth, be but follye mixt with bitternesse, and sorow sawced with repentaunce. For besides that the very affection of Loue it selfe tormenteth the mynde, and vexeth the body many wayes, with vnrestfulnesse all night, and wearines all day, seeking for that we can not haue: euen the selfe things which best before vs liked, in course of time and chaung of ryper yeares, whiche also therewithall chaungeth our wonted lyking and former fantasies, will then seeme lothsome and breede vs annoyaunce, when yougthes flowre is withered, and we fynde our bodyes and wits aunswere not to suche vayne iollitie and lustfull pleasaunce.

      <field name="fulltext">THis Æglogue is purposely intended to the honor and prayse of our most gracious souereigne, Queene Elizabeth. The speakers herein be Hobbinoll and Thenott, two shepheardes: The which Hobinoll being before mentioned, greatly to haue loued Colin, is here set forth more largely, complayning him of that boyes great misaduenture in Loue, whereby his mynd was alienate and with drawen not onely from him, who moste loued him, but also from all former delightes and studies, aswell in pleasaunt pyping, as conning ryming and singing, and other his laudable exercises. Whereby he taketh occasion, for proofe of his more excellencie and skill in poetrie, to recorde a song, which the sayd Colin sometime made in honor of her Maiestie, whom abruptely he termeth Elysa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thenot. Hobbinoll. TEll me good Hobbinoll, what garres thee greete? What? hath some Wolfe thy tender Lambes ytorne? Or is thy Bagpype broke, that soundes so sweete? Or art thou of thy loued lasse forlorne?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Or bene thine eyes attempred to the yeare, Quenching the gasping furrowes thirst with rayne? Like April shoure, so stremes the trickling teares Adowne thy cheeke, to quenche thye thirstye payne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Nor thys, not that, so muche doeth make me mourne, But for the ladde, whom long I lovd so deare, Nowe loues a lasse, that all his loue doth scorne: He plonged in payne, his tressed locks dooth teare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shepheards delights he dooth them all forsweare, Hys pleasaunt Pipe, whych made vs meriment, He wylfully hath broke, and doth forbeare His wonted songs, wherein he all outwent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thenot. What is he for a Ladde, you so lament? Ys loue such pinching payne to them, that proue? And hath he skill to make so excellent, Yet hath so little skill to brydle loue?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Colin thou kenst, the Southerne shepheardes boye: Him Loue hath wounded with a deadly darte. Whilome on him was all my care and ioye, Forcing with gyfts to winne his wanton heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now from me hys madding mynd is starte, And woes the Widdowes daughter of the glenne: So now fayre Rosalind hath bred hys smart, So now his frend is chaunged for a frenne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thenot. But if his ditties bene so trimly dight, I pray thee Hobbinoll, record some one: The whiles our flockes doe graze about in sight, And we close shrowded in thys shade alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinol. Contented I: then will I singe his laye Of fayre Elisa, Queene of shepheardes all: Which once he made, as by a spring he laye, And tuned it vnto the Waters fall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">YE dayntye Nymphs, that in this blessed Brooke doe bathe your brest, Forsake your watry bowres, and hether looke, at my request: And eke you Virgins, that on Parnasse dwell, Whence floweth Helicon the learned well, Helpe me to blaze Her worthy praise, Which in her sexe doth all excell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of fayre Elisa be your siluer song, that blessed wight: The flowre of Virgins, may shee florish long, In princely plight. For she is Syrinx daughter without spotte, Which Pan the shepheards God of her begot: So sprong her grace Of heauenly race, No mortal blemishe may her blotte.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See, where she sits vpon the grassie greene, (O seemly sight) Yclad in Scarlot like a mayden Queene, And Ermines white. Vpon her head a Cremosin coronet, With Damaske roses and Dafadillies set: Bayleaues betweene, And Primroses greene Embellish the sweete Violet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tell me, haue ye seene her angelick face, Like Phoebe fayre? Her heauenly haueour, her princely grace can you well compare? The Redde rose medled with the White yfere, In either cheeke depeincten liuely chere. Her modest eye, Her Maiestie, Where haue you seene the like, but there?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sawe Phoebus thrust out his golden hedde, vpon her to gaze: But when he sawe, how broade her beames did spredde, it did him amaze. He blusht to see another Sunne belowe, Ne durst againe his fyrye face out showe: Let him, if he dare, His brightnesse compare With hers, to haue the ouerthrowe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shewe thy selfe Cynthia with thy siuer rayes, and be not abasht: When shee the beames of her beauty displayes, O how art thou dasht? But I will not match her with Latonaes seede, Such follie great sorow to Niobe did breede. Now she is a stone, And makes dayly mone, Warning all others to take heede.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pan may be proud, that euer he begot such a Bellibone, And Syrinx reioyse, that euer was her lot to beare such an one. Soone as my younglings cryen for the dam, To her will I offer a milkwhite Lamb: Shee is my goddesse plaine, And I her shepherds swayne, Albee forswonck and forswatt I am.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I see Calliope speede her to the place, Where my Goddesse shines: And after her the other Muses trace, with their Violines. Bene they not Bay braunches, which they doe beare, All for Elisa, in her hand to weare? So sweetely they play, And sing all the way, That it a heauen is to heare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lo how finely the graces can it foote to the Instrument: They daucen deffly, and singen soote, in their merriment. Wants not not [sic] a fourth grace, to make the daunce euen? Let that rowme to my Lady be yeuen: She shalbe a grace, To fyll the fourth place, And reigne with the rest in heauen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And whither rennes this beuie of Ladies bright, raunged in a rowe? They bene all Ladyes of the lake behight, that vnto her goe. Chloris, that is the chiefest Nymph of al, Of Oliue braunches beares a Coronall: Oliues bene for peace, When wars doe surcease: Such for a Princesse bene principall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ye shepheards daughters, that dwell on the greene, hye you there apace: Let none come there, but that Virgins bene, to adorne her grace. And when you come, whereas shee is in place, See, that your rudenesse doe not you disgrace: Binde your fillets faste, And gird in your waste, For more finesse with a tawdrie lace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bring hether the Pincke and purple Cullambine, With Gelliflowres: Bring Coronations, and Sops in wine, worne of Paramoures. Strowe me the ground with Daffadowndillies, And Cowslips, and Kingcups, and loued Lillies: The pretie Pawnce, And the Cheuisaunce, Shall match with the fayre flowre Delice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now ryse vp Elisa, decked as thou art, in royall aray: And now ye daintie Damsells may depart echeone her way, I feare, I haue troubled your troupes to longe: Let dame Eliza thanke you for her song.

      <field name="fulltext">Gars thee greete) causeth thee to weepe and complain. Forlorne) left &amp; forsaken. Attempred to the yeare) agreeable to the season of the yeare. that is Aprill, which moneth is most bent to shoures and seasonable rayne: to quench, that is, to delaye the drought, caused through drynesse of March wyndes. The Ladde) Colin Clout) The Lasse) Rosalinda. Tressed locks) wrethed &amp; curled. Is he for a ladde) A straunge manner of speaking .s. what maner of Ladde is he? To make) to rime and versifye. For in this word making, our olde Englishe Poetes were wont to comprehend all the skil of Poetrye, according to the Greeke woorde [poiein], to make, whence commeth the name of Poets. Colin thou kenst) knowest. Seemeth hereby that Colin perteyneth to some Southern noble man, and perhaps in Surrye or Kent, the rather bicause he so often nameth the Kentish downes, and before, As lythe as lasse of Kent. The Widowes) He calleth Rosalind the Widowes daughter of the glenne, that is, of a country Hamlet or borough, which I thinke is rather sayde to coloure and concele the person, then simply spoken. For it is well knowen, euen in spight of Colin and Hobbinoll, that shee is a Gentle woman of no meane house, nor endewed with anye vulgare and common gifts both of nature and manners: but such indeede, as neede nether Colin be ashamed to haue her made knowne by his verses, nor Hobbinoll be greued, that so she should be commended to immortalitie for her rare and singular Vertues: Specially deserving it no lesse, then eyther Myrto the most excellent Poete Theocritus his dearling, or Lauretta the diuine Petrarches Goddesse, or Himera the worthye Poete Stesichorus hys Idole: Vpon whom he is sayd so much to haue doted, that in regard of her excellencie, he scorned &amp; wrote against the beauty of Helena. For which his praesumptuous and vnheedie hardinesse, he is sayde by vengeaunce of the Gods, thereat being offended, to haue lost bothe his eyes. Frenne) a straunger. The word I thinke was first poetically put, and afterwarde vsed in commen custome of speach fo forenne. Dight) adorned. Laye) a songe. as Roundelayes and Virelayes. In all this songe is not to be respected, what the worthinesse of her Maiestie deserueth, nor what to the highnes of a Prince is agreeable, but what is moste comely for the meanesse of a shepheards witte, or to conceiue, or to vtter. And therefore he calleth her Elysa, as through rudenesse tripping in her name: &amp; a shepheards daughter, it being very vnfit, that a shepheards boy brought vp in the shepefold, should know, or euer seme to haue heard of a Queenes roialty. Ye daintie) is, as it were an Exordium ad preparandos animos. Virgins) the nine Muses, daughters of Apollo and Memorie, whose abode the Poets faine to be on Parnassus, a hill in Grece, for that in that countrye specially florished the honor of all excellent studies. Helicon) is both the name of a fountaine at the foote of Parnassus, and also of a mounteine in Baeotia, out of which floweth the famous Spring Castalius, dedicate also to the Muses: of which spring it is sayd, that when Pegasus the winged horse of Perseus (whereby is meant fame and flying renowme) strooke the grownde with his hoofe, sodenly thereout sprange a wel of moste cleare and pleasaunte water, which from thence forth was consecrate to the Muses &amp; Ladies of learning. Your siluer song) seemeth to imitate the lyke in Hesiodus argureon melos . Syrinx) is the name of a Nymphe of Arcadie, whom when Pan being in loue pursued, she flying from him, of the Gods was turned into a reede. So that Pan catching at the Reedes in stede of the Damosell, and puffing hard (for he was almost out of wind) with hys breath made the Reedes to pype: which he seeing, tooke of them, and in remembraunce of his lost loue, made him a pype thereof. But here by Pan and Syrinx is not to bee thoughte, that the shephearde simplye meante those Poetical Gods: but rather supposing (as seemeth) her graces progenie to be divine and immortall (so as the Paynims were wont to iudge of all Kinges and Princes, according to Homeres saying. Thumos de megas esti diotrepheos Basileos, time d' ek dios esti philei o metiea Zeus) could deuise no parents in his iudgement so worthy for her, as Pan the shepeheards God, and his best beloued Syrinx. So that by Pan is here meant the most famous and victorious King, her highnesse Father, late of worthy memorye K. Henry the eyght. And by that name, oftymes (as hereafter appeareth) be noted kings and mighty Potentates: And in some place Christ himself, who is the verye Pan and god of Shepheardes. Cremosin coronet) he deuiseth her crowne to be of the finest and most delicate flowers, instede of perles and precious stones, wherewith Princes Diademes vse to bee adorned and embost. Embellish) beautifye and set out. Phebe) the Moone, whom the Poets faine to be sister vnto Phaebus, that is the Sunne. Medled) mingled. Yfere) together. By the mingling of the Redde rose and the White, is meant the vniting of the two principall houses of Lancaster and of Yorke: by whose longe discord and deadly debate, this realm many yeares was sore traueiled, &amp; almost cleane decayed. Til the famous Henry the seuenth, of the line of Lancaster, taking to wife the most vertuous Princesse Elisabeth, daughter to the fourth Edward of the house of Yorke, begat the most royal Henry the eyght aforesayde, in whom was the firste vnion of the Whyte Rose and the Redde. Calliope) one of the nine Muses: to whome they assigne the honor of all Poeticall Inuention, and the firste glorye of the Heroicall verse. other say, that shee is the Goddesse of Rhetorick: but by Virgile it is manifeste, that they mystake the thyng. For there in hys Epigrams, that arte semeth to be attributed to Polymnia, saying: Signat cuncta manu, loquiturque Polymnia gestu. which seemeth specially to be meant of Action and elocution, both special partes of Rhetorick: besyde that her name, which (as some construe it) importeth great remembraunce, conteineth another part. but I holde rather with them, which call her Polymnia or Polyhymnia of her good singing. Bay branches) be the signe of honor &amp; victory, &amp; therfore of myghty Conquerors worn in theyr triumphes, &amp; eke of famous Poets, as saith Petrarch in hys Sonets. Arbor vittoriosa triomphale, Honor d'Imperadori &amp; di Poeti, &amp;c. The Graces) be three sisters, the daughters of Iupiter, whose names are Aglaia, Thalia, Euphrosyne, &amp; Homer onely addeth a fourth .s. Pasithea) otherwise called Charites, that is thanks. whom the Poetes feyned to be the Goddesses of al bountie &amp; comelines, which therefore (as sayth Theodontius) they make three, to wete, that men first ought to be gracious &amp; bountiful to other freely, then to receiue benefits at other mens hands curteously, and thirdly to requite them thankfully: which are three sundry Actions in liberalitye. And Boccace saith, that they be painted naked, (as they were indeede on the tombe of C. Iulius Caesar) the one hauing her backe toward vs, and her face fromwarde, as proceeding from vs: the other two toward vs, noting double thanke to be due to vs for the benefit, we haue done. Deaffly) Finely and nimbly. Soote) Sweete. Meriment) Mirth. Beuie) A beauie of Ladyes, is spoken figuratiuely for a company or troupe. the terme is taken of Larkes. For they say a Beuie of Larkes, euen as a Couey of Partridge, or an eye of Pheasaunts. Ladyes of the lake) be Nymphes. For it was an olde opinion amongst the Auncient Heathen, that of euery spring and fountaine was a goddesse the Soueraigne. Whiche opinion stucke in the myndes of men not manye yeares sithence, by meanes of certain fine fablers and lowd lyers, such as were the Authors of King Arthure the great and such like, who tell many an vnlawfull leasing of the Ladyes of the Lake, that is, the Nymphes. For the word Nymphe in Greeke signifieth Well water, or otherwise a Spouse or Bryde. Bedight) called or named. Cloris) the name of a Nymph, and signifieth greenesse, of whome is sayd, that Zephyrus the Westerne wind being in loue with her, and coueting her to wyfe, gaue her for a dowrie, the chiefedome and soueraigntye of al flowres and greene herbes, growing on earth. Olives bene) The Oliue was wont to be the ensigne of Peace and quietnesse, eyther for that it cannot be planted and pruned, and so carefully looked to, as it ought, but in time of peace: or els for that the Oliue tree, they say, will not growe neare the Firre tree, which is dedicate to Mars the God of battaile, and vsed most for speares and other instruments of warre. Whereupon is finely feigned, that when Neptune and Minerua strove for the naming of the citie of Athens, Neptune striking the ground with his mace, caused a horse to come forth, that importeth warre, but at Mineruaes stroke sprong out an Oliue, so note that it should be a nurse of learning, and such peaceable studies. Binde your) Spoken rudely, and according to shepheardes simplicitye. Bring) all these be names of flowers. Sops in wine a flowre in colour much like to a Coronation, but differeing in smel and quantitye. Flowre delice, that which they vse to misterme, Flowre de luce, being in Latine called Flos delitiarum. A Bellibone) or a bonibell. homely spoken for a fayre mayde or Bonilasse. Forswonck and forswatt) ouerlaboured and sunneburnt. I saw Phaebus) the sunne. A sensible Narration, and present view of the thing mentioned, which they call parousia . Cynthia) the Moone so called of Cynthus a hyll, where she was honored. Latonaes seede) Was Apollo and Diana. Whom when as Niobe the wife of Amphion scorned, in respect of the noble fruict of her wombe, namely her seuen sonnes, and so many daughters, Latona being therewith displeased, commaunded her sonne Phoebus to slea al the sonnes, and Diana all the daughters: whereat the vnfortunate Niobe being sore dismayed, and lamenting out of measure, was feigned of the Poetes, to be turned into a stone vpon the sepulchre of her children. for which cause the shepheard sayth, he will not compare her to them, for feare of like mysfortune. Now rise) is the conclusion. For hauing so decked her with prayses and comparisons, he returneth all the thanck of hys laboure to the excellencie of her Maiestie. When Damsins) A base reward of a clownish giuer. Yblent) Y, is a poeticall addition. blent blinded. Embleme This Poesye is taken out of Virgile, and there of him vsed in the person of Æneas to his mother Venus, appearing to him in likenesse of one of Dianaes damosells: being there most divinely set forth. To which similitude of diuinitie Hobbinoll comparing the excelency of Elisa, and being through the worthynes of Colins song, as it were ouercome with the hugenesse of his imagination, brusteth out in great admiration, (O quam te memore virgo?) being otherwise vnhable, then by soddein silence, to expresse the worthinesse of his conceipt. Whom Thenot answereth with another part of the like verse, as confirming by his graunt and approuaunce, that Elisa is nowhit inferiour to the Maiestie of her, of whome that Poete so boldly pronounced, O dea certe.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In this fifte Æglogue, vnder the persons of two shepheards Piers &amp; Palinodie, be represented two formes of pastoures or Ministers, or the protestant and the Catholique: whose chiefe talke standeth in reasoning, whether the life of the one must be like the other. with whom hauing shewed, that it is daungerous to mainteine any felowship, or giue too much credit to their co lourable and feyned goodwill, he telleth him a tale of the foxe, that by such a counterpoynt of craftines deceiued and deuoured the credulous kidde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Palinode. Piers, IS not thilke the mery moneth of May, When loue lads masken in fresh aray? How falles it then, we no merrier bene, Ylike as others, girt in gawdy greene? Our bloncket liueryes bene all to sadde, For thilke same season, when all is ycladd With pleasaunce: the grownd with grasse, the Wods With greene leaues, the bushes with bloosming Buds. Yougthes folke now flocken in euery where, To gather may bus-kets and smelling brere: And home they hasten the postes to dight, And all the Kirke pillours eare day light, With Hawthorne buds, and swete Eglantine, And girlonds of roses and Sopps in wine. Such merimake holy Saints doth queme, But we here sytten as drownd in a dreme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PIERS. For Younkers Palinode such follies fitte, But we tway bene men of elder witt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PALINODE. Sicker this morrowe, ne lenger agoe, I sawe a shole of shepeheardes outgoe, With singing, and shouting, and iolly chere: Before them yode a lusty Tabrere, That to the many a Horne pype playd, Whereto they dauncen eche one with his mayd. To see those folkes make such iouysaunce, Made my heart after the pype to daunce. Tho to the greene Wood they speeden hem all, To fetchen home May with their musicall: And home they bringen in a royall throne, Crowned as king: and his Queene attone Was Lady Flora, on whom did attend A fayre flock of Faeries, and a fresh bend Of louely Nymphes. (O that I were there, To helpen the Ladyes their Maybush beare) Ah Piers, bene not thy teeth on edge, to thinke How great sport they gaynen with little swinck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PIERS. Perdie so farre am I from enuie, That their fondnesse inly I pitie. Those faytours little regarden their charge, While they letting their sheepe runne at large, Passen their time, that should be sparely spent, In lustihede and wanton meryment. Thilke same bene shepeheards for the Deuils stedde, That playen while their flockes be vnfedde. Well is it seene, theyr sheepe bene not their owne, That letten them runne at randon alone. But they bene hyred for little pay Of other, that caren as little as they, What fallen the flocke, so they han the fleece, And get all the gayne, paying but a peece. I muse, what account both these will make, The one for the hire, which he doth take, And thother for leauing his Lords tas-ke, When gread Pan account of shepeherdes shall aske.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PALINODE. Sicker now I see thou speakest of spight, All for thou lackest somedele their delight. I (as I am) had rather be enuied, All were it of my foe, then fonly pitied: And yet if neede were, pitied would be, Rather, then other should scorne at me: For pittied is mishappe, that nas remedie, But scorned bene dedes of foud [fond] foolerie. What shoulden shepheards other things tend, Then sith their God his good does them send, Reapen the fruite thereof, that is pleasure, The while they here liuen, at ease and leasure? For when they bene dead, their good is ygoe, They sleepen in rest, well as other moe. Tho with them wends, what they spent in cost, But what they left behind them, is lost. Good is no good, but if it be spend: God giueth good for none other end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PIERS. Ah Palinodie, thou art a worldes childe: Who touches Pitch mought needes be defilde. But shepheards (as Algrind vsed to say,) Mought not liue ylike, as men of the laye: With them it sits to care for their heire, Enaunter their heritage doe impaire: They must prouide for meanes of maintenaunce, And to continue their wont countenaunce. But shepheard must walke another way, Sike worldly souenance he must foresay. The sonne of his loines why should he regard To leaue enriched with that he hath spard? SHoulD not thilke God, that gaue him that good, Eke cherish his child, if in his wayes he stood? For if he misliue in leudnes and lust, Little bootes all the welth and the trust, That his father left by inheritaunce: All will be soone wasted with misgouernaunce. But through this, and other their miscreaunce, They maken many a wrong cheuisaunce, Heaping vp waues of welth and woe, The floddes whereof shall them ouerflowe. Sike mens follie I cannot compare Better, then to the Apes folish care, That is so enamoured of her young one, (And yet God wote, such cause hath she none) That with her hard hold, and straight embracing, She stoppeth the breath of her youngling. SO often times, when as good is meant, Euil ensueth of wrong entent. The time was once, and may againe retorne, (For ought may happen, that hath bene beforne) When shepeheards had none inheritaunce, Ne of land, nor fee in sufferaunce: But what might arise of the bare sheepe, (Were it more or lesse) which they did keepe. Well ywis was it with shepheards thoe: Nought hauing, nought feared they to forgoe. For PAn himselfe was their inheritaunce, And little them serued for their mayntenaunce. The shephears [shepheards] God so wel them guided, That of nought they were vnprouided, Butter enough, honye, milke, and whay, And their flockes fleeces, them to araye. But tract of time, and long prosperitie: That nource of vice, this of insolencie, Lulled the shepheards in suc securitie, That not content with loyal obeysaunce, Some gan to gape for greedie gouernaunce, And match them selfe with mighty potentates, Louers of Lordship and troublers of states: Tho gan shepheards swaines to looke a loft, And leaue to liue hard, and learne to ligge soft: Tho vnder colour of shepeheards, somewhile There crept in Wolues, ful of fraude and guile, That often deuoured their owne sheepe, And often the shepheards, that did hem keepe. This was the first sourse of shepheards sorowe, That now nill be quitt with baile, nor borrowe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PALINODE. Three things to beare, bene very burdenous, But the fourth to forbeare, is outragious. Wemen that of Loues longing once lust, Hardly forbearen, but haue it they must: So when choler is inflamed with rage, Wanting reuenge, is hard to asswage: And who can counsell a thristie soule, With patience to forbeare the offred bowle? But of all burdens, that a man can beare, Moste is, a fooles talke to beare and to heare. I wene the Geaunt has not such a weight, That beares on his shoulders the heauens height. Thou findest faulte, where nys to be found, And buildest strong warke vpon a weake ground: Thou raylest on right withouten reason, And blamest hem much, for small encheason. How shoulden shepheardes liue, if not so? What? should they pynen in payne and woe? Nay sayd I thereto, by my deare borrowe, If I may rest, I nill liue in sorrowe. Sorrowe ne neede be hastened on: For he will come without calling anone. While times enduren of tranqullitie, Vsen we freely our felicitie. For when approchen the stormie stowres, We mought with our shoulders beare of the sharpe showres. And sooth to sayne, nought seemeth sike strife, That shepheardes so witen ech others life, And layen her faults the world beforne, The while their foes done eache of hem scorne.

      <field name="fulltext">PIERS. THilke same Kidde (as I can well deuise) Was too very foolish and vnwise. For on a tyme in Sommer season, The Gate her dame, that had good reason, Yode forth abroade vnto the greene wood, To brouze, or play, or what shee thought good. But for she had a motherly care Of her young sonne, and wit to beware, Shee set her youngling before her knee, That was both fresh and louely to see, And full of fauour, as kidde mought be: His Vellet head began to shoot out, And his wreathed hornes gan newly sprout: The blossomes of lust to bud did beginne, And spring forth ranckly vnder his chinne. My sonne (quoth she) (and with that gan weepe: For carefull thoughts in her heart did creepe) God blesse thee poore Orphane, as he mought me, And send thee ioy of thy iollitee. Thy father (that word she spake with payne: For a sigh had nigh rent her heart in twaine) Thy father, had he liued this day, To see the braunche of his body displaie, How would he haue ioyed at this sweete sight? But ah false Fortune such ioy did him spight, And cutte of hys dayes with vntimely woe, Betraying him into the traines of hys foe. Now I a waylfull widdowe behight, Of my old age haue this one delight, To see thee succeede in thy fathers steade, And florish in flowres of lusty head. Foe euen so thy father his head vpheld, And so his hauty hornes did he weld. Tho marking him with melting eyes, A thrilling throbbe from her hart did aryse, And interrupted all her other speache, With some old sorowe, that made a new breache: Seemed shee sawe in the younglings face The old lineaments of his fathers grace. At last her solein silence she broke, And gan his newe budded beard to stroke. Kiddie (quoth shee) thou kenst the great care, I have of thy health and thy welfare, Which many wylde beastes liggen in waite, For to entrap in thy tender state: But most the Foxe, maister of collusion: For he has voued thy last confusion. For thy my Kiddie be ruld by mee, And neuer giue trust to his trecheree. And if he chaunce come, when I am abroade, Sperre the yate fast for feare of fraude: Ne for all his worst, nor for his best, Open the dore at his request. So schooled the Gate her wanton sonne, That answerd his mother, all should be done. Tho went the pensife Damme out of dore, And chaunst to stomble at the threshold flore: Her stombling steppe some what her amazed, (For such, as signes of ill luck bene dispraised) Yet forth shee yode thereat halfe aghast: And Kiddie the dore sperred after her fast. It was not long, after shee was gone, But the false Foxe came to the dore anone: Not as a Foxe, for then he had be kend, But all as a poore pedlar he did wend, Bearing a trusse of tryfles at hys backe, As bells, and babes, and glasses in hys packe. A Biggen he had got about his brayne, For in his headpeace he felt a sore payne. His hinder heele was wrapt in a clout, For with great cold he had gotte the gout. There at the dore he cast me downe hys pack, And layd him downe, and groned, Alack, Alack. Ah deare Lord, and sweet Saint Charitee, That some good body woulde once pitie mee. Well heard Kiddie al this sore constraint, And lenged to know the cause of his complaint: Tho creeping close behind the Wickets clinck, Preuelie he peeped out through a chinck: Yet not so preuelie, but the Foxe him spyed: For deceitfull meaning is double eyed. Ah good young maister (then gan he crye) Iesus blesse that sweete face, I espye, And keepe your corpse from the carefull stounds, That in my carrion carcas abounds. The Kidd pittying hys heauinesse, Asked the cause of his great distresse, And also who, and whence that he were. Tho he, that had well ycond his lere, Thus medled his talke with many a teare, Sicke, sicke, alas, and little lack of dead, But I be relieued by your beastlyhead. I am a poore Sheepe, albe my coloure donne: For with long traueile I am brent in the sonne. And if that my Grandsire me sayd, be true, Sicker I am very sybbe to you: So be your goodlihead doe not disdayne The base kinred of so simple swaine. Of mercye and favour then I you pray, With your ayd to forstall my neere decay. Tho out of his packe a glasse he tooke: Wherein while kiddie vnwares did looke, He was so enamoured with the newell, That nought he deemed deare for the iewell. Tho opened he the dore, and in came The false Foxe, as he were starke lame. His tayle he clapt betwixt his legs twayne, Lest he should be descried by his trayne. Bimg within, the Kidde made him good glee, All for the loue of the glasse he did see. After his chere the Pedlar can chat, And tell many lesings of this, and that: And how he could shewe many a fine knack. Tho shewed his ware, and opened his packe, All saue a bell, which he left behind In the bas-ket for the Kidde to fynd. Which when the Kidde stooped down to catch, He popt him in, and his bas-ket did latch, Ne stayed he once, the dore to make fast, But ran awaye with him in all hast. Home when the doubtful Damme had her hyde, She mought see the dore stand open wyde. All aghast, lowdly she gan to call Her Kidde: but he nould answere at all. Tho on the flore she sawe the merchandise, Of which her sonne had sette to dere a prise. WHat helpe? her Kidde shee knewe well was gone: Shee weeped, and wayled, and made great mone. Such end had the Kidde, for he nould warned be Of craft coloured with simplicitie: And such end perdie does all hem remayne, That of such false freendship bene fayne.</field>

But Piers thereto strongly replyeth with another peece of the same verse, saying as in his former fable, what fayth then is there in the faythlesse.

So he compareth the soile, wherin Hobbinoll made his abode, to that earthly Paradise, in scripture called Eden; wherein Adam in his first creation was placed. Which of the most learned is thought to be in Mesopotamia, the most fertile and pleasaunte country in the world (as may appeare by Diodorus Syculus description of it, in the hystorie of Alexanders conquest thereof) lying betweene the two famous Ryuers (which are sayd in scripture to flow out of Paradise) Tygris and Euphrates, whereof it is so denominate. Forsake the soyle) This is no poetical fiction, but vnfeynedly spoken of the Poete selfe, who for speciall occasion of priuate affayres (as I haue bene partly of himselfe informed) and for his more preferment remouing out of the Northparts came into the South, as Hobbinoll indeede aduised him priuately.

But the sooth is, that when all Italy was distraicte into the Factions of the Guelfes and the Gibelins, being two famous houses in Florence, the name began through their great mischiefes and many outrages, to be so odious or rather dreadfull in the peoples eares, that if theyr children at any time were frowarde and wanton, they would say to them that the Guelfe or the Gibeline came. Which words nowe from them (as many thinge els) be come into our vsage, and for Guelfes and Gibelines, we say Elfes and Goblins. No otherwise then the Frenchmen vsed to say of that valiaunt captain, the very scourge of Fraunce, The Lord Thalbot, afterward Erle of Shrewsbury; whose noblesse bred such a terrour in the hearts of the French, that oft times euen great armies were defaicted and put to flyght at the onely hearing of hys name. In somuch that the French wemen, to affray theyr chyldren, would tell them that the Talbot commeth. Many Graces) though there be indeede but three Graces of Charites (as afore is sayd) or at the vtmost but foure, yet in respect of many gyftes of bounty, there may be sayde more. And so Musaeus sayth, that in Heroes eyther eye there satte a hundred graces. And by that authoritye, thys same Poete in his Pageaunts sayth. An hundred Graces on her eyeledde satte, &amp;c. Haydeguies) A country daunce or rownd. The conceipt is, that the Graces and Nymphes doe daunce vnto the Muses, and Pan his musicke all night by Moonelight. To signifie the pleasauntnesse of the soyle. Peeres) Equalles and felow shepheards. Queneapples vnripe) imitating Virgils verse. Ipse ego cana legam tenera lanugine mala. Neighbour groues) a straunge phrase in English, but word for word expressing the Latine vicina nemora. Spring) not of water, but of young trees springing. Calliope) afforesayde. Thys staffe is is [sic] full of verie poetical inuention. Tamburines) an olde kind of instrument, which of some is supposed to be the Clarion. Pan with Phoebus) the tale is well knowne, howe that Pan and Apollo striuing for ex cellencye in musick, chose Midas for their iudge. Who being corrupted wyth partiall affection, gaue the victorye to Pan vndeserued: for which Phoebus sette a payre of Asses eares vpon hys head &amp;c. Tityrus) That by Tityrus is meant Chaucer, hath bene already sufficiently sayde, &amp; by thys more playne appeareth, that he sayth, he tolde merye tales. Such as by hys Canterburie tales. whom he calleth the God of Poetes for hys excellencie, so as Tullie calleth Lentulus, Deum vitae suae .s. the God of hys lyfe. To make) to versifie. O why) A pretye Epanorthosis or correction. Discurtesie) he meaneth the falsenesse of his louer Rosalinde, who forsaking hym, hadde chosen another. Poynte of worthy wite) the pricke of deserued blame. Menalcas) the name of a shephearde in Virgile; but here is meant a person vnknowne and secrete, agaynst whome he often bitterly inuayeth. vndersonge) vndermynde and deceiue by false suggestion. Embleme You remember, that in the fyrst Æglogue, Colins Poesie was Anchora speme: for that as then there was hope of fauour to be found in tyme. But nowe being cleane forlorne and reiected of her, as whose hope, that was, is cleane extinguished and turned into despeyre, he renounceth all comfort and hope of goodnesse to come. which is all the meaning of thys Embleme.

And now the Sonne hath reared vp his fyriefooted teme, Making his way betweene the Cuppe, and golden Diademe: The rampant Lyon hunts he fast, with Dogge of noysome breath, Whose balefull barking bringes in hast pyne, plagues, and dreery death.

And of S. Brigets bowre I trow, all Kent can rightly boaste: And they that con of Muses skill, sayne most what, that they dwell (As goteheards wont) vpon a hill, beside a learned well.

Vpon whose toppe the starres bene stayed, and all the skie doth leane, There is the caue, where Phebe layed, The shepheard long to dreame. Whilome there vsed shepheards all to feede theyr flocks at will, Till by his foly one did fall, that all the rest did spill. And sithens shepheardes bene foresayd from places of delight: For thy I weene thou be affrayed, to clime this hilles height. Of Synah can I tell thee more, and of our Ladyes bowre: But little needes to strow my store, suffice this hill of our. Here han the holy Faunes resourse, and Syluanes haunten rathe.

Here growes Melampode euery where, and Terebinth good for Gotes: The one, my madding kiddes to smere, the next, to heale theyr throtes. Hereto, the hills bene nigher heuen, and thence the passage ethe. As well can proue the piercing leuin, that seeldome falls bynethe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thomalin. Syker thou speakes lyke a lewde lorrell, of Heauen to demen so: How be I am but rude and borrell, yet nearer wayes I knowe. To Kerke the narre, from God more farre, has bene an old sayd sawe. And he that striues to touch the starres, oft stombles at a strawe. Alsoone may shepheard clymbe to skye, that leades in lowly dales, As Goteherd prowd that sitting hye, vpon the Mountaine sayles. My seely sheepe like well belowe, they neede not Melampode: For they bene hale enough, I trowe, and liken theyr abode. But if they with thy Gotes should yede, they soone myght be corrupted: Or like not of the frowie fede, or with the weedes be glutted. The hylls, where dwelled holy saints, I reuerence and adore: Not for themselfe, but for the sayncts, which han be dead of yore. And nowe they bene to heauen forewent, theyr good is with them goe: Theyr sample onely to vs lent, that als we mought doe soe. Shepheards they weren of the best, and liued in lowly leas: And sith theyr soules bene now at rest, why done we them disease? Such one he was, (as I haue heard old Algrind often sayne) That whilome was the first shepheard, and liued with little gayne: As meeke he was, as meeke mought be, simple, as simple sheepe, Humble, and like in eche degree the flocke, which he did keepe. Often he vsed of hys keepe a sacrifice to bring, Nowe with a Kidde, now with a sheepe The Altars hallowing. So lowted he vnto hys Lord, such fauour couth he fynd, That sithens neuer was abhord, the simple shepheards kynd. And such I weene the brethren were, that came from Canaan: The brethren twelue, that kept yfere The flockes of mighty Pan. But nothing such thilke shephearde was, whom Ida hyll dyd beare, That left hys flocke, to fetch a lasse, whose loue he bought to deare: For he was proude, that ill was payd, (no such mought shepheards bee) And with lewde lust was ouerlayd: tway things doen ill agree: But shepheard mought be meeke and mylde, well eyed, as Argus was, With fleshly follyes vndefyled, and stoute as steede of brasse. Sike one (sayd Algrin) Moses was, that sawe hys makers face, His face more cleare, then Christall glasse, and spake to him in place. This had a brother, (his name I knewe) the first of all his cote, A shepheard trewe, yet not so true, as he that earst I hote. Whilome all these were lowe, and lief, and loued their flocks to feede, They neuer strouen to be chiefe, and simple was theyr weede. But now (thanked be God therefore) the world is well amend, Their weedes bene not so nighly wore, such simplesse mought them shend: They bene yclad in purple and pall, so hath theyr god them blist, They reigne and rulen ouer all, and lord it, as they list: Ygyrt with belts of glitterand gold, (mought they good sheepeheards bene) Theyr Pan theyr sheepe to them has sold, I saye as some haue seene. For Palinode (if thou him ken) yode late on Pilgrimage To Rome, (if such be Rome) and then he sawe thilke misusage. For shepeheards (sayd he) there doen leade, As Lordes done other where, Theyr sheepe han crustes, and they the bread: the chippes, and they the chere: They han the fleece, and eke the flesh, (O seely sheepe the while) The corn is theyrs, let other thresh, their hands they may not file. They han great stores, and thriftye stockes, great freendes and feeble foes: What neede hem caren for their flocks? theyr boyes can looke to those. These wisards weltre in welths waues, pampred in pleasures deepe, They han fatte kernes, and leany knaues, their fasting flockes to keepe. Sike mister men bene all misgone, they heapen hylles of wrath: Sike syrly shepheards han we none, they keepen all the path.</field>

By this poesye Thomalin confirmeth that, which in hys former speach by sondry reasons he had proued. for being both hymselfe sequestred from all ambition and also abhorring it in others of hys cote, he taketh occasion to prayse the meane and lowly state, as that wherein is safetie without feare, and quiet without danger, according to the saying of olde Philosophers, that vertue dwelleth in the midddest, being enuironed with two contrary vices: whereto Morrell replieth with continuance of the same Philosophers opinion, that albeit all bountye dwelleth in mediocritie, yet perfect felicitye dwelleth in supremacie. for they say, and most true it is, that happinesse is placed in the highest degree, so as if any thing be higher or better, then that streight way ceaseth to be perfect happines. Much like to that, which I once heard alleaged in defence of humilitye out of a great doctour, Suorum Christus humillimus: which saying a gentle man in the company taking at the rebownd, beat backe again with lyke saying of another Doctoure, as he sayde.

Resort of people doth my greefs augment, The walled townes do worke my greater woe: The forest wide is fitter to resound The hollow Echo of my carefull cryes, I hate the house, since thence my loue did part, Whose waylefull want debarres myne eyes from sleepe. Let stremes of teares supply the place of sleepe: Let all that sweete is, voyd: and all that may augment My doole, drawe neare. More meete to wayle my woe, Bene the wild woddes my sorrowes to resound, Then bedde, or bowre, both which I fill with cryes, When I them see so waist, and fynd no part Of pleasure past. Here will I dwell apart In gastful groue therefore, till my last sleepe Doe close mine eyes: so shall I not augment With sight of such a chaunge my recklesse woe: Helpe me, ye banefull byrds, whose shrieking sound Ys signe of dreery death, my deadly cryes Most ruthfully to tune. And as my cryes (Which of my woe cannot bewray least part) You heare all night, when nature craueth sleepe, Increase, so let your yrksome yells augment. Thus all the night in plaints, the daye in woe I vowed haue to wayst, till safe and sound She home returne, whose voyces siluer sound To cheerefull songs can chaunge my cherelesse cryes. Hence with the Nightingale will I take part, That blessed byrd, that spends her time of sleepe In songs and plaintiue pleas, the more taugment The memory of hys misdeede, that bred her woe: And you that feele no woe, | when as the sound Of these my nightly cryes | ye heare apart, Let breake your sounder sleepe | and pitie augment.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">HErein Diggon Dauie is deuised to be a shepheard, that in hope of more gayne, droue his sheepe into a farre countrye. The abuses whereof, and loose liuing of Popish prelates, by occasion of Hobbinols demaund, he discourseth at large.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinol. Diggon Dauie. DIggon Dauie, I bidde her god day: Or Diggon her is, or I missaye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Her was her, while it was daye light, But nowe her is a most wretched wight. For day, that was, is wightly past, And now at earst the dirke night doth hast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Diggon areede, who has thee so dight? Neuer I wist thee in so poor a plight. Where is the fayre flocke, thou was wont to leade? Or bene they chaffred? or at mischiefe dead?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Ah for loue of that, is to thee moste leefe, Hobbinol, I pray thee gall not my old griefe: Sike question ripeth vp cause of newe woe, For one opened mote vnfolde many moe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Nay, but sorrow close shrouded in hart I know, to kepe, is a burdenous smart. Eche thing imparted is more eath to beare: When the rayne is faln, the cloudes wexen cleare. And nowe sithence I sawe thy head last, Thrise three Moones bene fully spent and past: Since when thou hast measured much grownd, And wandred I wene about the world rounde, So as thou can many thinges relate: But tell me first of thy flocks astate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. My sheepe bene wasted, (wae is me therefore) The iolly shepheard that was of yore, Is nowe nor iolloye, nor shepehearde more. In forrein costes, men sayd, was plentye: And so there is, but all of miserye. I dempt there much to haue eeked my store, But such eeking hath made my hart sore. In tho countryes, whereas I haue bene, No being for those, that truely mene, But for such, as of guile maken gayne, No such countrye, as there to remaine. They setten to sale their shops of shame, And maken a Mart of theyr good name. The shepheards there robben one another, And layen baytes to beguile her brother. Or they will buy his sheepe out of the cote, Or they will caruen the shepheards throte. The shepheards swayne you cannot wel ken, But it be by his pryde, from other men: They looken bigge as Bulls, that bene bate, And bearen the cragge so stiffe and so state, As cocke on his dunghill, crowing cranck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Diggon, I am so stiffe, and so stanck, That vneth may I stand any more: And nowe the Westerne wind bloweth sore, That nowe is in his chiefe souereigntee, Beating the withered leafe from the tree. Sitte we downe here under the hill:hill: Tho may we talke, and tellen our fill, And make a mocke at the blustring blast. Now say on Diggon, what euer thou hast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Hobbin, ah Hobbin, I curse the stounde, That euer I cast to haue lorne this grounde. Wel-away the while I was so fonde, To leaue the good, that I had in honde, In hope of better, that was vncouth: So lost the Dogge the flesh in his mouth. My seely sheepe (ah seely sheepe) That here by there I whilome vsed to keepe, All were they lustye, as thou didst see, Bene all sterued with pyne and penuree. Hardly my selfe escaped thilke payne, Driuen for neede to come home agayne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Ah fon, now by thy losse art taught, That seeldome chaunge the better brought. Content who liues with tryed state, Neede feare no chaunge of frowning fate: But who will seeke for vnknowne gayne, Oft liues by losse, and leaues with payne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. I wote ne Hobbin how I was bewitcht With vayne desyre, and hope to be enricht. But sicker so it is, as the bright starre Seemeth ay greater, when it is farre: I thought the soyle would haue made me rich: But nowe I wote, it is nothing sich. For eyther the shepeheards bene ydle and still, And ledde of theyr sheepe, what way they wyll: Or they bene false, and full of couetise, And casten to compasse many wrong emprise. But the more bene fraught with fraud and spight, Ne in good nor goodnes taken delight: But kindle coales of conteck and yre, Wherewith they sette all the world on fire: Which when they thinken agayne to quench With holy water, they doen hem all drench. They saye they con to heauen the high way, But by my soule I dare vndersaye, Thye neuer sette foote in that same troade, But balk the right way, and strayen abroad. They boast they han the deuill at commaund: But aske hem therefore, what they han paund. Marrie that great Pan bought with deare borrow, To quite it from the blacke bowre of sorrowe. But they han sold thilk same long agoe: For thy woulden drawe with hem many moe. But let hem gange alone a Gods name: As they han brewed, so let hem beare blame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Diggon, I praye the speake not so dirke. Such myster saying me seemeth to mirke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Then playnely to speake of shepheards most what, Badde is the best (this english is flatt.) Their ill hauiour garres men missay, Both of their doctrine, and of their faye. They sayne the world is much war then it wont, All for her shepheards bene beastly and blont. Other sayne, but how truely I note, All for they holden shame of theyr cote. Some sticke not to say, (whote cole on her tongue) That sike mischeife graseth hem emong, All for the casten too much of worlds care, To deck her Dame, and enrich her heyre: For such encheason, If you goe nye, Fewe chymneis reeking you shall espye: The fat Oxe, that wont ligge in the stal, Is nowe fast stalled in her crumenall. Thus chatten the people in theyr steads, Ylike as a Monster of many heads. But they that shooten neerest the pricke, Sayne, other the fat from their beards doen lick. For bigge Bulles of Basan brace hem about, That with theyr hornes butten the more stoute: But the leane soules treaden vnder foote. And to seeke redresse mought little boote: For liker bene they to pluck away more, Then ought of the gotten good to restore. For they bene like foule wagmoires ouergrast, That if thy galage once sticketh fast, The more to wind it out thou doest swinck, Thou mought ay deeper and deeper sinck. Yet better leaue of with a little losse, Then by much wrestling to leese the grosse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Nowe Diggon, I see thou speakest to plaine: Better it were, a little to feyne, And cleanly couer, that cannot be cured. Such il, as is forced, mought nedes be endured. But of sike pastoures howe done the flocks creepe?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Sike as the shepheards, sike bene her sheepe, For they nill listen to the shepheards voyce, But if he call hem at theyr good choyce, They wander at wil, and stray at pleasure, And to theyr foldes yeeld at their owne leasure. But they had be better come at their cal: for many han into mischiefe fall, And bene of rauenous Wolues yrent, All for they nould be buxome and bent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Fye on thee Diggon, and all thy foule leasing, Well is knowne that sith the Saxon king, Neuer was Woolfe seene many nor some, Nor in all Kent, nor in Christendome: But the fewer Woolues (the soth to sayne,) The more bene the Foxes that here remaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Yes, but they gang in more secrete wise, And with sheepes clothing doen hem disguise, They walke not widely as they were wont For feare of raungers, and the great hunt: But priuely prolling too and froe, Enaunter they mought be inly knowe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Or priue or pert yf and bene, We han great Bandogs will tear their skinne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Indeede thy ball is a bold bigge curre, And could make a iolly hole in theyr furre. But not good Dogges hem needeth to chace, But heedy shepheards to discerne their face. For all their craft is in their countenaunce, They bene so graue and full of mayntenaunce. But shall I tell thee what my selfe knowe, Chaunced to Roffynn not long ygoe?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Say it out Diggon, what euer it hight, For not but well mought him betight. He is so meeke, wise, and merciable, And with his word his worke is conuenable. Colin clout I wene be his selfe boye, (Ah for Colin he whilome my ioye) Shepheards sich, God mought vs many send, That doen so carefully theyr flocks tend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Thilk same shepheard mought I well marke: He has a Dogge to byte or to bark, [38. misnumbered] Neuer had shepheard so nene a kurre, That waketh, and if but a leafe sturre. Whilome there wonned a wicked Wolfe, That with many a Lambe had glutted his gulfe. And euer at night wont to repayre Vnto the flocke, when the Welkin shone faire, Ycladde in clothing of seely sheepe, When the good old man vsed to sleepe. Tho at midnight he would barke and ball, (For he had eft learned a curres call.) As if a Woolfe were emong the sheepe. With that the shpheard would breake his sleepe, And send out Lowder (for so his dog hote) To raunge the fields with wide oppen throte. Tho when as Lowder was farre away, This Woluish sheepe would catchen his pray, A Lambe, or a Kidde, or a weanell wast: With that to the wood would he speede him fast. Long time he vsed this slippery pranck, Ere Roffy could for his laboure him thanck. At end the shepheard his practise spyed, (For Roffy is wise, and as Argus eyed) And when at euen he came to the flocke, Fast in theyr folds he did them locke, And tooke out the Woolfe in his counterfect cote, And let out the sheepes bloud at his throte.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Marry Diggon, what should him affraye, To take his owne where euer it laye? For had his wesand bene a little widder, He would hue deuoured both hidder and shidder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Mischiefe light on him, and Gods great curse, Too good for him had bene a great deale worse: For it was a perilous beast aboue all, And eke had he cond the shepherds call. And oft in the night came to the shepecote, And called Lowder, with a hollow throte, As if it the old man selfe had bene. The dog his maisters voice did it weene, Yet halfe in doubt, he opened the dore, And ranne out, as he was wont of yore. No sooner was out, but swifter then thought, Fast by the hyde the Wolfe lowder caught: And had not Roffy renne to the steuen, Lowder had be slaine thilke same euen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. God shield man, he should so ill haue thriue, All for he did his deuoyr beliue. If sike bene Wolues, as thou hast told, How mought we Diggon, hem be-hold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. How, but with heede and watchfulnesse, Forstallen hem of their wilinesse? For thy with shepheard sittes not playe, Or sleepe, as some doen, all the long day: But euer liggen in watch and ward, From soddein force theyr flocks for to gard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Ah Diggon, thilke same rule were too straight, All the cold season to wach and waite. We bene of flesh, men as other bee, Why should we be bound to such miseree? What euer thing lacketh chaungeable rest, Mought needes decay, when it is at best.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Diggon. Ah but Hobbinol, all this long tale, Nought easeth the care, that doth me forhaile. What shall I doe? what way shall I wend, My piteous plight and losse to amend? Ah, good Hobbinol, mought I thee praye, Of ayde or counsell in my decaye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hobbinoll. Now by my soule Diggon, I lament The haplesse mischief, that has thee hent, Nethelesse thou seest my lowly saile, That froward fortune doth euer auaile. But were Hobbinoll, as God mought please, Diggon should soone find fauour and ease. But if to my cotage thou wilt resort, So as I can, I wil thee comfort: There mayst thou ligge in a vetchy bed, Till fayrer Fortune shewe forth her head.</field>

Indeede the Romish Tityrus, I heare, Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede, Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede, And laboured lands to yield the timely eare, And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede, So as the heauens did quake his verse to here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye, And great Augustus long ygoe is dead: And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade, That matter made for Poets on to play: For euer, who in derring doe were dreade, The loftie verse of hem was loued aye. But after vertue gan for age to stoupe, And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease: The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease, To put in preace emong the learned troupe. Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease, And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And if that any buddes of Poesie, Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne: Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne, And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye. Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne: Tom Piper makes vs better melodie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Piers. O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place? If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt: (And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt) Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace. Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit, And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heauen apace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cuddie. Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne, So high to sore, and make so large a flight: Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight, For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne: He, were he not with loue so ill bedight, Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Piers. Ah fon, for loue does teach him climbe so hie, And lyftes him vp out of the loathsome myre: Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire, Would rayse ones mynd aboue the starry skie. And cause a captiue corage to aspire, For lofty loue doth loath a lowly eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cuddie. All otherwise the state of Poet stands, For lordly loue is such a Tyranne fell: That where he rules, all power he doth expell. The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes, Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell: Vnwisely weaues, that takes two webbes in hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who euer casts to compasse weightye prise, And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate: Let powre in lauish cups and thriftie bitts of meate, For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise.

      <field name="fulltext">Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage. O if my temples were distaind with wine, And girt in girlonds of wild Yuie twine, How I could reare the Muse on stately stage, And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine, With queint Bellona in her equipage.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">This Æglogue is made in imitation of Theocritus his xvi. Idilion, wherein hee reproued the Tyranne Hiero of Syracuse for his nigardise towarde Poetes, in whom is the power to make men immortal for theyr good dedes, or shameful for their naughty lyfe. And the lyke also is in Mantuane, The style hereof as also that in Theocritus, is more loftye then the rest, and applyed to the heighte of Poeticall witte. Cuddie) I doubte whether by Cuddie be specified the authour selfe, or some other. For in the eyght Æglogue the same person was brought in, singing a Cantion of Colins making, as he sayth. So that some doubt, that the persons be different. Whilome) sometime. Oaten reedes) Auena. Ligge so layde) lye so faynt and vnlustye. Dapper) pretye. Frye) is a bold Metaphore, forced from the spawning fishes. for the multitude of young fish be called the frye. To restraine.) This place seemeth to conspyre with Plato, who in his first booke de Legibus sayth, that the first inuention of Poetry was of very vertuous intent. For at what time an infinite number of youth vsually came to theyr great solemne feastes called Panegyrica, which they vsed euery fiue yeere to hold, some learned man being more hable then the rest, for speciall gyftes of wytte and Musicke, would take vpon him to sing fine verses to the people, in prayse eythet [eyther] of vertue or of victory or of immortality or such like. At whose wonderful gyft al men being astonied and as it were rauished, with delight, thinking (as it was indeede) that he was inspired from aboue, called him vatem: which which kinde of men afterwarde framing their verses to lighter musick (as of musick be many kinds, some sadder, some lighter, some martiall, some heroicall: and so diuersely eke affect the mynds of men) found out lighter matter of Poesie also, some playing wyth loue, some scorning at mens fashions, some powred out in pleasures, and so were called Poetes or makers. Sence bereaue. what the secrete working of Musick is in the myndes of men, aswell appeareth, hereby, that some of the auncient Philosophers, and those the moste wise, as Plato and Pythagoras held for opinion, that the mynd was made of a certaine harmonie and musicall nombers, for the great compassion &amp; likenes of affection in thone and in the other as also by that memorable history of Alexander: to whom when as Timotheus the great Musitian playd the Phrygian melodie, it is said, that he was distraught with such vnwonted fury, that streight way rysing from the table in great rage, he caused himselfe to be armed, as ready to goe to warre (for that musick is very warlike:) And immediately whenas the Musitian chaunged his stroke into the Lydian and Ionique harmony, he was so furr from warring, that he sat as styl, as if he had bene in mattes of counsell. Such might is in musick. wherefore Plato and Aristotle forbid the Aradian Melodie from children and youth. for that being altogither on the fyft and vij, tone, it is of great force to molifie and quench the kindly courage, which vseth to burne in yong brests. So that it is not incredible which the Poete here sayth, that Musick can bereaue the soule of sence. The shepheard that) Orpheus: of whom is sayd, that by his excellent skil in Musick and Poetry, he recouered his wife Eurydice from hell. Argus eyes) of Argus is before said, that Iuno to him committed hir husband Iupiter his Paragon Io, bicause he had an hundred eyes: but afterwarde Mercury wyth his Musick lulling Argus asleepe, slew him and brought Io away, whose eyes it is sayd that Inno [Iuno] for his eternall memory placed in her byrd the Peacocks tayle. for those coloured spots indeede resemble eyes. Woundlesse armour) vnwounded in warre, doe rust through long peace. Display) A poeticall metaphore: whereof the meaning is, that if the Poet list showe his skill in matter of more dignitie, then is the homely Æglogue, good occasion is him offered of higher veyne and more Heroicall argument, in the person of our most gratious soueraign, whom (as before) he calleth Elisa. Or if mater of knighthoode and cheualrie please him better, that there be many Noble &amp; valiaunt men, that are both worthy of his payne in their deserued prayses, and also fauourers of hys skil and faculty. The worthy) he meaneth (as I guesse) the most honorable and renowmed the Erle of Leycester, whom by his cognisance (although the same be also proper to other) rather then by his name he bewrayeth, being not likely, that the names of noble princes be known to country clowne. Slack) that is when thou chaungest thy verse from stately discourse, to matter of moro [more] pleasaunce and delight. The Millers) a kind of daunce. Ring) company of dauncers. The Romish Tityrus) well knowen to be Virgile, who by Mecaenas means was brought into the fauour of the Emperor Augustus, and by hin moued to write in loftier kinde, then he erst had doen. Whereon) in these three verses are the three seueral workes of Virgile intended. For in teaching his flocks to feede, is meant his Æglogues. In labouring of lands, is hys Bucoliques. In singing of wars and deadly dreade, is his diuine Æneis figured. In derring doe) In manhood and chiualrie. For euer) He sheweth the cause, why Poetes were wont be had in such honor of noble men; that is, that by them their worthines &amp; valor shold through theyr famous Posies be commended to al posterities. wherfore it is sayd, that Achilles had neuer bene so famous, as he is, but for Homeres immortal verses. which is the only aduantage, which he had of Hector. And also that Alexander the great comming to his tomb in Sigeus, with naturall teares blessed him, that euer was his hap to be honoured with so excellent a Poets work: as so renowmed and ennobled onely by hys meanes. which being declared in a most eloquent Oration of Tulies, is of Petrarch no lesse worthely sette forth in a sonet Giunto Alexandro a la famosa tomba Del sero Achille sospirando disse O fortunato che si chiara tromba. Trouasti &amp;c. And that such account hath bene alwayes made of Poetes, aswell sheweth this that the worthy Scipio in all his warres against Carthage and Numantia had euermore in his company, and that in a most familiar sort the goode olde Poete Ennius: as also that Alexander destroying Thebes, when he was enformed that the famous Lyrick Poet Pindarus was borne in that citie, not onely commaunded streightly, that no man should vpon payne of death do any violence to that house by fire or otherwise: but also specially spared most, and some highly rewarded, that were of hys kinne. So fauoured he the only name of a Poete. whych prayse otherwise was in the same man no lesse famous, that when he came to ransacking of king Darius coffers, whom he lately had ouerthrowen, he founde in a little coffer of siuer two bookes of Homers works, as layd vp there for speciall iewells and richesse, which he taking thence, put one of them dayly in his bosome, and thother euery night layde vnder his pillowe. Such honor haue Poetes alwayes found in the sight of princes and noble men. which this author here very well sheweth, as els where more notably. But after) he sheweth the cause of contempt of Poetry to be idlenesse and baseness of mynd. Pent) shut vp in slouth, as in a coope or cage. Tom piper) An Ironicall Sacrasmus [Sarcasmus], spoken in derision of these rude wits, whych make more account of a ryming rybaud, then of skill grounded vpon learning and iudgment. Ne brest) the meaner sort of men. Her peeced pineons) vnperfect skil. Spoken wyth humble modestie. As soote as Swanne) The comparison seemeth to be strange: for the swanne hath euer wonne small commendation for her sweete singing: but it is sayd of the learned that the swan a little before hir death, singeth most pleasantly, as prophecying by a secrete instinct her neere destinie As wel sayth the Pote elswhere in one of his sonetts. The siluer swanne doth sing before her dying day As shee that feeles the deepe delight that is in death &amp;c. Immortall myrrhour) Beauty, which is an excellent obiect of Poeticall spirites, as appeareth by the worthy Petrarchs saying. Fiorir faceua il mio debile ingegno A las sua ombra, et crescer ne gli affanni. A caytiue corage) a base and abiect minde. For lofty loue) I think this playing with the letter to be rather a fault then a figure, aswel in our English tongue, as it hath bene alwayes in the Latin, called Cacozelon. A vacant) imitateth Mantuanes saying. vacuum curis diuina cerebrum Poscit. Lauish cups) Resembleth that comen verse Faecundi calices quem non fecere disertum. O if my) He seemeth here to be rauished with a Poeticall furie. For (if one rightly mark) the numbers rise so ful, &amp; the verse groweth so big, that it seemeth he hath forgot the meanenesse of shepheards state and stile. Wild yuie) for it is dedicated to Bacchus &amp; therefore it is sayd that the Maenades (that is Bacchus franticke priestes) vsed in theyr sacrifice to carry Thyrsos, which were pointed staues or Iauelins, wrapped about with yuie. In buskin) it was the maner of Poetes &amp; plaiers in tragedies to were buskins, as also in Comedies to vse stockes &amp; light shoes. So that the buskin in poetry is vsed for tragical matter, as it said in Virgile. Sola sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno. Queint) strange Bellona; the goddese of battaile, that is Pallas, which may therefore wel be called queint for that (as Lucian saith) when Iupiter hir father was in traueile of her, he caused his sonne Vulcane with his axe to hew his head. Out which leaped forth lustely a valiant damsell armed at all poyntes, whom seeing Vulcane so faire &amp; comely, lightly leaping to her, proffered her some cortesie, which the Lady disdeigning, shaked her speare at him, and threatned his saucinesse. Therefore such strauugenesse [straungenesse] is well applyed to her. Æquipage.) order. Tydes) seasons. Charme) temper and order. for Charmes were wont to be made by verses as Ouid sayth. Aut si carminibus. Embleme. Hereby is meant, as also in the whole course of this Æglogue, that Poetry is a diuine instinct and vnnatural rage passing the reache of comen reason.

Thy Muse to long slombreth in sorrowing, Lulled a sleepe through loues misgouernaunce. Now somewhat sing, whose endles souenaunce, Emong the shepeheards swaines may aye remaine, Whether thee list the loued lasse aduaunce, Or honor Pan with hymnes of higher vaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Colin. Thenot, now nis the time of merimake. Nor Pan to herye, nor with loue to playe: Sike myrth in May is meetest for to make, Or summer shade vnder the cocked haye. But nowe sadde Winter welked hath the day, And Phoebus weary of his yerely tas-ke, Ystabled hath his steedes in lowlye laye, And taken vp his ynne in Fishes has-ke. Thilke sollein season sadder plight doth aske: And loatheth sike delightes, as thou doest prayse: The mornefull Muse in myrth now list ne mas-ke, As shee was wont in yougth and sommer dayes.

Nay, better learne of hem, that learned bee, An han be watered at the Muses well: The kindlye dewe drops from the higher tree, And wets the little plants that lowly dwell. But if sadde winters wrathe and season chill, Accorde not with thy Muses meriment: To sadder times thou mayst attune thy quill, And sing of sorrowe and deathes dreeriment. For deade is Dido, dead alas and drent, Dido the greate shepehearde his daughter sheene: The fayrest May she was that euer went, Her like shee has not left behind I weene. And if thou wilt bewayle my wofull tene: I shall thee giue yond Cosset for thy payne: And if thy rymes as rownd and rufull bene, As those that did thy Rosalind complayne, Much greater gyfts for guerdon thou shalt gayne, Then Kidde of Cosset, which I thee bynempt: Then vp I say, thou iolly shepeheard swayne, Let not my small demaund be so contempt.</field>

But I haue already discoursed that at large in my Commentarye vpon the dreames of the same Author. Meynt) Mingled. Embleme. Which is as much to say, as death biteth not. For although by course of nature we be borne to dye, and being ripened with age, as with a timely haruest, we must be gathered in time, or els of our selues we fall like rotted fruite from the tree: yet death is not to be counted for euil, nor (as the Poete sayd a little before) as doome of ill desert) For though the trespasse of the first man brought death in to the world, as the guerdon of sinne, yet being ouercome by the death of one, that dyed for al, it is now made (as Chaucer sayth) the grene path way to lyfe. So that it agreeth well with that was sayd, that Death byteth not (that is) hurteth not at all.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THis Æglogue (euen as the first beganne) is ended with a complaynte of Colin to God Pan. wherein as weary of his former wayes, he proportioneth his life to the foure seasons of the yeare, comparing hys youthe to the spring time, when he was fresh and free form loues follye. His manhoode to the sommer, which he sayth, was consumed with greate heate and excessiue drouth caused through a Comet or blasinge starre, by which he meaneth loue, which passion is comenly compared to such flames and immoderate heate. His riper yeares hee resembleth to an vnseasonable harueste wherein the fruites fall ere they be rype. His latter age to winters chyll and frostie season, now drawing neare to his last ende.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THe gentle shepheard satte beside a springe, All in the shadowe of a bushy brere, That Colin hight, which wel could pype and singe, For he of Tityrus his songs did lere. There as he satte in secreate shade alone, Thus gan he make of loue his piteous mone. O soueraigne Pan thou God of shepheards all, Which of our tender Lambkins takest keepe: And when our flocks into mischaunce mought fall, Doest save from mischeife the vnwary sheepe: Als of their maisters hast no lesse regarde, Then of the flocks, which thou doest watch and ward:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I thee beseche (so be thou deigne to heare, Rude ditties tund to shepheards Oaten reede, Or if I euer sonet song so cleare, As it with pleasaunce mought thy fancie feede) Hearken awhile from thy greene cabinet, The rurall song of carefull Colinet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whilome in youth, when flowrd my ioyfull spring, Like Swallow swift I wandred here and there: For heate of heedlesse lust me so did sting, That I of doubted daunger had no feare. I went the wastefull woodes and forest wyde, Withouten dreade of Wolues to bene espyed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wont to raunge amydde the mazie thickette, And gather nuttes to make me Christmas game: And ioyed oft to chace the trembling Pricket, Or hunt the hartlesse hare, til shee were tame. What wreaked I of wintrye ages waste, Tho deemed I, my spring would euer laste.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How often haue I scaled the craggie Oke, All to dislodge the Rauen of her neste: Howe haue I wearied with many a stroke, The stately Walnut tree, the while the rest Vnder the tree fell all for nuts at strife: For ylike to me was libertee and lyfe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And for I was in thilke same looser yeares, (Whether the Muse so wrought me from my birth, Or I tomuch beleeued my shepherd peres) Somedele ybent to song and musicks mirth, A good olde shephearde, Wrenock was his name, Made me by arte more cunning in the same.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fro thence I durst in derring to [doe] compare With shepheards swayne, what euer fedde in field: And if that Hobbinol right iudgement bare, To Pan his owne selfe pype I neede not yield. For if the flocking Nymphes did folow Pan, The wiser Muses after Colin ranne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But ah such pryde at length was ill repayde, The shepheards God (perdie God was he none) My hurtlesse pleasaunce did me ill vpbraide, My freedome lorne, my life he lefte to mone. Loue they him called, that gaue me checkmate, But better mought they haue behote him Hate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tho gan my louely Spring bid me farewel, And Sommer season sped him to display (For loue then in the Lyons house did dwell) The raging fyre, that kindled at his ray. A comett stird vp that vnkindly heate, That reigned (as men sayd) in Venus seate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Forth was I ledde, not as I wont afore, When choise I had to choose my wandring waye: But whether luck and loues vnbridled lore Would leade me forth on Fancies bitte to playe: The bush my bedde, the bramble was my bowre, The Woodes can witnesse many a wofull stowre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where I was wont to seeke the honey Bee, Working her formall rowmes in Wexen frame: The grieslie Todestool growne there mought I se And loathed Paddocks lording on the same. And where the chaunting birds luld me a sleepe, The ghastlie Owle her grieuous ynne doth keepe. Then as the springe giues place to elder time, And bringeth forth the fruite of sommers pryde: Also my age now passed yougthly pryme, To thinges of ryper reason selfe applyed. And learnd of lighter timber cotes to frame, Such as might saue my sheepe and me fro shame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To make fine cages for the Nightingale, And Baskets of bulrushes was my wont: Who to entrappe the fish in winding sale Was better seene, or hurtful beastes to hont? I learned als the signes of heauen to ken, How Phoebe fayles, where Venus sittes and when.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And tryed time yet taught me greater thinges, The sodain rysing of the raging seas: The soothe of byrds by beating of their wings, The power of herbs, both which can hurt and ease: And which be wont tenrage the restlesse sheepe, And which be wont to worke eternall sleepe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But ah vnwise and witlesse Colin cloute, That kydst the hidden kinds of many a wede: Yet kydst not ene to cure thy sore hart roote, Whose ranckling wound as yet does rifely bleede. Why liuest thou stil, and yet hast thy deathes wound? Why dyest thou stil, and yet aliue art founde?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus is my sommer worne away and wasted, Thus is my haruest hastened all to rathe: The eare that budded faire, is burnt &amp; blasted, And all my hoped gaine is turned to scathe. Of all the seede, that in my youth was sowne, Was nought but brakes and brambles to be mowne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My boughes with bloosmes that crowned were at firste, And promised of timely fruite such store, Are left both bare and barrein now at erst: The flattring fruite is fallen to grownd before. And rotted, ere they were halfe mellow ripe: My haruest wast, my hope away dyd wipe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fragrant flowres, that in my garden grewe, Bene withered, as they had bene gathered long. Theyr rootes bene dryed vp for lacke of dewe, Yet dewed with teares they han be euer among. Ah who has wrought my Rolalind [Rosalind] this spight To spil the flowres, that should her girlond dight,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And I, that whilome wont to frame my pype, Vnto the shifting of the shepheards foote: Sike follies nowe haue gathered as too ripe, And cast hem out, as rotten an vnsoote. The loser Lasse I cast to please nomore, One if I please, enough is me therefore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And thus of all my haruest hope I haue Nought reaped but a weedye crop of care: Which, when I thought haue thresht in swelling sheaue, Cockel for corne, and chaffe for barley bare. Soone as the chaffe should in the fan be fynd, All was blowne away of the wauering wynd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So now my yeare drawes to his latter terme, My spring is spent, my sommer burnt vp quite: My harueste hasts to stirre vp winter sterne, And bids him clayme with rigorous rage hys right. So nowe he stormes with many a sturdy stoure, So now his blustring blast eche coste doth scoure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The carefull cold hath nypt my rugged rynde, And in my face deepe furrowes eld hath pight: My head besprent with hoary frost I fynd, And by myne eie the Crow his clawe dooth wright. Delight is layd abedde, and pleasure past, No sonne now shines, cloudes han all ouercast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now leaue ye shepheards boyes yonr [your] merry glee, My Muse is hoarse and weary of thys stounde: Here will I hang my pype vpon this tree, Was neuer pype of reede did better sounde. Winter is come, that blowes the bitter blaste, And after Winter dreerie death does hast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gather ye together my little flocke, My little flock, that was to me so liefe: Let me, ah lette me in your folds ye lock, Ere the breme Winter breede you greater griefe. Winter is come, that blowes the balefull breath, And after Winter commeth timely death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Adieu delightes, that lulled me asleepe, Adieu my deare, whose loue I bought so deare: Adieu my little Lambes and loued sheepe, Adieu ye Woodes that oft my witnesse were: Adieu good Hobbinol, that was so true, Tell Rosalind, her Colin bids her adieu.</field>

Musick) that is Poetry as Terence sayth Qui artem tractant musicam, speking of Poetes. Derring doe) aforesayd. Lions house) He imagineth simply that Cupid, which is loue, had his abode in the whote signe Leo, which is in middest of somer; a pretie allegory, whereof the meaning is, that loue in him wrought an extaordinarie heate of lust. His ray) which is Cupids beame or flames of Loue. A Comete) a blasing starre, meant of beautie, which was the cause of his whote loue. Venus) the goddesse of beauty or pleasure. Also a signe in heauen, as it is here taken. So he meaneth that beautie, which hath alwayes aspect to Venus, was the cause of all his vnquietnes in loue. Where I was) a fine description of the chaunge of hys lyfe and liking, for all things nowe seemed to hym to have altered their kindly course.

Cotes) sheepecotes. for such be the exercises of the shepheards. Sale) or Salow a kind of woodde like the wyllow, fit to wreath and bynde in leapes to catch fish withall. Phoebe sayles) The Eclipse of the Moone, which is alwayes in Cauda or Capite Draconis, signes in heauen. Venus) .s. Venus starre, otherwise called Hesperus and Vesper and Lucifer, both because he seemeth to be one of the brightest starres, and also first ryseth and setteth last. All which still in starres being conuenient for shepheardes to knowe as Theocritus and the rest vse. Raging seaes) The cause of the swelling and ebbing of the sea commeth of the course of the Moone, sometime encreasing, sometime wayning and decreasing. Sooth of byrdes) A kind of sooth saying vsed in elder tymes, which they gathered by the flying of byrds; First (as is sayd) niuented [invented] by the Thuscanes and from them deriued to the Romanes, who (as is sayd in Liuie) were so supersticiously rooted in the same, that they agreed that euery Noble man should put his sonne to the Thuscanes, by them to be brought vp in that knowledge. Of herbes) That wonderous thinges be wrought by herbes, aswell appeareth by the common working of them in our bodies, as also by the wonderful enchauntments and sorceries that haue bene wrought by them; insomuch that it is sayde that Circe a famous sorceresee turned men into sondry kinds of beastes &amp; Monsters, and onely by herbes: as the Poete sayth Dea saeua potentibus herbis &amp;c.

In the first verse his delights of youth generally. in the second, the loue of Rosalind, in the thyrd, the keeping of the sheepe, which is the argument of all Æglogues. In the fourth his complaints. And in the last two his professed frendship and good will to his good friend Hobbinoll. Embleme. The meaning whereof is that all thinges perish and come to theyr last end, but workes of learned wits and monuments of Poetry abide for euer. And therefore Horace of his Odes a work though ful indeede of great wit &amp; learning, yet of no so great weight and importaunce boldly sayth. Exigi monimentum aere perennius, Quod noc imber nec aquilo vorax &amp;c. Therefore let not be enuied, that this Poete in his Epilogue sayth he hath mad a Calendar, that shall endure as long as time &amp;c. folowing the example of Horace and Ouid in the like. Grande Opus exegi quae nec Iouis ira nec ignis, Nec ferum poterit nec edax abolere vetustas &amp;c.</field>

Goe lyttle Calender, thou hast a free passeporte, Goe but a lowly gate emongste the meaner sorte.
