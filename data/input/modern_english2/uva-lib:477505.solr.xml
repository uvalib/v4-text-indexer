      <field name="fulltext">Stilling, that night after dinner, had surpassed himself. He always did, Wrayford reflected, when the small fry from Highfield came to dine. He, Cobham Stilling, who had to find his bearings, keep to his level, in the big, heedless, oppressive world of New York, dilated and grew vast in the congenial medium of Highfield. The Red House was the biggest house of the Highfield summer colony, as Cobham Stilling was its biggest man. No one else within a radius of a hundred miles (on a conservative estimate) had as many horses, as many greenhouses, as many servants, and assuredly no one else had two motors, or a motor-boat for the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The motor-boat was Stilling's latest hobby, and he rode — or sailed — it in and out of the conversation all the evening, to the obvious edification of every one present save his wife and his visitor, Austin Wrayford. The interest of the latter two, who, from opposite ends of the drawing-room, exchanged a fleeting glance when Stilling again launched his craft on the thin current of the talk — the interest of Mrs. Stilling and Wrayford, had already lost its edge by protracted conversational contact with the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But the dinner-guests — the Rector, Mr. Swordsley, and Mrs. Swordsley, Lucy and Agnes Granger and their brother Addison, and young Jack Emmerton from Harvard — were all, for divers reasons, stirred to the proper pitch of feeling. Mr. Swordsley, no doubt, was saying to himself: "If my good parishioner here can afford to buy a motor-boat, in addition to all the other expenditures which an establishment like this must entail, I certainly need not scruple to appeal to him again for a contribution toward our Galahad Club." The Granger girls, meanwhile, were evoking visions of lakeside picnics, not unadorned with the presence of young Mr. Emmerton; while that youth himself speculated as to whether his affable host would let him, when he came back on his next vacation, "learn to run the thing himself"; and Mr. Addison Granger, the elderly bachelor brother of the volatile Lucy and Agnes, mentally formulated the precise phrase in which, in his next letter to his cousin Professor Spildyke of the University of East Latmos, he should allude to "our last delightful trip in my old friend Cobham Stilling's ten-thousand-dollar motor-launch" — for East Latmos was still in that primitive stage of social culture on which such figures impinge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Isabel Stilling, sitting beside Mrs. Swordsley, her head slightly bent above the needlework with which, on such occasions, it was her old-fashioned habit to be engaged — Isabel also had doubtless her reflections to make. As Wrayford leaned back in his corner, and looked at her across the bright, flower-filled drawing-room, he noted first of all — for the hundredth time — the flexible play of her hands above the embroidery-frame, the shadow of the dusky, wavy hair on her forehead, the tired droop of the lids over her somewhat full gray eyes. He noted this, taking in unconsciously, at the same time, the indescribable quality in her attitude, in the fall of her dress and the turn of her head, that set her, for him, in a separate world; then he said to himself: "She's certainly thinking 'Where on earth will he get the money to pay for it?'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But at the same moment, from his inevitable position on the hearth-rug, cigar in mouth, his hands in his waistcoat pockets, Stilling was impressively perorating.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I said, 'If I have the thing at all, I want the best that can be got.' That's my way, you know, Swordsley; I suppose I'm what you'd call fastidious. Always was, about everything, from cigars to wom-" — his eye met the apprehensive glance of Mrs. Swordsley, who looked, in evening dress, like her husband with his clerical coat cut slightly lower — "so I said, 'If I have the thing at all, I want the best that can be got.' Nothing makeshift for me, no second-best. I never cared for the cheap and showy. I always say frankly to a man, 'If you can't give me a first-rate cigar, for the Lord's sake, let me smoke my own.' Well, if you have my standards, you can't buy a thing in a minute. You must look round, compare, select. I found there were lots of motor-boats on the market, just as there's lots of stuff called champagne. But I said to myself, 'Ten to one there's only one fit to buy, just as there's only one champagne fit for a gentleman to drink.' Argued like a lawyer, eh, Austin?" He tossed this jovially toward Wrayford. "Take me for one of your own trade, wouldn't you? Well, I'm not such a fool as I look. I suppose you fellows who are tied to the treadmill, — oh, excuse me, Swordsley, but work's work, isn't it? — I suppose you think a man like me has nothing to do but take it easy--loll through life like a woman. By George, sir, I'd like either of you to see the time it takes — I won't say the brains — but just the time it takes to pick out a good motor-boat. Why, I went — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Stilling set her embroidery-frame noiselessly on the low table at her side, and turned her head toward Wrayford. "Would you mind ringing for the tray?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The interruption helped Mrs. Swordsley to waver to her feet. "I think we really ought to be going; my husband has an early service to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her host sounded an immediate protest. "Going already? Nothing of the sort! Why, the night's still young, as the poet says. Long way from here to the rectory? Nonsense! In our little twenty-horse motor we do it in five minutes — don't we, Belle? Ah, you're walking, to be sure — " Stilling's indulgent gesture seemed to concede that, in such a case, allowances must be made, and that he was the last man not to make them. "Well, then, Swordsley — " He held out a thick, red hand that seemed to exude beneficience, and the clergyman, pressing it, ventured to murmur a suggestion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What, that Galahad Club, again? Why, I thought my wife — Isabel, didn't we — No? Well, it must have been my mother, then. And of course, you know, anything my good mother gives is — well — virtually — You haven't asked her? Sure? I could have sworn; I get so many of these appeals. And in these times, you know, we have to go cautiously. I'm sure you recognize that yourself, Swordsley. With my obligations — here now, to show you don't bear malice, have a brandy and soda before you go. Nonsense, man! This brandy isn't liquor; it's liqueur . I picked it up last year in London — last of a famous lot from Lord St. Oswyn's cellar. Laid down here, it stood me at — Eh?" he broke off as his wife moved toward him. "Ah, yes, of course. Miss Lucy, Miss Agnes — a drop of soda-water? Look here, Addison, you won't refuse my tipple, I know. Well, take a cigar, at any rate, Swordsley. And, by the way, I'm afraid you'll have to go round the long way by the avenue to-night. Sorry, Mrs. Swordsley, but I forgot to tell them to leave the gate on the lane unlocked. Well, it's a jolly night, and I daresay you won't mind the extra turn along the lake. And, by Jove! if the moon's out, you can get a glimpse of the motor-boat as you turn the point. She's moored just out beyond our boat-house; and it's a privilege to look at her, I can tell you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE dispersal of the remaining guests carried Stilling out into the hall, where his pleasantries echoed genially under the oak rafters while the Granger girls were being muffled for the drive and the carriages summoned from the stables.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By a common impulse Mrs. Stilling and Wrayford had moved together toward the hearth, which was masked from the door into the hall by a tall screen of lacquer. Wrayford leaned his elbow against the chimney-piece, and Mrs. Stilling stood motionless beside him, her clasped hands hanging down before her. The rose on her breast stirred slightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you any more work to do with him to-night?" she asked below her breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford shook his head. "We wound it all up before dinner. He doesn't want to talk about it any more than he can help."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's so bad?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; but he's got to pull up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused, looking down at her clasped hands. He listened a moment, catching Stilling's farewell shout; then he changed his position slightly, and laid his hand on her arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In an hour?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made a faint motion of assent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell you all about it then. The key's in the usual place?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She nodded again, and walked away with her long, drifting motion as her husband came in from the hall. He went up to the tray, and poured himself a tall glass of brandy and soda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The weather's turning queer — black as pitch out now. I hope the Swordsleys won't walk into the lake — involuntary immersion, eh? He'd come out a Baptist, I suppose. What'd the Bishop do in such a case? There's a problem for a lawyer, my boy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He clapped Wrayford resoundingly on the thin shoulder and then walked over to his wife, who was gathering up her embroidery silks and dropping them into an old-fashioned work-bag. Stilling took her by the arms and swung her playfully about so that she faced the lamplight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter with you to-night?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The matter?" she echoed, blushing a little, and standing very erect in her desire not to appear to shrink from his touch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You never opened your lips. Left me the whole job of entertaining those blessed people. Didn't she, Austin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford laughed and lighted a cigarette. "She wasn't quite up to the mark."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There! You see even Austin noticed it. What's the matter? Aren't they good enough for you? I don't pretend they're particularly exciting; but, hang it! I like to ask them here — I like to give pleasure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't mean to be dull," said Isabel, appealingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you must learn to make an effort. Don't treat people as if they weren't in the room just because they don't happen to amuse you. Do you know what they'll think? They'll think it's because you've got a bigger house and more cash. Shall I tell you something? My mother said she'd noticed the same thing in you lately. She said she sometimes felt you looked down on her for living in a small house. Oh, she was half joking, of course; but you see you do give people that impression. I can't understand treating any one in that way. The more I have myself, the more I want to make other people happy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Isabel gently freed herself and laid the work-bag on her embroidery-frame. "I have a headache; perhaps that made me stupid. I'm going to bed." She turned toward Wrayford and held out her hand. "Good night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night," he answered, opening the door for her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When he turned back into the room, his host was pouring himself a third glass of brandy and soda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Here, have a nip? Gad, I need it badly, after the shaking up you gave me this afternoon." Stilling gave a short laugh, and carried his glass to the hearth, where he took up his usual commanding position. "Why the deuce don't you drink something, Austin? You look as glum as Isabel. One would think you were the chap that had been hit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford threw himself into the chair from which Mrs. Stilling had lately risen. It was the one she habitually sat in, and to his fancy a faint scent of her always clung to it. He leaned back and looked up at Stilling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Want a cigar?" the latter continued. "Shall we go into the den and smoke?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford hesitated. "If there's anything more you want to ask me about — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gad, no! I had full measure and running over this afternoon. The deuce of it is, I don't see where the money's all gone to. Luckily I've got plenty of nerve; I'm not the kind of man to sit down and snivel because he's been touched in Wall Street."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford rose again. "Then, if you don't want me, I think I'll go up to my room and put some finishing touches to a brief before I turn in. I must get back to town to-morrow afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, then." Stilling set down his empty glass, and held out his hand with a tinge of alacrity. "Good-night, old man."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They shook hands, and Wrayford moved toward the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, Austin — stop a minute!" his host called after him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford turned, and the two men faced each other across the hearth-rug. Stilling's eyes shifted uneasily in his flushed face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's one thing more you can do for me, like a good chap, before you go. Tell Isabel about that loan; explain to her she's got to sign a note for it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford, in his turn, flushed slightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You want me to tell her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hang it! I'm soft-hearted — that's the worst of me." Stilling moved toward the tray, and lifted the brandy decanter. "And she'll take it better from you; she'll have to take it from you. She's proud. You can take her out for a row to-morrow morning — you can take her out in the motor-launch, if you like. I meant to have a spin in it myself in the morning; but if you'll tell her — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford hesitated. "All right. I'll tell her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks a lot, my dear fellow. And you'll make her see it wasn't my fault, eh? Women are awfully vague about money, and if you appear to back me up, you know — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford nodded. "As you please. Good night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night. Here, Austin — there's just one more thing. You needn't say anything to Isabel about the other business — I mean my mother's securities."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah?" said Wrayford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stilling shifted from one foot to the other. "I'd rather put that to the old lady myself. I can make it clear to her. She idolizes me, you know — and, hang it! I've got a good record. Up to now, I mean. My mother's been in clover since I married; I may say she's been my first thought. And I don't want her to hear of this from Isabel. Isabel's a little harsh at times — and of course this isn't going to make her any easier to live with."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well," Wrayford assented.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stilling, with a look of relief, walked toward the window which opened on the terrace. "Gad! what a queer night! Hot as the kitchen-range. Shouldn't wonder if we had a squall before morning. I wonder if that infernal skipper took in the launch's awnings before he went home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford paused a moment in the doorway. "Yes, I saw him do it. She's shipshape for the night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good! That saves me a run down to the shore." Stilling strolled back into the room, whistling cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night, then," said Wrayford.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good night, old man. You'll tell her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell her," Wrayford answered from the threshold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And mum about my mother!" his host called after him.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE darkness had thinned a little when Wrayford scrambled down the steep path to the shore. Though the air was heavy, the threat of a storm seemed to have vanished, and now and then the moon's edge showed above a torn slope of cloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But in the densely massed shrubbery about the boat-house the night was still black, and Wrayford had to strike a match before he could find the lock and insert his key. He left the door unlatched, and groped his way in. How often he had crept into this warm pine-scented obscurity, guiding himself cautiously by the edge of the bench along the side wall, and hearing the stealthy lap of water through the gaps in the flooring! He knew just where one had to duck one's head to avoid the two canoes swung from the rafters, and just where to put his hand on the latch of the door that led to the balcony above the lake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boat-house represented one of Stilling's abandoned whims. He had built it some seven years before, and for a time it had been the scene of incessant nautical exploits. Stilling had rowed, sailed, paddled indefatigably, and all Highfield had been impressed to bear him company and admire his versatility. Then motors had come in, and he had forsaken aquatic sports for the guidance of the flying chariot. The canoes of birchbark and canvas had been hoisted to the roof, the little sail-boat had rotted at her moorings, and the movable floor of the boat-house, ingeniously contrived to slide back on noiseless runners, had lain undisturbed through several seasons. Even the key of the boat-house had been mislaid, — by Isabel's fault, her husband asserted, — and the locksmith had to be called in to make a new one when the purchase of the motor-boat made the lake once more the center of Stilling's activity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Wrayford entered he noticed that a strange oily odor overpowered the usual scent of dry pine-wood; and at the next step his foot struck an object that rolled noisily across the boards. He lighted a match, and found he had overturned a can of grease which the boatman had no doubt been using to oil the runners of the sliding-floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford felt his way down the length of the boat-house, and softly opening the balcony door, looked out on the lake. A few yards off the launch lay motionless in the veiled moonlight; and just below him, on the black water, he saw the dim outline of the skiff which Stilling used to paddle out to her. The silence was so intense that Wrayford fancied he heard a faint rustling in the shrubbery on the high bank behind the boat-house, and the crackle of gravel on the path descending to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He closed the door again and turned back; and as he did so the other door, on the land-side, swung inward, and a figure darkened the dim opening. Just enough light entered through the round holes above the respective doors to reveal it as Mrs. Stilling's cloaked outline, and to guide her to him as he advanced. But before they met she stumbled and gave a little cry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it?" he exclaimed, springing toward her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My foot caught; the floor seemed to give way under me. Ah, of course — " She bent down in the darkness — "I saw the men oiling it this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford caught her to him. "Be careful, darling! It might be dangerous if it slid too easily. The water's deep under here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; the water's very deep. I sometimes wish — " She leaned against him without finishing her sentence, and he tightened his arms about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hush!" he whispered, his lips on her hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly she threw back her head and seemed to listen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter?" he asked, listening also. "What did you hear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know." He felt her trembling. "I'm not sure this place is as safe as it used to be — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford held her to him reassuringly. "But the boatman sleeps down at the village; and who else should come here at this hour?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My husband might. He thinks of nothing but the launch."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He won't to-night, for I told him I'd seen the skipper roll up the awning, and put the launch shipshape, and that satisfied him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah, he did think of coming, then?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only for a minute, when the sky looked so black half an hour ago, and he was afraid of a squall. It's clearing now, and there's no danger."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew her down on the bench, and they sat a moment or two in silence, her hands in his. Then she said wearily: "You'd better tell me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford gave a faint laugh. "Yes, I suppose I had. In fact, he asked me to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He asked you to?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sounded a sharp note of contempt. "The coward! he's afraid!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford made no reply, and she went on: " I'm not. Tell me everything, please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, he's chucked away a pretty big sum again — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How has he done it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He says he doesn't know. He's been speculating, I suppose. The madness of making him your trustee!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew her hands away quickly. "You know why I did it. When we married I didn't want to put him in the false position of the man who accepts everything; I wanted people to think the money was partly his."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know what you've made people think; but you've been eminently successful in one respect. He thinks it's his — and he loses it as if it were."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She shivered a little, drawing her cloak closer. "There are worse things. Go on."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isabel!" He bent over her. "Give me your hand again." He lifted it and laid a long kiss on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was it — exactly — that he wished you to tell me?" she asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That you've got to sign another promissory note — for fifty thousand this time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew a deep breath. "Is that all?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford hesitated; then he said: "Yes — for the present."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She sat motionless, her head bent, her hand resting passively in his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He leaned nearer. "What did you mean, just now, by worse things?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused a moment. "Haven't you noticed that he's been drinking a great deal lately?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I've noticed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were both silent again; then Wrayford said with sudden vehemence: "And yet you won't — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Won't?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Put an end to it. Good God! Save what's left of your life."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made no answer, and in the deep stillness the throb-throb of the water underneath them was like the anxious beat of a heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isabel — " Wrayford murmured. He bent over to kiss her, and felt the tears on her face. "Isabel! I can't stand it! Listen to me — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She interrupted him. "No; no. I've thought of everything. There's the boy — the boy's fond of him. He's not a bad father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Except in the trifling matter of ruining his son."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And there's his poor old mother. He's a good son, at any rate; he's never hurt her . And I know her. If I left him, she'd never touch a penny. What she has of her own is not enough to live on; and how could he provide for her? If I put him out of doors, I should be putting his mother out, too — out of the little house she's so happy in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But surely you could arrange — there are always ways."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not for her! She's proud. And then she believes in him. Lots of people believe in him, you know. It would kill her if she ever found out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford made an impatient movement: "It will kill you, if you stay with him to prevent her finding out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She turned toward him and laid her other hand on his. "Not while I have you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have me? In this way?" he echoed with an exasperated laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In any way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My poor girl — poor child!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She drew back from him suddenly, with a quick movement of fear. "You mean that you'll grow tired — your patience will give out soon?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He answered her only by saying: "My poor Isabel!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But she went on insistently: "Don't you suppose I've thought of that — foreseen it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well — and then?" he exclaimed with sudden passion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've accepted that, too," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dropped her hands with a despairing gesture. "Then, indeed, I waste my breath!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She made no answer, and for a time they sat silent, side by side, but with a space between. At length he asked in a contrite voice: "You're not crying, Isabel?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't see your face, it's grown so dark again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I hadn't noticed. The storm must be coming, after all." She made a motion as if to rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He drew close, and put his arm about her again. "Don't leave me yet, dear! You know I must go to-morrow." He broke off with a laugh. "I'm to break the news to you to-morrow morning, by the way; I'm to take you out in the motor-launch and break it to you." He dropped her hands and stood up. "Good God! How can I go away and leave you here alone with him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've done it often before."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; but each time it's more damnable. And then I've always had a hope — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A hope?" She rose also. "Give it up! Give it up!" she moaned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've none, then, yourself?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was silent, drawing the folds of her cloak about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"None — none?" he insisted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only one," she broke out passionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He bent over and sought for her in the darkness. "What is it, my dearest? What is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't touch me! That he may die!" she shuddered back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He dropped his hands, and they drew apart instinctively, hearing each other's quick breathing through the obscurity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" You wish that sometimes, too?" he said at length in a low voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sometimes? I wish it always — every day, every hour, every moment!" She paused, and then let the quivering words break out. "You'd better know it; you'd better know the worst of me. I'm not the saint you suppose; the duty I do is poisoned by the thoughts I think. Day by day, hour by hour, I wish him dead. When he goes out I pray for something to happen; when he comes back I say to myself: 'Are you here again?' When I hear of people being killed in accidents I think: 'Why wasn't he there?' When I read the death-notices in the paper I say: 'So-and-so was just his age.' When I see him taking such care of his health and his diet, — as he does, you know, except when he gets reckless and begins to drink too much, — when I see him exercising and resting, and eating only certain things, and weighing himself, and feeling his muscles, and boasting that he hasn't gained a pound, I think of the men who die from overwork, who throw their lives away for some big object, and I say to myself: 'What can kill a man who thinks only of himself?' And night after night I keep myself from going to sleep for fear I may dream that he's dead. When I dream that, and wake and find him there, it's worse than ever — and my thoughts are worse than ever, too!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She broke off on a stifled sob, and the thump-thump of the water under the floor was like the beat of a loud, rebellious heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, you know the truth! Is it too bad for you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He answered in a low voice, as if unconscious of her question: "Such things do sometimes happen, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do they?" She laughed. "Yes, I've seen it happen — in happy marriages!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They were silent again, not approaching each other. Abruptly Isabel turned, feeling her way toward the door. As she did so, the profound stillness of the night was broken by the sound of a man's voice, caroling out somewhat unsteadily the refrain of a music-hall song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The two in the boat-house darted toward each other with a simultaneous movement, clutching hands as they met.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's coming!" Isabel breathed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford detached himself hastily from her hold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He may only be out for a turn before he goes to bed. Wait a minute. I'll see if I can make out." He felt his way to the bench, scrambled up on it, and stretching his body forward, managed to bring his eyes in line with the opening above the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's as black as pitch. I can't see anything."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The refrain rang out nearer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wait! I saw something twinkle. There it is again. It's coming this way — down the path. It's his cigar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a long rattle of thunder through the stillness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the storm!" Isabel gasped. "He's coming to see about the launch."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford dropped noiselessly from the bench to her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's coming — yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She caught him by the arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isn't there time to get up the path and slip under the shrubbery?" she whispered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no; he's in the path now. He'll be here in two minutes. He'll find us."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He felt her hand tighten on his arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must go in the skiff, then. It's the only way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And let him find you here? And hear my oars? Isabel, listen — there's something I must say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She flung herself against him, shaken with dry sobs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Isabel, just now I didn't tell you everything. He's ruined his mother — taken everything of hers, too. And he's got to tell her; it can't be kept from her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She uttered a startled sound and drew away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is this the truth? Why didn't you tell me before?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He forbade me. You were not to know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Close above them, in the shrubbery, Stilling rolled out:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nita, Juanita, Ask thy soul if we must part!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford caught her wrist in a hard grasp. "Understand this — if he comes in, he'll find us. And if there's a scandal you'll lose your boy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She seemed not to hear him. "You — you — you — he'll kill you!" she cried out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wrayford laughed and released her. She drew away and stood shrinking close against the wall, her hands pressed to her breast. Wrayford straightened himself and listened intently. Then he dropped to his knees and laid his hands against the boards of the sliding-floor. It yielded at once with a kind of evil alacrity; and at their feet they saw, in the night, another night that moved and shimmered. Wrayford sprang up, and threw himself back against the wall, behind the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A key rattled, and after a moment's fumbling the door swung open noisily. Wrayford and Isabel saw a black bulk against the obscurity. It moved a step, lurched forward, and vanished from them. In the depths there was a long cry and a splash.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go! go!" Wrayford cried out, feeling blindly for Isabel in the blackness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go?" she shuddered back, wrenching herself away from him with horror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He stood still a moment, as if dazed; then she saw him suddenly plunge from her side, and heard another splash far down, and a tumult in the beaten water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the darkness she cowered close to the opening, pressing her face over the edge, and frantically crying out the name of each in turn. Suddenly she began to see; the obscurity was less opaque, a faint moon-pallor diluted it. Isabel vaguely discerned the two shapes struggling in the black pit below her; once she saw the gleam of a face. Then she glanced up desperately for some means of rescue, and caught sight of the oars ranged on brackets against the wall. She snatched down the nearest, bent over the opening, and pushed the oar down into the blackness, calling her husband's name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The clouds had swallowed up the moon again, and she could see nothing below her, but she still heard a tumult in the beaten water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Cobham! Cobham!" she screamed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As if in answer, she felt a mighty clutch on the oar, a clutch that strained her arms to the breaking-point as she tried to brace her knees against the runners of the sliding-floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hold on! hold on! hold on!" a voice gasped out from below; and she held on, with racked muscles, with bleeding palms, with eyes straining from their sockets, and a heart that tugged at her like the weight on the oar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly the weight relaxed, and the oar slipped up through her lacerated hands. She felt a wet bulk scrambling over the edge of the opening, and Stilling's voice, raucous and strange, groaned out, close to her: "God! I thought I was done for."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He staggered to his knees, coughing and sputtering, and the water dripped on her from his clothes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She flung herself down, straining over the pit. Not a sound came up from it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Austin! Austin! Quick! Another oar!" she shrieked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Stilling gave a cry. "My God! Was it Austin? What in hell — Another oar? No, no; untie the skiff, I tell you. But it's no use. Nothing's any use. I felt him lose hold as I came up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After that she remembered nothing more till, hours later, as it appeared to her, she became dimly aware of her husband's voice, high, hysterical and important, haranguing a group of scared lantern-struck faces that seemed to have sprung up mysteriously about them in the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor Austin! Poor fellow . . . terrible loss to me . . . mysterious dispensation. Yes, I do feel gratitude — miraculous escape — but I wish he could have known that I was saved!"</field>
