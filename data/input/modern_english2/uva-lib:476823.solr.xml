      <field name="fulltext">"WHILOMVILLE STORIES BY STEPHEN CRANE" A street lined with trees. Illustration by Edward B. Edwards</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONE November it became clear to childish minds in certain parts of Whilomville that the Sunday-school of the Presbyterian church would not have for the children the usual tree on Christmas eve. The funds free for that ancient festival would be used for the relief of suffering among the victims of the Charleston earthquake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The plan had been born in the generous head of the superintendent of the Sunday-school, and during one session he had made a strong plea that the children should forego the vain pleasures of a tree, and, in a glorious application of the Golden Rule, refuse a local use of the fund, and will that it be sent where dire distress might be alleviated. At the end of a tearfully eloquent speech the question was put fairly to a vote, and the children in a burst of virtuous abandon carried the question for Charleston. Many of the teachers had been careful to preserve a finely neutral attitude, but even if they had cautioned the children against being too impetuous they could not have checked the wild impulses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But this was a long time before Christmas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very early, boys held important speech together. "Huh! you ain't goin' to have no Christmas tree at the Presperterian Sunday-school."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sullenly the victims answered, "No, we ain't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Huh!" scoffed the other denominations, "we are goin' to have the all-fired-est biggest tree that ever you saw in the world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little Presbyterians were greatly downcast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It happened that Jimmie Trescott had regularly attended the Presbyterian Sunday-school. The Trescotts were consistently undenominational, but they had sent their lad on Sundays to one of the places where they thought he would receive benefits. However, on one day in December Jimmie appeared before his father and made a strong spiritual appeal to be forthwith attached to the Sunday-school of the Big Progressive church. Doctor Trescott mused this question considerably. "Well, Jim," he said, "why do you conclude that the Big Progressive Sunday-school is better for you than the Presbyterian Sunday-school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now — it's nicer," answered Jimmie, looking at his father with an anxious eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why — now — some of the boys what go to the Presperterian place, they ain't very nice," explained the flagrant Jimmie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trescott mused the question considerably once more. In the end he said: "Well, you may change if you wish, this one time, but you must not be changing to and fro. You decide now, and then you must abide by your decision."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yessir," said Jimmie, brightly. "Big Progressive."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said the father. "But remember what I've told you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the following Sunday morning Jimmie presented himself at the door of the basement of the Big Progressive church. He was conspicuously washed, notably raimented, prominently polished. And, incidentally, he was very uncomfortable because of all these virtues.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A number of acquaintances greeted him contemptuously. "Hello, Jimmie! What you doin' here? Thought you was a Presperterian?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie cast down his eyes and made no reply. He was too cowed by the change. However, Homer Phelps, who was a regular patron of the Big Progressive Sunday-school, suddenly appeared and said, "Hello, Jim!" Jimmie seized upon him. Homer Phelps was amenable to Trescott laws, tribal if you like, but iron-bound, almost compulsory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hello, Homer!" said Jimmie, and his manner was so good that Homer felt a great thrill in being able to show his superior a new condition of life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You 'ain't never come here afore, have you?" he demanded, with a new arrogance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I 'ain't," said Jimmie. Then they stared at each other and manoeuvred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know my teacher," said Homer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I don't know her ," admitted Jimmie, but in a way which contended, modestly, that he knew countless other Sunday-school teachers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Better join our class," said Homer, sagely. "She wears spectacles; don't see very well. Sometimes we do almost what we like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," said Jimmie, glad to place himself in the hands of his friend. In due time they entered the Sunday-school room, where a man with benevolent whiskers stood on a platform and said, "We will now sing No. 33 — 'Pull for the shore, sailor, pull for the shore.'" And as the obedient throng burst into melody, the man on the platform indicated the time with a white and graceful hand. He was an ideal Sunday-school superintendent — one who had never felt hunger or thirst or the wound of the challenge of dishonor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie, walking carefully on his toes, followed Homer Phelps. He felt that the kingly superintendent might cry out and blast him to ashes before he could reach a chair. It was a desperate journey. But at last he heard Homer muttering to a young lady, who looked at him through glasses which greatly magnified her eyes. "A new boy," she said, in a deeply religious voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm," said Jimmie, trembling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The five other boys of the class scanned him keenly and derided his condition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We will proceed to the lesson," said the young lady. Then she cried sternly, like a sergeant, "The seventh chapter of Jeremiah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a swift fluttering of leaflets. Then the name of Jeremiah, a wise man, towered over the feelings of these boys. Homer Phelps was doomed to read the fourth verse. He took a deep breath, he puffed out his lips, he gathered his strength for a great effort. His beginning was childishly explosive. He hurriedly said,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are these."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now," said the teacher, "Johnnie Scanlan, tell us what these words mean." The Scanlan boy shamefacedly muttered that he did not know. The teacher's countenance saddened. Her heart was in her work; she wanted to make a success of this Sunday-school class. "Perhaps Homer Phelps can tell us," she remarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Homer gulped; he looked at Jimmie. Through the great room hummed a steady hum. A little circle, very near, was being told about Daniel in the lion's den. They were deeply moved at the story. At the moment they liked Sunday-school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why — now — it means," said Homer, with a grand pomposity born of a sense of hopeless ignorance — "it means — why, it means that they were in the wrong place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," said the teacher, profoundly; "it means that we should be good, very good indeed. That is what it means. It means that we should love the Lord and be good. Love the Lord and be good. That is what it means."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little boys suddenly had a sense of black wickedness as their teacher looked austerely upon them. They gazed at her with the wide-open eyes of simplicity. They were stirred again. This thing of being good — this great business of life THE PROFESSIONAL BRIGHT BOY OF THE CLASS SUDDENLY AWOKE A woman holding a bible and sitting in a Sunday school room with a group of children. Illustration by Peter Newell — apparently it was always successful. They know from the fairy-tales. But it was difficult, wasn't it? It was said to be the most heart-breaking task to be generous, wasn't it? One had to pay the price of one's eyes in order to be pacific, didn't one? As for patience, it was tortured martyrdom to be patient, wasn't it? Sin was simple, wasn't it? But virtue was so difficult that it could only be practised by heavenly beings, wasn't it?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And the angels, the Sunday-school superintendent, and the teacher swam in the high visions of the little boys as beings so good that if a boy scratched his shin in the same room he was a profane and sentenced devil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And," said the teacher, "'the temple of the Lord' — what does that mean? I'll ask the new boy. What does that mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dun'no'," said Jimmie, blankly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But here the professional bright boy of the class suddenly awoke to his obligations. "Teacher," he cried, "it means church, same as this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Exactly," said the teacher, deeply satisfied with this reply. "You know your lesson well, Clarence. I am much pleased."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other boys, instead of being envious, looked with admiration upon Clarence, while he adopted an air of being habituated to perform such feats every day of his life. Still, he was not much of a boy. He had the virtue of being able to walk on very high stilts, but when the season of stilts had passed he possessed no rank save this Sunday-school rank, this clever-little-Clarence business of knowing the Bible and the lesson better than the other boys. The other boys, sometimes looking at him meditatively, did not actually decide to thrash him as soon as he cleared the portals of the church, but they certainly decided to molest him in such ways as would re-establish their self-respect. Back of the superintendent's chair hung a lithograph of the martyrdom of St. Stephen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmie, feeling stiff and encased in his best clothes, waited for the ordeal to end. A bell pealed: the superintendent had tapped a bell. Slowly the rustling and murmuring dwindled to silence. The benevolent man faced the school. "I have to announce," he began, waving his body from side to side in the conventional bows of his kind, "that — " Bang went the bell. "Give me your attention, please, children. I have to announce that the Board has decided that this year there will be no Christmas tree, but the — "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Instantly the room buzzed with the subdued clamor of the children. Jimmie was speechless. He stood morosely during the singing of the closing hymn. He passed out into the street with the others, pushing no more than was required.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Speedily the whole idea left him. If he remembered Sunday-school at all, it was to remember that he did not like it.</field>
