      <field name="fulltext">THIS Exposition, the grandest achievement of its kind ever attempted, is under the auspices of the United States Government. The World's Columbian Exposition Company, an Illinois corporation, prepares ground and buildings, pays the runn! charge of the finances. The participants in the display include not only the forty-four states and five territories of the American nation, but also nearly every foreign government making it a wonderfully complete international affair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The city of Chicago, the chosen location, is the commercial capital of the great West, and is the second city in size on the Western Hemisphere. The growth of the city is phenomenol, and its position, at the foot of the Great Lakes, and half way between the Atlantic seaboard and the Mississippi— making it the transportation center of the United States—assures it a still greater future. Its public and private buildings are the most heroically planned, elaborately finished and extensive of any in America, while the energy and spirit of its citizens is attested to by the fact of their securing the Exposition site from her older eastern rivals.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE SITE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Exposition site includes a portion of Jackson Park and the Midway Plaisance, an area of 664 acres, with a frontage of one and one-half miles on the lake (Michigan).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Exposition buildings proper are situated in Jackson Park. Midway Plaisance, connecting Jackson Park with Washington Park, is occupied throughout its entire length by special Exposition features, largely of a foreign character. Fully one million dollars have been expended on the grounds in grading and dredging extensive waterways throughout it, in landscape gardening and the purchase of statuary, fountains, pleasure boats, observation towers, and other accessories.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The electric lighting of buildings and grounds is ten times more extensive than was employed at the Paris Exposition, and includes 138,218 electric lamps; 6,766 arc lights of 2,000 candle power each, and 131,452 of incadescent, sixteen candle power type. The total number of electric lights in use at Jackson Park is more than half the number used in all Chicago, outside the Exposition grounds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sixty-four million gallons of water per day is the available supply to buildings and grounds. The pumping works, and all the great machinery furnishing the 26,000 horse power required, are on teh grounds open to the inspection of visitors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Special features of landscape gardening art, which has here been brought to perfection, are the Basin, branching into the Grand Canal, and leading to the broad lagoons which surround the great wooded island in the center of the grounds. Go where you may, one meets the ever present water. All Exposition buildings border on Basin, Canal, Lagoon, or Lake front. The result is to dispel the languid, torrid air and add an invigorating charm to the scene. The grand effect of the ensemble is shone in the double page panoramic view which leads the illustrations of this souvenir, while a map showing the location and purpose of each building, occupies the inside back cover.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">In the construction of the buildings, about 60,000,000 feet of lumber and 18,000 tons of steel and iron have been used. In their adornment, nearly 84,000 pieces of ornamental "staff" work have been added. The total expense before the doors are thrown open to the public will not be far from twenty-five million dollars.</field>

      <field name="heading_text">THE DAIRY BUILDING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FORESTRY BUILDING COST $100,000 THE DAIRY BUILDING Illustrations of Forestry and Dairy buildings at the Chicago World's Fair wreathed in foliage and images of shrubs and trees. The two buildings have flags and many little people walking about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though comparatively small in area, covers an exhibit which, from its novelty, will attract much interest. It contains a complete ensemble of dairy products, and in addition a dairy school, in connection with which a series of tests will be conducted to determine the relative merits of each breed of cattle as milk and butter producers. The building is of plain exterior, two stories in height. The model dairy, 25x100, is on the first floor, and is provided with amphitheater seats whereon four hundred spectators can view the experimental tests. The building is provided with refrigerators and cold storage closets for the care of the dairy products, and from a café in the second story dairy fare will be dispensed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADMINISTRATION BUILDING COST $435,000 Illustrations of Administration Building and the U.S. Coast Line Battleship at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Featuring well-landscaped grounds, women with parasols and a very almost Baroque architecture. The ship is blowing steam and chugging in the water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Entering the Exposition grounds at the railway terminal station this building will be the first to greet the eye of a majority of visitors. Its lofty gilded dome is the most conspicuous object on the grounds, rising to a height of two hundred and sixty feet, the height of the famous Auditorium tower in the city of Chicago. Although comparatively small in extent—covering an area but two hundred and fifty square feet-yet it is so richly and ornately decorated, and has such a wealth of artistic design that it is pronounced the gem of the Exposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The plan of this building is four Doric pavilions of heroic proportions and eighty-four feet square, which stand at the four angles of the square, and support a great central dome one hundred and twenty feet in diameter and two hundred and twenty feet high. Four grand entrances, fifty feet wide and fifty feet high, admit the public. Above each entrance are semicircular arched vaults, and above the arches -are great screens of glass, admitting light to the central rotunda.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The whole structure is richly adorned with carvings, sculpture, paintings and stained glass. The arrangement of all is in accord with tile most artistic taste. Particularly grand is the great central dome, which rises two hundred feet above the floor. Its interior is enriched by deep molded panels, filled with low relief sculpture and by immense paintings, representing the arts and sciences. The rotunda rivals, if it does not surpass the most celebrated domes of the world.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE MACHINERY HALL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MACHINERY HALL COST $1,200,000 Fit on a piece of "parchment", illustration of Machinery hall at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition complete with palatial building, people walking, and gondolas on the canal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Next across the canal from the Agricultural Building stands the Machinery flail. The two are connected by a collonade, which affords all extensive view nearly a mile in length down the canal. This building is looted by three arched trusses, presenting the appearance in its interior of three iron railroad trainhouses joined together, Indeed, the roof is made in three distinct parts, with the intention of taking them down and selling them for trainhouses, after their usefulness as an Exposition building is past. Around the foul sides of the interior extends a gallery fifty Let wide. Down each of the long raves runs an elevated traveling crane from end to end of the building, moving platforms which make a complete circuit of the building, whereon visitors may sit and view the exhibit without exertion. The power for moving the vast amount of machinery oil exhibition is supplied from a power-house outside the building. The Machinery Hall is a large structure, and Owing to the necessity for strength, its cost is beyond that of any of the Exposition buildings except that devoted to the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts. Its ornamentations are chiefly on the side facing the grand court, where the Spanish renaissance style asserts itself, and with the collonade surrounding the canal, the fountain and obelisk rising front the water, and the gondolier's presence follows out tile Spanish-Venetian plan of the Columbian Exposition. (See view looking south over the lagoon.)</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE HORTICULTURAL BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORTICULTURAL BUILDING COST $300,000 AGRICULTURAL BUILDING COST $1,000,000 Illustrations of Horticultural and Agricultural Buildings at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Palatial buildings on the water circumnavigated by gondolas—very Venetian in style.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oil the farther shore of the lagoon, and facing for its entire length on the water, with an ornamental boat landing leading up to the grand entrance, through beautiful flower terraces for out-door exhibits, and past tanks for tile growth of semiaquatic plants, stands the building erected for the display of the world's flora. Its design is a central pavilion, With two end pavilion.,, each connected with the central one by front and rear curtains, arched with glass and forming two interior courts. These courts are planted with many varieties of ornamental shrubs and flowers arranged against all artistically painted background. Under the crystal dome, one hundred and eighty-seven feet in diameter, and rising one hundred and thirteen feet, are arranged the tallest palms, bamboo, tree ferns and other tropical productions procurable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Galleries art placed ill each pavilion. Those at either end of the building being occupied by cafés, the situation and surroundings being a particularly pleasing combination, with rest and refreshment. The cafés afford, upon three sides, a charming overlook upon the grounds, In and about this building will be exhibited almost every variety of flower, plant, vine and mail), tropical trees. Arrangements have been perfected for light, and heat if necessary, particularly adapted to each variety. The exterior walls are a pleasing pale buff color, done in "staff," and the outside terrace, sloping to the lagoon, flower strewn and crossed by promenades, makes the spot particularly attractive as a quiet resting retreat.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE AGRICULTURAL BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With low roof, constructed principally of glass, the Agricultural Building suggests the purpose for which it is intended. So far from being simple in design, however, it ranks next to the Administration Building as the most elaborate structure in the grounds. Its position, too, is most fortunate, occupying space on the opposite side of and fronting the grand basin from the Manufactures and Liberal Arts Building and shows the important consideration given America's greatest industry. The style of architecture is strictly classic. Tilt building has floor space of nine acres, and rises in one bold story, whose general cornice line is sixty-five feet above the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the main entrance art mammouth Corinthian columns fifty feet high and five feet in diameter. Passing these, one enters the vestibule, from which entrance is had to the rotunda, one hundred feet in diameter, beneath the central pavilion, which is one hundred and forty-four feet square. This is surmounted by a glass dome one hundred and thirty feet high. In addition to this central pavilion, there are others whose domes rise ninety-six feet high at the four corners of tile building, each of which covers a minor entrance, but which are dwarfed by the glory of the center. The vestibule within the main entrance is filled with statuary, specially designed to illustrate the agricultural industry, and similar designs are grouped about the corner entrances in the most elaborate manner. Above each of the corner pavilions are groups of three female figures of gigantic proportions, supporting a mammouth globe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Near by art the Forestry and Dairy Building, the saw mills and stock pens, so that the visitor from the farm or the plantation will find himself amid congenial surroundings and may well be proud of tile distinction given his calling.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE ELECTRICAL BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ELECRICAL BUILDING COST $400,000 VIEW LOOKING SOUTH OVER THE LAGOON Illustration of the palatial electrical building and illustration of rowboats, gondolas going under the foot-bridge toward the lagoon at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The home of the, to many, most novel and brilliant exhibition of all, fronts the grand court that holds the Administration Building, and extends to the lagoon. Upon one side is the Manufactures and on the opposite side is the Mines Building. The plan is of a nave extending the entire length of the building, one hundred and fifteen feet wide and one hundred and fourteen feet high. This is crossed in the middle by a transept of corresponding dimensions. A pitched roof covers both nave and transept. The extensions from these central Parts which form the parallelogram, are covered with a flat roof sixty-two feet high, provided with skylights. A series of galleries, connected across the nave by two bridges and reached from below by four grand staircases, form the second story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The exterior of the structure presents a continuous line of Corinthian pilasters forty-two feet high, supporting a deep cornice and resting upon a broad base, which together make the height above the grade sixty-eight and one-half feet. Pavilions occur at each of the four corners of the building, above which rise ornamental open towers to a height of one hundred and sixty -nine feet. A center pavilion, with double towers, occurs oh each side, and at the south front (on the court) and north front (on the lagoon) will be the elaborate granyentrances. A gigantic statue of Franklin will be placed before the South entrance, and tablet-, containing the names eminent in electrical science will be displayed upon the colonade. The material of this building has been treated to resemble marble, and the decorations composed of figures in relief have a general tendency to illustrate the purposes of the exhibit. All the latest electrical appliances will be found in operation here, and considering the fact that at the last all-American exposition,-Philadelphia, 1876,-the science was but a dream of the future the great discoveries and applications that have since been made will attract every visitor to this spot.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE FISHERIES BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FISHERIES BUILDING COST $ 200,000 TRANSPORTATION BUILDING COST $ 370,000 Illustrations of Fisheries and Transportation Buildings at the World's Columbian Exposition with canals, pedestrian bridges, gondolas, and multitudes of little people walking about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be seen that each of the great industries of America is recognized by an individual Exposition building. That devoted to the Fisheries will be a striking novelty to the visitors from the interior states, with its large reservoirs and tanks filled with their living exhibit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The plan is of a large central structure, with two smaller polygonal buildings to the right and left, corintcted with it by arcades. Its location is On tile water way which leads from the lake to the lagoon which surrounds the wooded island, and at whose month is the molt and the naval exhibit-a model of cruiser "Illinois," 70X350 feet. In the central section is the general Fisheries exhibit. One of the polygonal buildings holds the angling exhibit, and the other is devoted to aquaria. The exterior, of Spanish-Romanesque design, is covered with ornamental details of capitals, modillions, brackets and cornices, each modeled from fish or other sea forms. It is roofed with old Spanish title and is of pleasing color.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The polygonal building devoted to the aquaria is one hundred and thirty-five feet in diameter. In the center is a rotunda sixty feet in diameter, in the middle of which is a great basin or pool, twenty-six feet across, from which towers a moss and fern covered rookery. Streams of water pour from the crevices in the rocks and fall to a mass of reeds and ornamental aquatic plants in the pool below, where brilliant varieties of fish disport. A series of large tanks,—ten in number,—and possessing a water capacity of 7,000 to 27,000 gallons each, are arranged along one side of a great corridor or arcade, fifteen feet wide, and on the opposite side a line of smaller tanks, with a capacity ranging from 750 to 1,500 gallons each. The glass fronts of the aquaria contain 3,000 square feet of surface, and are in length 575 feet. The total water capacity of the tanks is 140,000 gallons. Forty thousand gallons of this is devoted to the marine exhibit, and requires a salt water reservoir and circulation of 80,000 gallons. The supply is received from the Wood's Holl (Massachusetts) station of the United States Fish Commission, where the sea water is evaporated to one-fifth its original bulk, thus increasing its density, which is restored to the original degree by the mixture of water from Lake Michigan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One side of the larger tanks may be viewed from the rotunda, and passing out of this one reaches the corridor, with the double line of tanks, from which the opposite side of the larger tanks may be seen, and the second row of smaller ones. The general exhibit illustrates the pursuit and capture of all specimens of the finny tribe from the whale to the sardine, and also the manner of breeding and propagating the food and game fish.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE TRANSPORTATION BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This building is devoted to the display of every known vehical used for transportation purposes, and for every known means of power utilized to propel them. Their classification covers a wide range: from a baby carriage to a 100-ton locomotive, and from a cash carrier or a carrier pigeon, to a balloon. Its position in the grounds is one of the group forming the northern quadrangle farthest from the lake front but facing the lagoon, and with an extensive view of the wooded island. It is more simple in general design than many buildings of its size, but withal bears many beautiful architectural details, and is rendered especially conspicuous by its "Golden Door" as the large arched main entrance is termed. This feature of the building is an immense single arch, most elaborately ornamented with carving, bas-reliefs and mural paintings, all treated with gold leaf, forming a rich and beautiful effect. Numerous minor entrances are from time to time pierced through the walls, which, with the continuous line of window arches and the glory of the "Golden Door," relieve the long facades from any, tincture of severity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cupola, placed exactly in the center of the Transportation Building, is one of the finest view points obtainable. It is reached by eight elevators and is one hundred and sixty-five feet high. The interior suggests cathedral proportions, with its long nave and aisles. The roof is formed in three divisions, the center one much higher than the others, and its walls have the same continuous line of arched windows which admit floods of light. The abundant elevator facilities permit visitors to reach, without fatigue, all parts of the building, by way of galleries at various stages of height.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In addition to the main building an enormous annex is added, covering about nine acres, wherein the heavier and more bulky exhibits will be displayed. This is but one story in height, and will contain railroad tracks at intervals of sixteen feet throughout, upon which are shown the modus operandi, of railroad equipment the making up of trains, the trial of patent devices and what not. An impossing array of locomotives will appear on dress parade daily, placed facing each other down the long central avenue. The earliest locomotives used in America and the first passenger cars hauled, form an interesting study of comparison when placed beside the modern mogul or express engine and the latest pattern vestibuled train.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE HALL OF MINES AND MINING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MINES AND MINING BUILDING COST $265,000 WOMAN'S BUILDING COST $138,000—ARCHITECT MISS SOPHIA G. HAYDEN. Illustrations of Mines and Mining and the Woman's Buildings at the World's Columbian Exposition. Two palatial buildings adorned with flags, with little people and horses walking and riding about, boats in the canal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Side by side with the Electrical Building, stands the Exhibition Hall of Mines and Mining. The building is but one story in height, the main cornice being sixty-five feet from the ground. Its design follows no arbitrary lines, but in simple and straightforward elegance it is all that a great Exposition building should be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The entrances are upon each of the four sides of the building, the principal ones upon the ends. These are each one hundred and ten feet high and thirty-two feet wide, opening into lavishly decorated vestibules eighty-eight feet high. To the right and left of each entrance interior, broad flights of steps lead to the galleries, sixty feet wide and twenty-five feet above the floor. The interior is lighted by large windows on the sides, and from above by a, high clearstory extending around the building. Decorations, illustrative of mining, are generously bestowed about, and are massed at the prominent points of the facade. Part of the mining exhibit consists of marbles of various kinds and hues, which are incorporated in the building itself, as they serve as facing for the loggias on the first floor. These loggias, or covered promenades, each twenty five feet wide and two hundred and thirty feet long, are richly decorated arcades that extend between the main entrance and the dome covered pavilions at each corner on the ground floor, and from which entrance is had to the building at several points. In addition to this there is a deeply recessed promenade on the gallery floor level, which commands a fine view of the grounds and waterways. The gathering, smelting and treatment of ores of both the precious and baser metals will be illustrated by working models. Mining machinery will be in full blast, and many valuable mine products displayed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE WOMANS' BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This graceful structure was designed by a woman, and is to be controlled entirely by the Woman's Board. It will be furnished, decorated and filled with the products of woman's hands, and stands a proud monument to the skill and executive ability of the women of America. Its position on the grounds is next north of the Horticultural Building, at a point where the lagoon forms a bay about four hundred feet in width. From the center of this bay a grand landing and staircase leads to the summit of a terrace, six feet above the water. One crosses this terrace to meet other staircases that lead to the grand triple arched entrance in the center of the principal facade, above which entrance is an open colonade in the second story. The corner pavilions have each an open colonade added above the main cornice, which will be used as a garden and open air resort, a feature not included in the plan of any building on the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A thoroughly Italian courtyard effect is produced in the interior, under the open rotunda, 70x65 feet in extent, protected by a highly ornamented skylight. This rotunda is surrounded by a two-story open arcade, through which, and from overhead, an abundance of light is admitted to all rooms facing the interior space. Opposite the main front is the library of books written by women. The Bureau of Information, statistics in regard to woman's occupations, headquarters for press correspondents, a clubroom for exhibitors and an assembly-room are some of the usages of space. One of the end pavilions,—the southern one,—is devoted to the retrospective exhibit on the first floor entire. Above stairs is a model kitchen, refreshment rooms and reception rooms, which lead to the open balcony in front. The retrospective exhibit consists of colonial relics, antique silver, old laces, fans and bric-a-brac articles. The northern pavilion contains exhibits by statistics and models, of the philanthropic, charitable and reformatory work of women all over the globe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Within the main building, to the left of the grand entrance, is located a model hospital, and to the right a model kindergarten; each occupying 80x60 feet of space. The whole exhibit is strongly suggestive of the fact that woman is the helper, comforter and rescuer of humanity, and at the same time shows her capability, genius and courage.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUILDING.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ART PALACE COST $670,000 U.S. GOVERNMENT BUILDING COST $400,000 Illustrations of Art Palace and U.S. Government Buildings at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Palatial buildings ornamented by flowers and parchment-like paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Each of the Departments of Government at Washington has been assigned space in the building erected by the United States for its exhibit. The War Department, 23,000 square feet; Treasury, 10,500 square feet; Agriculture, 23,250 square feet; Interior, 24,000 square feet ; Post Office, 9,000 square feet; Fisheries, 20,000 square feet, and Smithsonian Institute balance of space. The State Department exhibit extends from the rotunda to the east end, and that of the Department of justice from the rotunda to the west end of the building.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Government building formed one of the principal attractions at the Philadelphia exposition. Its ordnance exhibit was particularly fine, and with the National Museum to draw from, can produce relics which are of inestimable value and interest. Its position at the Columbian Exposition is between the lake shore and the lagoon, in the broad plain between the Manufactures and Fisheries Buildings, connected with the latter by a bridge. It is of classic style and resembles much the National Museum at Washington. The building is very substantially constructed of iron and glass, and has for its principal architectural feature an imposing central dome one hundred and. twenty feet in diameter and one hundred and fifty feet high, the space beneath which is clear of exhibits. Near by is the Naval Exhibit which should be classed as an annex to the Government Building, completing the departmental list; and across the narrow strait which connects the lake with the lagoon, are the buildings erected by the governments of Great Britain, Germany, and Mexico.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">THE FINE ART MUSEUM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The most valuable exhibit of all, considered from a monetary point of view, is undoubtedly to be found in the building devoted to the fine arts. Although intended for a temporary structure, it is necessarily fireproof. The main walls are of solid brick, covered with highly ornamented stucco work, whose general tone or color is light gray stone, and the roof, floors and galleries are of iron, the light being supplied by skylights in iron frames. The building is farthest removed from the general entrance to the grounds, but enjoys a most important site, for about it to the northward are grouped the various State Buildings. Its main entrances are to the north and south, the latter with a commanding water view across a terrace, which descends to the boat landing on the lagoon. The north front faces a wide lawn, just beyond which are the State Buildings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Art Museum is a pure type of refined, classic architecture. Its shape is oblong, intersected from the four sides by a great nave and transept, one hundred feet wide and seventy feet high, with a dome sixty feet in diameter in the center. This dome, one hundred and twenty-five feet in height, will be surmounted by, a collossal statue. The exhibit of sculpture is displayed upon the main floor of both nave and transept, and on either side are galleries twenty feet wide and twenty-four feet above the floor, which afford ample areas for the display of paintings and relief sculpture. There are smaller rooms for the private collections and the exhibits of the various art schools. On either side of the main building, and connected therewith by handsome corridors, are large annexes, which are also filled with various art exhibits. Four great portals give entrance to the Art Building. These are richly ornamented with architectural sculpture, and the freize of the exterior walls and the pediments of the principal entrance are replete with sculpture and bas-relief portraits of the masters of ancient art. Grouped about in the immediate neighborhood are ornamental groups of statuary. The finest examples of ancient and modern art are here displayed. Italian and Spanish old masters from the Vatican and Florentine collections, and many of the most famous paintings and statues of the day are some of the interior treasures.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ILLINOIS STATE BUILDING COST $250,000 MANUFACTURES AND LIBERAL ARTS BUILDING FROM SOUTH EAST COST $1,500,000 Illustrations of Illinois State and Manufactures and Liberal Arts Buildings at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Palatial buildings on the water ornamented with flowers, on teh water we see boats and gondolas and various crowds of people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not only is this the mammoth of the Exposition, but it is the largest exposition building ever erected. It covers thirty and one-half acres, and with its galleries contains forty acres of floor space. Its position in the grounds is most conspicuous of all the buildings, facing as it does the lake, with only lawns and promenades between, and standing at an angle with the lagoon and main basin. Within this building, corresponding to the "Main Building" of the Philadelphia Exposition, the general exhibit of manufactured goods is displayed. On the ground floor, "Columbia Avenue," fifty feet wide, extends through the great building's entire length, and an avenue of corresponding width crosses it at right angles at the center. From the floor thirty grand staircases, each with twelve feet flights, rise to the main gallery which extends around the four sides of the interior, with a uniform width of fifty feet. From it project eighty-six lesser galleries, twelve feet wide, where visitors may rest and survey the vast array of exhibits and the busy scene below. The exterior of the building is covered with "staff," made to represent marble, and has very elaborate ornamentations. The main roof of iron and glass, rises one hundred and fifty feet above the ground and arches an area of 1,400x385 feet. There are four grand entrances, designed as triumphal arches, each forty feet wide and eighty feet high, each surmounted by sculptured eagles, eighteen feet high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The whole effect of this building is a structure of magnificent proportions, a long array of colonades and arches, where every severe line is softened into harmony by tasteful ornamentation.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PIER AND CASINO 1492 COLUMBUS 1892. Images of triumphant columns and people overlooking Lake Michigan and watching boats with the Casino in the background. Above looks like a Spanish stucco chapel. Also of note is a portrait of Columbus himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Forestry Building presents a most unique appearance of any on the ground. Its prevailing architectural idea is to preserve the rustic order of things. On all four sides is a veranda, supporting the roof of which is a colonade composed of tree-trunks, contributed by various states, territories and foreign countries, each twenty-five feet in length and in their natural state, with bark preserved. Each tree-trunk which forms this colonade bears a tablet, inscribed with the common and scientific name of the wood, the state or country from which the specimen was contributed, and such information as the approximate quantity of the timber in the region from whence it came. Specimens of the most characteristic trees of each section are here. The sides of the building are covered with peeled slabs. The window frames are of rustic design, and the main entrance very elaborately finished in different woods. The roof is thatched with tan-bark, and surmounting the cornices of the veranda are numerous staffs, bearing the flags of states and nations who have entered their exhibit below.</field>
