      <field name="fulltext">1. Saga of a Wineland Baby [1] BY HAUK ERLENDSSON (ABOUT 1000) ONE summer a ship came from Norway to Greenland. The skipper's name was Thorning Karlsefni, and he was the son of Thord called "Horsehead," and a grandson of Snorri. Thorning Karlsefni, who was a very wealthy man, passed the winter there in Greenland, with Lief Ericsson. He very soon set his heart upon a maiden called Gudrid, and sought her hand in marriage. That same winter a new discussion arose concerning a Wineland voyage. [2] The people urged Karlsefni to make the bold venture, so he determined to undertake the voyage, and gathered a company of sixty men and five women. He entered into an agreement with his shipmates that they should each share equally in all the spoils. They took with them all kinds of cattle, as they intended to settle the country if they could. Karlsefni asked Lief for his house in Wineland. [3] Lief replied that he would lend it but not give it. They sailed out to sea with the ship and arrived safe and sound at Lief's booths, [4] and carried their hammocks ashore there. They were soon provided with an abundant supply of food, for a whale of good size and quality was driven ashore and they secured it. Their cattle were turned out upon the land. Karlsefni ordered trees to be felled; for he needed timber wherewith to load his ships. They gathered some of all the products of the land, grapes, all kinds of game, fish, and other good things. [5] A NORSE SHIP. Black and white illustration of a Norse ship at sea, with dolphins in foreground. In the summer after the first winter the Skrellings were discovered. [6] A great throng of men came forth from the woods; the cattle were close by and the bull began to bellow and roar with a great noise. At this the Skrellings were frightened and ran away with their packs, wherein were gray furs, sables, and all kinds of skins. They fled towards Karlsefni's dwelling and tried to get into the house, but Karlsefni caused the doors to be defended. Neither people could understand the other's language. The Skrellings put down their packs, then opened them and offered their wares, in exchange for weapons, but Karlsefni forbade his men to sell their weapons. He bade the women to carry out milk to the Skrellings; as soon as these people had tasted the milk, they wanted to buy it and nothing else. [7] Now it is to be told that Karlsefni caused a strong wooden palisade to be constructed and set up around the house. It was at this time that a baby boy was born to Gudrid and Karlsefni and he was called Snorri. [8] In the early part of the second winter the Skrellings came to them again in greater numbers than before, and brought with them the same kind of wares to exchange. Then said Karlsefni to the women, "Do ye carry out now the same thing which proved so profitable before and nothing else." The Skrellings seemed contented at first, but soon after, while Gudrid was sitting in the doorway beside the cradle of her infant son, Snorri, she heard a great crash made by one of the Skrellings who had tried to seize a man's weapons. One of Karlsefni's followers killed him for it. "Now we must needs take counsel together," said Karlsefni, "for I believe they will visit us a third time in greater numbers. Let us now adopt this plan: when the tribe approaches from the forest, ten of our number shall go out upon the cape in front of our houses and show themselves there, while the remainder of our company shall go into the woods back of our houses and hew a clearing for our cattle. Then we will take our bull and let him go in advance of us to meet the enemy." The next time the Skrellings came they found Karlsefni's men ready and fled helter-skelter into the woods. Karlsefni and his party remained there throughout the winter, but in the spring Karlsefni announced that he did not intend to remain there longer, for he wished to return with his wife and son to Greenland. They now made ready for the voyage and carried away with them much in vines and grapes and skins. [9] [1] This story was handed down by tradition for many centuries; but it describes a real settlement, the first by Europeans in America nine centuries ago. [2] I.e. to a place called Wineland. [3] Lief had already made a voyage to Wineland and built a house there. [4] The name of Lief's place. [5] The ships which had brought out the colonists were sent back with a cargo from Wineland. [6] The Skrellings were natives, probably Esquimaux or other northern tribes. [7] The Skrellings had neither cows nor goats, so that milk was a novel luxury for them.

      <field name="fulltext">2. Throngs of Children to see Columbus [10] BY CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS (1492) THIRTY-THREE days after my departure from Cadiz I reached the Indian Sea, where I discovered many islands which were thickly peopled. I took possession of these without resistance in the name of our most illustrious Monarch, [11] by a public proclamation and with unfurled banners. To the first of these islands, which is called by the Indians Guanahani, I gave the name of the blessed Saviour, San Salvador, [12] relying upon whose protection I had reached this as well as the other islands. As soon as we arrived at the great island, which I have said was named Juana, [13] I proceeded along its coast a short distance westward, and found it to be so large and apparently without termination, that I could not suppose it to be an island, but the continental province of Cathay. [14] In the meantime I had learned from some Indians whom I had seized, that that country was certainly an island: and therefore I sailed towards the east, coasting to the distance of three hundred and twenty-two miles, which brought us to the extremity of it. From this point I saw lying eastwards another island, fifty-four miles distant from Juana, to which I gave the name of Espanola. [15] All these islands are very beautiful; they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense height which retain their foliage in all seasons, I believe, for when I saw them they were as verdant and luxuriant as they usually are in Spain in the month of May. Some of them were blossoming, some bearing fruit, and all flourishing in the greatest perfection. Yet the islands are not so thickly wooded as to be impassable. The nightingale and various birds were singing COLUMBUS'S SHIPS IN FACSIMILE. Black and white illustration of a ship at sea, with the text Oceanica Classis (?) above it. in countless numbers, and that in November, the month in which I arrived there. The inhabitants are very simple and honest, and exceedingly liberal with all they have; none of them refusing anything he may possess when he is asked for it; but on the contrary inviting us to ask them. They exhibit great love towards all others in preference to themselves: they also give objects of area value for trifles, and content themselves with very little in return. I, however, forbade that these trifles and articles of no value, such as pieces of dishes, plates, and glass, keys, and leather straps should be given to them; although if they could obtain them, they imagined themselves to be possessed of the most beautiful trinkets in the world. On my arrival in the new world I took some Indians by force from the first island to which I came, in order that they might learn our language. These men are still travelling with me, and although they have been with us now for a long time, they continue to entertain the idea that I have descended from heaven. On our arrival at any new place they publish this, crying out immediately with a loud voice to the other Indians, "Come, come and look upon beings of a celestial race": upon which both women and men, children and adults, young men and old, when they get rid of the fear they at first entertain, will come out in throngs, crowding the roads to see us, some bringing food and others drink, with astonishing affection and kindness.

      <field name="fulltext">3. A Father dressed in Silk BY TWO ITALIAN GENTLEMEN (1497) LONDON, 23d August, 1497. OUR Venetian, John Cabot, who went with a small ship from Bristol to find new islands, has come back, and says that he has discovered, seven hundred leagues off, the mainland of the country of China. [17] He coasted along it for three hundred leagues, [18] and landed but did not see any people. But he has brought here to the king certain snares spread to take game, and a needle for making nets. He found some notched trees, from which he judged that people lived about there. Being in doubt, he came back to the ship. He had been away three months on the voyage, and, in returning, he saw two islands to the right; but he did not wish to land, lest he should lose time, for he was in want of provisions. The king of this country has been much pleased. [19] He has promised for another time ten armed ships such as Cabot desires, and has given him all the prisoners, except such as are confined for high treason, to go with him. [20] The king has granted him money also, with which to amuse himself till then. Meanwhile, he is with his Venetian wife and his sons at Bristol. His name is John Cabot and he is called the Great Admiral; great honor is paid to him, and he goes about dressed in silk. The English are ready to go with him, and so are many of our rascals. [21] As discoverer of these things, Cabot has planted a large cross in the ground with a banner of England, and one of St. Mark, as he is a Venetian; [22] so that our flag has been hoisted very far away. 18th December, 1497. Perhaps amidst so many occupations of your Excellency it will not be unwelcome to learn how the King of England has gained a part of Asia without drawing his sword. [23] In this kingdom there is a certain Venetian named John Cabot, of gentle disposition, very expert in navigation, who, seeing that the most serene Kings of Portugal and Spain had occupied unknown islands, wished to gain new territory for the English king. Having obtained the king's promise that he might have the lordship of the dominions which he might discover, Cabot embarked in a small vessel with a crew of eighteen persons, and set out from Bristol, a port in the western part of this kingdom. He wandered for a long time; at length he came to land, where he hoisted the royal standard, and took possession for his Highness; then, having obtained various proofs of his discovery, he returned. Since John was a foreigner and poor, he would not have been believed if the crew, who are nearly all English, and belong to Bristol, had not testified that what he said was the truth. This Cabot has the description of the world on a chart, and also on a solid sphere which he has made. On this he shows where he has been. They say that the new land is excellent and the climate is temperate; they also say that perhaps dye-wood and silk grow there. They affirm that the sea is full of fish which are taken not only with a net, but also with a basket, which has a stone fastened to it in order to keep it in the water. This I have heard John Cabot himself say. People look upon him as a prince. [24] [17] John Cabot was sent out by Henry VII, King of England, and this was the first English voyage to America. [18] A league = three miles. [19] Henry VII of England. [20] I.e. let Cabot take them as seamen, so as to relieve the crowded English prisons. [21] Rascals = poor men.

      <field name="fulltext">4. The Name America [25] BY HYLACOMYLUS (1507) AND the fourth part of the world having been discovered by Americus, it may be called Amerige; that is, the land of Americus or America. Now truly, since these regions are more widely explored, and another fourth part is discovered by Americus Vesputius, as may be learned from the following letters, I do not see why any one may justly forbid it to be named Amerige, that is, Americ's Land, after Americus the discoverer, who is a man of sagacious mind; or call it America, since both Europa and Asia derived their names from women. [25] The first man to suggest the name of America was a German schoolmaster whose name means "Miller of the Wood Pond." Really Americus Vespucius discovered very little, and does not deserve to have the continents named for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5. How to find an Ocean BY ANTONIO HERRERA (1513) BALBOA, having resolved to march over to the South Sea, and having provided all things necessary for it, set out from Darien in the beginning of September, 1513. [26] He went by sea as far as the land of the Cacique Careta. There he left the brigantines and the canoes and advanced towards the mountain. Careta who was friendly to him commanded some of his subjects to attend Balboa. A neighboring Cacique, Ponca, by name, who had spies abroad, was informed that the Spaniards were coming up his mountain, and hid himself in an out of the way part of his territory. Balboa sent some of the Careta Indians to assure him that he was doing no harm but would be his friend as he was Careta's. So Ponca came, bringing a present of gold. Balboa received him with much joy because he did not wish to leave an enemy behind. He gave him an abundance of beads, looking glasses, and some iron axes. In return, Balboa demanded of Ponca some guides and men to carry burdens. The Cacique [27] granted all he desired, and gave him plenty of provisions. Then Balboa proceeded to the top of the mountain whence he had been told that the other sea might be seen. From Ponca's land to the top was about six days' journey; but they spent twenty-five days because of the roughness of the land, and because they were short of provisions. At length they arrived at the top of the high mountain, on the twenty-fifth of September, 1513 , whence the sea could be seen. Balboa was given notice a little while before they came to the top that they were very near it. Commanding all to halt there, Balboa went up alone and saw the South Sea; then, with uplifted hands and on his knees, he returned thanks to heaven for being the first who had seen this sea. After performing this act of devotion he called his men and repeated the same, and they followed his example, while the Indians stood amazed to see them so overjoyed. Balboa praised Camegra's son for giving him this news, and promised all his followers much wealth and happiness. They all believed him, for he was very much beloved because he made no difference between himself and the common soldiers, He always showed sympathy for the sick and wounded, every one of whom he visited and comforted. He was himself undaunted in dangers, never showing the least fear in the greatest perils. Balboa next ordered that a certificate should be drawn of his taking possession of that sea and all that was in it for the Crown of Castile; [28] as a testimony of this he cut down trees, raised crosses and heaps of stones, and cut the name of the King of Spain on some of the trees. He then resolved to go down the mountains to observe what there was on them and on the sea-coast. He sent Captain Francis Pizarro to view the sea-coast and the country round about. [29] John Escaray and Alonzo Martin, with twelve men each, he sent to find the shortest way to this sea. Alonzo Martin hit upon the shortest road and in two days came to a place where he found two canoes upon dry land, yet saw no sea; but whilst he was considering how those canoes were up on the land, the sea water came in and lifted them up about a fathom in height; [30] for upon that coast the sea ebbs and flows every six hours, two or three fathoms, so that great ships are left dry and no sea water appears for half a league at least. Alonzo Martin, seeing the canoes begin to swim, went into one of them and bid his companions to bear witness that he was the first to enter the South Sea. Another man whose name was Atienza did the like and bid them bear witness that he was the second. They returned to Balboa with the news, which made them all rejoice. [31] [26] The South Sea, which we call the Pacific Ocean, which washed the eastern shores of India and China, was what most of the early European Explorers set out to find. Balboa, a Spanish officer, had heard from a native chief that there was a great sea across the mountains. [27] Cacique = chief. [28] The state of Castile was a part of Ferdinand's Spanish kingdom. [29] We shall meet Pizarro again presently. [30] The tide rose a fathom—that is, 6 feet. [31] Nobody then guessed that there was an opening south of the land, by which they could sail into the Pacific Ocean.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6. A Room Full of Gold BY FRANCISCO XERES (1533) GOVERNOR PIZARRO received news from the natives that the way to Cuzco passed through very populous districts which were rich and fertile; [32] that there was an inhabited valley called Caxamalca ten or twelve days' journey from the settlement where Atahuallpa, the greatest lord among these natives, resided. [33] When Atahuallpa had come to the province of Caxamalca years before he found it to be so rich and pleasant that he settled there and continued to conquer other lands from thence. This lord was held so much in dread, that the natives of the valley did not dare to leave his service for the service of the king of Spain; so they told the Christians and their leader, Governor Pizarro, that a small detachment of Atahuallpa's army would be sufficient to kill all the Christians. Governor Pizarro thereupon resolved to march in search of Atahuallpa to reduce him to the service of the king of Spain and to win over the surrounding countries. The Governor departed from the city of San Miguel in search of Atahuallpa on the twenty-fourth of September, 1532. [34] He arrived at the town of Caxamalca two months later at the hour of vespers. In the middle of the town there was a great open space surrounded by walls and houses. The Governor occupied this position and sent a messenger to Atahuallpa to announce his arrival, to arrange a meeting, and in order that he might show him where to lodge; meanwhile he ordered the town to be examined with a view to discovering a strong position where he might pitch his camp. He ordered all the troops to be stationed in the open space and the cavalry to remain mounted until it was seen whether Atahuallpa would come. This town, which is the principal place in the valley, is situated on the edge of a mountain, with an open plain in front of it. Two rivers flow through the valley, which is level and well peopled with about two thousand inhabitants. Near the entrance there are two bridges because two rivers flow past: The plaza [35] is larger than any in Spain, surrounded by a wall and entered by two doorways which open upon the streets of the town. The houses are more than two hundred paces in length, very well built, being surrounded by strong walls, three times the height of a man. [36] The roofs are covered with straw and wood, the interiors are divided into eight rooms, much better than any we had seen before. Their walls are of well cut stones, and each lodging is surrounded by a wall of masonry with doorways, and has its fountain of water in an open court brought from a distance by pipes for the supply of the house. Atahuallapa feared that the Spaniards would kill him, so he told Governor Pizarro that he would give his captors a great quantity of gold and silver. [37] The Governor asked him: "How much can you give and in what time ?" Atahuallapa said: "I will give gold enough to fill a room twenty-two feet long and seventeen wide up to a white line which is half way up the wall. The height will be once and a half that of a man's stature." Atahuallapa also said, that up to that mark he would fill the room with different kinds of golden vessels, such as jars, pots, vases, besides lumps and other pieces. As for silver, he said that he would fill a whole chamber with it twice over. He undertook to do this in two months. Governor Pizarro told him to send off messengers for this purpose, and that when it was accomplished he need have no fear. Then Atahuallapa sent messages to his captains who were in the city of Cuzco, ordering them to send two thousand Indians, laden with gold and silver. After some days, several of the family of Atahuallapa arrived. There was his brother, who came from Cuzco, and sisters and wives. The brother brought many vases, jars, and pots of gold and much silver, and he said that there were more on the road; but that as the journey was long, the Indians who were bringing the treasure became tired and could not come so quickly, but that every day more gold and silver would arrive . And it came. On some days twenty thousand, on others fifty or sixty thousand pesos of gold arrived. [38] The Governor ordered it to be put in the house where Atahuallapa had his guard, and to be stored there until he had accomplished what he had promised. SPANIARD IN ARMOR. Black and white illustration of a man with upper-body armor, with hand on sword. And so the gold was delivered to the Christians by little and little and slowly, because it was necessary to employ many Indians who had to go from village to village to collect it. [39] The Governor ordered the pieces of gold to be counted, and the gold vessels and plates to be melted down and weighed. It was found that there was over three million pesos of good gold. Of this, Governor Pizarro had as his share two hundred thousand pesos of gold and fifty thousand of silver. The "royal fifth" was set aside for the Spanish king. All the rest was divided among all the conquerors who had accompanied Governor Pizarro, and the men who had been friendly to them during the expedition. Thus every one of Pizarro's helpers in the country received something out of this room full of gold. [40] [32] Pizarro was a Spanish officer who had got permission from Spain to conquer the region in South America which we call Peru. Cuzco was the native capital. [33] Atahuallpa was king of the natives. [34] Pizarro had only 213 men and 63 horses. [35] Plaza = the Spanish name for public square. [36] A pace is about three feet. [37] A great battle between Atahuallapa's forces and Pizarro's took place, in which Atahuallapa was taken prisoner. Throughout his captivity he was kindly treated, but he felt uneasy about his safety. [38] A peso = a dollar. [39] Worth about $17,500,000 in our money. The Spanish king demanded a certain fixed share of treasures found in the new world. [40] Having got the gold, Pizarro murdered Atahuallpa, and enslaved the people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7. Buried in the Mississippi BY A PORTUGUESE GENTLEMAN OF ELVAS (1542) CAPTAIN DE SOTO was the son of a Spanish squire. He went into the Spanish Indies when Peter Arias was governor of the West Indies. [41] There he was without anything of his own save his sword and shield. For his good qualities and valor, Peter Arias made him captain of a troop of horsemen, and by his own command De Soto went with Fernando Pizarro to the conquest of Peru. Afterwards the Spanish Emperor made him governor of the Isle of Cuba and President of Florida, with the title of Marquis over a certain part of the lands which he might conquer. On Sunday, the eighteenth day of May, in the year 1539, President De Soto departed from Havana in Cuba with his fleet, which consisted of nine vessels, five great ships, two caravels and two brigantines. [42] They sailed for seven days with a prosperous wind. On Friday they landed on the western coast of Florida. De Soto left Captain Caldero there with thirty horsemen and seventy footmen with provisions for two years. Then he himself with all the rest of his men marched into the mainland in search of the "Great River"; and after many adventures they found the river; but the natives were hostile and the country was poor. After many weary and dangerous marches, the governor fell into great dumps to see how hard it was to get down the Mississippi to the sea. It seemed even worse, because the number of his men and horses was every day diminished, as they could not find enough food to sustain them in this country. Discouraged by that thought De Soto fell sick. Before he took his bed, he sent an Indian to the cacique at Quigalta to tell him that he, Fernando De Soto, was the Child of the Sun, and that all the way on his journey thither, all men had obeyed and served him; that he requested him to accept of his friendship, and come to him, for he should be very glad to see him; and in sign of love and obedience to bring something with him of that which in his country was most prized. The cacique answered by the same Indian, saying that whereas De Soto said that he was the Child of the Sun, if he would dry up the Great River he would believe him; and touching the rest, that he was wont to visit none; but rather that all those of whom he had notice did visit him, served, obeyed, and paid him tributes willingly or perforce. Therefore, if De Soto desired to see him, it were best he should come to his place. That if he came in peace, he would receive him with special good will. Or if De Soto came in war, even then the chief told him to come and find the Indians in the town where, they were, adding, that for De Soto or any other person he would not shrink one foot back. By the time the Indian returned with this answer, the governor had betaken himself to bed, very ill with fever and much grieved that he was not able to pass over the river and seek this cacique to see if he could lessen that pride of his. But the current of the river was very strong in those parts, where it was nearly half a league broad and sixteen fathoms deep. [43] On both sides there were many Indians, and his power was not now so great but that he had need to help himself when he could by flight rather than by force. Before he could do either, on the twenty-first of May, in the year 1542, Don Fernando De Soto, the valorous, virtuous, and valiant captain, Governor of Cuba, and President of Florida, departed out of this life. He departed in such a place and at such a time that during his sickness he had had but little comfort, and the danger wherein all his people found themselves of perishing in that strange country, is the reason why they did not visit nor stay with him as they ought to have done. Luys de Moscoso [44] determined to conceal this death from the Indians because Fernando De Soto had made them believe that the Christians were immortal; and, since they had considered him to be hardy, wise, and valiant, Moscoso feared that if they should know that he was dead they would be bold to set upon the Christians, even if the Spaniards tried to live peaceably among them. As soon as De Soto was dead, therefore, Luys de Moscoso commanded the men to put him in a house secretly. Here he remained for three days. Removing him thence, Moscoso commanded them to bury him in the night at one of the gates of the town just within the wall. As the Indians had seen De Soto sick and had missed him, they suspected what had happened. Passing by the place where he was buried and seeing the earth disturbed, they looked and spoke one to another. Luys de Moscoso, understanding it, gave the order that De Soto should be taken up by night and a great deal of sand cast into the mantles wherein he was wrapped. Then De Soto was carried in a canoe and thrown into the midst of the Great River. The cacique of Guachaya inquired for him, demanding what was become of his brother, the governor. Luys de Moscoso told him that he had gone to heaven as he had many other times, and because he was to stay there certain days, he had left him in his place. The cacique still thought that the governor was dead, and commanded two young and well proportioned Indians to be brought thither, praying Luys to command them to be beheaded that they might attend and serve his lord and brother after his death. Luys told him that the governor was not dead but had gone to heaven and that he had taken such of his own Christian soldiers as he needed away with him; but the Indians believed nothing of what he said. [45] [41] This is one of the unsuccessful expeditions made by the Spaniards. De Soto expected to find gold as Pizarro had done. [42] Caravel = a four masted ship. [43] A mile and a half wide and hundred feet deep. [44] Next in command in the expedition. [45] A small remnant of the proud expedition, at last escaped to the sea. Neither De Soto's pride nor Moscoso's lies helped them.</field>

[47] They have also some garments of feathers, finely sewed and fastened together. In summer they wear the hairy side of the skins outward, and in winter they wear four or five thicknesses with the hairy sides turned inward. These people are by nature subtle and sharp-witted, ready to understand our meaning by signs and make answers that can be well understood. If they have not seen the thing whereof we ask, they will wink or cover their eyes with their hands as if to say it had been hid from sight. If they do not understand what you ask them, they will stop their ears. They are willing to teach us the names of anything in their language which we desire to know, and are quick to learn anything of us. They delight in music and will keep time and stroke to any tune which we may sing, both with their voice, head, hands, and feet, and will sing the same tune after us. They live in caves in the earth and hunt for their dinners just as the bears and other wild beasts do. They eat raw flesh and fish. On the twenty-first of August the captain of our ship sent a boat on shore for wood with six of our men who had friendly dealings with these Esquimaux. After that, they beckoned us on shore several times to play foot-ball with them, and some of our company went on shore to play with them; but nimble as they were, as often as they struck at the ball our men won the game. [46] That is, of two ports of the northern lands visited by English explorers. [47] The Esquimaux still wear such garments.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">9. The Joke of the Pilot's Boy [48] BY FRANCIS PRETTY (1578) FROM thence we went to a certain port called Tarapaca, where we landed and found by the seaside a Spaniard lying asleep. Beside him there lay thirteen bars of silver, which we took, leaving the man. Not far from thence we went on land for fresh water, and met a Spaniard and an Indian boy driving eight lames, or Peruvian sheep, which were as big as donkeys; each one of these sheep had on his back two bags of leather, each bag containing fifty pounds of fine silver. So we brought both the sheep and their burden to the ship and found we had obtained eight hundred weight of fine silver. From here we sailed to a place called Arica. When we entered port we found three small brigs which we rifled, and found in one of them fifty-seven wedges of silver, each of them weighing about twenty pounds weight. In these brigs we did not find a single person, for all had gone ashore to the town, which consisted of about twenty houses. If our company had been larger we would have rifled the town, but our general contented himself with the spoils of the ships, put off to sea again, and set sail for Lima. To Lima we came on the thirteenth of February, and entering port, we found there about twelve ships lying fast moored to their anchors, their sails having been carried on shore. Their captains and the merchants felt most secure here, never having been assaulted by the negroes. Our general rifled these ships and found in one of them a chest full of plate and good store of silks and linen cloth. This chest he took to his own ship. [49] While he was on board this ship he got news of another ship, called the Spitfire, laden with treasure: hereupon we stayed there no longer, but cutting all the cables of the enemies' ships in the haven, we left them drift whither they would, either to sea or to shore, and with all speed we followed the Spitfire towards Paita. Before we arrived there, the Spaniards shot out again towards Panama. Our general speedily pursued. But we met a brig laden with ropes and tackling; we boarded and searched it until we found a quantity of gold and golden crucifixes set with large emeralds. Thence we departed, still following the Spitfire. and our general promised the company that whosoever should first descry her should have his reward of gold for his good news. It happened that John Drake, going up to the top, descried her at about three o'clock. About six o'clock we came to her, shot at her with three pieces of ordnance, and struck down her mizzenmast. [50] Next we entered the boat and found in her great riches, such as jewels, precious stones, thirteen chests of fine plate, four-score pound weight of gold, and twenty-six tons of silver. The place where we took this prize was called Cape de San Francisco, about one hundred and fifty leagues from Panama. [51] The name of the pilot of this ship was Francisco. He owned two fair gilt bowls of silver which our General found, and said: "Signor Pilot, [52] you have here two silver cups, I must needs have one of them." The pilot, because he could not choose otherwise, yielded, giving one to the General and the other to the steward of our ship. When the pilot left us, his boy said to our General: "Captain, our ship shall be called no more the Spitfire, but the Spittreasure, and your ship shall be called the Spitfire." This bright speech of the pilot's boy made us all laugh, both then and long after. [48] Although England was not formally at war with Spain, Sir Francis Drake made a voyage around the world during the years 1577 1580, with the purpose of capturing Spanish vessels and towns; and Queen Elizabeth refused to punish him. The Spaniards had never before seen an enemy in the Pacific Ocean. The places mentioned here are on the west coast of South America. [49] It is plain that Drake was little better than a common pirate, robbing innocent people right and left. [50] Ordnance = cannon. [51] Not San Francisco, California; though Drake went there later. Signor = the Spanish word for sir. [52] The General was Drake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10. Far, Far at Sea BY THE REV. FRANCIS HIGGINSON (1629) [53] THE names of the five ships were as follows: — The first was called the Talbot, a good and strong ship of three hundred tons and nineteen pieces of ordnance, with a crew of thirty mariners. This ship carried more than a hundred planters, [54] six goats, five great pieces of ordnance, with all manner of ammunition and provisions for the Plantation for a twelfth-month. [55] The second ship was called the George. This also was a strong ship of about three hundred tons, with a crew of thirty mariners. Her general cargo was of cattle, twelve mares, thirty cows, and some goats. She had fifty-two planters on board. The third ship was called the Lion's Whelp, and was a nimble ship of one ' hundred and twenty-two tons, carrying many mariners and over forty planters with provisions. The fourth ship was called the Four Sisters. The fifth ship was called the Mayflower. [56] This did carry both passengers and provisions. A SHIP AMONG FLYING FISH. Black and white illustration of a ship at sea with fish "flying" as high as the sails. The George having some special urgent reasons for hastening her passage set sail before the rest, about the middle of April. We who took ship in the Talbot and the Lion's Whelp hoisted sail from Gravesend on Saturday, the 25th of April. [57] On Tuesday, a week later, we entered the channel early in the morning, and passed by Portsmouth very slowly for the wind was weak and calm. [58] In the afternoon the wind slackened and we were forced to anchor, a little this side of Cowes Castle, where I and my wife and daughter Mary, the two mates, and some others with us obtained leave from the master of the ship to go ashore to wash our linen, but the wind turning when we were absent, they hoisted sail and left us there at Cowes. [59] Wednesday, early in the morning a shallop was sent from the ship to fetch us to Yarmouth, [60] but the weather proved rough and our women desired to be set on shore at a point three miles short of Yarmouth, and the rest of the way we went on foot, and then regained the ship. The next Sabbath being the first Lord's Day on which we had been at sea we were disturbed in our morning services by the charge of a man-of-war. [61] The captain of this ship finding us too strong for him durst not venture to assail us, but made off. This day, my two children, Samuel and Mary, began to be sick of the small pox, which was brought into the ship by one Mr. Brown who was sick with the small pox at Gravesend. [62] By Tuesday, towards night, my daughter grew sicker. She died by five o'clock that night, and was the first of our ship to be buried in the great Atlantic Sea. By the following Saturday we were comforted with the hope that my son Samuel would get well. One morning while we were at prayers, a strong sudden blast of wind came from the south, stirred up the waves and tossed us more than ever before. Towards night the wind abated by little and little until it was calm. Mr. Goffe's great dog, that fell overboard during the gale, could not be recovered. On Wednesday, just two months [63] after we left our English port, we had a clear sight of America, and of Cape Sable which was seven or eight leagues to the south. [64] On the sea about us we saw yellow gilly-flowers. [65] About the afternoon of the next day we had a clear sight of many islands and hills by the seashore. We saw an abundance of mackerel, and a great store of whales puffing up water as they went by our ship. Their enormous size astonished those of us who had not seen them before; their backs appeared like small islands. Friday, after the fog cleared, we saw many schools of mackerel on every side of our ship. . The sea was abundantly stored with rock-weed and yellow flowers. By noon we were within three leagues of Cape Ann; and as we sailed along the coast we saw every hill and dale and every island full of great woods and high trees. The nearer we came to the shore the more flowers we saw, sometimes scattered abroad, sometimes joined in sheets nine or ten yards long. Towards night, we came near the harbor of Salem, whither we were bound. [53] Higginson called this narrative "The true story of the voyage to New England, made during the last summer. Begun on the 25th April, 1629." [54] Planters =settlers. [55] Plantation = settlement or colony. [56] This is not the celebrated voyage of the Mayflower to Plymouth; that had been nine years earlier.

      <field name="fulltext">11. The Ship and the Indians BY EDWARD JOHNSTON (1628) THE whole Indian nation of Massachusetts was frightened at a ship that arrived in the bay, for they had never seen one before. [66] They themselves report that when some Indians saw a great thing moving toward them upon the waters, wondering what creature it could be, they ran with their light canoes from place to place, and stirred up all their countrymen to come forth and behold this monstrous thing. At this sudden news the shores for many miles were filled with the people of this unclothed nation. They gazed at this wonder till some of the bravest among them manned their canoes. [67] INDIANS CANOEING. Black and white illustration of a long canoe: a man stands at each end paddling, while two men in the center sit near (apparently) a fire. Armed with bows and arrows, they approached within bow shot of the ship, and let fly their long arrows at her. These were headed with bone and some stuck fast in the wood. Others dropped into the water. The Indians wondered that the ship did not cry out, but kept moving quietly on toward them, and that its passengers made no defence. All of a sudden the master caused a cannon to be fired. This struck such fear into the poor Indians that they hurried to shore, and their wonder was greatly increased. Once again the great crowd of Indians waited with amazement to see the outcome. The seamen furled up their sails and came to anchor, then manned their long boat, and went ashore. At their approach most of the Indians fled, but some saw that the newcomers were men, who made signs to stop their flight, in order that they might trade with the natives. For that purpose the newcomers had brought some copper kettles, and the Indians by degrees made their approach nearer and nearer. Then they saw clearly the kettles which had been set forth before them. The Indians knocked on them and were much delighted with the sound. They were much more astonished to see that they would not break, although they were so thin. To obtain those kettles the Indians brought the white men many beaver skins. They loaded the strangers richly according to their wishes. [66] The Massachusetts settlement was made by a rich corporation, which could send over hundreds of people at a time.

      <field name="fulltext">12. The Ship in the Air [68] OVER the harbor of New Haven appeared, in the evening, the form of a ship with three masts. Suddenly all the tackling and sails were to be seen. Shortly after, upon the ship there appeared a man, standing with one arm akimbo under his left side; and holding in his right hand a sword stretched out towards the sea. Then from the side of the ship which was toward the town arose a great smoke, which covered all the ship; and in that smoke she vanished away. But some saw her keel sink into the water. This was seen by many men, women, and children, and it lasted about a quarter of an hour. The unhappy mourners of relatives lost in a ship nearly two years before, tried to find some connection between the ship in the air and their own sufferings. In the gloomy and sad state of their minds they tried to find some meaning in the strange appearance. There are many accounts of this air-ship. One says: "After the failure of news of their ship from England, prayers, both public and private, were offered by the distressed people. They prayed that the Lord would, if it was His pleasure, let them hear what He had done with their dear friends, and that He would help them to bow humbly to His holy will. "Then a great thunder storm arose out of the northwest, and a ship was seen sailing against the wind. The very children cried out, 'There's a brave ship.' The air-ship remained before their eyes and came up as far as there was water for such a vessel. It came so near to some persons, that they thought a man might throw a stone on board her." The people were so sure and satisfied that they had seen the ship that they believed that God, for the quieting of their troubled hearts, had been willing to send this wonderful ship to tell of what He had done to those for whom so many prayers had been made. [68] This wonderful appearance was probably a mirage, or image of a very distant ship.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">13. Treasure at the Bottom of the Sea BY COTTON MATHER (1692) [69] CAPTAIN WILLIAM PHIPS frequently told his wife that he would yet be captain of a king's ship, and that he should be the owner of a fair brick house in the green land north of Boston. [70] One year Captain Phips arrived with a ship and a tender at Port de la Platta. [71] There he made a stout canoe of a stately cotton tree, large enough to carry eight or ten persons. In doing this he used his own hand and adze and endured no little hardship, living out of doors in the woods many nights together. With this canoe he had his men explore the reefs of shoals thereabouts for they rise to within two or three feet of the surface of the sea, and are so steep that a ship striking on them would immediately sink. Captain Phips had dragged from an old Spaniard in a previous voyage a few facts about this spot, which was supposed to be the very spot where a wreck lay. This wreck was supposed to hold a great treasure. One day after the men in the canoe were returning to Captain Phips and his large boat with bad news about their day's search, one of the men, looking over the side of the canoe into the calm water, spied a sea feather growing, as he judged, out of a rock. He bade one of the Indians to dive down and fetch this feather that they might carry home something with them. The diver who brought up the feather brought also a surprising story. He said that he saw a number of great guns down in the watery land where he found the feather. That report of these guns astonished the whole company exceedingly, and at once turned their discouragement for their ill-success into assurances that they had now come to the true spot of ground for which they had been looking. Upon further diving the Indian fetched up a lump of silver worth perhaps two or three hundred pounds. [72] They prudently marked the spot with a buoy, that they might find it readily again. Then they went back to their captain, who for some time had despaired of anything but bad news. They gave a similar report now, meanwhile slipping the lump of silver under the table where the captain was sitting. After hearing him express his determination to wait patiently they pushed the lump to the spot where he was, then he cried out: "Why, what is this?" With changed countenances the men told him how and where they had got it. Then said Captain Phips: "Thanks be to God. We are made." So away they went, all hands to work. Now most happily they first fell upon that ruined wreck where the bullion had been stored, and they prospered so in this "New Fishery" that in a little while they brought up thirty-two tons of silver; for now it had come to measuring silver by tons. [73] Thus once again there came into the light of the sun a treasure which had been groaning under the waters for half a hundred years. In this time there had grown upon the plate a crust like limestone seven inches thick. Besides this incredible treasure of plate in various forms, they fetched up from seven or eight fathoms of water vast riches of gold, pearls and jewels. [74] [69] Cotton Mather was one of the greatest New England ministers. [70] Phips was a Massachusetts trader. [71] Now Buenos Ayres. [72] $1000 to $1500 [73] This find was worth about a million dollars. [74] For this feat Phips was made "Sir William Phips" by the king of England.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">14. A Pirate's Pastimes [75] BY ESQUEMELIN (1666) BEFORE the pirates go to sea, they give notice to all concerned of the day on which they are to sail. They oblige each man to bring so many pounds of powder and gunballs. When all have come aboard they decide where to get food, especially meat; for they eat scarcely anything else. Sometimes they rob such and such hog-yards, where the Spaniards often have a thousand hogs together. They come to these places in the night. They surround the keeper's house and force him to get up and give them as many hogs as they wish to have. They threaten to kill him if he will not obey or if he makes any noise. When they have meat enough for their trip they return to their ship. When well supplied with food, they begin to plan where they will go to seek their fortunes. These pirates keep very good order among them. selves. They are very polite and kind to each other, so that if any one wants what another has, he very willingly gives it to him. [76] There was one noted pirate who lived afterwards at Jamaica. He did many surprising things. His real name was not known. His companions called him Rache Brasiliano because he had long lived in Brazil. He joined the pirates and was liked so much that they made him captain. In a few days he took a great ship coming from New Spain. [77] It had a great quantity of gold and silver on board which he carried to Jamaica. For this the pirates thought very highly of him. But in his private affairs he governed himself very poorly. He would sometimes appear brutal and foolish when in drink, running up and down the streets and beating or injuring those he met. No person dared to oppose him. Once while on a journey with his men, all were very hungry and thirsty; for it was a desert place. FREEBOOTERS' PASTIMES. Black and white illustration: in foreground, men step from a boat to land; elsewhere a man holds another at knife point; various figures fight with swords; in background, the town burns. They were chased by a troop of a hundred Spaniards. Brasiliano seeing their danger encouraged his companions by telling them that they were better soldiers than the Spaniards and ought, at least, to die with their arms in their hands fighting, like men of courage. That, he said, would be better than to surrender to the Spaniards who would take away lives with torments. The pirates were but thirty in number, yet seeing their brave captain show such courage they resolved to do the same. So they faced the troop of Spaniards, and discharged their guns at them so well that they killed one horseman with almost every shot. The fight lasted an hour; then the Spaniards were put to flight. The pirates took from the dead what was most useful. Captain Henry Morgan was another noted pirate He was born in England. His father was a rich farmer of good rank. When Morgan was young he had no wish to be a farmer. So he left his own country, and found two pirates ready to go to sea; and he went with them. He learned their manner of living so exactly that he became in time a pirate captain. Finally he had twelve ships with seven hundred fighting men. They decided to attack the town of Puerto de Principe. It was at a distance from the sea, and had never been plundered by any pirates and they knew that the people living there were rich. Captain Morgan and his men set sail, steering towards Puerto de Principe. [78] When they came into its bay, a Spaniard who was a prisoner aboard the pirate ships swam ashore by night to the town and told its people of the plan of the pirates. This he had overheard in their talk while they thought he did not understand English. Upon hearing this the Spaniards began to hide their riches and carry away their movables. The governor gathered together all the men of the town and took a stand where the pirates would be obliged to pass. He commanded many trees to be cut down and laid across their path to hinder their passing, when the pirates arrived. The Spaniards charged them very bravely for a while, but the pirates were very skilful with their guns. The governor with many of his companions was killed, and the Spaniards fled into the woods to save themselves. But before they could reach it, most of them were killed by the pirates. Many people upon seeing the pirates in the town, shut themselves up in their houses, and from them shot at the pirates. The pirates then threatened them saying, "If you do not give up willingly you shall soon see the town in flames.; Your wives and children also will be killed before your faces." At these threats the Spaniards surrendered. As soon as the pirates got possession of the town, they shut up all the men, women and children and slaves in several churches. They stole everything they could find. They also searched the country round about, bringing in daily many goods and prisoners and much food. Then they had a merry time as is their way. They did not remember the poor prisoners, but gave them nothing to eat so that nearly all died of their misery. [79] [75] Pirates or sea-robbers were the curse of their times; and there are still some of them in the seas east of Asia. Many good ships were destroyed by them, and thousands of people killed, for the small gain to be had from plundering vessels and passengers of their valuables. Sometimes they landed and sacked towns. [76] This does not seem very likely, many times they fought with each other. [77] New Spain = the Spanish possessions in the new world. [78] On the island of San Domingo. To be attacked by pirates was exactly like being attacked by a horde of furious wild beasts, except that no wild animals could be so cruel as men. [79] The pirates got away with their booty, but at a later attack on another Spanish town, Morgan and his followers were beaten by the Spaniards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">15. The Privateers' Attack [80] BY JOHN FONTAINE (1708) WITH a constant apprehension of attack before us, we lived on the qui vive from the first day of June, 1704, until the eighth day of October, 1708, when, with all our precautions, we were actually taken by surprise. A French privateer entered the harbor during the night, and anchored off Bear Haven, about five miles from my house, and entirely out of our sight. She hoisted English colors by way of deception. She succeeded in her wish, for the officer no sooner discovered her, than he concluded she was a vessel just arrived from America, and went down with two or three soldiers of his company. He was in great haste to be the first to board her, in order to regale himself with rum punch, a beverage of which he was unhappily much too fond. He was made a prisoner the instant his foot touched the deck of the vessel, but the captain and the officers behaved towards him with the greatest civility. He was a little shocked at first, but they made him so very welcome, treating him to the best of wine and brandy, that he soon lost the remembrance of his situation. He gave the captain all the information he wanted, and it was of a nature to encourage him to proceed. He told him that the soldiers were dispersed without any commander, for the captain and lieutenant were both absent, as well as himself. He was sure it would be very easy to surprise my house, for I had no one near enough to help me but my own family. Upon the strength of this information, the captain prepared for going ashore, and sent eighty men in three boats, commanded by two lieutenants. They quitted the ship at midnight, and landed before it was light. They commenced their march about daybreak, in perfect silence, and stooping very low, in order that they might be neither seen nor heard. An Irish servant who was fetching home the cows was the first person to discover them, marching in good order, and only the distance of a long musket shot from the house. He ran home as fast as he could, and cried out that we were lost, for a number of armed men were in sight. PORTRAIT OF A PIRATE. Black and white illustration: a portrait of a man, with the text Sr. HEN: MORGAN beneath. We got up directly, and I ordered every door to be shut, but there was so much confusion that the gates of the large court in front, and even the house door below the tower were forgotten and left open for some time. This was perceived by the enemy as we afterwards learned; but it was supposed to have been done on purpose as a feint, and that we must have a loaded cannon within ready to fire if any one approached. When the men were near enough to hear me, I hailed them through a speaking-trumpet. I told them if they were friends to stop, and let us know who they were, and if enemies, to come forward, and we would receive them with vigor. In the meantime my children were busily engaged loading our arms and putting them in order. The men continued to advance. I ordered my son James to fire upon them from a garret window with our largest gun, which was six feet long. This made them lower their heads; they then separated into six detachments and took various posts. Some of them, under cover of hedges and ditches, contrived to get round to the back of the house. They had determined to root us out this time, for their first act was to set fire to the malt-house, which was towards the east, then to the stacks of hay, straw and grain which were at the north and east, and after that to the cow-house, stable, and long fish-press which were at the west of my house. These were all very combustible. In less than half an hour we were encompassed with flames on every side but one. By reason of the fire and smoke between them and us, we were unable to see our enemies, and we suffered much from the smoke, which found its way to us through every crevice. I ordered the servants to put water in every tub and bucket that could be found, and then immerse sheep-skins with wool upon them, and ox-skins, of both which we had many in the house. When these were thoroughly saturated I had them placed in the windows, as being the most exposed parts of the house. My dear wife superintended these arrangements. The roof was slated, so there appeared but little danger of fire being communicated to us through that channel. The whole garrison consisted of my wife and myself, our children and four servants. Two of the latter were mere cowboys, and the other two had never seen a battle. We fired hap-hazard, as fast as we could load. We did so, because we could actually see nothing but fire and smoke, and therefore could not aim at our enemies. My chief apprehension arose from the fear that they might possess themselves of our cannon and turn them against ourselves. Therefore I thought that while unable to see what our assailants were doing, I could not employ myself better than in firing my large blunderbuss every few minutes in the direction of the cannon. While I was firing at random, I had a glimpse of a man setting fire to the covering of the fish-press. I took deliberate aim at him with my blunderbuss, loaded as usual with swan-shot, and wounded him in several places, but not seriously. While we were blinded and suffocated by the smoke from the burning stacks, our adversaries raised a small mound of turf and wood, behind which they intrenched themselves. They set to work with long poles to detach the slates from the roof of the north-east tower. As soon as they uncovered a portion, they applied fire to it, by means of burning straw at the end of their poles, and in this way the roof was on fire three times, and we as often extinguished it from within. [80] This is one of the boldest defences known in American history. A privateer was a vessel authorized to capture an enemy's property, but the privateersmen often were little better than pirates, as in this case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">16. How the Boys fought the Privateersmen BY JOHN FONTAINE (1708) ABOUT two o'clock in the afternoon, they accomplished making a breach in the wall of this same northeast tower. We could see them at work with iron bars. While they were so engaged my children fired upon them. They formed a sort of rampart with a mattress on the top of a large basket, such as is used in the country for carrying peat. They knelt behind this rampart, and fired as fast as they could one after the other, without daring to show their noses. The enemy still continued at work with their long poles and firebrands endeavoring to set the roof on fire. When the smoke had subsided a little, I hit upon a position from which I could see to take aim at their hands, as they raised them above their intrenchment to guide the poles. I fired, and I thought I hit them, but as they still persevered in their work I began to think it probable that I had not put a sufficient charge in the piece, so when I loaded again I put in a double quantity of powder. I had no sooner loaded than I had the opportunity of aiming at a hand I saw raised. I fired, but my piece was overloaded, and it burst, by which unfortunate accident I was thrown down with much violence. Three of my ribs and my right collar-bone were broken, and the flesh of my right hand was much torn. I was so completely stunned that I had no power to move, or even to breathe for some seconds. My wife saw me fall, and she naturally concluded I had been struck by a ball from the enemy. She ran to my assistance, and raised me up without making any noise whatever. As soon as I was able to articulate, I told her how it had happened. After I was prostrated, my dearest wife assumed the command. She had an eye to every thing. She went round to furnish ammunition as it was required, and she gave courage as well by her exhortations as by her example. My sons defended the breach by an incessant fire from behind their mattress rampart. At last, a grenade was thrown in at the breach, which ran under the basket. It overturned the whole affair, but without doing any harm, thanks be to God, except giving the boys a fright which made them abandon their post; but only for a very short time. One of them ran to me, in great dismay, to tell me that the hole was as large as any door, and that the enemy were entering by it. The other boys were still firing from the dormer windows. I immediately rose from my bed, and asked them to give me a pistol ready. cocked and loaded, which I took in my left hand, the right being useless. I called my family around me, and I said to them, "I see, my dear children, that we must be overpowered by the great number of those who are attacking us. It is inevitable; but we will not stand quietly to be killed like dogs. Let us rather sell our lives dearly, and die like lions." I was advancing towards the breach while I said these words. As soon as I had done speaking, my poor boys re-entered the room, and took up their old position without a word or a gesture indicative of fear. They replaced their basket and mattress, exposed to the fire of more than ten muskets. It was, indeed, a melancholy sight! At the same time, I was gratified with their display of unflinching courage. Blessed be thou, O my God! who preserved them from injury amid such a shower of balls. When they resumed the fire, the enemy retreated from the breach, and did not dare to show their heads, or even their hands. This caused all their fire to be thrown away; for, by not raising the butt-end of their muskets, they carried too high, and the shot went far above us every time. Seeing that we did not give way in the least, they began to tire of our obstinate resistance. They might possibly have heard me speak to the children, and it is very certain they overrated our force extremely. From the constant fire in all directions, as well as upon the main point of attack, they concluded that we must have at least twenty men. They called out to us to surrender, and they would give us good quarter. I held a conversation with my wife and children, and we determined, at any rate, to hear what terms they offered. The firing was stopped on both sides, and I advanced to the breach to hold parley with them. One of the lieutenants came forward and took aim at me. My second son, Peter, saw what he was about, before I observed him. He immediately caught hold of me and drew me to one side, barely in time to save me from being the victim of their treachery; for the ball passed within two or three inches of my stomach. I was extremely indignant, and said, "Ah ! you traitors ! was it then merely with the view of surprising me, that you proposed a parley ? Fire upon these traitors, my sons. Fire, I say." The boys obeyed me without loss of time, and fired upon the deceitful miscreants. I had foolishly exposed myself to a very great danger, by placing confidence in the good faith of an enemy whom I might have known was destitute of all honorable feeling. The ever watchful providence of God again interposed for my deliverance. We kept up an incessant fire for another quarter of an hour, when the enemy called out to us again, and made a second offer of good quarter. I reproached them with their recent perfidy, and told them I could not trust persons who had already attempted to betray the confidence I had reposed in them. They then threatened that, if we refused to surrender, they would throw a barrel of powder in the breach and blow us all up. "I have three or four at your service here," said I, "and I intend to scatter their contents over this floor and the inner hall, and whenever you are pleased to enter, I will throw a lighted turf upon it, and make you dance. You may depend upon it, I will not perish without you." The desperate tone of this reply made them repeat once more their offer of good quarter. So we had a cessation of hostilities on both sides. Their proposition was, that they should have the plunder, to which I assented. I demanded life and liberty for myself and all who were with me. He was to guarantee life and liberty to all of us, and to promise on their part the most strictly honorable deportment while in possession, and they were to have the plunder. They swore to the observance of these terms. I then had the doors opened, and ranged myself, my wife, my sons and four servants in regular order, to surrender our arms to the Commander, as he entered. Oh, God! our Preserver ! thou knowest, and none else can know the state of my feelings at that moment, to see my beloved wife and dear children, at the mercy of enemies, fourteen of whom we had wounded. Oh! what everlasting praises do we owe to thee for our preservation. It was thou who restrained our bloodthirsty enemies from executing the vengeance which they had sworn against us. Oh, my God! I beseech thee to sanctify the lives which thou hast so miraculously preserved, and assist us to devote them to thy service! The Commander, and a good many of the men came in, and seeing only five youths, and four cowherds, they looked anxiously around, and asked me where all my men were, evidently fearing an ambuscade. "You need not fear anything dishonorable from me," said I, "you now see our whole garrison." "Impossible," said he, "these children could never have kept up all the firing." My wife then spoke to him, and said, "I am in hopes, sir, that the fact of so few persons having made this gallant defence, will be an inducement to you whom I trust we shall find a man of honor to treat us with the more consideration." Struck with her courage the Commander ordered a guard to protect us, and contented himself with sweeping away what remained of our place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">17. A Pirate's Fate By Benjamin Colman (1726) THE story of these wretched men is short and tragical. They sailed from Jamaica on board a snow, John Green, Commander, bound to Guinea. They had not been long at sea before they conspired to seize the captain and mate and then go a-pirating. [81] On the 27th of May, 1726, they put in execution their wicked design, in a most cruel and barbarous manner. About one o'clock in the morning, William Fly, then boatswain of the snow "Elizabeth," [82] after he had been for some time forward with several of the sailors, came aft with Alexander Mitchel and others, and said to Morrice Cunden (gunner of the ship), then at the helm. "You, dog, if you stir hand or foot, or speak a word, I'll blow your brains out!" And immediately thereupon he went into the cabin where Captain Green was in bed, and Alexander Mitchel followed him; and while they were there Morrice Cunden heard the captain cry out: "What's the matter?" But they soon hauled him upon deck, and were about to throw him overboard; A SHIP OF WAR. Black and white illustration of a ship. he was heard calling earnestly to the doctor to hand him a rope. But the doctor was by this time himself in irons. Thus bloodily these inhuman creatures began their piracy, but vengeance followed them and suffered them not to live. William Fly, the chief and worst (we may suppose) of these barbarous rogues, took on him the command, and named the snow the "Fame's Revenge." They were well stored with powder, and rum and provisions, but wanted a better vessel; and in quest of this it is likely they bent their course, first to Carol line, and from thence to New England. On the third of June they took a sloop at anchor off North Carolina, on board of which was Mr. William Atkinson, a passenger; who was afterwards the happy instrument in the hand of God for their destruction. They very much needed one so well skilled, as Atkinson was both a mariner and pilot; and Fly treated him well on that account, but kept a strict eye upon him, forbidding him to have any conversation with the forced men; and, lest he should talk to them, he had a hammock hung for him in the cabin. They commanded him to carry them to Martha's Vineyard in order to wood and water there, and in hopes to meet with some sloop fitting for their purpose. But he resolved to run the venture of carrying them past the Vineyard, and run them up into or near the bay before they were aware of it. When they perceived it they began to look upon him with an evil eye, and spake of throwing him overboard. But as Fly was uttering his rage at him the next morning on this account, and telling him what death he should die if anything ill befell them through his conduct. a schooner came in sight, which put an end to Fly's rage, for the joy of a good prize. They found it a schooner of Marblehead, George Girdler, Master. Mr. Atkinson had some time before this meditated the seizing on Fly and his company, and found means secretly to communicate his mind to some on board, whom he thought he might trust; particularly to Samuel Walker, and Thomas Streaton; and Walker had spoken of it to James Benbrook; who all consented if a fair opportunity should offer. It was very necessary to his design to ingratiate himself, as far as he honestly and with a good conscience could, with Fly and his pirates. Yet in doing this he ran a risk both of his innocence and his life of his innocence, for "with a furious man thou shalt not go, lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul;" and of his life, for as some of the pirates, the captain especially, began to think friendly of him and to hearken to his advice (they all depending on him to navigate the ship). If a ship of war had taken them, it is to be feared that he had in vain pleaded his innocence and good intentions. But the good God who preserved, has also pleaded his innocence. And we ought to praise his virtue, conduct and courage, and give God the glory of it. Fly had no sooner taken the schooner of Marblehead, when they discovered another at a distance from them. Whereupon he put three men on board the schooner, and purposed to bear down on the new sail with both his vessels. But Mr. Atkinson with a ready thought advised him to put six men into the schooner, and send her down on the fishing vessels, for the schooner had been one of their company but a day before, and so there would be no likelihood of their flying from her: "but," said he, "if the snow and the schooner now bear down together, they'll take you for what you are, and make away from you." Fly came into his advice and put three men more into the schooner, and parted with her, standing a course wide from her. Now Atkinson's thoughts were hard at work how to draw Fly away from his arms on the quarter-deck. For there he kept alone, nor would suffer Atkinson to step up, so much as to set down the bowl of punch after he had drank to him. And probably a message which he received from a chief pirate on board the schooner, "To have a special care of his friend," did increase his jealousy; though he seem. d only to laugh at it. Within a little while Atkinson spied a sail ahead to the leeward, and informed Fly of it. And presently after he pretended to discover two or tier, more sail, and told him he would have a fleet of prizes. But Fly with his glass could see but one. "Why," said Atkinson, "if you were but here, sir, with your glass, ahead, you would easily see them all." On a sudden Fly forgot his caution, and comes off the quarter-deck, where his arms lay, and sits him down ahead to spy the sails spoken of. Then Atkinson gave the sign to his friends, and Walker followed by Benbrook came up, pretending at first to direct the captain to look a point or two on such a side, while Atkinson (a spare and slender man) passed aft toward the arms, and in the instant that Walker laid hold of Fly he took the fire-arms, and returned pointing the gun to the pirate's breast, and telling him "He was a dead man if he did not immediately submit himself his prisoner." The wicked Fly earnestly begged for his life, and now found that mercy which he had so barbarously denied to his innocent captain. When Fly found himself chained down and effectually secured, he fell at times into the most desperate ragings; the same blasphemer now in his furious despair, or worse than he ever was before in his jollity and pride; when he would sometimes even dare to ridicule the noise of God's thunder, as it rattled over him, saying, "That they were playing bowls in the air," etc., and as the lightnings sometimes flashed upon them, he would say "Who fires now? Stand by," etc. So he dared the dreadful vengeance, which pursued him swift as the lightnings and suddenly struck him. But Capt. Atkinson and his brave mates are much to be praised, that they dealt so mercifully with these bloody men; and neither "blew their brains out" (their own phrase) nor threw them overboard. Blessed be God that kept them that day from shedding blood, and from avenging themselves with their own hands. It was much better to reserve the murderers to the judgment of the law, in the proper course of it. Capt. Atkinson and his company now made the best of their way for the port of Boston. [81] In many cases piracy began with mutiny and The seizure of the ship by the sailors. [82] A snow is a sort of brig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18. Sharks and Water Spouts BY Rev. George Whitefield (1737) [83] My dear Friends, Though I know no reason why you should be solicitous about anything that happens to such a dead dog as I am, yet as your love (O unmerited Kindness) abounds exceedingly towards me, I send you a full and particular account of my voyage. Monday, Feb. 20, 1737. I spent the morning on board in writing letters to my dear friends in England. Went in the afternoon on shore to Gibralter, and was unspeakably delighted with the prospect of the place The seeing persons of all nations and languages gave me great pleasure. Saturday, March 18. The weather being exceedingly fair, and the sea calm, I went with the Captain on board the Lightfoot. Dined with the gentlemen belonging to the ship; married a couple; dispersed Bibles, testaments and soldiers' monitors amongst the men. Exchanged some books for some cards which I threw overboard. Preached a sermon against drunkenness which God enabled me to finish yesterday; and returned in the evening highly delighted with seeing the porpoises roll about the great deep. Monday, March 20. To-day the Colonel came to dine with us, and in the midst of our meal we were entertained with a most agreeable sight. It was a shark about the length of a mall. It followed our ship, and was attended with five little fishes, called the pilot fish, much like a mackerel, but larger. These I am told always keep the shark company. And what is most surprising, though the shark is so ravenous a creature, yet let it be never so hungry, it never touches one of them. Nor are they less faithful to him. For if at any time the shark is hooked, these little creatures will not forsake him. They cleave close to his fins and are often taken up with him. Go to the pilot-fish, thou that forsakes" a friend in adversity. Consider his ways and be abashed. Tuesday, April 18. Was greatly delighted in seeing two water spouts, which ran along for several miles, and by the especial Providence of God escaped US. We saw one of them coming, and were surprised to observe a sudden calm for about six minutes. The other parts of the sea boiled like a pot. But surely the everlasting I AM said to the sea at that instant, "Let there be a calm in that place." For by that means our ship was immediately stopped in her course. So the water spout passed by before we came up to it. Otherwise it would have torn our sail in pieces. God's hand was so visible in this, that several said they never beheld the like before. Saturday, April 22. Fled as it were on the wings of the wind for three days past. I find that God generally sends us strongest winds when nearest our port. Friday, May 5. This afternoon, after having lain about a week on this coast, we saw Savannah River, and sent off for a pilot. Oh what joy appeared in everyone's countenance! Sunday, May 7. Last night, by the blessing of God, we cast anchor near Tyby Island about fourteen miles off Savannah. After this I took boat and arrived safe at Savannah, having a most pleasant passage, about seven in the evening. [83] Rev. George Whitefield, the great preacher, describes some of the incidents of his voyage to America in 1737.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">AN INDIAN TOWN. Black and white illustration showing a village surrounded by tall stakes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">19. How to grow Indian Corn BY HENRY SPELMAN (1689) THE Indians have houses, but few of the greatest towns have more than twenty or thirty of them. Their buildings are made like an oven, with a little hole through which they go out and in. In the midst of the house there is a hole through which the smoke goes out. The king's houses are broader and longer than those of the other people, having many dark windings and turnings. [84] When the Indians go hunting, the women go to a place assigned beforehand to build wigwams for their husbands to sleep in at night. They carry mats to cover these huts, and as the men go further in their hunting, the women go on ahead, carrying the mats. By the side of their dwelling-houses the Indians commonly make a place to plant their corn. If there be much wood in that place, they cut down the larger trees, and the smaller trees they burn to the root, pulling most of the bark from them so as to make them die. In these cornfields they used to dig holes with a crooked piece of wood. Since then the English have brought them shovels and spades. They put into these holes ordinarily four or five kernels of their wheat, and two beans. [85] When the wheat has grown up, having a stalk as big as a cane reed, the beans run up on them, like our hops on poles. The ear of the wheat is long alla thick, and yet for all its coarseness, the stalk has commonly four or five ears. Their corn is planted and gathered at about the same time as ours, but their manner of harvesting is like our way of gathering apples. First they put the ears in hand baskets, then empty them into larger baskets, made of the bark of trees or of hemp. Then they lay the corn upon thick mats in the sun to dry, and every night they make a great pile of it, covering it with mats to protect it from the dew. When it is safely weathered, they pile it up in their houses, and daily as they want to use some of the corn they rub the kernels off into a great basket, wringing the ears between their hands. A great basket of this takes up the best part of some of their houses. Shelling corn is chiefly women's work, for the men only hunt to get skins in winter and dress them in summer. But though now it is out of our purpose, we may not forget altogether the planting of the King's corn, for which a day is appointed. [86] On that day a great party of the country people meet and work so hard that the greater part of the King's corn is planted in one day. After the planting is over the King takes the crown which the King of England sent him, and puts it upon his head. This done, the people go backwards and forwards among the corn hills he King following. Their faces are always towards the King, expecting that he will throw some beads among them. [87] It is his custom at such a time to make those who had been planting corn scramble for the beads. Some of his favorites he calls to him and gives the beads into their own hands. This is the greatest courtesy which he offers to his people. When his corn is ripe the country people come to him again AN INDIAN DANCE. Black and white illustration of people dancing in a circle, holding various objects; three people in the center embrace. and gather, dry, and rub out all his corn for him and then store it in the houses abounding for that purpose. [88] [84] The early settlers called the Indian chiefs "kings." [85] "Their wheat" means Indian corn; the Indians did not have real wheat. [86] The Indian King, that is, the chief. [87] The beads were brought from Europe and the Indians greatly valued them; before the English came the had only little shells and fresh-water pearls. [88] The English very soon learned to eat the Indian pone or corn bread, baked in the ashes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20. Delights of New England BY REV. FRANCIS HIGGINSON (1630) [89] THE variety of the soil of New England is to be admired. It appears in the abundance of grass which grows everywhere, very thick and very high in different places; but it grows very wild with a great stalk and broad wide blade, because it has never been cropped by cattle, nor mown with the scythe, and seldom trampled under foot. It can scarcely be believed how our cows and goats, horses and pigs, do thrive and prosper here in this country. In our plantation we can already buy a quart of milk for a penny. The abundant increase of grain proves this country to be a wonder. Thirty, forty, and Sixty fold harvests are ordinary here. Our planters hope to have more than a hundred-fold here this year. Our children, by planting corn, may earn more than their own support. This country abounds with roots of great variety which are good to eat. Our turnips, parsnips, and carrots are both bigger and sweeter than those ordinarily found in England. Barberries grow in plenty, and pennyroyal, sorrel and water-cress, leeks and onions. There also is an abundance of other wild herbs, delightful to smell, whose names we do not know. There is a plenty of single damask roses, very sweet; and two kinds of herbs which bear two kinds of flowers, which they say are as good to make cordage or cloth as our hemp or flax. We have mulberries, plums, raspberries, currants, chestnuts and walnuts, all of which grow in plenty here. New England has water enough, both salt and fresh, as the Atlantic sea runs all along this coast. We have a number of excellent harbors, such as Cape Ann and Massachusetts Bay and Salem. The abundance of sea-fish is almost beyond believing, and usually I can scarce believe it with my own eyes. I often see a great number of whales, mackerel, and codfish taken in. Then there is a fish called bass, as sweet and wholesome a fish as ever I did eat. It is altogether as good as our fresh herring. They come in June, and again three months later. Of this fish one may take many hundreds together. Indeed, their nets ordinarily take more than the fishermen are able to haul to land, so that they want for boats and men and often are forced to let many go that they have taken. Besides bass, we took plenty of thornbacks, and an abundance of lobsters, so that the smallest boy in the plantation may both catch and eat as many as he may wish of them. The air of New England is one special thing that commends this place. Experience shows that there is hardly a more healthful place to be found in the world, or one that agrees better with our English bodies. Many who were weak and sickly in Old England, by coming hither, have been safely healed, and grown healthful and strong. A sup of New England's air is better than a whole draught of Old England's ale. [89] The writer of this piece is the same Francis Higginson, whose voyage we read about in the last chapter. He is here writing home to his friends, urging them to come; and thousands of English people did come over at that time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">21. All Sorts of Creatures BY JOHN JOSSELYN (1663-1672) [90] THE humming birds, the smallest of all birds, are of changeable colors, and are found in New England They feed upon honey which they suck out of flowers with their long needle-like bills. They sleep all winter and are not to be seen until the spring, at which time they brood in little nests, made of soft, silk-like stuff. Their eggs are no bigger than white peas, and they hatch four or five at a time. The turkeys are blacker than ours. [91] I have heard several trustworthy persons say that they have seen turkey-cocks that weighed forty, even sixty pounds. Out of my personal experience, I can assure you that I have eaten my share of a turkey that weighed thirty pounds after he was dressed. I have also seen sixty broods of young turkeys on the side of a marsh, sunning themselves early in the morning. The English and the Indians have, by this time, nearly destroyed the breed, so that it is very rare to meet with a wild turkey in the woods. Some of the English people, however, have numbers of them in their yards. The wild turkeys hatch twice or three times in a year. If you would keep the young alive, you must give them little water, for if they have their fill Or water, they will grow weak, and you will never be able to raise any of them. The squaws weave coats of turkey feathers for their children. [92] Of pigeons there are millions upon millions. In the spring and in the fall when they return southward I have seen a flight of pigeons four or five miles long. To my thinking, they had neither beginning nor ending. So thick they were that I could see no sun. In one tree might be seen nest after nest. And one tree after another for miles among the pine trees, I have seen, filled with these nests. But they are fewer now. [93] The owl is the dullest bird there is. Of these there are three sorts, a great grey owl with ears, a little gray owl, and a white owl. Poor, ragged birds they are, and have no glittering, golden feathers. Of beasts of the earth there are not many kinds here. The wolves have their kennels under thick bushes by great trees, in far-off places in the swamps. A dog caught a wolf which had got into the sea, and held him there until some one went in and led him out. The dog kept his hold upon the wolf until they had tied its legs. When they brought the wolf into the house, they unbound his legs, and he did not offer to bite. He did not so much as show his teeth. He put his head down, and looked toward the door, as if he would willingly have his liberty But they killed him, as they did other wolves. The bear at certain seasons is a terrible creature. When hunted with dogs, he goes up a tree, where he is shot. When he is fat, which is in acorn time, and in winter, he makes good food. But then there is no one who dares to kill him but the Indians. The bear makes his den among thick bushes, pushing in here and there a dot of moss. [94] This moss, being covered with snow, melts in the daytime with the heat of the sun: but in the night it is frozen in a thick coat of ice. The mouth of the den is very narrow. Here they lie single, never two in a den all winter. The Indian, as soon as he finds them, creeps in upon all fours. With his left hand, he seizes the neck of the sleeping bear, drags him to the mouth of the den, where with a club or small hatchet he kills him, before he can open his eyes. But sometimes the bear is too quick for the Indian, as one of them called Black Robin can tell. He was badly hurt by the bear before he could strike it. The females among beasts and birds of prey, in size and beauty, surpass the males. So do they especially among fishes. To speak of fishes I shall begin first with the whale. [95] The whale is a kingly fish as all fishes of great size are. There was one of them thrown up on the shore about eight miles from where I lived This whale was fifty-five feet long. These sea creatures are of great strength and size. The herring are very numerous. The people catch them all summer long. We saw them once driven into the harbour by other great fish that feed upon them near the shore. It was at the time of high water. They threw themselves upon the land in such great numbers that we could have gone up to the knee among them for a quarter of a mile. I have seen a lobster that weighed twenty pounds. [96] They cast off their shell-coats in the spring, and so do crabs. They have, underneath, a thin, red skin which grows thick and hard in a short time, and forms a new shell-coat . The Indians feed much upon the lobster. Some they roast and some they dry. The starfish has five points like a star. The whole fish is no bigger than the palm of a man's hand. It is of a tough substance, like leather. It is about an inch in thickness, whitish underneath, of the color of a cucumber above and somewhat rough. A BIG COLONIAL TREE. Black and white illustration of a tree. When it is warm in one's hand, you may see it make a stiff motion, turning down one of its points and putting up another. The starfish is very common, and is found thrown up on the rocks by the sea-tide. [90] John Josselyn was very fond of the country, and also fond of telling a big story; the hummingbirds disappear in winter, because they go south. [91] Wild turkeys. [92] Young turkeys are still thought very hard to raise. [93] Two centuries later such pigeon roosts existed near the Ohio River. [94] The white people killed lots of them. [95] The whale is not a fish, but an animal living in the water; it cannot stay long under water without rising to take breath. [96] No such big lobsters are left now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">22. How to raise Tobacco By Alsop (1666) THE three main commodities this country affords for trade, are tobacco, furs, and flesh. [97] Furs and skins, as those of beavers, otters, musk-rats, raccoons, wild-cats, and elk or buffalo, with several others, were first sold by the Indians of the country. They were sold to the white people living near, and by them to the merchants who carried them into England and other places where they became salable. Tobacco is the only regular article of trade of this province. The use of it was first found out by the Indians many ages ago. Its use was brought into the Christian world by that great discoverer of America, Columbus. [98] It is generally made by all the people of this province. Between the months of March and April, they sow the seed, which is much smaller than mustard-seed, in small beds and patches. These patches are dug up and made with care. About May the plants commonly appear green in those beds. In June they are transplanted from their beds, and set in little hillocks in distant rows, dug up for the same purpose. Twice or thrice they are weeded, and freed from poor leaves that are peeping out from the body of the stalk. [99] They cut off the tops of the several plants as they find occasion, when they grow too fast. About the middle of September they cut the tobacco down, and carry it into houses, made for that purpose, to bring it to its purity. And after time has brought it to perfection, it is then tied up in bundles, and packed into hogsheads. It is then laid away for trade. Between November and January there arrive in this province ships to the number of twenty sail and upwards. All are trading vessels loaded with goods to sell or trade. They trade with the planter for silks, hollands, woolens, and broadcloths, and other necessary goods, at such rates as shall be thought fair and lawful for tobacco at so much the pound. Advantage on both sides is considered. The planter has given his work, and the merchant has risked coming; with his goods into a far country. Thus is the trade on both sides made in a fair and honest way. The people of this province are seldom or never put to the fear of being robbed of their money, nor of dirtying their fingers by counting vast sums. They have more bags to carry corn than coin; but the very product of the dirty ground of this province affords as great a profit to the inhabitants as the gold of Peru does to the Spaniard. Our shops of Maryland are the merchants' storehouses, where with few words goods are bought and delivered. They are not like those shop-keepers' boys in London that continually cry, "What do ye lack, sir ? What do ye buy ?" Tobacco is the coin of Maryland, and will purchase goods from the merchant quicker than money. I must confess the New England men that trade into this province, had rather have fat pork for goods, than tobacco or furs. [97] Tobacco was the main crop in the South in the colonial time, and therefore we ought to know how it was grown. [98] Sir Walter Raleigh introduced smoking into England. [99] To top tobacco = to cut off young growing heads.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">23. Carolina Beasts BY THOMAS ASH (1680) [100] Fireflies. [101] —There are in Carolina great numbers of fireflies, who carry their lanterns in their tails, in dark nights flying through the air, shining like streaks of fire, and lighting it with their golden spangles. I have seen a larger sort at Jamaica. These have two lights upon their eyes and a third in their tails; on dark nights they shine like candles, so that I have often, at a distance, mistaken their sparkle for the lights of some distant plantation. Amongst large orange trees in the night I have seen many of those flies whose lights have appeared like hanging candles or hanging torches which amidst the leaves yielded a sight truly curious. With three of these fireflies secured in a glass bottle in a very dark night I have read very small print. Turtles. [102] —The tortoises, more commonly called by our Indians the turtles, are of three sorts: the hawksbill, whose shell is that which we call the tortoise shell; the green turtle, whose flesh is good to eat; the third kind is called the loggerhead turtle, and neither its shell nor its flesh is of worth. The kind of creatures who live both on the land and on the sea in the day usually keep in the sea, swimming on the surface. In fair weather they delight to expose themselves to the sun, oftentimes falling asleep, lying there without any motion on the water, until they are disturbed by the approach of some ship. Then, as they are very quick of hearing, they awaken quickly and dive away. In the night they often come on shore to feed, and lay their eggs in the sand, which once covered they leave for the sun to hatch. The little turtles dig their passage out of the sand, immediately making their way towards the water. Sea Cow. [103] —There is, farther to the southward of Carolina, a fish called the sea cow, of extraordinary size, sometimes of a thousand pounds. It feeds on the banks on the grassy herbage. She has a head like a cow and is of a green color. Her flesh is said to be sweeter than the tenderest veal. Its skin makes excellent whips for horses, which are very serviceable and lasting. Alligator or Crocodile.—There are in the mouths of their rivers, or in the lakes near the sea, creatures which are little known in the West Indies and are called alligators or crocodiles. Their backs are scaly and impenetrable, so that a musket ball cannot pierce them. [104] It lives both on land and on water, and is such a greedy creature that it devours everything it sees. Man, however, it dares to take on land only by surprise or when asleep. In the water the crocodile is more dangerous. It sometimes grows to great length, from sixteen to twenty feet, and has a long mouth set with sharp teeth. Its body, when full grown, is as large as that of a horse, growing smaller towards the tail. Nature has given land creatures an instinct to avoid the crocodile, warning them by its strong musky smell, which can be perceived at Considerable distance, so that poor cattle, smelling it in time, can get out of harm's way. [100] Thomas Ash was born in England in 1650, and came over to the part of the coast at first considered the southern part of Virginia. but which in 1676 was chartered as the colony of Carolina. He was Governor of that colony from 1689 to 1694, and wrote one of the best accounts of the country that has come down to us. [101] Fireflies were not known in England. [102] The turtles of which Ash speaks are all water turtles. The colonists found them very useful for food, but at the present day very few come ashore. [103] The sea cow is also called the manatee; it is now very scarce in the waters of the coast of the United States. [104] A rifle-ball will penetrate the alligator's hide.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">24. The Dangers of the Way BY MADAM SARAH KNIGHT (1704) MONDAY, October 2nd, 1704. About three o'clock afternoon I began my journey from Boston to New Haven, being about two hundred miles. [105] When we had ridden about an hour, we came into a thick swamp, which by reason of a great fog, very much startled me, for it was now very dark. In about an hour, or something more, after we left the swamp, we came to Billing's tavern, where I was to lodge. My guide dismounted and very complaisantly helped me down, and showed the door, signing to me with his hand to go in; which I gladly did. But I had not gone many steps into the room ere I was interrogated by a young lady (I understood after. wards she was the elder daughter of the family). These were her words. "Law for me what in the world brings you here at this time a' night ? I never see a woman on the road so dreadful late in all the days of my versall life. [106] Who are you? Where are you going? I'm scared out of my wits." With much more of the same kind. I told her she treated me very rudely, and I did not think it my duty to answer her unmannerly questions. But to get rid of them I told her I came there to have the mail carrier's company with me tomorrow on my journey. I begged the Miss to show me where I must lodge. She conducted me to a parlor in a little back lean to, which was almost filled with the bedstead. It was so high that I was forced to climb on a chair to get up to the wretched bed that lay on it. Having stretched my tired limbs on it, and laid my head on a sad colored pillow, I began to think on the transactions of the past day. TUESDAY, October 3rd. About eight in the morning I, with the mail carrier, proceeded forward with out anything remarkable. And about two in the afternoon, we arrived at the carrier's second stage, where the western postman met him with letters. Here, having called for something to eat, the woman brought a twisted thing like a cable, but a little whiter, which proved to be a loaf of bread. Laying it on the table she tugged for life to bring it into a capacity to spread. Having with great pains accomplished this, she served also a dish of pork and cabbage. I suppose this was the remains of dinner. The sauce was of a deep purple, as I thought, because it was boiled in her dye pot. The bread was of Indian meal and everything on the table service in keeping. As I was hungry, I got a little down. But my stomach was soon cloyed. About three in the afternoon I went on with my third guide, who rode very hard. We came to a river which they generally ride through. But I dared not venture. So the mail carrier got a lad and canoe to carry me to the other side, and he rode through and led my horse. The canoe was very small and shallow, so that when we were in it seemed ready to take in water, which greatly terrified me. This caused me to be very circumspect, sitting with my hands fast on each side, my eyes steady. I did not dare so much as to lodge my tongue a hair's breadth more on one side of my mouth than on the other. I dared not so much as to think of Lot's wife, for a wry thought would have overset our wherry. [107] But I was soon put out of this pain by feeling the canoe on shore, and I as soon almost saluted the land with my feet. Rewarding my canoeman, again I mounted and we made the best of our way forward. The road here was very even and the day pleasant, near the sunset. The carrier now told me we had nearly fourteen miles to ride to the next stopping place, where we were to lodge. I asked him about the rest of the road, forseeing that we must travel in the night. He told me there was a bad river which we were to ride through with a current so very fierce that a horse could hardly stem it; he said it was narrow, and we should soon be over. I cannot express the concern of mind caused by this account. No thoughts but those of the dangerous river could entertain my imagination. They tormented me with blackest ideas of my approaching fate. Sometimes I saw myself drowning, other times drowned, and at the best like a holy sister just come out of a spiritual bath in dripping garments. Now was the glorious sun, with his swift courses, arrived at the end of his day's journey, leaving poor me with the rest of this part of the lower world in darkness, with which we were soon surrounded. The only glimmering we now had was from the spangled skies of which imperfect reflections rendered every object formidable. Each lifeless tree trunk with its shattered limbs, appeared an armed enemy, and every little stump like a ravenous devourer. Nor could I so much as see my guide, when at any distance which added to the terror. Thus absolutely lost in thought, and dying with the very fear of drowning, I came up with the post man, whom I did not see till I was beside his horse He told me that he was stopping for me; and we rode on very deliberately a few paces when we entered a thicket of trees and shrubs. I perceived by the horse's gait that we were on the descent of a hill. As we came nearer the bottom it was totally dark, from the trees that surrounded it. But I knew by the going of the horse, we had entered the water, and my guide told me that this was the hazardous river of which he had been talking. Riding up close to my side he bid me not to fear for we should be over immediately. I now rallied all the courage I was mistress of. I knew I must either venture the fate of drowning or be left like the children in the wood. So, as the postman bade me. I gave reins to my nag, and sitting as steady as just before in the canoe, in a few minutes got safe to the other side, which was the Narragansett country. [105] This brave lady started off cheerfully for her long and dangerous journey; there were then few roads in New England, and few bridges. [106] See for saw. Versall = probably universal. [107] Lot's wife was turned into salt for looking back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">25. Creatures of the Wilderness BY COLONEL WILLIAM BYRD (1728) [108] WE came to the banks of a creek called in the Indian language, "Ohimpa-moni," signifying Jumping Creek, from the frequent jumping of fish during the spring season. Here we encamped, and by the time the horses were hobbled, our hunters brought us no less than a brace and a half of deer, which made great plenty and consequently great content in our quarters. [109] Some of our people had shot a great wild cat which was at the fatal moment making a comfortable meal upon a fox-squirrel. The wild cat is as big again as any household cat, and much the fiercest inhabitant of the woods. Whenever it is disabled it will tear its own flesh for madness. Although a panther will run away from a man, a wild cat will only make a surly retreat before him. Now and then he will face about if he be not too closely pursued. He will even pursue in his turn, if he observe the least sign of fear or even of caution in those that pretend to follow him. The flesh of this beast, as well as of the panther, is as white as veal, and altogether as sweet and delicious. One day a great flock of cranes flew over our quarters. They were exceedingly noisy in their flight. They seemed to steer their course toward the south (they are birds of passage) in quest of warmer weather. They only took this country on their way. They are as rarely met with in this part of the world as a highwayman or a beggar. [110] These birds travel generally in flocks. When they roost they place upon the highest trees sentinels, which constantly stand upon one leg to keep themselves waking. We forded several runs of excellent water. [111] After wards we crossed a large level of high land full of lofty walnut, poplar, and white oak trees. As we marched along we saw many buffalo tracks, but could not have the pleasure of seeing the animals. They either smelt us out, having that sense of smell very lively, or else they were alarmed at the noise which so many people must necessarily make in marching along. At the sight of a man they will snort and grunt, cock up their ridiculous short tails, and tear up the ground with a fury of fear. These wild cattle hardly ever range alone, but herd together like tame cattle. We had been so refreshed by a day of rest that we broke camp one morning earlier than usual and passed the several fords of the Hico River. The woods were very thick a great part of this day's journey, so that we were forced to scuffle hard to advance seven miles. We took up our quarters again on Sugar-tree Creek. A little distance from this creek one of the men had the luck to meet with a young buffalo of two years old. Notwithstanding he was no older he was as big as an ordinary ox. His legs were very thick and very short and his hoofs exceeding broad. His back rose into a kind of bunch a little above the shoulders. This I believe contributes not a little to that creature's enormous strength. The portly figure of this animal is disgraced by a shabby little tail, not above twelve inches long. This he cocks up on end, whenever he is in a passion; and instead of lowing or bellowing, grunts with no better grace than a hog. The hair growing on his head and neck is long and shaggy, and so soft that it will spin into thread not unlike mohair. Some people have stockings knit of it, that would have served an Israelite during his forty years' march through the wilderness. THE SUPPOSED BUFFALO. Black and white illustration of a creature with small head rather like a sheep, large body, curly fur, and oversized hooves. Its horns are short and strong, [112] and the Indians make large spoons out of them, which they say will split and fall to pieces whenever poison is put into them. [113] The color of the buffalo is a dirty brown, and its hide is so thick that it is scarcely penetratable. Buffaloes may be easily tamed when they are taken young. As thick as this poor beast's hide was, a bullet made shift to enter it and fetch him down. He was found all alone, though buffalo seldom are. The men were so delighted with this new diet, that the grid-iron and the frying pan had THE REAL BUFFALO. Black and white illustration of a buffalo. no rest all night. Before we marched this morning, every man took care to pack up some buffalo steaks in his knapsack, besides what he crammed into himself. Another day we encamped on a pleasant hill, over looking a river which seemed to be deep everywhere except where we forded. The Indian killed a very fat doe, and came across a bear which had been put to death and half devoured by a panther. The last named of these brutes reigns absolute monarch of the woods. In the keenness of his hunger he will venture to attack a bear; though then it is always by surprise, as beasts of the cat kind come upon their prey. Their play is to take the poor bears napping. The bears are very drowsy animals. And though they are exceedingly strong, yet their strength is heavy; while the panthers are too nimble and cunning to trust themselves within their hug. As formidable as the panther is to his fellow brutes, he never has the confidence to venture upon a man. He retires from him with great respect if there be a way open for his escape. However it must be confessed his voice is a little contemptible for a monarch of the forest. It is not a great deal louder or more awful than the mewing of a household cat. Not far from our quarters one of the men picked up a pair of elk's horns, not very large, and discovered the track of the elk that had shed them. The elk is as big as a horse and of the deer kind. Only the stags have horns and those exceedingly large and spreading. Their swiftest speed is a fast trot. In that motion they turn their horns back upon their necks, and cock their noses aloft in the air. Nature has taught them this attitude to save their antlers from being caught in the thickets. The Indians say if one of the drove happen by some wound to be disabled from making his escape, the rest will forsake their fears to defend their friend. This they will do with great obstinacy till they are killed on the spot, although otherwise they are so alarmed at the sight of a man, that to avoid him they will sometimes throw themselves down very high precipices into the river. [108] Colonel Byrd was a great traveller in the backwoods of Virginia, and got beyond all the settlements into the wild woods, which are here described. [109] A brace and a half is three. [110] Of course, there could be neither robbers nor beggars where there were no people. [111] I.e . Several streams. [112] I.e. they are strong and durable. [113] There was no ground for this belief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">26. Beavers and Bears [114] BY COLONEL WILLIAM BYRD (1728) WE had difficulty in passing a water called Yapatsco or Beaver Creek. Those industrious animals, the beavers, had dammed up the water so high that we had much ado to get over. It is hardly credible how much work of this kind they will do in the space of one night. They bite young saplings into proper lengths with their fore-teeth, which are exceedingly strong and sharp. Afterwards they drag them to the place where they intend to stop the water. Then they know how to join timber and earth together with so much skill that their work is able to resist the most violent flood that can happen. In this they are qualified to instruct their betters. It is certain their dams will stand firm when the strongest that are made by men will be carried down the stream. On our return journey we again had difficulty in crossing the Yapatsco. The beavers had dammed up the water much higher than we found it at our going up. So we were obliged to lay a bridge over a part that was shallower than the rest, to facilitate our passage. Beavers have more of instinct—that half brother of reason—than any other animal, especially in matters of self-preservation. In their houses they always contrive a sally-port, [115] both towards the land and towards the water. This enables them to escape by one, if their retreat should happen to be cut off by the other. They perform all their works in the dead of night to avoid discovery. They are kept diligently to it by the master beaver which by his age or strength has gained to himself an authority over the rest. If any of the gang happen to be lazy, or will not exert himself to the utmost in felling of trees, or dragging them to the place where they are to be made use of, this superintendent will not fail to chastise him. This he does with the flat of the tail, with which he is able to give unmerciful strokes. The beavers lie snug in their houses all day, unless some unneighborly miller chance to disturb their repose, by demolishing their dams to supply his mill with water. It is rare to see one of them. The Indians, for that reason, have hardly any way to take them, except by laying snares near the place where they dam up the water. Both beavers and wolves, we know, when one of their legs is caught in a trap, will bite it off, that they may escape with the rest. The fur of the beaver is very valuable, especially in the more northern countries, where it is longer and finer. BEAVER. Black and white illustration of a beaver. Our Indian killed a bear that was feasting upon the wild grapes. In the fall, the flesh of this animal has a very high relish, different from that of other creatures; but in its taste it inclines nearest to that of pork. This beast is in truth a very clean feeder, living, while the season lasts, upon acorns, chestnuts and chinquapins, wild honey and wild grapes. [116] About January, when there is nothing to be got in the woods, they retire into some cave or hollow tree. There they sleep away two or three month very comfortably. BEAR. Black and white illustration of a bear. One of the young fellows who we sent to bring up the tired horses entertained us in the evening with a remarkable adventure of that day. He had strayed, it seems, from his company in a bog, and made a bear cub a year old betake itself to a tree. While he was new-priming his gun with intent to fetch the cub down, the old gentle-woman appeared. Perceiving her son in distress, she advanced open mouthed to his relief. The man was so intent on his game that she had approached very near before he saw her. But finding his danger, he faced about upon the enemy. She immediately reared upon her hind legs and put herself in battle array. The man, wondering at the bear's assurance, endeavored to fire upon her. But owing to the dampness of the priming, his gun did not go off. He cocked it a second time, and had the same misfortune. After missing fire twice he had the folly to punch the beast with the muzzle of his gun. But mother Bruin was on her guard, seized the weapon with her paws, and by main force wrenched it out of the fellow's hands. The man being thus fairly disarmed, thought himself no longer a match for the enemy. Therefore he retreated as fast as his legs could carry him. The brute naturally grew bolder upon the flight of her adversary, and pursued him with all her heavy speed. For some time it was doubtful whether fear made one run faster or fury the other. But after an even run, the man had the mishap to stumble over a stump and fell down at his full length. He now would have sold his life a pennyworth. But the bear fearing there might be some trick in the fall, instantly halted, and looked with much attention on her prostrate foe. In the meanwhile, the man had with great presence of mind resolved to make the bear believe he was dead. So he lay breathless on the ground, in hopes that the beast would be too generous to kill him over again. To carry on the farce, he lay motionless for some time without daring to raise his head to see how near the monster was to him. But in about two minutes, to his remarkable comfort, he was raised from the dead by the barking of a dog. The dog belonged to one of his companions who came seasonably to his rescue and drove the bear from pursuing the man to take care of her cub. For she feared it might now fall into a second distress. [114] The beaver had the misfortune to carry a coat of beautiful fur, and hence has been hunted almost out of the world. Very few are now to be found in the United States. [115] I.e . a gate of exit. [116] Chinquapins are a kind of acorn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">27. The Alligator in Georgia (1735) THE crocodile, which seems to be the chief of reptiles, abounds in all the rivers of Georgia. They call them alligators. I have seen some of these twelve feet long, I believe. A number of various errors are commonly reported about these creatures. One is that their scales are musket proof; whereas I have frequently seen them killed with small shot. Nay, I have heard from people of good credit, that when they have found one at a distance from the water, they have killed him with sticks. They did not think him worth a shot. Mr. Horton has more than once struck one through with a sword. The watermen often knock them on the head with their oars, as the alligators lie sleeping upon the banks. For they are very sluggish and timid; though they can make one or two springs in the water with nimbleness enough. They can also snap with strength whatever comes within their jaws. They are terrible to look at, stretching open a horrible large mouth, big enough to swallow a man. Theyhave rows of dreadful large sharp teeth. Their feet are like those of dragons, armed with great claws. They have a long tail which they throw about with great strength, and which seems to be their best weapon. For their claws are weakly set on; and the stiffness of their necks hinders then from turning nimbly to bite. When Mr. Oglethorpe was at Savannah for the first time, he tried to make an end of the fear which the people had for the crocodiles. So he wounded and caught one about twelve feet long, and had him brought up to the town. He set the boys to bait him with sticks. [117] The creature gaped and blew hard, but had no heart to move. It only turned about its tail, and snaps at the sticks. At our first coming they would stare at the boats, and stay still till they came up close to them; so that Mr. Horton killed five in one day. But after frequent attacks, they grew more shy. They destroy a great many fish, and will seize a hog or a dog if they see him in the water. But their general way of preying is to lie still, with their mouths open and their noses just above water. So they watch till the stream brings something down as prey to them. They swallow anything that comes into their mouths, and upon opening them, knots of lightwood have been found inside of them. [118] They lay eggs which are smaller than those of a goose. They scrape together a number of leaves, and other trash, of which nature has taught them to choose such as will be warm. Of these they make a hot-bed, in the midst of which they leave their eggs covering them with a sufficient thickness. The heat of the heap, helped by the warmth of the climate, hatches the eggs and the young crocodiles creep out like small lizards. [117] Bait = worry. [118] A kind of pine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">28. Colonial Pets BY PETER KALM (1748) UPON trial it has been found that the following animals and birds which are wild in the woods of North America can be made nearly as tame as domestic animals. The calves of the wild cows, [119] which are found in Carolina, and other provinces to the south of Pennsylvania, can be brought up among tame cattle. When they are grown up they are perfectly tame but at the same time very unruly, so that no enclosure is strong enough to hold them if they try to break through. As they possess great strength in their necks it is easy for them to overthrow the fences with their horns, and to get into the cornfields. The American deer can likewise be tamed. A farmer in New Jersey had one in his possession, which he caught when it was very young; at present, it is so tame that in the daytime it runs into the woods for its food, and towards night returns home, frequently bringing a wild deer out of the woods, giving its master an opportunity to hunt at his very door. Beavers have been tamed to such an extent that they have brought home what they caught by fishing to their masters. This is often the case with otters, of which I have seen some that were as tame as dogs, and followed their master wherever he went; if he went out in a boat the otter went with him, jumped into the water and after a while came up with a fish. The raccoon can in time be made so tame as to run about the streets like a domestic animal; but it is impossible to make it leave off its habit of stealing In the dark it creeps to the poultry, and kills a whole flock in one night. Sugar and other sweet things must be carefully hidden; for if the chests and boxes are not always locked, it gets into them and eats the sugar with its paw. The ladies, therefore, have some complaint against it every day. The gray and flying squirrels are so tamed by the boys that they sit on their shoulders and follow them everywhere. The turkey cocks and hens run about in the woods of this country and differ in no respect from our tame ones, except in their superior size and more palatable flesh. When their eggs are found in the woods and put under tame turkey hens, the young ones become tame; however, when they grow up, it sometimes happens that they fly away; their wings are therefore commonly clipped when they are young. Wild geese are likewise tamed in the following manner. When the wild geese first come hither in the spring and stop a little while the people try to shoot them on the wing. They then row to the place where the wild goose falls, catch it and keep it for some time at home; by this means many of them have been made so tame that when they were let out in the morning they returned in the evening; but to be more sure of them, their wings are commonly clipped. Partridges which are here in abundance, can be so far tamed as to run about all day with the poultry, coming along with them to be fed. In the same manner I have seen wild pigeons so tame that they will fly out and return again. [119] I.e. buffalo.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">29. Gossip about Bears and Mosquitoes BY PETER KALM (1748) BEARS are very numerous higher up in the country, and do much mischief. Mr. Bartram told me, that when a bear catches a cow, he kills her in the following manner. He bites a hole into the hide, and blows with all his power into it, till the animal swells excessively and dies; for the air expands greatly between the flesh and the hide. [120] An old Swede, called Nils Gustave's son, who was ninety-one years of age, said, that in his youth, the bears had been very frequent hereabouts, but that they had seldom attacked the cattle. Whenever a bear was killed, its flesh was prepared like pork, and it had a very good taste. The flesh of bears is still prepared like ham, on the river Morris. The environs of Philadelphia, and even the whole province of Pennsylvania in general, contain very few bears, for they have been extirpated by degrees. In Virginia they kill them in several different ways. Their flesh is eaten by both rich and poor, since it is reckoned equal in goodness to pork. In some parts of this province, where no hogs can be kept, on account of the great numbers of bears, the people are used to catch and kill them, and to use them instead of hogs. The American bears, however, are said to be less fierce and dangerous than the European ones. The gnats, which are very troublesome at night here, are called mosquitoes. They are exactly like the gnats in Sweden, only somewhat smaller. In daytime or at night they come into the houses and when the people have gone to bed they begin their disagreeable humming, approach nearer to the bed, and at last suck up so much blood that they can hardly fly away. Their bite causes blisters on people with delicate skins. When the weather has been cool for some days, the mosquitoes disappear. But when it changes again, and especially after a rain, they gather frequently in such quantities about the houses that their numbers are astonishing. The chimneys which have no valves for shutting them out afford the gnats a free entrance into the houses of the English. In sultry evenings the mosquitoes accompany the cattle in great swarms from the woods to the houses, or to town, and when the cattle are driven past the houses the gnats fly in wherever they can. In the greatest heat of the summer they are so numerous in some places, that the air seems to be quite full of them, especially near swamps and stagnant water, such as the river Morris in New Jersey. The inhabitants therefore make a big fire before the houses to expel these disagreeable guests by the smoke. The old Swedes here say that gnats have formerly been much more numerous; that even at present they swarm in vast quantities on the seashore near the salt water; and that those which troubled us this autumn in Philadelphia were of a more poisonous kind than they commonly used to be. This last quality appeared from the blisters which were formed on the spots where the gnats had made their sting. In Sweden I never felt any other inconvenience from their sting than a little itching while they sucked. But when they stung me here at night my face was so disfigured by little red spots and blisters that I was almost ashamed to show myself. [120] This does not seem very likely; and Professor Kalm did not say that he had ever seen it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">30. Bullfrogs [121] BY PETER KALM (1749) BULLFROGS are a large species of frogs which I had an opportunity of hearing and seeing to-day. As I was riding out, I heard a roaring before me; and I thought it was a bull in the bushes, on the other side of the dyke, though the sound was rather more hoarse than that of a bull. I was however afraid, that a bad goring bull might be near me, though I did not see him. I continued to think so till some hours after, when I talked with some Swedes about the bullfrogs, and, by their account, I immediately found that I had heard their voice. The Swedes told me, that there were numbers of them in the dyke. I afterwards hunted for them. Of all the frogs in this country, this is doubtless the greatest. I am told, that towards autumn, as soon as the air begins to grow a little cool, they hide themselves under the mud, which lies at the bottom of ponds and stagnant waters, and lie there torpid during winter. As soon as the weather grows mild, towards summer, they begin to get out of their holes, and croak. If the spring, that is, if the mild weather, begins early, they appear about the end of March; but if it happens late, they tarry under water till late in April. Their places of abode are ponds and bogs of stagnant water; they are never in any flowing water. When many of them croak together, they make an enormous noise. Their croak exactly resembles the roaring of an ox or bull which is somewhat hoarse. They croak so loud that two people talking by the side of a pond cannot understand each other. They croak all together; then stop a little, and begin again. It seems as if they had a captain among them: for when he begins to croak, all the others follow; and when he stops, the others are all silent. In day time they seldom make any great noise, unless the sky is covered. The night is their croaking time; and, when all is calm, you may hear them, though you are near a mile and a half off. When they croak, they commonly are near the surface of the water, under the bushes, and have their heads out of the water. Therefore, by going slowly, one may get close up to then before they go away. As soon as they are quite under water, they think themselves safe, though the water be very shallow. Sometimes they sit at a good distance from the pond; but as soon as they suspect any danger, they hasten with great leaps into the water. They are very expert at hopping. A full-grown bullfrog talcs near three yards at one hop. I have often been told by the old Swedes the following story, which happened here, at the time when the Indians lived with the Swedes. It is well known, that the Indians are excellent runners. I have seen them, at Governor Johnson's, equal the best horse in its swiftest course, and almost pass by it. Therefore, in order to try how well the bullfrogs could leap, some of the Swedes laid a wager with a young Indian, that he could not overtake the frog, provided it had two leaps before hand. They carried a bullfrog, which they had caught in a pond, upon a field, and burnt his back. The fire, and the Indian, who endeavored to keep close up to the frog, had such an effect upon the animal, that it made its long hops across the field, as fast as it could. The Indian began to pursue the frog with all his might at the proper time The noise he made in running frightened the poor frog. Probably it was afraid of being tortured with fire again; therefore it redoubled its leaps, and by that means it reached the pond before the Indian could overtake it. In some years they are more numerous than in others. Nobody could tell, whether the snakes had ever ventured to eat them, though they eat all the lesser kinds of frogs. The women are no friends to these frogs, because they kill and eat young ducklings and goslings. Sometimes they carry off chickens that come too near the ponds. I have not observed that they bite when they are held in the hands, though they have little teeth. When they are beaten they cry out almost like children. I was told that some eat the thighs of the hind legs, and that they are very palatable. [121] This seems like a large story: this kind of bullfrogs must have disappeared, for nobody sees them now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">31. Rattlesnakes (1756) I WILL give here an account of that infamous reptile, the rattle-snake, which is considered the most dangerous of any poisonous creature known in this part of the world. [122] The rattle-snake hardly ever measures out six feet in length. He has a gorgeous skin or coat, that may vie with any rich brocade. His summer haunt is in meadows and swampy grounds among long grass. During the winter season he harbors in the ground or in the sides of hills where there are craggy stones. They are said to lie together in numbers. Their age may be known by the number of rings upon their tail. But it is certainly a mistake that the rings grow single, one every year. Were that the case, some that I have seen must have been eight or ten years old. But having had the curiosity to take in pieces one of these rattles, I found the parts which must be of one year's growth, to consist of two rings and a small tip. The next year there grows such another part under the first, which thrusts it off from the flesh, and it remains like a cap upon it. That protuberance which is next the tip holds it on. In like manner the succeeding growths are made. This curious member nature has designed for giving persons warning, when they happen unwarily to approach too near the snake. [123] A man has just time to recollect himself, and stop his pace before he comes in immediate danger of a bite; which will be within distance of the snake's length. For if he lay at his full stretch before, as soon as any one comes near him, he draws himself in. He is then wound up in a close coil, with his tail pointed upward, and his head laid back. And he gives his rattle such a brisk shake, that it sounds like the tremulous motion of a musical chord. Then if the person does not stop or divert his course, he instantly flings out upon him. The teeth of this snake are curved, exquisitely fine and sharp, two on each side the gum. They are shut up like a cat's claw till when he goes to bite. Sometimes the mowers happen to stumble over them and receive no hurt; but they always give the signal when they are prepared for mischief. [122] Rattlesnakes were very common in all the rough and stony parts of the country, but have now almost disappeared in settled regions. [123] Probably nature intended the snake to frighten his enemies by the sound.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">32. A King's Nephews and Nieces BY CAPTAIN ARTHUR BARLOWE (1584) [124] THE twenty-seventh day of April in the year 1584, we departed from England, with two barks well furnished with men and victuals, after receiving our last directions by your letters and also your commands delivered by yourself upon our leaving the river Thames. The second of July, we found shoal water, where we smelt as sweet and as strong a smell as if we had been in the midst of some delicate garden abounding with all kinds of flowers, by which scent we were assured, that the land could not be far distant. Keeping good watch, and bearing but slack sail, the fourth day of the same month we arrived upon a coast, which we supposed to be, a continent. [125] We sailed along this coast for a hundred and twenty English miles before we could find any entrance or any river issuing into the sea. The first opening that appeared to us we entered, though not without some difficulty, casting anchor about three harquebus shot [126] within the haven's mouth on the left hand side. [127] After we had given thanks to God for our safe arrival thither, we manned our boats, and went to view the land next adjoining, and "to take possession of the same, in the right of the Queen's most excellent Majesty, as rightful Queen and Princess of the same." [128] This being performed, according to the ceremonies used in such enterprises, we viewed the land about us, finding it very sandy and low toward the water's side, but so full of grapes that the very beating and surge of the sea overflowed the fruit. We passed from the sea side towards the tops of those hills next adjoining, and from thence beheld the sea on both sides, to the north and to the south, finding no end in either direction. This land we found to be only an island, twenty miles long and nearly six miles broad. Under the bank or hill whereon we stood, we beheld the valleys filled with goodly cedar trees, and having discharged our harquebus-shot, a flock of white cranes arose under us, with such a cry redoubled by many echoes, as might be made if an army of men shouted altogether. We remained by the side of this island two whole days before we saw any people of the country: on the third day we espied one small boat rowing towards us, having in it three persons. This boat came to the island side, four harquebus-shot from our ships, and two of the people remaining there, the third came along the shore side toward us. We were all on board; he walked up and down upon the point of the land next to us. Then the master and the pilot of the "Admiral," Simon Ferdinando, and the Captain Philip Amadas, myself, and others rowed to the land. Our coming did not make this fellow show any fear or doubt. After he had spoken of many things not understood by us, [129] we brought him with his own good liking aboard the ships, and gave him a shirt, a hat and some other things, and made him taste of our wine and our meat, which he liked very well. After looking carefully at both barks, he departed, and went to his own boat which he had left in a little cove or creek nearby. As soon as he was INDIAN WARRIORS. Black and white illustration of men wearing what appear to be square snowshoes and hunting a boar and a deer. two bow shot into the water, he fell to fishing, and in less than half an hour, he had laden his boat as deep as it could swim. With this he came again to the point of land, and there he divided his fish into two parts, pointing out one part for the ship, and the other for the pinnace. [130] Thus, after he had requited as far as he could the benefits he had received, he departed out of our sight. The next day there came unto us divers boats, and in one of them the King's brother, accompanied with forty or fifty men, very handsome and goodly people' and in their behaviour as mannerly and civil as any, in Europe. His name was Granganimeo, and the King is called Wingina, [131] the country Wingandacoa, and now by her Majesty, Virginia. [132] The King is greatly obeyed, and his brothers and children reverenced. The King himself in person was at the time, sorely wounded in a fight which he had had with the King of the next country. A day or two after this, we fell to trading with them, exchanging some things that we had, for deer skins. When we showed him our whole store of merchandise, of all the things that he saw, a bright tin dish pleased him most. After two or three days the King's brother came aboard the ships and drank wine, and ate of our meat and of our bread, and liked it exceedingly. Then after a few days had passed, he brought his wife with him to the ships, his daughter and two or three children. His wife was very well favored, of medium stature and very bashful. She had on her back a long cloak of leather, with the fur side next to her body. About her forehead she had a band of white coral. In her ears she had bracelets of pearls hanging down to her waist. The rest of her women of the better sort had pendants of copper hanging in either ear, and some of the children of the King's brother and other noblemen, had five or six in either ear. He himself had upon his head a broad plate of gold or copper, for being unpolished we knew not which metal it might be, neither would he by any means suffer us to take it off his head. His apparel was like his wife's, only the women wear their hair long on both sides of the head, and the men on but one side. They are of color yellowish, and their hair black for the most part, and yet we saw children who had very fine auburn and chestnut colored hair. [124] This account is a part of a letter written by Captain Barlowe to Sir Walter Raleigh, who fitted out the expedition. [125] This makes the voyage sixty-eight days.

      <field name="fulltext">33. Indian Home Life BY WILLIAM STRACHEY (1610-1612) THE drink of the Indians is like that of the Turks, clear water. For although they have grapes in abundance, they have not learned the use of them. They have not found out how to press them into wine. Pears or apples they have none with which to make cider. The men spend their time in fishing, hunting, wars, and such manlike exercises out of doors. They scorn to be seen in any woman's work. This is the reason why the women are very busy and the men so idle. Their fishing is often much in boats which they call quintans. They make one out of a tree by burning and scraping away the coals with bones and shells, till they have made it in the form of a trough. [133] Instead of oars they use paddles and sticks. They row faster than we can in our barges. They have nets for fishing, which are made of the barks of certain trees, and of deer sinews. There is a kind of grass out of which their women spin a very even thread, rolling it with their hands. This thread serves for many purposes. They use it to make coverings, to sew their garments of feathers, and to make their leggings. With it, also, they make lines for fishing. In the time of their hunting, they leave their habitations and gather themselves into companies; and then they go to the wildest places with their families. There they pass their time in hunting and getting wild fowl. In the time of hunting every man will try to do his best to show his skill. For by excelling in the chase they obtain the favor of the women. While they are hunting in deserts or wildernesses there are commonly two or three hundred together With the sunrising they call up one another and go forth searching for the herd of deer. When they have found it they encircle it with many fires. Between the fires, they place themselves, making the most terrible noise that they can. The deer, frightened by the fires and the voices, betake them to their heels. The Indians chase them so long within that circle, that many times they kill six, eight, ten, or fifteen in a morning. Hares, partridges, turkeys, fat or lean, young or old, even in laying or in brooding time, they devour. At no time do they spare any that they can catch. [134] There is a kind of exercise that they have among them much like that which boys call bandy in English. [135] Likewise, they have the exercise of football. [136] In this they only use the foot forcibly to carry the ball from the one to the other. They kick it to the goal with a kind of skill and swift footmanship, to excel in which is thought a great honor. But they never strike up one another's heels, as we do. They do not consider it praiseworthy to win a goal by such an advantage. The spare time between their sleep and meals they usually use in gayety, dancing, and singing. For their kind of music, they have different instruments. They have a kind of cane on which they pipe. [137] These can hardly be sounded without great straining of the breath. Upon these instruments they keep a certain rude time. But their chief instruments are rattles, made of small gourds or of shells. These mingled with their voices, sometimes twenty or thirty together, make such a terrible howling as would rather frighten than give pleasure to any man. The women love children very dearly. To make their children hardy they wash them in the coldest mornings in the rivers. By painting and ointments, they so tan their skin, that after a year o. two no weather will hurt them. To practice their children in the use of their bows and arrows, the mother does not give them their breakfast in a morning until they have hit a mark which she sets for them to shoot at. So skilful do they expect the children to become, that the mother often throws up in the air a piece of moss which the boy must hit as it falls, with his arrow. If he does not succeed he cannot have his breakfast. [133] These are "dugouts" or wooden canoes; further north birch canoes were used. [134] In England game laws forbid the killing of birds at certain times. [135] Bandy = hockey: the game was probably lacrosse. [136] Football in England was very rough, and there was plenty foul tackling. [137] A sort of flute.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">34. The Capture of Pocahontas, the Little Indian Princess BY RAPHE HAMOR(1613-1614) [138] POCAHONTAS. Black and white illustration: portrait of a woman. IT chanced that Powhatan's delight and darling, his daughter Pocahontas, whose fame has been spread even in England, took the pleasure to visit her friends at the Potomac. Her friends had been sent thither like shopkeepers at a fair, to exchange some of her father's commodities for those of this region. She came in the absence of Captain Argall. When she had been staying here some three months or longer, it happened that Captain Argall arrived in search either of hope or profit. Pocahontas, desirous to renew her familiarity with the English, and delighting to see them, said she would gladly visit them, keeping herself unknown, perhaps because she was afraid of being seized. No sooner had Captain Argall received intelligence of her, than he planned with an old friend and adopted brother of his, called Japazeus, how and by what means he might procure her as a captive. [139] He told the Indian that now or never was the time to give pleasure to his friend, if he really possessed that love of which he had made profession. Captain Argall told him that as a ransom for Pocahontas-he might recover some of our English men and arms, now in the possession of her father. He promised to use her fairly and with gentle treatment. Japazeus, fully assured that his brother would use her courteously as he promised, gave in turn his word that he would use his best endeavors and secrecy to accomplish this desire. And thus he wrought it, making his own wife an instrument to aid his plot. For Japazeus agreed that his wife, Pocahontas, and himself would accompany his brother, Captain Argall, to the waterside. Then, according to the plan, his wife should feign a great and longing desire to go aboard the ship, for although it had been in port three or four times before, she had never seen it. She was to be earnest with her husband, begging him to give her permission. [140] Then he was to seem angry with her, and to pretend that her request was needless, especially since she had women with her to bear her company; and she in turn was to pretend to take it unkindly, feigning to weep; whereupon her husband, seeming to pity those counterfeit tears, was to give her leave to go aboard, only if it pleased Pocahontas to accompany her. Now came the greatest labor, to win Pocahontas to go with her, for perhaps she might feel responsible on account of her father's wrong treatment of the English, even though she supposed herself unknown. By earnest persuasions, Pocahontas assented, and forthwith aboard they went. The best cheer that could be made was seasonably provided. To supper they went, merry on all hands, especially Japazeus and his wife, who, to express their joy, would once in a while tread upon Captain Argall's foot, as if to say, "'Tis done; she is your own." Supper ended, Pocahontas was lodged in the gunner's rooms, where Japazeus and his wife left her, because they desired to hold a conference with "their brother." This conference was only to acquaint him by what stratagem they had betrayed his prisoner. After this discourse they went to sleep, and Pocahontas as well, mistrusting nothing of their plot Nevertheless, a little frightened and anxious to return, she was up first in the morning and hastened to Japazeus, urging him to be gone. But Captain Argall well rewarded him secretly with a small copper kettle and some other less valuable ,trifles, which he so highly valued that doubtless he would have betrayed his own father for them. Argall permitted both Japazeus and his wife to return on shore, and in the hearing of others he told Japazeus as he went away that he should keep Pocahontas because the father of Pocahontas held as prisoners eight of our Englishmen, many swords, firearms, and other tools which he had at several times by treacherous murders taken from our men. Whereupon she began to be exceedingly pensive and discontented, although still ignorant of the treachery of Japazeus; in outward appearance, he was no less unhappy than she was herself that he should be the means of her captivity. [138] The author of this piece lived among the Indians. Powhatan was the most powerful Indian living near the English in the colony of Virginia. Argall was governor. [139] Japazeus was an Indian who had gone through a ceremony of brotherhood with Argall. [140] The plot was that Japazeus's wife should make it seem a favor to her for Pocahontas to go on board.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">35. In Powhatan's Country [141] BY RAPHE HAMOR (1613-1614) MUCH ado there was to persuade Pocahontas to be patient. With extraordinary courteous usage they accomplished this little by little, and so to Jamestown she was brought, and a messenger to her father was forewith despatched to tell him that his only daughter was in the hands and possession of the English. There she was to be kept until such time as he would ransom her with our men, swords, arms, and other tools treacherously taken from us. The news was unwelcome and troublesome to him, partly for the love he bare to his daughter and partly to the love he bare to our men his prisoners, of whom he made great use although with us they seemed unfitted for any employment. [142] And those swords and firearms of ours, though they were of no use to him, delighted him just to look upon. He could not without long advice and deliberation with his council, resolve upon anything, and it is really true that we heard nothing from him till three months afterwards. Then by persuasion of others he returned seven of our men, and with each of them an unserviceable musket. By them he sent us word that whenever we pleased to deliver his daughter, he would give us in satisfaction of the injuries he had done to us, and for the rest of our firearms broken and stolen from him, would pay five hundred bushels of corn and be forever friends with us. The men and arms we received in part payment, and returned to him for an answer that his daughter was very weld, and was kindly treated, and should be well treated, however he dealt with us: but we could not believe that the rest of our arms were either lost or stolen from him and therefore until he returned them all, we would not by any means deliver his daughter Then it should be at his choice whether he would establish peace or continue enemies with us This answer as it seemed did not please him very well for we heard no more from him till last March Then with Captain Argall's ship and some other vessels belonging to the colony, Sir Thomas Dale with an hundred and fifty men well equipped went up into Powhatan's river, where his chief habitations were We carried with us his daughter, either to move them to fight for her, if such were their courage and boldness, or to restore the remainder of our goods, that is our swords, arms, and tools. We proceeded and had entered the narrows of the river, where the channel lay within shot of the shore, when from an ambush they let their arrows fly amongst us in our ship. We were justly provoked, and forthwith manned our boats, went ashore and burned in that very place some forty houses; and of the things we found therein, we made free booty and pillage. As they themselves afterwards confessed us, we wounded and killed five or six of their men. With this revenge, we satisfied ourselves for their presumption in shooting at us. The critical time now came; we went the higher up the river, and anchored near Powhatan's residence. Here at a town called Matchot were assembled about four hundred men well appointed with their bows and arrows to welcome us. They dared us to come ashore, a thing which we had planned before; so ashore we went. [141] A continuation of the previous story. [142] Probably they had run away to the Indians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">36. The Wedding of Pocahontas [143] BY RAPHE HAMOR (1613-1614) Two of Powhatan's sons came to us who were very desirous to see their sister, there present on the shore with us. They rejoiced greatly at the sight of Pocahontas and at her well-being, for they had suspected that she would be badly treated, although they had often heard the contrary. They promised that they would persuade their father to redeem her and to conclude a firm peace forever with us. Upon this resolution the two brothers went on board our boat with us. We had already despatched two Englishmen, Master John Rolfe and Master Sparkes to acquaint their father with the business in hand. The next day these men returned saying that they had not been admitted to Powhatan's presence; but they had spoken with his brother Apachamo, his successor, who had already the command of all the people; and promised his best endeavors to further our just request. It was then April and the time of year called us to our business at home, to prepare ground and to plant corn for our winter's provisions; so we departed upon these terms, giving the Indians respite till harvest, to decide what was best for them to do. We told them clearly that if a final agreement were not made between us before that time, we should return again and destroy or take away all their corn, burn all the houses upon that river, leave not a fishing weir standing nor a canoe in any creek thereabouts, and kill as many of them as we could. Long before this time, a gentleman of approved behavior and honest carriage, Master John Rolfe fell in love with Pocahontas and she with him. Of this fact I made Sir Thomas Dale aware by a letter from Master John Rolfe, even while we were conferring and making conditions with Powhatan's men In the letter Rolfe begged Dale's advice and assistance in his love, if it seemed to him for the good of the Plantation. [144] Pocahontas herself told her brothers about it. Sir Thomas Dale's approval of the match was the only reason why he was so mild amongst Powhatan's people. Otherwise he would not have departed from their river, without other conditions. The rumor of this intended marriage soon came to Powhatan's knowledge and was acceptable to him, as appeared by his sudden consent thereto. Some ten days after he sent an old uncle of hers, named Opachisco, to give her away in the church as his deputy, and two of his sons to see the marriage solemnized. This was done about the fifth of April, and ever since then we have had friendly relations not only with Powhatan himself, but also with his subjects round about us; so that now I see no reason why the colony should not thrive apace. [143] Continuation of the previous story. [144] The Jamestown settlement was commonly spoken of as the Plantation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">37. Children of Moshup turned into Fishes BY THOMAS COOPER (1620) [145] THE first Indian who came to Martha's Vineyard was brought there with his dog on a cake of ice. When he came to Gay Head, he found a very large man whose name was Moshup. He had a wife and five children, four sons and one daughter. He lived in a den. He used to catch whales and then pull up trees and make a fire and roast them. The coals of the trees and the bones of the whales are now to be seen. After he was tired of staying here, he told his children to go and play ball on a beach that joined No Man's Land to Gay Head. He then made a mark with his toe across the beach at each end. He made it so deep that the water came in and cut away the beach, so that his children were in fear of drowning. They took their sister up, and held her out of the water. He told them to act as if they were going to kill whales, and they were all turned into fishes. The sister was dressed in large stripes. The father gave then a strict order always to be kind to her. His wife mourned the loss of her children so greatly that he threw her away. She fell upon Seconet, near the rocks, where she lived some time, begging from all who passed on the water. After a while she was changed into a stone. The entire shape of her remained for many years. But after the English came, some of them broke off the arms and head; but most of the body is there to this day. Moshup went away, no one knew where. He never talked with the Indians, but he was kind to them, by sending whales ashore for them to eat. But after there grew to be too many Indians around him, he left them. [145] A half-blooded Indian about sixty years old told these stories. He said they were told to him by his grandmother who was a strong girl when the English first came among her people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">38. A Chieftain's Lament BY PASSACONNAWAY (1660) [146] HEARKEN to the words of your father. I am an old oak that has withstood the storms of more than a hundred winters. Leaves and branches have been stripped from me by the winds and frosts. My eyes are dim. My limbs totter. I must soon fall! But when young and strong, my bow could be bent by no young man of the Pennacooks. My arrows would pierce a deer at a hundred yards, and I could bury my hatchet in a sapling up to the handle. No wigwam then had so many furs. No pole had so many scalp locks as Passaconnaway's! [147] Then I delighted in war. The whoop of the Pennacooks was heard upon the Mohawk and no voice so loud as Passaconnaway's. The scalps upon the pole of my wigwam told the story of Mohawk suffering. The English came, they seized our lands; I sat me down at Pennacook. They followed upon my footsteps. I made war upon them, but they fought with fire and thunder. [148] My young men were swept down before me, when no one was near them. I tried magic against them, but they still increased and got the better of me and mine. [149] I gave place to them and came to my beautiful island of Natticook. I, that can make the dry leaf turn green and live again I, that can take the rattlesnake in my palm as I would a worm, without harm I, who have had communion with the Great Spirit dreaming and awake I am powerless before the pale faces. The oak will soon break before the whirlwind. It shivers and shakes even now. Soon its trunk will be fallen the ant and the worm will sport upon it! Then think, my children, of what I say. I commune with the Great Spirit. He whispers to me now: "Tell your people peace, peace, is the only hope of your race. I have given fire and thunder to the pale faces for weapons. I have made them plentier than the leaves of the forest, and still shall they increase! These meadows shall turn with the plough. These forests shall fall by the axe. The pale faces shall live upon your hunting-grounds, and make their villages upon your fishing-places!" The Great Spirit says this and it must be so! We are few and powerless before them ! We must bend before the storm! The wind blows hard! The old oak trembles! Its branches are gone! Its sap is frozen! It bends! It falls! Peace, peace with the white men is the command of the Great Spirit and the wish the last wish of Passaconnaway. [146] Passaconnaway was chieftain of the Pennacook Indians, in the Merrimac River. No one set down his speech at the time, but this is the spirit of his words. [147] At the doors of the lodges the Indians set up poles, ornamented with the scalps of those whom they had killed. [148] I.e. they went west and attacked the fierce Iroquois. [149] The English muskets seemed strange to the Indians on account of the dash of light and noise made when one was fired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">39. Indian School-Boys BY CAPTAIN DANIEL GOOKIN (1674) PART I [150] THAT which I shall here offer, may be included under two heads. First, that our utmost efforts be used, with all industry and diligence, that the Indians, especially the children and youth, may be taught to speak, read, and write, the English tongue. For this end I propose, first, that as many of their children as may be procured, with the free Consent of their parents and relations, be placed in sober and Christian families, as apprentices, until the youths are twenty-one years, and the maids are eighteen INDIAN WRITINGS. Black and white illustration of a kind of hieroglyphics — pictures used as words. years of age: the boys to be instructed in the trades practiced by their masters; and the girls in good housewifery of all sorts: with this provision in all contracts and indentures, that they shall be taught to read and write the English tongue at the cost of their masters. And this may be easily accomplished, because servants are scarce in New England. The ordering of this affair must be committed to the management of prudent persons, who have an interest in the Indians, and who may be able, by their authority and wisdom, so to argue the case with the Indians, as to convince them that such a plan is for their children's good. For Indians are generally so indulgent to their children, that they are not easily persuaded to give them over to the English. Secondly, another way for bringing this matter to pass, is by setting up one or two free schools, to teach them to read and write English. But this thing hath some difficulty in it; partly because a person suitable to be a schoolmaster will not be willing to leave the English society, and to live constantly among the Indians, as such a work would require. There is also the question as to how the Indian children that are sent to school, shall be provided with food and clothing, without charge on the Indian property of the Indian tribe. The only exception to this should be a blue coat for each of them once a year, which will not cost much, but will greatly encourage the Indians. [151] For the accomplishing of this matter for the Indians within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, I have consulted and advised with Mr. Eliot; [152] and we both joined in a proposal to the honored commissioners of the United Colonies, at their last meeting. I have consulted also with most of the principal rulers and teachers of the praying Indians, [153] and they have generally agreed and approved the expedient following. PART II THERE is an Indian village, within twenty-eight or thirty miles from Boston, westward upon the road to Connecticut, called Okommakamesit, otherwise Marlborough, which lieth very near the centre of most of the praying villages. This Indian plantation [154] joineth unto an English town called Marlborough; so that the English and Indian plantations bear the same name. In this Indian plantation there is a piece of fertile land, containing above one hundred and fifty acres, upon which the Indians have lived for some little time, and they have planted apple-trees thereupon which bear an abundance of fruit. This parcel of land, with the addition of twenty acres of the nearest meadow, and a woodland of about fifty acres, is well worth two hundred pounds in money. [155] Yet the Indians will willingly devote it to this work; for it brings little or no profit to them, nor is it ever like to do so. The Englishmen's cattle devour all in it, because it lies open and unfenced; and while the Indians planted there, it was in a way fenced by them; yet by their improvidence and bad fences, they reaped little benefit in those times; and that was one cause of their removal. Now I propose that. the parcel of land above described, be set apart for an Indian free school, and confirmed by an act of the General Court of this colony, for this end forever: [156] and that it be fenced with a stone wall into two or three enclosures for cow pastures. This may be done easily, because there are stones enough at hand upon it. Then to build a convenient house for a schoolmaster and his family, and under the same roof may be room for a school: also to build some outhouses for hay, and cattle The cost of all this will not amount to above two hundred pounds in money. When this is done, the place will be fit to accommodate a schoolmaster and his family, without any other salary than the use of this farm. Moreover, it is very probable, that the English people of Marlborough, will gladly and readily send their children to the same school, paying the schoolmaster for them. This will better his income and be good for them, for they have no school in that place at the present. In regard to this plan, I have heard some of the most prudent white people lament; but it is expensive to raise a school and support a schoolmaster for twenty or thirty children, and the inhabitants are backward in doing it. The laws of the colony require every village consisting of fifty families, to provide a school to teach the English tongue and to write; but these people of Marlborough, because they have not quite fifty families, take that low advantage so as to ease their purses of this common charge. [157] But as soon as this school herein proposed, is set up, it will be to their interest to put their children to it, because this will be the cheapest and easiest way that they can take. By my plan the schoolmaster will reap an advantage in his neighborhood, and be in communion with the English church at Marlborough. This will tend to remove the first difficulty. Besides, the English and Indian children will learn together in the same school, and that will promote the Indians' learning to speak the English tongue. Of this we have had experience, when Indian children were taught by English schoolmasters at Roxbury and Cambridge, in former years. Then several Indian children were kept at those schools. A second difficulty is this: how shall these Indian children, though they have their schooling free, be provided with diet [158] and clothing, without public charge? I answer, that I have conferred with several of the most prudent and judicious Indians of the other towns, who think there will be no difficulty to provide board for their children, by procuring it at reasonable rates from the Indians, their countrymen, who inhabit Marlborough. And as for clothing, a little serves them, and that of a poor sort, and their parents can provide it, especially if the Honorable Corporation order them a blue coat once a year in the beginning of winter, and also provide them with books. [150] Apprentices were placed by their parents or guardians with master workmen, who agreed to teach them trades or household work. [151] A blue coat was a blue blanket.

      <field name="fulltext">40. Rescued from Captivity BY INCREASE MATHER (1677) [159] BETWEEN sunset and dark the Indians came upon us. Another man and I who were together ran away at the outcry the Indians made. They were shouting and shooting at some others of the English that were close by. We took for our place of safety a swamp that was near. The Indians seeing us so near teem, ran after us and shot many guns at us. Three shots were fired upon me, while the Indians were quite close to me. As the swamp was muddy I slipped and fell down: whereupon one of the enemy stepped up to me, with his hatchet lifted up to knock me on the head. He thought I was so hurt by my fall that I could not go any farther. As it happened, I had a pistol with me, which I pointed at the Indian. He stepped back thinking it was loaded, but it was not. He said if I would give myself up, I should have no hurt; he added that the woods were full of Indians. So I gave myself up and by three of them was lcd away. Two other Indians came running to us; and one lifted up the end of his gun to knock me on the head. But the other put up his hand and stopped the blow, and said I was his friend. They now took me, bound me, and led me away. Soon I was brought into the company of other captives that were that day brought away from the town of Hatfield. It was cause for both sorrow and joy to see the other people: for company in such a sad condition was a comfort, though of little help in any way. Then we were all bound and led away in the night over the mountains. Through dark and awful places, we went at least four miles, before we found a place for a brief rest. This was in a dismal place of woods on the side of the mountain. We were kept bound all that night. The Indians kept waking, and we had little mind to sleep in this night's travel. The Indians scattered, and as they went made strange noises, as of wolves, and owls, and other wild beasts. This was so that they would not lose each other, or be discovered by the English. About the break of day, we marched again and went over a great river. There we rested, and the Indians marked out upon trays the number of their prisoners, as their custom is. Here I was again in great danger. A quarrel arose about me over a question as to whose captive I was; for three took me. I thought I must be killed to end the trouble; so when they put it to me, whose I was, I said three Indians took me. So they agreed to have all a share in me; and I had now three masters. That one was my chief master who laid hands on me first, and so I was fallen into the hands of the worst of all the company. In this place they gave us some food which they had seized from the English. The next night found us in another dismal place. We were then staked down and spread out on our backs; and so we lay all night, yes, so we lay many nights. [160] They told me their law was that we should lie so nine nights. By that time, it was thought, we should no longer know where we were. The manner of staking down was this: our arms and legs stretched out were staked down fast, and a cord was about our necks, so that we could not stir. The next day we crossed the river again, and there we took up our quarters for a long time. We were now so many miles away, that the Indians were quite out of all fear of the English. But they were now in great fear of other tribes of Indians. Here they built a long wigwam. Here they had a great dance, as they call it, and decided to burn three of us. They had got bark to, do it with, and as I understood afterwards, I was one that was to be burnt. Though I knew not which was to be burnt, yet I knew some were intended for that: so much I understood of their language. The next day when we were to be burnt, our master and some others took our part, and so the evil was prevented in this place. Here I had a shirt brought to me to make. One of my Indian masters said it should be made this way, a second said another way, a third his way. I told them I would make it the way my chief master said. Then one Indian struck me on the face with his fist. I suddenly rose up in anger ready to strike too: Upon this there was a great hubbub. I had to humble myself to my master and so that matter ended. While we were here one of the English captives made his escape from them; and when the news of his escape came, we were all called in and bound. One of the Indians, a captain among them, and always our great friend, met me coming in: he told me about the run-away. The Indians were very angry, and spoke of burning us. They held court, and it was decided that the Indian that let the run-away go was the person to blame. So no harm was done to us. While we lingered here food grew scarce. One bear foot must serve five of us for a whole day. Then we parted into two companies. Some went one way and some another way. We went over a great mountain. We were eight days going over it, and travelled very hard. Every day we had either snow or rain. Here also we lacked food. We came to a lake and stayed there a great while to make canoes to go over the lake. Here I was almost frozen and here we almost starved. All the Indians went hunting but got nothing. Then they wished the English to pray and see what the Englishman's God could do. So we prayed. The Indians came believingly, night and morning, to our prayers. Next day they got bears. Then they would have us give thanks to God at meals. But after a while they grew tired of this, and the chief stopped it. Then a storm overtook us. And I was for several days without food. When I came to travel in the ice I soon tired. Two Indians ran away; and one only was left. He would carry me a while and then I would walk a while. He carried me to a Frenchman's house, and set me down. There they gave me food and drink and sent for the doctor, who said he could cure me. My Indian master was in want of money, and pawned me to the white man for fourteen beaver skins. But he could not get the beavers, and so I was sold. But by being thus sold, I was in God's good time set at liberty and returned to my friends in New England. [159] Several persons who have been taken prisoners by the Indians tell touching stories concerning the goodness of God in carrying them through many dangers, and at last setting them in a safe place again. Here is one man's story in his own words. [160] A common practice of the Indians, to prevent their captives from escaping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">41. The Pipe of Peace BY MONSIEUR JONTEL (1679) WHILE we halted on the bank of a river to eat, we heard the tinkling. of some small bells. This made us look about and we spied an Indian with a naked sword-blade in his hand. It was adorned with feathers of several colors, and two large hawks' bells, which made the noise we had heard. PIPE OF PEACE. Black and white illustration of two pipes, each adorned with feathers. He made signs for us to come to him, and gave US to understand that he was sent by the leaders of the Indians to meet us, and bring us to their village. He caressed us in a strange way. I noticed that he took pleasure in ringing the hawks' bells. Having travelled a while with him, we saw a dozen other Indians coming towards us. They made much of us and conducted us to the village, to the chief's cottage. There we found dried bear-skins laid on the ground. They made us sit on these. We were shell treated with eatables, and a throng of women came to see us. The next day the elders came to visit us. They brought us two buffalo hides, the skins of four others, one white wild goat's skin, all of them well dried. They also gave us four bows. These things they gave in return for the present we had before made them. The chief and another Indian came again some time after, bringing two loaves, the finest and the best we had yet seen. Towards evening, we were entertained with a ceremony we had not seen before. A company of elders, with some young men and women, came to our cottage in a body, singing as loud as they could roar. The foremost had a calumet, so they call a very long sort of tobacco-pipe, adorned with several sorts of feathers. When they had sung a while, before our cottage, they entered it, still singing on for about a quarter of a hour. After that they took our priest, whom they considered our chief, and led him in solemn manner out of the cottage, holding him under the arms. When they were come to a place they had ready, one of them laid a great handful of grass on his feet. Two others brought clean water in an earthen dish and washed his face. Then they made him sit down on a skin, put there for the purpose. When the priest was seated, the elders took their places, sitting round about him. The master of the WEAPONS OF WAR. Black and white illustration of two weapons: an axe and a kind of hammer with two sharp points. ceremonies fixed in the ground two little wooden forks. He laid a stick across these; all the things were painted red. He placed on them a buffalo hide dried, a goat's skin over that, and then laid the pipe thereon. The song was begun again, the women joining in the chorus. The concert was made louder by great hollow gourds, in which there were large gravel stones. The Indians struck upon these, keeping time with the notes of the choir. And the most amusing of all was that one of the Indians placed himself behind our priest, to hold him up; at the same time he shook and candled him from side to side, doing all in time with the music. The concert was hardly ended, when the master of the ceremonies brought two maids, one having in her hand a sort of collar, and the other an otter's skin. These they placed on the wooden forks, at the ends of the pipe. Then he made them sit down on each side of our priest, facing each other and with their feet spread out on the ground. Then one of the elders fastened a dyed feather to the back part of the priest's head, tying it to his hair. The singing went on all that time. But the priest grew tired of all this and made signs to us. We made it known to the chief that the priest was not well. So two of the Indians took hold of him under the arms and led him back to the cottage. They made signs to him to take a rest. This was at about nine in the evening and the Indians spent all that night singing. In the morning they went again to the priest, took him again out of the cottage, with the same ceremony, but made him sit down while the singing-was going on. Then the master of the ceremonies took the pipe, filled it with tobacco and lighted it, next he offered it to the priest; but he drew back and came forward six times before he gave it to him. Having at last put it in his hands, the priest made motions as if he were smoking, and gave it back to them. Then they made us all smoke round, every one of them in his turn, the music still going on. The sun was growing very hot, and the bare headed priest made signs that it did him harm. Then at last they stopped singing and took him back into the cottage. They took the pipe and put it into a case made of wild goat's skin, with the two wooden forks and the red stick that lay across them. All of these one of the elders offered the priest. They told him that he might pass through all the Indian nations which were their friends. Because he had this sign of peace, he would every where meet with kindness. This was the first place where we saw the calumet, or pipe of peace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">42. Saving a Flock of Children BY DANIEL NEAL (1607) ALL the plans of the English during the year 1696 seemed to be upset and nothing but murmurings and complaints were to be heard from one end of the Massachusetts province to the other. The Indians on the other hand were strangely exalted with their late success and threatened to ruin the whole country during the next summer. In the meantime they posted themselves so advantageously that it was hardly safe for the people on the frontiers to stir out of their houses. They killed many people who were at work in their fields. To crown the calamities of the year there was a very great scarcity of all sorts of grain, and the poor were ready to break out into riot for want of bread. In the winter the enemy were pretty quiet, but upon the fifteenth of March, they made a descent upon the outskirts of Haverhill, burnt about half a dozen houses and captured thirty-nine persons. Among the prisoners was Hannah Dunston, who was a very brave woman. At this time she was weak and sick in her bed with only her nurse and eight small children in the house, when the Indians surrounded it. Her husband was at work in the field and seeing the enemy at a distance he ran home and bade seven of his eight children to get away as fast as they could to some garrison in the town. He then informed his wife of her danger, but before she could rise the enemy were so near that her husband despaired of being able to carry her off. He took his horse and his firearms, resolving to live or die with his children. He overtook them about forty rods from his house and drove them before him like a flock of sheep as fast as their little legs would carry them till they got to a place of safety about a mile or two from his house. The Indians pursued him all the while, but he kept in the rear of his little flock, and when any of the Indians came within reach of his gun, he aimed at them and they made their retreat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">43. Indian Children at Home BY JOHN FONTAINE (1715) AFTER breakfast, I went down to the Saponey Indian town, which is about a musket-shot from the fort. I walked round to view it. It lies in a plain by the riverside. The houses join all the one to the other, and altogether make a circle. The walls are large pieces of timber, squared, and sharpened at the lower end, which are put down two feet in the ground, and stand about seven feet above the ground. These posts are laid as close as possible the one to the other. When they are all fixed after this manner, they make a roof with rafters, and cover the house with oak or hickory bark, which they strip off in great flakes, and lay it so closely that no rain can come in. Some Indian houses are covered in a circular manner, by getting long saplings, sticking each end in the ground, and so covering them with bark. For entering into this town or circle of houses there are three ways or passages of about six feet wide, between two of the houses. All the doors are on the inside of the ring, and the ground is very level within, making a place which is in common, for all the people to divert themselves. In the centre of the circle is a great stump of a tree. I asked the reason they left that standing, and they informed me it was for one of their head men to stand upon when he had anything of consequence to relate to them, so that being raised, he might the better be heard. The Indian women bind their children to a board that is cut after the shape of the child. two pieces at the bottom of this board to tie the two legs of the child to. The head or top of the board is round, and there is a hole through the top of it for a string to be passed through, so that when the women tire of holding them, or have a mind to work, they hang the board to the limb of a tree, or to a pin in a post for that purpose. There the children swing about and divert themselves, out of the reach of anything that may hurt them. They are kept in this way till nearly two years old, which I believe is the reason they are all so straight, and so few of them lame or odd-shaped. Their houses are pretty large, they have no garrets, and no other light than the door, and that which comes from the hole in the tap of the house, to let INDIAN MONEY. Black and white illustration showing articles that are woven or made from beads. out the smoke. They make their fires always in the middle of the house. The chief of their household goods is a pot, and they have also some wooden dishes and trays, which they make themselves. They seldom have anything to sit upon, but squat upon the ground. They have small divisions in their houses to sleep in, which they make of mats made of bullrushes. They have bedsteads, raised about two feet from the ground, upon which they lay bear and deer skins, and all the covering they have is a blanket. These people have no sort of tame creatures, but live entirely upon their hunting and the corn which their wives cultivate. They live as lazily and miserably as any people in the world. Between the town and the river, upon the riverside, there are several little huts built with wattles, [161] in the form of an oven, with a small door in one end of it. These wattles are plastered on the outside very closely with clay; they are big enough to hold a man, and are called sweating-houses. When they have any sickness, they get ten or twelve pebble stones which they heat in the fire, and when they are red-hot they carry them into these little huts. The sick man or woman goes in with only a blanket, and they shut the door. There they sit and sweat until they are no more able to support it, and then they go out and immediately jump into the water over head and ears, and this is the remedy they have for all distempers. To-day the governor sent for all the young boys, and they brought with them their bows. He got an axe, which he stuck up, and made them all shoot by turns at the eye of the axe, which was about twenty yards distant. Knives and looking-glasses were the prizes for which they shot, and they were very dextrous at this exercise, and often shot through the eye of the axe. This diversion continued about an hour The governor then asked the boys to dance a war dance, so they all prepared for it, and made a great ring. The musician came and sat himself in the middle of the ring. All the instrument he had was a piece of board and two small sticks. The board he set upon his lap, and began to sing a doleful tune; and by striking on the board with his sticks, he accompanied his voice. He made several antic motions, and sometimes shrieked hideously, which was answered by the boys. As the men sung, so the boys danced all round, endeavoring who could outdo the one the other in antic motions and hideous cries, the movements answering in some way to the time of the music. All that I could remark by their actions was, that they were representing how they attacked their enemies, and relating one to the other how many of the other Indians they had killed, and how they did it, making all the motions in this dance as if they were actually in the action. By this lively representation of their warring, one may see the base way they have of surprising and murdering the one the other, and their inhuman manner of murdering all the prisoners, and what terrible cries they have, they who are conquerors. After the dance was over, the governor treated all the boys, but they were so little used to have a stomach full, that they simply devoured their victuals. So this day ended. The next day after breakfast we assembled ourselves, and read the Common Prayer. With us were eight of the Indian boys, who answered very well to the prayers, and understood what was read. After prayers we dined, and in the afternoon we walked abroad to see the land, which is well timbered and very good. We returned to the fort and supped.

      <field name="fulltext">44. The Indian Boy and the Magic Bears [162] THE youngest of the three brothers now decided to go away, because both he and his sister feared that the surviving bears would visit them and do them injury in revenge for what the boy hunter had done to their people. The sister urged her brother to go, and gave him a stone ornament which she wore in her hair, and a large handful of blueberries. The boy hunter still had four arrows. These things he was to use as she instructed him, at a time which would come, when every other means of saving his life failed. Then he started away in a direction new to him, to find a place where he might live in safety. While he was going along slowly one day, he heard behind him a peculiar sound, as of many footsteps. Looking back, he beheld some bears following him, and he at once realized that they had discovered his trail, and that they were now in pursuit of him. He began to run, crying out, "What shall I do? The bears have found my tracks, and are after me!" The country in which he was now passing was an apparently endless prairie, with nothing growing upon it but short grass; but as he flew onward he heard a voice, which said, "So soon as the bears catch you they will kill you; now you must use your arrows." Immediately the boy hunter remembered that he had his weapons and the articles which his sister had given him. Taking an arrow from his quiver, he fixed it to his bowstring, and as he was about to shoot it into the air before him he said to the arrow, "When you come down, there shall be about you a copse covering an area as wide as the range of an arrow. There I shall hide myself." Away flew the arrow, and the moment it struck and entered the earth there was a small hole in the ground, around which sprung up a dense growth of brush The little boy ran to the hole, crawled into it, and then went to the edge of the brush, where he came up and hid by the side of a tree which also had sprung out of the ground. As the bears came to the spot where they had seen the boy disappear, they began to tear up the brush until not a piece remained standing. Not finding the hunter, the bears began to search for his last footprints, and finding that they terminated at the hole made by the arrow they at once followed him. As the bears were now in close pursuit of the boy, he again disappeared in the ground and started away until he had got quite a distance from the tree, when he again emerged and started to run away along the prairie. By the time the bears reached the tree where the boy had rested for a moment, they were again delayed in trailing him, but they finally succeeded in tracking him out to the prairie, where they espied him running in the distance. They immediately set out in pursuit, but it was a long time before they neared him. When the bears approached, the hunter took his second arrow, and shooting it into the air before him, said to it, "When you come down there shall be about you a copse as wide as the range of an arrow. There I shall hide myself." When the arrow descended and entered the earth there appeared a dense undergrowth which completely hid the boy, who then went to the hole, crawled into it, and travelled along in the ground until he had passed beyond the end of the copse, where he emerged and hid by a tree which also had sprung up. AN INDIAN PAPOOSE. Black and white illustration As before, the bears were infuriated at the escape of the boy, and tore up the brush in every direction in their search for him. Finally they discovered the arrow hole, which they entered. Following the footsteps of the boy they soon found the place where he had taken refuge, but before they reached him he found himself pursued, and, again diving under the surface, he started away for some distance, when he emerged from beneath the ground and started away over the prairie as before. A second time were the bears baffled, and by the time they found the footprints of the boy he was far off. They at once started in pursuit, and as the boy began to tire a little the bears gained rapidly on him, until he found that the only way to escape was to use his third arrow. Taking the shaft from his quiver and fitting it to his bow string, he aimed upward into the air before him and said, "When you come down there shall be about you a copse as wide as the range of an arrow. There I shall hide myself." The arrow descended, making a hole in the ground as before, and a copse appeared all around it, hiding it from view. The boy at once went down into the hole and away to the edge of the copse, where he ascended to the surface and hid near one of the trees which had sprung up at his command. The chase was a long one, and in time the boy began to tire and the bears to gain on him, so that he was compelled to take his last arrow, which he fixed to the string of his bow and shot into the air, saying, "When you come down there shall be about you a marsh filled with cat-tails, from the middle of which there shall be a trail; by that shall I escape." When the arrow descended the boy found himself in the midst of a large marsh, and from his feet forward a trail of firm ground, which enabled him to continue running whilst the bears struggled in the mud and amongst the cat-tails. After a while the bears also found the trail, and renewed their pursuit Of the boy, giving him no opportunity for a moment's rest. As they neared him, the bears shouted, "We are now close upon you, and in a short time we will catch you and kill you!" Then the boy remembered the stone which his sister had given him, and taking it out of his pouch he put it in a strip of buckskin and slung it round several times above his head, then threw it forward on the prairie, saying, "As I sling this it will cause a long high rock to appear, upon which I shall take refuge." The little stone bounded and rolled along over the ground and suddenly became transformed into a steep, high cliff with a flat top and with many loose stones lying about the edge. As the boy reached the cliff he clambered to the summit and looked over the edge to watch the bears. The bears ran around the base, looking for the boy everywhere, and when they appeared beneath the boy, he began to roll over the large loose stones upon them, killing a great many and breaking the bones and otherwise disabling others. While the unharmed bears, who were even more astonished at what had transpired, went to look at their killed and wounded companions, the boy hastily descended on the opposite side of the cliff and started out in a new direction to escape. After gazing awhile at their dead and wounded companions the unmaimed bears began to look for the boy, but neither hearing nor seeing him they suspected that he had escaped, and at once began to search for footprints leading away from the rock. When these were found, the bears followed in pursuit until they were almost certain of capturing their enemy. Now the bears had not eaten anything for a long time, and they began to feel very hungry; but there was nothing in sight that they could devour save the boy, so they tried their utmost to catch him, and were slowly gaining on him when he remembered the blueberries which his sister had given him. These he took from his pouch, and threw them into the air, scattering them far and wide, and said, "When you fall to the ground there shall be blueberries growing everywhere; these will deliver me." When the berries fell, surely enough there instantly appeared blueberry bushes laden with fruit, which caused the bears to stop. They were so eager to eat that they entirely forgot the boy until they could eat no more; the: then remembered what they had contemplated doing when they first set out. One old bear, observing dissatisfaction among his friends, said, "My brothers, we had better give up the chase; the boy is merely a mystery. Let us stop and live here, for here we shall have sufficient food without digging for it." To this the rest of the bears assented; so here they made their home. [162] This is a story told by Indians of our own times; but it is exactly such stories as were told around the campfires of the Indians whom our forefathers visited.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">45. The First Landing at Plymouth [163] BY GOVERNOR WILLIAM BRADFORD (1620) OMITTING other things, I will tell you that after long beating about at sea they came to Cape Cod and they were not a little joyful. Having thus arrived in a good harbor and having been brought safe to land, they fell upon their knees and blessed the God of Heaven who had brought them over the vast and furious ocean, and delivered them from all the perils and miseries of the sea. Even now they had no friends to welcome them, nor inns to entertain or refresh their weather-beaten bodies; no houses and much less towns in which to seek for succor. It was in the winter season, and those who know about the winters of that country know them to be sharp and violent, with cruel and fierce storms, which make it dangerous to travel even to known places, much more to search an unknown coast. [164] They knew that they were in a desolate wilderness, full of wild beasts and wild men, in what numbers they knew not. If they looked behind them, there was the mighty ocean which they had crossed, seeming now like a gulf or a bar to separate them from all the civilized parts of the world. It was on the eleventh day of November that they arrived at Cape Cod and necessity called them to look immediately for a place of habitation. They had brought a large shallop with them out of England, stowed away in the quarters of the ship. No\v they took her out and set their carpenters to work to trim her up. This work they saw would take a long time because the ship had become much shattered during the foul weather which struck the big vessel. Whilst the ship was being mended a few of them offered to go along the land to explore the places near by. Some of them thought that they saw a river as they went into the harbor. Sixteen men well armed started out under the leadership of Captain Standish. After some hours sailing it began to snow and rain and the sea became very rough; they broke their rudder and it was as much as two men could do to steer the shallop with a couple of oars. Their pilot bade them be of good cheer, for he saw the harbor, but the storm increased and the night came on; so they put on what sail they could in order to get there while they could see. By doing this they broke their mast in three pieces and their sail-fell overboard. The men set things to right as far as they could, and having the current with them they came into the harbor. Then the pilot saw that he had been deceived in the place and that they were in a dangerous rough cove, full of breakers. A lusty seaman who steered bade those who rowed to put the shallop about, or else they would all be cast away. This they did with speed, so that he bade them be of good cheer and to row bravely for there was a fair bay before them which he thought they might find, and there ride in safety Though it was very dark and rained hard they got under the lee of a small island and remained there all night in safety. [165] They did not know that this was an island until morning. Then they were divided in their minds; some wished to stay in the boat for fear they might be amongst the Indians; others were so weak and cold that they felt they could not endure that, so they went ashore to make a fire. This they did with great trouble, everything was so wet. Then the rest were delighted to come to them, for the wind had shifted to the northwest, and had frozen their clothing, which had been wet in the storm. So after a day and night of much trouble and danger, God gave them a morning of comfort and hope, for the next day was a fair sunshiny day. They found themselves on an island secure from the Indians, where they might dry their clothes, clean their firearms and rest themselves. So they gave God thanks for his mercies. This being the last day of the week, they prepared to keep the Sabbath the next day. On Monday they sounded the harbor and found it fit for shipping. [166] They marched up into the land, found many cornfields and little running brooks, making it a place, as they supposed, fit for a settlement. At least, it was the best they could find and both the season and their present necessities made them glad to accept it, so that they returned to their big ship again with this news, which did much to comfort the hearts of the rest of their people. On the fifteenth of December, the big ship weighed anchor to go to the place which Miles Standish and his exploring party had discovered, and came within two leagues of it, [167] but they were obliged to wait there a day. On the sixteenth day the wind came fair, and they arrived in this harbor. [168] Afterwards they took a better view of the place and decided where to pitch their dwelling. On the twenty-fifth day they began to erect the first house, for the common use of all. [163] The Mayflower and its passengers, carrying English people who had been living lately in Holland.

      <field name="fulltext">46. The First Settlement of Massachusetts BY EDWARD JOHNSON (1628) THESE new-comers were a supply of servants from England sent over in 1628 to provide against the wants of a lonely wilderness. Among them came over a mixed crowd of people, by whom little was done. But the much honored Mr. John Endicot came over with them to govern. He was a good person to begin this wilderness work, for he was courageous, bold, and fearless; yet sociable and of a cheerful disposition. He could be loving or austere as occasion demanded. The place picked out by this people for a settlement was in the midst of the outstretched arm of Cape Ann. Here they began to build a town which is called Salem. After some little time they found out how insignificant were the neighboring Indians, and the boldest among the English people gathered in different places which they began to take up for their own. Those that were sent over as servants had a great desire to see the new sights in the new world, and found it easier to eat up of their master's provisions, than to get more. Those that came over as their own masters had but little food left. Most of them began to regret coming when beer and corn began to fail. The poor Indians could not relieve them for they were obliged to eke out their own food with acorns. What added to the unhappiness of the settlers was the thought that the ditch between England and their new place of abode was so wide that they could not leap over with a leaping-stick. [169] Yet some delighted their eye with the novelty of things about them; and they kept thinking of the new discoveries they would make when spring came. They managed to get through the winter's cold by keeping near the fireside, and found fuel enough groaning at their very doors. They smoked burned tobacco with all the comfort they could. They talked, between one while and another, of the great progress they would make after the summer's sun had changed the earth's white furred gown into a green garment. In the year 1629 there came over three godly ministers. This was to strengthen the faith of the settlers in meeting difficulties. Now although the number of the faithful people of Christ was small, yet their longing desire to gather themselves into a church was very great. The church of Christ being thus begun, the Lord in His tender mercy caused it to increase and be fruitful. And now behold several other regiments of the soldiers of Christ, shipped for His service in the western world. [170] Their difficulties were many and mournful. The billows were high and angry, covering them with awful water and dashing their bodies from side to side. Their goods were thrown from place to place on the ships. After the Lord had given them these trials, He sent diseases to visit their ships. [171] On the twelfth day of July or thereabouts, 1630, these soldiers of Christ first set foot on the western end of the world. There they arrived in safety, men, women, and children. On the north side of the Charles River they landed, near a small island called A SOLDIER'S OUTFIT. Black and white illustration of a shirt, musket, and sword. Noddell's Island. [172] Lady Arabella and some other godly women abode at Salem while their husbands remained at Charlestown to settle the civil government and to form another church of Christ. The first court was held aboard the ship Arabella. The much honored John Winthrop was chosen governor for the remainder of that year, 1630. The worthy Thomas Dudley was chosen deputy governor. Then sore sickness fell upon the people, so that in almost every family mourning and sorrow was heard; and they had no fresh food to strengthen them. Yet it was wonderful to see with what Christian courage these soldiers of Christ persevered amidst all calamities. Soon they had formed other churches and towns. The fourth church was seated at Boston, which became the central town and largest city of this wilderness. The form of this town is like a heart. It is naturally situated for fortifications. It has two hills on the front part of it, facing the sea. One is well fortified with heavy cannon. The other has a very strong battery built of whole timber and filled with earth. At the bottom of these hills lies a great bay on which this town is built. [173] It is over-topped by a third hill. [174] From all three of these overtopping towers a constant watch is kept to foresee the approach of any danger from strange enemies. Each hill is furnished with a beacon and land guns. By their redoubled echoes these give notice of any danger to all their sister towns. The buildings of this city are beautiful and large. Some are pleasingly built of bricks, tiles, stone, and slate. They are placed in an orderly fashion upon beautiful streets. Much shipping is built here yearly, and some ships of good size. Both tar and masts, the country affords from its own soil; there is also a supply of food, both for their own and for foreigners' ships. This town is the very market of the land. French, Portuguese, and Dutch come here to trade. [169] I.e. that they could not easily go home again. [170] That is, more colonists set out, and the writer likens them to soldiers of the Lord. [171] "Ship fever," a very dangerous disease, was common in the voyages of that time. [172] Now East Boston. [173] Boston Harbor. [174] Beacon Hill, on which the State House now stands.</field>

How the Englishmen sailed past New Amsterdam BY DAVID DE VRIES (1612) WHEN we arrived before Fort Amsterdam, we found a Company's ship there with a prize taken on the way laden with sugar. [175] She had brought over the new governor, Wouter Van Twiller. He had been a clerk in NEW AMSTERDAM. Black and white illustration of the coast of a town, viewed from the water. the West India Department at Amsterdam. I went ashore to the fort, out of which he came to welcome us, and inquired of me how the whale fishing succeeded. A few days later, on the eighteenth of April, an Englishman arrived here, who came from New England to trade up the Hudson River. This Englishman invited the governor to come and see him. I went with them, in company with a number of officers, who became drunk and got into such high words that the Englishman could not understand how it was that there should be such unruliness among the officers of the company, nor why the governor should have not more control over them; he was not accustomed to such conduct among his countrymen. The Englishman and his crew remained six or seven days, lying before the fort, and then said that he wished to go up the river, and that the land belonged to the English. This we denied, declaring that they had never made any settlement there. On the twenty-fourth, however, the Englishman weighed anchor and sailed up the river to Fort Orange. [176] Then Governor Wouter Van Twiller assembled all his forces before his door, had a cask of wine brought out, filled a bumper, and cried out for those who loved the Prince of Orange [177] and him to do the same as he did, and protect him from the outrage of the Englishman who was already out of sight, sailing up the river. The people all began to laugh at him; for they understood well how to drink dry the cask of wine, but did not wish to trouble the Englishman, saying that they were friends. As I sat at the table with him at noon I told him that he had been very foolish, as the Englishman had no permission to navigate in the river, but only a paper of. a custom house, stating that he had paid so much duty and might sail with so many passengers to New England, and not to New Netherlands. I said, if it were my matter, I would have helped him away from the fort with beans from eight pounders, [178] and not permitted him to sail up the river. I told him that since the English had troubled us in the East Indies, we ought to take hold of them; that I had no good opinion of that nation, for they were so proud that they thought everything belonged to them; were it an affair of mine I should send a ship after him to make him haul down the river. I added that the Englishman was only making sport of the Governor. A NEW YORK LADY.

      <field name="fulltext">48. Maryland, My Maryland BY FATHER ANDREW WHITE (1634) ON the third of March we sailed into the Chesapeake Bay, bending our course to the north that we might reach the Potomac River. The Chesapeake Bay, ten leagues broad, and four, five, six, and even seven fathoms deep, flows gently between its shores; it abounds in fish when the season of the year is favorable. A more beautiful body of water you can scarcely find. A larger or more beautiful river than the Potomac I have never seen. The Thames compared with it can scarcely be considered a rivulet. It is not made impure by marshes, but on each shore of solid earth there are beautiful groves of trees, not choked up with an undergrowth of brambles and bushes, but looking as if the place were laid out by hand, in a manner so open that you might freely drive a four-horse coach in the midst of the trees. At the very mouth of the river we beheld the natives armed. That night fires were kindled through the whole region, and since so large a ship had never been seen by them, messengers were sent everywhere to announce, "a canoe, as large as an island, has brought as many men as there are trees in the woods." We proceeded, however, to the Heron Islands, so called from the immense flocks of birds of this kind. The first island that: presented itself we called by the name of St Clement's; the second, St. Catherine's, and the third St. Cecilia's; for, having arrived at the wished-for country we gave such names as we liked to the places that we found. We landed first at St. Clement's, to which the approach is difficult, except by wading, because of the shelving nature of the shore. Here the young women, who had landed for the purpose of washing, were nearly drowned by the upsetting of the boat, and a great portion of my linen was lost no trifling misfortune in these parts This island abounds in cedar, sassafras, and the herbs and flowers for making salads of every kind, and with the nut of a wild tree, which bears a very hard nut, in a thick shell, with a kernel very small but remarkably pleasant to taste. [179] Since this island was only four hundred acres in extent, however, it did not appear to be a place sufficiently large for a new settlement. Nevertheless, a site was sought for building a fort to shut out foreigners from the trade of the river, and to protect our boundaries. On the day of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary, on the twenty-fifth of March, in the year 1634, we offered in this island, for the first time, the sacrifice of the mass: in this region of the world it had never been celebrated before. [180] [179] Probably the hickory-nut. [180] The writer of this extract was a Catholic priest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">49. Creatures in Pennsylvania BY GABRIEL THOMAS (1698) THE natives of this country are very charitable to one another. The lame and the blind amongst them live as well as the best. They are also very kind and obliging to the Christians. [181] In person they are ordinarily tall, straight, and well formed. Their tread is strong, and they generally walk with the chin high up. Of complexion, they are dark, but in features they are gypsy-like, greasing themselves with bear's fat, and using nothing to protect them against the injuries of the sun and weather, so their skins cannot fail to be dark. Their eyes are small and black. They have pleasing faces. Their language is dignified and polite. But they use few words. One word serves in the place of three. The language is sweet, and of noble sound. Take here a specimen:— Hodi hita nee Cuska a peechi, nee, machi Pennsylvania huska dogwachi, Keshow a peechi Nowa, huska haly, Chetena Koon peo. This is the English of it:— Farewell friend, I will very quickly go to Pennsylvania, very cold moon will come presently, And very great hard frosts will come quickly. As soon as their children are born, they wash them in cold water, especially in cold weather. To harden them and make them courageous, they plunge them in the river. The children find their feet early; usually at nine months they can walk alone. The boys fish till they are fifteen years of age, then hunt. When they have given a proof of their manhood by getting together a large lot of skins, they may marry. This is usually at the age of seventeen or eighteen. The girls stay with their mothers, and help to hoe the ground, plant corn, and carry burdens. They marry when they are about thirteen or fourteen years of age. The next people who settled in what is now Pennsylvania after the Indians were the Dutch. They called the country New Netherland. They were the first planters in those parts, but they made little or no improvement in the land. They gave themselves WILLIAM PENN. Black and white illustration: portrait of a man in armor. wholly to trading in skins and furs, which the Indians furnished to them for rum, strong liquors, sugar, and other things. Soon after the Dutch, came the Swedes and Fins. They gave themselves to farming, and were the first Christian people that made any great improvement there. The air in this region is very fine and pleasant, and healthful. The heavens are serene, seldom cloudy, and somewhat like the better part of France. The corn harvest is ended before the middle of July, and most years they have between twenty and thirty bushels for every bushel they sow. There are several sorts of wild beasts good for trade and for food. Panthers, wolves, deer, beaver, otter, hares, musk-rats, minks, wild-cats, foxes, raccoons, rabbits, and opossums are to be found. The possum is a strange creature, having a pouch to shelter her young ones. By this means she saves them from danger, when anything comes to disturb them. There are also bears, and some wolves. But they are now pretty well destroyed by the Indians for the sake of the reward given them by the Christians for so doing. Here is also that wonderful creature, the flying squirrel! It has a kind of skinny wings, almost like those of the bat. It has the same kind of hair and color as the common squirrel, but is much smaller. I have myself seen it fly from one tree to another in the woods. But how long it can keep on flying is not exactly known. There are in the woods many red deer. I have bought of the Indians a whole deer skin and all for a little gunpowder. The venison is excellent food, most delicious, far exceeding that of Europe. This is the opinion of most careful and observing people. There are vast numbers of other wild creatures, such as the elk and buffalo. All of these beasts, birds, and fish, are free to any one who will shoot or take them away. There is no hindrance or opposition whatever. There are among other things various sorts of frogs. The bull-frog makes a roaring noise hardly to be distinguished from that of the beast from which it takes its name. There is another sort of frog that crawls up to the tops of trees. [182] There it seems to imitate the notes of several birds. There are many other strange and different creatures. Bees thrive and increase wonderfully in that country. The Swedes often get a great supply of them in the woods, where they are free to anybody. Choice honey is sold in the capital city [183] for five pence a pound. Wax is also plentiful and cheap; they have a considerable trade in it. I must needs say, even the present encouragements are very great and inviting. Poor people, both men and women, of all kinds, can here get three times the wages for their labor that they can in England. The Christian children born here are generally fine-looking and beautiful to behold. In general they are seen to be better-natured, milder, and more tender-hearted than those born in England.

      <field name="fulltext">50. Plantation Life in Virginia BY ROBERT BEVERLY (1720) As the families live altogether at country-seats, they each have their graziers, seedsmen, gardeners, brewers, bakers, butchers, and cooks. [184] They have plenty and a variety of provisions for their table; and as for spicery, and other things that the country does not produce, they have constant supplies of them from England. The gentry pretend to have their victuals served up as nicely as if they were in London. When I come to speak of their cattle, I cannot forbear charging my countrymen with exceeding unthrift. By not providing sufficiently for them during the winter, they starve their young cattle, or at least stunt their growth. Their fish is in vast plenty and variety, and extraordinarily good of its kind. Beef and pork are commonly sold there, at from one penny to two pence the pound, or more, according to the time of the year; their fattest and largest pullets at six pence a piece; their chickens at three or four shillings the dozen; their ducks at eight pence or nine pence a piece; their geese at ten pence or a shilling; their turkey hens at fifteen or eighteen pence; their turkey cocks at two shillings or half a crown. [185] Oysters and wild fowl are not so dear as poultry, and in their season are the cheapest food they have. Their deer are commonly sold from five to ten shillings according to their scarcity or goodness. [186] The bread in gentlemen's houses is generally made of wheat, but some choose the pone, which is the bread made of Indian meal. Many of the poorer sort of people have so little regard for the English grain that although they might have it with the least trouble in the world, yet they do not sow the ground because they will not be at the trouble of making a fence particularly for it. And therefore their constant bread is pone, so called from the Indian name oppone. A kitchen garden does not thrive better nor faster in any part of the universe, than in Virginia. They have all the fruit plants that grow in England, and in greater perfection than in England. Besides these they have several roots, herbs, vine-fruits, and salad flowers peculiar to themselves, most of which will neither increase, nor grow to perfection in England. Their small drink is either wine and water, beer, milk and water, or water alone. [187] The richer sort of people generally brew their small beer with malt, which they have from England, though barley grows there very well; but for want of the convenience of malthouses, the inhabitants take no care to sow it. The poorer sort brew their beer from molasses and bran; from Indian corn, malted by drying it in a stove; from persimmons dried in cakes and baked; from potatoes; or from the green stalks of Indian corn cut small, and bruised. Their strong drink is Madeira wine, cider, mobby punch, made either of rum from the Caribbee Islands, or brandy distilled from their apples and peaches; besides brandy, wine and strong beer, which they have constantly from England. Their fuel is altogether wood, which every man burns at pleasure, for it costs him only the cutting, and carrying it home. In all new grounds it is such an incumbrance, that they are forced to burn great heaps of it, to rid the land. They have very good pit-coal in several places of the country, but no man has yet thought it worth his while to make use of it, as he has wood in plenty, which is lying conveniently near him. [188] They get their clothing of all sorts from England, as linen, woolen, silk, hats, and leather: yet flax and hemp grow nowhere in the world better than there. Their sheep yield good increase, and bear good fleeces; but they shear them only to cool them. The mulberry-tree, whose leaf is the proper food of the silk worm, grows there like a weed, and silk worms have been observed to thrive extremely well. Most of their hides lie and spoil, or are made use of only for covering dry goods, in a leaky house. Indeed, some few hides with much ado are tanned, and made into servants' shoes, but in so careless a fashion, that the planters do not care to buy them, if they can get others. Sometimes perhaps a better manager than ordinary, will vouchsafe to make a pair of breeches of a deerskin. Nay, they are such abominably poor managers ,that though their country be over-run with wood, yet they have all their wooden ware from England; their cabinets, chairs, tables, stools, chests, boxes, cart-wheels, and all other things, even so much as their bowls and birchen brooms, to the eternal reproach of their laziness. For their recreation, the plantations, orchards, and gardens constantly afford them fragrant and delightful walks. In their woods and fields, they have an unknown variety of vegetables, and other rarities of nature to discover and observe. They have hunting, fishing, and fowling, with which they entertain them selves in a hundred ways. There is the most good-nature and hospitality practiced in the world, both towards friends and strangers; but the worst of it is, this generosity is attended now and then, with a little too much intemperance. A neighborhood is as much scattered as in the country in England; but the goodness of the roads, and the fairness of the weather, bring people often together. The inhabitants are very courteous to travellers. A stranger has only to inquire upon the road, where any gentleman, or good house keeper lives, and there he may depend upon being received with hospitality. This good nature is so general among their people, that the gentry, when they go abroad, order their principal servant to entertain all visitors, with everything the plantation affords. And the poor planters who have but one bed will very often sit up, or lie upon a couch all night, to make room for a weary traveller to rest himself after his journey. [184] That is, they have servants or slaves for each of these duties. [185] English penny = two cents. An English sixpence = twelve cents. An English shilling = about twenty-four cents. [186] That is, from $1.25 to $ 2.50 each. [187] Small drink was anything but distilled spirits. In those days everybody drank freely (and often too much) of all sorts of fermented and distilled liquors. [188] About fifty years ago the burning of this coal began, and has ever since continued.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">51. Puritan Amusements BY P. BENNETT (1704) SEVERAL families in Boston keep a coach, and a pair of horses, and some few drive with four horses; as for chaises and saddle horses, considering the size of the place, they outdo London. [189] They have some nimble lively horses for their coaches but not any of that beautiful, large, black breed so common in London. The common horses used in carts about the town are very small and poor. They seldom have their fill of anything but labor. The country carts and wagons are generally drawn by oxen, from two to six, according to the distance or to the burden they are loaded with. When the ladies ride out to take the air, it is generally in a chaise or chair, and then but a single horse is used. [190] They have a negro servant to drive them. The gentlemen ride out here as in England, some in chairs, and others on horseback, with their negroes to attend them. They travel in much the same manner on business as for pleasure. Their roads are exceedingly good in summer. Yet it is safe travelling night or day; for they have no highway robbers to interrupt them. Riding through the woods is pleasant, and the country is dotted with farm houses, cottages, and some few gentlemen's country houses. The best of their inns and public houses are far short of the beauty and convenience of ours in England. They have generally a little rum to drink, and some of them have a sorry sort of Madeira wine. For food they have Indian corn roasted, and bread made of Indian meal. Sometimes they have a fowl or fish dressed after a fashion; they have pretty good butter, and a very sad sort of cheese. But those who are used to these things think them tolerable. For their amusements, every afternoon, after drinking tea, the gentlemen and ladies walk the Mall. From there they go to one another's houses to spend the evening, that is, those who are not disposed to attend the evening lecture. [191] This they may do, if they please, six nights out of seven, the year round. What they call the Mall is a walk on a fine green A COLONIAL KITCHEN. Black and white illustration of a kitchen: a woman tends to the fire, another rolls dough, children play, etc. common. [192] It is nearly half a mile over, with two rows of young trees planted opposite to each other. There is a fine footway between in imitation of St. James's Park. [193] Part of the bay of the sea which encircles the town, takes its course along the northwest side of the Common. [194] Their country sports are chiefly shooting and fishing. For the former the woods afford them plenty of game. The rivers and ponds, with which this country abounds, yield them a great plenty as well as a great variety of fine fish. The government is in the hands of the Dissenters, who do not allow theatres or music houses. [195] But although plays and such entertainments are not held here, the people don't seem to be dispirited or to mope for want of them. For both the ladies and gentlemen dress and appear as gay, usually, as courtiers in England on a coronation day or birthday. And the ladies here visit, drink tea, and do everything else in the height of fashion. They neglect the affairs of their families with as good a grace as the finest ladies in London.

Impressions of South Carolina BY ELIZA LUCAS (May 22d, 1742) I AM now set down, my dear brother, to obey your commands and give you a short description of the part of the world I now inhabit. South Carolina is an extensive country near the sea. Most of the settled part of it is upon a flat. The soil near Charlestown sandy; but further inland it is clay and swamp lands. The country abounds with fine navigable rivers and great quantities of fine timber. At a great distance, that is to say about a hundred and fifty miles from Charlestown, it is very hilly. The soil in general is very fertile and there are few European or American fruits or grains but what grow here. The country abounds with wild fowl, deer, and fish. Beef, veal, and mutton are here in much greater perfection than in the islands, though not equal to that of England. Fruit is extremely good and grows in profusion. The oranges exceed any I ever tasted in the West Indies or from Spain or Portugal. [196] The people in general are hospitable and honest; and the better sort add to these qualities a polite genteel behavior. The poorer sort are the most indolent people in the world, or they would never be so wretched in so plentiful a country as this. The winters here are fine and pleasant. But four months in the year are extremely disagreeable,—excessively hot, much thunder and lightning, anti mosquitoes and sand flies in abundance. Charlestown, the metropolis, is a neat pretty place. The inhabitants are polite and live in a very genteel manner. The streets and houses are regularly built. The ladies and gentlemen are gay in their dress. Upon the whole you will find as many agreeable people of both sexes, for the size of the place, as almost anywhere. St. Phillips Church in Charlestown is a very elegant one and much frequented. There are several more places of public worship in the town, and in general the people are of a religious turn of mind. I began in haste and have shown no order in writing, or I should have told you, before I came to summer, that we have a most charming spring in this country. Especially is this true for those who travel through the country. For the scent of the young myrtle and yellow jessamine, with which the woods abound, is delightful. The staple commodity here is rice, which is the only thing they export to Europe. Beef, pork, and lumber they send to the West Indies. Mama and Polly join in love, with dear brother. Yours affectionately, E. LUCAS. To GEORGE LUCAS, Esquire. [196] West Indies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">53. Slavery in Virginia LETTERS OF PETER FONTAINE (1757) As to your query, whether enslaving our fellow creatures be a practice agreeable to Christianity, I shall only mention something of our present state here. Like Adam we are all apt to shift off the blame from ourselves and lay it upon others, how justly in our case you may judge. The negroes are enslaved by the negroes themselves before they are purchased by the masters of the ships who bring them here. It is to be sure at our choice whether we buy them or not, so this then is our crime, folly, or whatever you will please to call it. Our Assembly, foreseeing the bad consequences of importing such numbers amongst us, hath often attempted to lay a duty upon them which would amount to a prohibition, such as ten or twenty pounds a head; [197] but no Governor dare pass such a law, having instructions to the contrary from the Board of Trade at home. [198] By this means they are forced upon us, whether we will or will not. This plainly shows the African Company hath the advantage of the colonies, and may do as it pleases with the Ministry Since we have been exhausted of our little stock of cash by the war, the importation of slaves has stopped; our poverty then is our best security There is no more picking for their ravenous jaws upon bare bones; but should we begin to thrive they will be at the same business again. All our taxes are now laid upon slaves and on shippers of tobacco, which the English wink at while we are in danger of being torn from them; but we dare not do it in time of peace, it being looked upon as the highest presumption to lay any burden upon trade. [199] This is our part of the grievance, but to live in Virginia without slaves is morally impossible. Before our troubles, you could not hire a servant or slave for love or money; so that, unless you are robust enough to cut wood, to go to mill, to work at the hoe, etc., you must starve, or board in some family where they both fleece and half starve you. There is no set price upon corn, wheat, and provisions, so they take advantage of the necessities of strangers, who are thus obliged to purchase some slaves and land. This of course draws us all into the original sin and curse of the country of purchasing slaves. This is the reason we have no merchants, traders, or artificers of any sort who do not become planters in a short time. A common laborer, white or black, if you can be so much favored as to hire one, is a shilling sterling or fifteen pence currency per day; [200] a bungling carpenter two shillings or two shillings and sixpence per day; beside diet and lodging. That is, for a lazy fellow to get wood and water, £19. 16. 3, current per annum; add to this seven or eight pounds more and you have a slave for life. Nevertheless I cannot help expressing my concern at the nature of our Virginia estates, so far as they consist in slaves. I suppose we have, young and old, one hundred and fifty thousand of them in the country, a number, at least, equal to the whites. It is a hard task to do our duty towards them as we ought. We run the hazard of temporal ruin if they are not compelled to work hard on the one hand and on the other, that of not being able to render a good account of our stewardship in the other and better world, if we oppress and tyrannize over them. Besides, according to our present method, which every body appears afraid to go out of, it seems quite necessary to lay most stress on that useless weed, tobacco, as our staple commodity. This is the reason that all other useful trades and occupations are neglected. Every Virginia tradesman must be at least half a planter, and, of course, not to be depended upon as a tradesman.

      <field name="fulltext">54. In New Jersey BY A GENTLEMAN (1756) THE province of New Jersey, of which I come now to give you some description, has been settled a little more than a hundred years. It is as well cultivated as any of the colonies, yet is in a careless condition, or at least seems so to one who has not seen newly settled places. The farms which lie interspersed in the bosom of thick woods, resemble the face of the sky after a tempest, when the clouds are breaking away and dispersing. The pleasantest spots that you see here are but homely beauties. Almost everywhere you pass upon the roads, you are either in woods, or have woods on one side of you. And the view which is on the open side is terminated by trees within the breadth of a field or two. So that the horizon is hardly any where clear, and to view the country from an eminence it seems to be almost all woods. The roads in most places are very good, but then you travel in a maze. You have neither milestone nor Mercury for your direction. Only here and there is a tree marked with the initial letter of the name of the next town, but so ill cut that one can hardly know it to be an alphabetical character. [201] A few scattered houses make here a village. And in those towns where the buildings stand in line they are not near together. The people are naturally brisk and of a lively temper. They stand much upon a footing of equality with each other. Those of the common sort by conversing freely with persons in office acquire a knowledge of things and business. Thus they receive a brightening by which they are far superior to our country men of the same rank. Religion is here divided into many sects and parties. The men who are extremely kind husbands go commonly the way of the wife in this matter. The poor people in general live better here than in most places, I believe. This is because of the plenty and cheapness of provisions. They are able to place their children in good families by the time they are six or seven years of age, and they have little experience of what it costs to bring them up. So that very few of them turn beggars, or go to seek their bread from home: if they do go, they carry their working tools upon their backs. You must certainly think that thefts and robberies cannot but be rife among us, as these colonies are obliged to take all the rogues and villains that are yearly transported from the several jails in England. But I can assure you it is far otherwise. People think so little of the danger of these things that many families never fasten their doors when they go to bed. And the good housewives that have cloth in bleaching never take it in at nights. As to picking of pockets, the practice is utterly unknown, and the roads are perfectly uninfested and secure. But the wonder of this will evaporate when I tell you that none of the Newgate gentry [202] are landed here, but always either in Virginia or some of the southern colonies, where however they are no calamity. For the masters of the transports make them all bind themselves to him by indenture for four years. [203] Thus they are obliged to honest labor. The spring here is commonly late, but when the year does begin to dress, the ornaments of Nature are out all at once. In a few days the scene is quite changed. The vast orchards are clad in a thick bloom which makes the country look and smell like paradise. The country is well watered with fine streams and rivers, and every house has a well. The woods, though abounding with very beautiful birds, are the dullest of all sylvan scenes. The mocking bird is the mimic of them all, and a complete joker in his way. Nothing is so beautiful and diminutive as that little feathered spark, the humming bird, who with the most gallant address courts the daughters of the garden in a coat of plumage composed of the finest feathers. In summer time for about two months the air is bespangled every night with a kind of flies which they call fire-flies. They abound in swamps and woods of a wet soil. In those gloomy places they make an extraordinary appearance. Their light is not steady; and in the silent night, hovering about in their bright form they almost give the mind an impression of a haunted place. [201] Guide-post. [202] Newgate was a prison in London. "Newgate gentry" were convicts. [203] That is, the convicts and other bad characters have to agree to serve a master for four years after landing.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">55. Where the First English Child in America was Born BY GOVERNOR JOHN WHITE (1587) ABOUT the sixteenth of July, we arrived at the mainland of Virginia, which Simon Ferdinando took to be the Island of Croatoan. [204] Here we came to anchor and rode there two or three days. Finding ourselves deceived, we weighed anchor and sailed along the coast, where in the night, had not Captain Stafford been more careful in looking out than our Simon Ferdinando was, we should have been cast away upon the coast at a point called Cape of Fear, for we came within two cables' length of it; such was the carelessness and ignorance of our master. [205] The two and twentieth day of July we came safely to Cape Hatteras where our ship and pinnace anchored. The Governor went aboard the pinnace accompanied by forty of his best men, intending to pass up to Roanoke. He hoped to find those fifteen Englishmen whom Sir Richard Grenville had left there the year before. With these he meant to have a conference concerning the state of the country and the savages, intending then to return to the fleet and pass along the coast to the Bay of Chesapeake. [206] Here we intended to make our settlement and fort according to the charge given us among other directions in writing under the hand of Sir Walter Raleigh. We passed to Roanoke and the same night at sunset went ashore on the island, in the place where our fifteen men were left. But we found none of them, nor any sign that they had been there, saving only that we found the bones of one of them, whom the savages had slain long before. The Governor with several of his company walked the next day to the north end of the island where Master Ralph Lane, with his men the year before, had built his fort with sundry dwelling houses. We hoped to find some signs here, or some certain knowledge of our fifteen men. When we came thither we found the fort razed, but all the houses standing unhurt, saving that the lower rooms of them, and of the fort also, were overgrown with melons of different sorts, and deer were in rooms feeding on those melons. So we returned to our company without the hope of ever seeing any of the fifteen men living. The same day an order was given that every man should be employed in remodelling those houses which we found standing, and in making more cottages. On the eighteenth a daughter was born in Roanoke to Eleanor, the daughter of the Governor and the wife of Annanias Dare. This baby was christened on the Sunday following, and because this child was the first Christian born in Virginia she was named Virginia Dare. By this time our shipmasters had unloaded the goods and victuals of the planters and taken wood and fresh water, and were newly calking and trimming their vessels for their return to England. The settlers also prepared their letters and news to send back to England. [204] These settlers were sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh after two attempts to establish a colony in what is now North Carolina had failed. Ferdinando was the pilot. [205] Master means ship-captain. [206] That is, northward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">56. How the First Colony Disappeared BY GOVERNOR JOHN WHITE (1590) [207] WHEN our boats were fitted again, we put off from Hatteras, numbering nineteen persons in both boats. Before we could get to the place where our settlers were left, three years before, it was so exceedingly dark that we overshot the place by a quarter of a mile. There we espied, towards the north end of the island, the light of a great fire through the woods, to which we presently rowed. When we came right over against it, we let fall our grapnel near the shore and sounded a call with a trumpet, and afterwards many familiar English tunes. We called to them in friendly tones, but had no answer; we therefore landed at day-break, and coming to the fire, found the grass and sundry rotten trees burning about the place. From thence we went through the woods to that part of the island where I left our colony in the year 1587. All along this way we saw in the sand the print of the savages feet of two or three sorts, trodden during the night. As we went up the sandy bank, upon a tree and on the very brow thereof, were curiously carved these fair Roman letters, C R 0: which letters at once we knew to signify the place where I should find the settlers living, according to a secret token agreed upon between them and me, at my last departure from them. This agreement was, that they should in no wise fail to write or carve on the trees or posts of the doors the name of the place where they should be seated; for when I came away they were prepared to remove from Roanoke fifty miles inward. Therefore at my departure from them, in the year 1587, I told them that if they should happen to be distressed in any of those places, that then they should carve over the letters or name, a cross in this form but we found no such sign of distress Having well considered all this, we passed towards the place where we had left the people in sundry houses; but we found the houses taken down, and the place very strongly enclosed with a high palisade of great trees, looking very fort-like. One of the chief trees, or posts, at the right side of the entrance, had the bark taken off, and five feet from the ground, in fair capital letters, was graven C R O A T O A N, without any cross or sign of distress. This done, w e entered inside the palisade, where we found many bars of iron, two pigs of lead, four iron fowlers, iron sacker-shots, and such heavy things, thrown here and there, almost overgrown with grass and weeds. From thence we went along the waterside, towards a point of the creek, to see if we could find any of their boats or the pinnace, but we could perceive no sign of them nor any of the small arms which were left with them at my departure from them. At our return from the creek, some of our sailors, meeting us, told us that they had found where several chests had been hidden, and long since dug up again. These had been broken up, and much of the things in them spoiled and scattered about. Presently Captain Cook and I went to the place, which was in the end of an old trench made six years ago by Captain SIR WALTER RALEIGH. Black and white illustration: portrait of Raleigh holding a compass; a globe is in the background. Amadas. Here we found fine chests that had been carefully hidden by the planters, and among the same chests three were my own. About the place I found many of my things spoiled and broken, and my books torn from the covers, the frames of some of my pictures and maps rotten and spoiled with rain, and my armor almost eaten through with rust. This could be no other but the deeds of the savages, our enemies, who had watched the departure of our men to Croatoan, [208] and as soon as they were departed, these men dug up every place where they suspected anything to be buried; but although it grieved me much to see such spoil of my goods, yet on the other hand, I greatly rejoiced that I had safely found a certain token of their safe being at Croatoan, which is the place where Manteo was born, and where the savages of the island were our friends. [209] [207] White went to England leaving eighty-nine men, seventeen women, and eleven children at Roanoke; but he could not get back till three years later. This extract tells us what he found. [208] White did not get to Croatoan, and nothing was ever seen again of a single one of the one hundred and seventeen white people who were left there three years before. [209] Nobody knows what became of little Virginia Dare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">57. Boyhood of a Famous Colonist BY THOMAS SHEPHARD (1605-1620) I WAS born on the fifth day of November in the year 1605, in Lancaster, some six miles from the town, of Northampton in Old England. My father's name was William Shephard. As one of my older brothers had been called William he gave the name of Thomas to me. I remember my father well and have some little remembrance of my mother. My father was a wise and prudent man, the peace-maker of our town. My mother had a great love for me, perhaps because I was the youngest; but she died when I was about four years old. Later my father married another woman who let me see the difference between my own mother and a step-mother. She did not seem to love me and turned my father against me. Then my father sent me to school to a Welshman, Mr. Rico, who kept the free school in the town of Lancaster. He was exceedingly cruel and dealt unjustly with me. This discouraged me so about school and lessons that I remember wishing often times that I might take care of pigs, for once when I was a little fellow on a visit at my grandfather's, he had let me take care of the geese and do other farm-work. I still had a memory of it and thought I should like it better than I did to go to school and learn. My father died when I was about ten years of age, so I was left to the care of my step-mother who neglected my education very much, although my father had left a hundred pounds [210] to pay for my schooling. When John, an older brother, decided to take me out of this mother's hands, he was granted the right, and my portion was paid over to him. So I lived with this brother who showed much love for me and to whom I owed much, for he seemed to be a brother, father, and mother to me. Just about this time the cruel schoolmaster died, and another came to take his place. This man stirred up in my heart a desire of learning, and I told my friends I would be a scholar. I studied Greek and Latin; and finally I could take notes of the sermons on Sundays. So I continued at my studies until I was about fifteen years of age and was considered ripe for the University at Cambridge, in England. [211] [210] About $500. [211] Thomas Shephard lived to be the minister of the church in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">58. Let's Go A Fishing BY CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH (1614) Now here in New England savage boys and girls, or any other children may turn, carry, and return fish without either shame or any great pain. He is a very idle boy who has passed the age of twelve years and A COLONIAL CRADLE. Black and white illustration of a cradle. cannot do so much; and a girl is very stupid who cannot spin a thread to make nets to catch the fish. What pleasure can be greater, when people are tired with work on shore, whether they have been planting vines, or building houses or ships, than to get recreation for themselves before their very doors, in their own boats upon the sea. There man, woman, and child, each with a small hook and line, may take divers kinds of excellent fish at their pleasure. And is it not a pretty sport to pull up two-pence, [212] sixpence, and twelve pence as fast as you can haul and change a line? He is a very bad fisher who cannot take in one day with his hook and line one, two, or three hundred cods. These, dressed and dried, if they be sold here in New England, will bring ten shillings for a hundred; [213] or in England, more than twenty. If a man work but three days in seven he may get more than he can spend, unless he is very wasteful. Now carpenters, masons, gardeners, tailors, sailors, and smiths may all take this pretty recreation. Even if they fish for an hour only in a day, they may take more than they will eat in a week. Or, if they do not eat it, they may sell it or exchange it with fishermen and merchants for anything they want. What sport cloth yield a more pleasing feeling of contentment and less harm than angling with a hook and breathing the sweet air, from isle to isle, over the silent streams? My purpose is not to persuade children to leave their parents, or servants to leave their masters, but to bring over such as may be spared freely. Each parish or village in England, which will clothe its fatherless children of thirteen or fourteen years of age and send them here, will find that they can live exceedingly well here by their labor. [212] Two-pence = about four cents. [213] Ten shillings would be about $2.50 a hundred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">59. Boys and Girls in New Netherlands [214] BY CORNELIS VON TIENHOVEN (1650) WE are of the opinion, that permission should be obtained from the magistrates of some provinces and cities in Holland to send over boys and girls from the almshouses and orphan asylums. There ought to be three or four hundred of these boys and girls often, twelve, or fifteen years of age. And their own consent should be obtained also. With that intention a large ship might be chartered suitable to carry horses and pork from Curacco and afterward to return here with a cargo of log-wood. [215] It must be understood that the children are not to be bound to their masters longer than six or seven years. [216] If the girls should get married during that time, they must have a chance to hire again as servants with their masters or mistresses, if they will. Or they may remain wholly at liberty, or settle in New Netherland for themselves, on condition that they be allowed some land by the government, as much as the director of the colony shall think proper that each should have for the support of her family This land is to be free from all rents and taxes fol ten years after they settle upon the land. But after that time the people living in those parts shall pay one-tenth of what is made on their land, for the support of the colony. [214] This extract tells about a plan to build up the Dutch Colony at New Netherland, now the city of New York. [215] Large enough to carry a cargo besides the children, and thus cover the expense of their free transportation. Curacco, what we now call Dutch Guiana, in South America. [216] Bound means pledged by the written agreement of their parents or guardians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">60. London Children in Virginia [217] BY THE VIRGINIA COMPANY (1619) IT is asked what land the children are to have in return for their going over to Virginia. The answer is that they are not to have any; but at the end of their apprenticeship they are to be tenants of the common land. It is thought that the council of the company would then allow twenty-five acres apiece, for every one of them. For the good of these same children it is ordered by the council that every one of the children who are now living at the expense of the Virginia Company shall be educated and brought up in some good trade and profession. By this means they will be able to get their living and support themselves, when they have reached the ages of four-and-twenty years, or are out of their apprenticeships. Their apprenticeships are to last at least seven years, if they live so long. [218] Further it is ordered that all of these children when they become of age, or marry, whichever shall happen first, shall have freely given and made over to them fifty acres of land apiece. This land is to be in Virginia within the limits of the English plantation. It is fully intended that this next spring one hundred children more shall be sent and carried by the Virginia Company out of the city of London to Virginia. During their voyage they shall have their food sweet and good. They shall also be well dressed and have all other things necessary for the voyage. Every one of these children shall there be placed as apprentices with holiest and good masters. The boys shall serve for seven years, or until they are twenty-one years old or more. The girls shall serve for seven years, that is, until they are twenty-one or married. Their masters during that time must educate them and bring them up in some good trade or business. In this way they will be able to get their living and support themselves when their apprenticeships are over. During their terms of labor, they shall have all things necessary provided for them, such as food drink, and clothing. At the end of their apprenticeships, every one of these children shall have freely given to them by the Virginia Company enough corn to serve for food for a whole year. They shall also each have a house ready built to live in, and shall be placed as tenant in some convenient place upon as much land as they can manage. Each of these children shall, at this time, have one cow, and as much corn as he or she will plant. Each shall have suitable clothing, convenient weapons, and armor for defence in war. [219] AN OLD DOLL. Black and white illustration of a doll in a small chair. Every one shall have the necessary implements and utensils for the household, and enough working tools for his trade. Every one who has thus served the apprenticeship shall be bound to be tenant or farmer for seven years after his apprenticeship end. During that time of their labor and care they shall have one half of all the profits that shall arise from the management of their farms. At the end of the last seven years every one of the young men and women is to be at liberty to remain as farmer on the same land if he will, or to provide for himself elsewhere. [217] The city of London had agreed to furnish one hundred children for Virginia, and to pay the Virginia Company a premium of twenty-five dollars apiece for each child, partly to pay for the passage to Virginia, and partly for the children's clothes. [218] Apprenticeship. The custom of the time as to draw up agreements for boys and girls who were going into trades or service, by which their parents or guardians put children under the legal control of masters who had a right to their services for a term of years, usually seven. [219] Virginia wanted as many farmers or planters as she could get. The first apprenticeship has to he followed in each case by a second, upon easier terms, or at least terms better suited to the age of the apprentice. After a man had worked as a farmer for fourteen years, he would be likely to continue in that occupation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">61. The Lost Boy BY GOVERNOR BRADFORD (1621) TEN of our men made a voyage to the Kingdom of Nauset to find a boy that had lost himself in the woods. The 11th of June we set out, the weather being very fine. Before we had been long at sea, however, there arose a storm of wind and rain with much lightning and thunder. So that a water-spout arose not far from us. But God be praised, it did not last long; and we put in that night at a harbor where we had some hope of finding the boy. Two savages were in the boat with us. The one was Tisquantum who was our interpreter. The other was Tokamahamon, a special friend. It was night when we came into the bay. In the morning we saw savages hunting lobsters, and sent our two interpreters to speak with them. They told the Indians who we were and whence we came. They told the Indians not to fear us for we would not hurt them, as we were only searching for a lost boy. Their answer was that the boy was well but that he was at Nauset. Yet, since we were there, they wished us to come ashore and eat with them. This we did. They brought us to their sachem, Iyanough, a man not over twenty-six years of age. He was very gentle, polite, and considerate. Indeed he was not like a savage, with the exception of his dress. He entertained us in the same kind polite way; and his foods of different kinds were plentiful. One thing was very sad to us at this place. There was an old woman, whom we judged to be no less than a hundred years of age. She came to see US because she had never seen any English people. Yet she could not look at us, without breaking out in great anger, weeping and crying loudly. We asked the reason of this. They told us that she had three sons who went aboard a ship when Mr. Hunt was in this place, to trade with him, and he carried them away as captives into Spain. So the old woman had lost the comfort of her sons in her old age. We told them we were sorry that any English man should do them that wrong. We said that Hunt was .t bad man, and that all the English people who heard of the deed would say the same. But for us, we would not do them any harm, even if it would gain us all the skins in the country. So we gave her some small presents, which quieted her anger somewhat. After dinner we took boat for Nauset. Iyanough and two of his men went with us. We sent Tisquantum to tell Aspinet, the sachem, at Nauset why we came. The savages here came very thick about us. But we had little cause to trust them, as they had some time before made an attack upon us in that place. When our boat was aground they gathered on the shore, but we stood upon our guard, not allowing any of them to enter the boat except two. AN OLD TOY. Black and white illustration of a toy carriage. After sunset, Aspinet came with a great company of Indians, and brought the boy with him. One Indian carried the boy through the water. He had wandered five days, living on berries. Then he saw the lights of an Indian village which proved to be that of these people who first attacked us. Aspinet, when he brought the boy to us, had not less than a hundred Indians with him. Half of them came with him to our boats' side unarmed. The others stood at some distance with their bows and arrows. There he gave over to us the boy, hung with beads, and then made peace with us. We presented him with a knife. We gave one also to another Indian who had cared for the boy at his home and brought him here. Then they went away from us.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">62. Puritan Children BY GOVERNOR WILLIAM BRADFORD (1622) THE Puritans who went to Holland had hard work to support their families in a strange land where the chief industry was cloth-making. The children suffered, too, by the change from country life in England to city life at Amsterdam and Leyden. A COLONIAL FAMILY. Black and white illustration of a portrait of four children (apparently 3 girls, 1 boy) in fancy attire. Necessity was a taskmaster over them and so the Puritans were forced to be taskmasters, not only to their servants, but in a way to their dearest children. This greatly wounded the tender hearts of many a loving father and mother. So also it caused many sad and sorrowful effects. Many of their children were of the best dispositions and of right intentions. They had learned to bear the yoke of hardships in their youth. They were willing to bear part of their parents' burdens also. But oftentimes they were so weighed down by their heavy work, that although their minds were willing, yet their bodies bowed under the weight. And so they became like old, weak people even in their early youth. The strength of nature was used up in the very bud as it were. But there were other things more to be grieved over, which of all sorrows, were most heavy to be borne. Many of their children, because of these hardships and the great wickedness of young people in that country, and the many temptations of the place, were drawn away into evil. By bad example they were drawn into spendthrift and dangerous ways of doing. Having got the reins off their necks they left the good teachings of their parents. Some became soldiers. Others went upon far voyages by sea. Some others did worse things which led them to evil, to the danger of their souls. This brought great sorrow to their parents, and dishonor to God. So the parents saw that those who would be born after them, in years to come, would be in danger of being weak and wicked. To show how strict and serious life was among the Puritans, we have only to notice how different a time Christmas was then than it is now. [220] On the day called Christmas, the governor called them all out to work, as was the way then. But the most of the people, newly come at this time, said it was against their conscience to work on that day. So the governor said, if they made it a matter of conscience, he would let them alone until they knew better. So he led away the rest and left them. But when those with him came home at noon from their work, he found the others in the street at play publicly. Some were pitching the bar, some were playing at stool-ball, and such sports. So he went to them and took away the things they were playing with. He told them that it was against his conscience that they should play while others worked. If they made the keeping of the day a matter of religion, let them stay in their houses There should be no merry-making in the streets After that time nothing of the kind was tried again. [221] [220] This part of the extract describes life in Plymouth, after the Puritans had come over to New England. [221] The Puritians did not celebrate Christmas because they thought it was a Catholic day of rejoicing. Puritan children had sport but not on Christmas Day, which is now a day of rejoicing everywhere.</field>

A Poem about my Son Samuel's Going to England BY ANNE BRADSTREET (1657) THOU mighty God of sea and land I here resign into Thy hand The son of prayers, of vows, of tears, The child I looked for many years. Thou heard'st me then and gave'st him me; Hear me again; I gave him Thee. He's mine, but more, O Lord, thine own, For surely grace on him is shown. No friend I have like Thee to trust, For mortal helps are brittle dust. Preserve, O Lord, from storm and wrack. Protect him there and bring him back. And if Thou shalt spare me a space, That I again may see his face Then shall I sing henceforth Thy praise And bless Thee for it all my days.</field>

On Samuel's Return from England BY ANNE BRADSTREET (1657) ALL praise to Him who hath now turned My fears to joy, my sighs to song, My tears to smiles, my sad to glad, He's come for whom I waited long. Thou did'st preserve him where he went, On raging seas did safely keep, Did'st that ship bring to quiet port, While others sank into the deep. From dangers great Thou did'st him save Of pirates who were near at hand; And ordered so the adverse wind That he before them got to land. [222] On eagle's wings him hither brought Through wanton dangers manifold; And thus hath granted my request That I Thy mercies might behold. O help me pay my vows, O Lord, That ever I may thankful be, And may put him in mind of what Thou did for him, and so for me. In both our hearts erect a shrine Of duty and of thankfulness, That all Thy favors great received Our upright walking may express.

      <field name="fulltext">65. Send us More Children [223] BY J. ALRICHS (1658) Honorable, Worshipful, Wise, Prudent Gentlemen: IN regard to the salt, which your Honors suppose s is quite plenty at the Manhattans, you are mistaken. We have only a hogshead and a half, and can hardly get any there for money. Hardly a cup of salt can be had for extraordinary occasions; this causes great discontent and uproar. In well regulated places it happens that scarcity and want occur. Much more is this the case in a colony far distant and newly begun. Such a colony ought to be provided for one year with whatever is not produced there or procured easily from others. Little or no butter is to be had here, and less cheese. [224] Whenever any one is about to go on a journey he can get hardly anything more than dry bread, or he must carry along a pot or kettles to cook some food. Therefore, as a reminder, I say once more that it would be well if some rye meal, cheese, and such things were sent in all the ships. As horses are required here for agriculture, means should be found of sending a good supply of horses. In regard to the fort, it is in a great state of decay. [225] I have resolved on building a house of planks about fifty feet in length and twenty in breadth; also I have had one-third of the house, in which I have been lodging very uncomfortably, repaired, yet the greater part of it is still so leaky that it is only with great difficulty that anything can be kept dry. We shall be obliged to pull down and rebuild the soldiers' barracks immediately. I had expected, at least, a supply of provisions in the ship which had just arrived. There is a set of insolent fellows on board of her who will not turn a hand to work if there be anything to do, and there never is any one to be hired here for such work. Laborers will not stir for less than a dollar a day. Carpenters, masons and other mechanics earn four guilders; [226] this amounts to much in extensive works. There is no reason or plea for refusing to supply the settlers, who have been here some time from our common store, in exchange for their money. There is no merchant's store here, and scarcely any one who has provisions for sale, for the daily supply of the inhabitants; nay, not even bread, although there are over six hundred souls in this place. Whoever has anything will not sell it, and who so has none, cannot. Things are here in their infancy, and demand time. Many who come hither are as poor as worms and lazy withal, and will not work unless compelled by necessity. Send in the spring, or in the ships sailing in December, a large number of strong and hard working men. Should they not be forth coming at the right time, their places can be filled with boys of fifteen, sixteen, seventeen years and over. Bear in mind that the boys be healthy and strong. Whatever is done here must be done by labor. The children sent over from the almshouse have arrived safely, and were in such demand that all are bound out among the inhabitants; the oldest for two years, most of the others for three years, and the youngest for four years. They are to earn forty, sixty, and eighty guilders during the period, [227] and at the end of the term, will be fitted out in the same manner as they are at present. Please to continue sending others from time to time; but, if possible, none ought to come under fifteen years of age. They ought to be somewhat strong, as little profit is to be expected here without labor. 'Tis as yet somewhat too soon to send many women or a multitude of little children; it will be more advisable and safer when crops are gathered, when abundance prevails, and everything is cheaper. I might enlarge upon this account, but time does not permit, as the sloop by which I send it, is ready to sail.

      <field name="fulltext">66. A Sick Boy Cured BY JOHN BARNARD (1766) IT pleased God that I should be taken with scarlet fever; through the raging of the fever, and a fierce pain at my heart, every breath I drew was as though a sword had been run through me. I was so ill that they thought I would not live. On the third night, I think, it seemed to me that a certain woman came and brought me some small dark-colored pills. She told me to put one in my mouth and hold it there till it grew soft. Then I was to squeeze it flat between my thumb and finger and put it on my breast. It would soak in, she said, and before I had used them all so, I should be well. I did as I was told, and when I had used the third pill, my pain and fever left me, and I was well. My tender father, very early the next morning came into my bed-room to ask how I was. I told him I was quite well and intended to get up soon. I said the pills Mrs. Baird gave me last night had entirely cured me. He said to me: "Child, I believe she was not here; I heard nothing of it." To satisfy him I said: "Sir, I have the other four pills now in my hand." I put my hand out of the bed to show them, but they dropped out of my hand into the bed. I then raised myself up to look for them but could not find them. He said to me: "I am afraid, child, you are out of your senses." I said to him: "Sir, I am perfectly awake and in my senses, and find myself truly well." He left the room, thinking I was delirious, and I saw by his face that he feared I would die. He then asked of all the house whether that woman had been at the house the day or evening before. They all let him know that they had not seen her here. He went to his own room, and in about an hour came to me again. I was firm in the story I had told him. He talked to me of some other things and found by my answers that I was thoroughly awake. He was better satisfied, and left me with a more cheerful face. By noon I got up and was perfectly well of my sickness. I thought I would have given ever so much to know what the pills were, that others might have the benefit of them. Finding that the woman had not been at our house, and I was perfectly healed, I could not help thinking that a merciful God had sent a good angel to heal me. And to this very day I cannot but think it was more than a common dream, or the wild ideas of a feverish mind. It seemed to me a dream from God And what else can you make of it? Thus has God kindly helped me. Forever blessed be his name.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">68. Young People's Life in New Hampshire [235] FROM OLD COLONY MEMORIAL (1765) IN general, men old and young, who had got their growth, had a decent coat, vest, and small clothes, [236] and some kind of fur hat. These were for holiday use and would last half a lifetime. Old men had a great coat and a pair of boots. The boots generally lasted for life. For common use they had a long jacket, or what was called a fly coat, reaching down about half way to the knee. They had a striped jacket to wear under a pair of small clothes like the coat. These were made of flannel cloth. They had flannel shirts and stockings and thick leather shoes. A silk handkerchief for holidays would last ten years. In summer time they had a pair of wide trousers reaching half way from the knee to the ankle. Shoes and stockings were not worn by the young men. Few men in farming business wore them either. As for boys as soon as they were taken out of petticoats, they were put into small clothes summer and winter. This lasted till they put on long trousers which they called tongs. They were but little different from the pantaloons of to-day. These were made of linen or cotton, and soon were used by old men and young through the warm season. Later they were made of flannel cloth and were in general use for the winter. Young men never thought of great coats; and overcoats were then unknown. As for the women, old and young, they wore flannel gowns in winter. The young women wore wrappers in the summer, and about their ordinary business they did not wear stockings and shoes. They were usually contented with one calico gown. They generally had one woolen gown, and another of camel's hair goods; and some had them made of poplin. The sleeves were short and did not come below the elbow. On holidays they wore one, two, or three ruffles on each arm. They wore long gloves coming up to the elbow, fastened by what were called glove-tightens, made of black horse hair. They wore aprons made of checked linen or cotton; and for holiday use of white cotton, lawn, or cambric. They seldom wore caps when about their ordinary affairs; but they had two kinds. One kind they wore when they meant to be much dressed up. One was called strap-cap; it came under the chin; the other was called round-cord cap, and did not come over the ears. They wore thick leather, thin leather, and broadcloth shoes, all with heels an inch and a half high. These had peaked toes, turned up in a point at the toes. They generally had small, very small muffs; and some wore masks. The principal amusements of the young men were wrestling, running and jumping, or hopping three hops. Dancing was considered an important thing to know. Dances to step-tunes, such as Old Father George, Cape Breton, High Pietty Martin, and the Rolling Hornpipe were favorites. [237] At their parties dancing was their principal exercise; they sang songs also, and had a number of forfeit plays, such as "breaking and setting the pope's neck" and "find the button." At the time I speak of, a young woman did not think it a hardship or a disgrace to walk five or six miles to a meeting. There was no chaise or any sort of wagon or sleigh in the town where I lived. I remember the first chaise that passed through the town. It caused the greatest possible wonder. Potatoes were a scarce article in those days. Three bushels were thought a very large crop. I was quite a large boy before I ever saw a potato as large as a hen's egg. [235] This extract describes life in the New England Colonies more than a century ago. [236] Small clothes were breeches, worn with long stockings. [237] The colonials knew nothing of round dances their dances were chiefly "country dances," people drawn up in two lines, or jigs and such single dances, one doing the work and others looking on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">69. Colonial Sundays BY DR. ABIEL ABBOTT (about 1780) THIS Sunday evening I will say a word about Sunday of olden times. On Saturday evening the work of the week was finished. My father, after washing and putting on a skillet of water, would get his razor and soap, sit down by the fire and shave off his beard. Then he would take his Bible and sometimes some other book. My mother, after washing the potatoes and other vegetables, and getting ready the Sunday food, used to make hasty pudding [238] for supper. This was eaten in milk, or if we had no milk, it was eaten with butter and molasses. Then the little children were put to bed. Early in the evening my father read a chapter in the Bible and made a prayer. Soon after that the younger part of the family and the hired help went to bed. Indeed the family every night went to their rest soon after supper, especially in the summer. Saturday night and Sunday and Sunday night, there Nas a perfect stillness. No play was going on, and no laughing. Those of us who were old enough took the Bible or learned a hymn. We read in the COLONIAL PEWS. Black and white illustration of the interior of a church, showing pulpit and pews. testament or primer to father or mother in the morning. For breakfast, when we had milk enough, we had bread and milk. Otherwise we had beans and corn porridge. After the war of the Revolution, tea and toast were used for Sunday morning breakfast. As we lived at a distance from meeting, those who walked started as early as nine o'clock. Those who went on horse back set out soon after. The roads and bridges were very bad. The horses always carried two, and often a child in the mother's lap. Sometimes there was another child on the pommel of the saddle before the father. All went to meeting, except someone to keep the house and to take care of the children who could not take care of themselves. The one who stayed at home was told when to put the pork and vegetables into the pot for the supper which we had after meeting. Those who went to meeting used to carry in their pockets some short cake, or doughnuts and cheese for dinner. We used to get home from meeting generally at four o'clock. Then the women set the table, and the men took care of the horses and cattle in winter. After supper the children and younger part of the family were called together to read in the Bible and primer [239] and to sing some hymns and prayers. Soon after this, before my father read in the Bible and made a prayer, the cows were brought from the pasture and milked. No work was done except what was absolutely necessary. The dishes for supper and breakfast were left unwashed till Monday. Every one in the town, who was able to go to meeting, went. If any were absent, it was noticed, and it was supposed that sickness was the reason. If any one was absent three or four Sundays, the tithing man would make him a visit. [240] But this did not often happen. Sunday was not unpleasant to me. I did not feel gloomy, or want to play, or wish Sunday was gone or would not come. This was because I was so used to its rules. [238] Hasty pudding = corn mush. [239] "The New England Primer," everywhere read by children. [240] The tithing man was an officer of the church, who kept order during services, and saw to it that people did not stay away without reason.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">70. Too Much for the Whistle BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1779) [241] I AM charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of living there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in the mean time, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In my opinion, we might draw more good than we do, and suffer less evil, if we would take care and not to give too much for whistles. For to me it seems that most of the unhappy people we meet with are become so by neglect of that caution. You ask what I mean ? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one of myself. When I was a child of seven years old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pockets with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children, and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met' by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. They put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with vexation. The reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure. This, however, was afterward of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give too much for the whistle; and I saved my money. As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle. When I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance upon levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have said to myself, This man gives too much for his whistle. When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect, He pays indeed , said I, too much for his whistle. If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth, Poor man, I said, you pay too much for your whistle. When I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, Mistaken man , said I, you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle. If I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, Alas! say I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle. When I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband, What a pity , say I, that she should pay so much for a whistle! In short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.

      <field name="fulltext">71. Letters from a Father to his Son BY JOHN WINTHROP (1622) [242] "To my beloved son, John Winthrop, at the College in Dublin. Dear Son: Though I have received no letters from you yet, I cannot let any chance pass without some expression of my fatherly affection, and care for your welfare. Because of this affection, I am content to have you absent from me at so great a distance, for I know that God's power and care are alike in all places. And as for my own comfort, it shall be in your success and well-doing wherever you may be. Because I cannot so often put you in mind of those things which concern your good, as if you were nearer to me, you must take the more care to think about those teachings which I give you. Try, by all means, to keep in your heart the fear of God. And let not the awful profaneness and contempt of ungodly men lessen the respectful and great regard for the Great King, which is in your heart. But remember still, that the time is at hand when they shall call the mountains to hide them from the face of Him whom now they slight and pay no attention to. When you write back, let me know about the state of things at your college. Tell me how you like it. And remember my love to your teacher. Your grandfather, grandmother, and mother, send blessings to you. Your brothers and sisters are in health, I thank God. The Lord in mercy, fill your heart with his goodness. May he keep you from all evil. Your loving father, JOHN WINTHROP. GROTON, Aug. 6, 1622. My Beloved Son, I pray the Lord to bless thee with goodness and peace. I give him thanks for thy welfare. I hope, through his goodness, that this sickness which is now upon thee will turn to thy health. I received two letters from you, written, I see, in haste. But they were welcome to me and the rest, to you grandmother and mother. They all are glad that you like the college. I sent you two letters a good while ago. I hope they will reach you, though they may be long in going. The further you are from me, the more careful I am of your welfare, both in body and soul. The best way to both of these lies in your own trying. Your friends may pray for you and advise you; but your own faithfulness and watchfulness mast be added to make you blessed. God has given you a large number of outward good things. You must try to use them carefully. Remember that your happiness is not in food, drink, and such things, but in the favor of God for your part in a better life. I send you the books you wrote for. I shall also send you some cloth for a gown and suit. For a study gown, you would better buy some coarse Irish cloth. I shall, if God is willing, write to you again soon. Your grandfather and grandmother will write to you also. Your mother sends you her blessings. We are all in health, I thank God. Remember my love to your good teacher. The Lord in mercy bless and keep you, and direct and prosper your study. Your loving father, JOHN WINTHROP. GROTON, Aug. 31, 1622. A HORN BOOK.

Letters from a Son to a Father BY FORTH WINTHROP (1622) [243] Most Loving Father, Having such a chance as the coming down of my room fellow, Thomas Archisden, I thought good, though in some haste, to write to you. I hope you are all in health as I am here, blessed be God Almighty. I humbly pray him to help me by his holy spirit to keep in the way of goodness and to escape the poisonous sins of these evil times. I was once entangled in such sins, but I hope by the good spirit of God to avoid them more and more. My teacher sent down a letter to you some time ago by Deverux. I did not know about it. Now I have heard that he forgot to deliver it. I wish you to send word whether you got it, for that Deverux, as I am told, takes in hand letters to deliver and then opens them and does not send them. I suppose you have heard our college news about the change in the rules of the library. The duke is about to come to the college. If you have not heard all this, Tom Ark. can tell you when he sees you. I remember my duty to yourself and my mother, and I send love to the rest of my friends. I wish always to have your prayers and blessings. In haste, I am, Your dutiful and obedient son, F. WINTHROP. I wish you to send me the shoes of which I wrote you. I have need of some clothes, for these are worn out. I ask you to send me, sometime when it seems best, some stuff to make me clothes. Or do as you think right about this.

      <field name="fulltext">73. A Puritan's Objection to Women's Education [244] BY GENERAL JOHN WINTHROP (1645) MR. HOPKINS, the governor of Hartford upon Connecticut, came to Boston and brought his wife with him (a godly young woman, and of special parts), who was fallen into a sad infirmity, the loss of her understanding and reason, which had been growing upon her divers years, by occasion of her giving herself wholly to reading and writing; and she had written many books. Her husband, being very loving and tender of her, was loath to grieve her; but he saw his error when it was too late. For if she had attended to her household affairs, and such things as belong to women, and had not gone out of her way to meddle in such things as are proper for men, whose minds are stronger &amp;c. she had kept her wits and might have improved them usefully and honorably in the place God had set her. He brought her to Boston and left her with her brother, one Mr. Yale, a merchant, to try what means might be had for her. But no help could be had. A SAMPLER.

      <field name="fulltext">74. Rules of Dorchester Schools BY THE TOWN OF DORCHESTER (1641) THE schoolmaster shall faithfully attend his school and do his best to benefit his scholars. In this he is to use his best judgment, and|not remain away from school unless necessary. This would be to the disadvantage of his scholars and would hinder their learning. COLONIAL HANDWRITING. Black and white illustration: various examples of handwriting styles. From the beginning of the first month until the end of the seventh, he shall begin to teach every day at seven of the clock in the morning. For the other five months he shall begin every day at eight of the clock in the morning and end at four in the afternoon. Every day in the year the usual time for dismissing at noon shall be at eleven; to begin again at one. But every second day of the week, he shall call his scholars together between twelve and one of the clock to examine them. This is to find out what they have learned the Sabbath day before. At this time he shall take notice of any wrong-doing or disorder that any of his scholars have committed on the Sabbath. Then at some suitable time he shall instruct them how they must do at another time. Or he may punish them if the offence shall require it. He shall equally and impartially teach such as are placed in his care. No matter whether their parents be poor or rich, he shall not refuse any who have a right and interest in the school. [245] Such as are placed in his care he shall faithfully teach both in the regular school studies and also in points of good manners. He shall teach them dutiful behavior to all, especially those who are their superiors. Every sixth day of the week [246] he shall question his scholars in the principles of Christian religion. All men's efforts, without the blessing of God must be fruitless and unsuccessful. Therefore it is to be a chief part of the schoolmaster's duty to commend his scholars and his work to God in prayer. This he shall do morning and evening, taking care that his scholars do devoutly listen during the prayer. The rod of correction is a rule of-God necessary sometimes to be used upon children. [247] It may easily be abused by too much severity or too much kindness. The schoolmaster shall have full power to punish all or any of his scholars, no matter who they are. He shall do as the offence seems to require. All his scholars must be subject to this rule. No parent or other person living in the place shall go about to hinder the master in this. But if any parent or others shall think there is just cause for complaint against the master for too much severity, they shall have liberty to tell him so in friendly and loving way. [245] This warning was necessary in a century when the richer and more influential men were always given the better places. [246] That is, every Saturday. [247] At that time parents and teachers frequently whipped their children with rods.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">75. Strict Rules for College Students BY HARVARD COLLEGE (1660) [248] 1. IT is hereby ordered that the president and fellows of Harvard College have the power to punish all misdeeds of the young men in their college. They are to use their best judgment and punish by fines or whipping in the hall publicly, as the nature of the offence shall call for. 2. No student shall live or board in the family or private house of any person in Cambridge without permission from the president and his teachers. And if any shall have leave to do so, yet they shall attend all college exercises both for religion and schooling. They shall also be under college rules, and do as others ought to do. In case any student shall be and live in town out of the college grounds, more than one month or several times, without permission, he shall afterwards be looked upon as no member of the college. 3. Former orders have not prevented unnecessary damage to the college, by the roughness and carelessness of certain students. Yet for their benefit a great amount of money has been spent on these things. It is therefore ordered that hereafter all possible care shall be taken to prevent such injury to things. And when any damage shall be found done to any study room or other room used, the person or persons living in it shall pay for this. And where any damage shall be done to any part of the college building (except by the act of God), this shall be made good or paid for by all the students living in the college at the time when such damage shall be done or found to be done. This means damage to any empty room, the college fences, pump, bell, clock, etc. [249] But if the person or persons that did these things be discovered, he or they shall make good the damage. He or they shall also be in danger of further punishment and fines for such misconduct. If any student shall take any study room for his use he shall pay the rent of it for a whole year, whether he live in it so long or not. He shall be under promise to leave the room in as good condition as he found it when he first came into it. Parents are greatly annoyed by reason of ill-treatment put upon their children when they first come to college. [250] This is because the older students send them upon their own private errands. For the future great care shall be taken to prevent this same thing. All doings of this kind shall be severely punished, by a fine paid by such persons as shall do so. Or they shall receive bodily punishment if it is considered best. 4. M—, H—, and W— were expelled from college and their names cut out of the tables in the dining room. By order of the president of the college, this was done before all the fellows interested. It was because of the disorder and bad actions of these three young men toward Andrew Belcher. They killed Grandma Sell's dog and stole ropes with which to hang him. They hung him upon a sign-post at night, as one of them afterwards confessed before the college authorities and before his companions. And at the time it was not denied in any way; but two of the students afterwards got the third one to say that after all what he had related was not true. Many great lies were told by all of them, and especially by one. And there were many reasons for the belief that they committed these crimes. [248] Harvard College was for more than a century the only college in the English Colonies. [249] Until two centuries later the cost of broken windows was assessed on all the students. [250] This shows that hazing existed two hundred and forty years ago.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">76. Benjamin Franklin's Boyhood BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1706) I WAS the youngest son of my father, Josiah Franklin, and was born in Boston, New England. My father had in all seventeen children; of which I remember thirteen sitting at once at his table. I was put to the grammar school at eight years of age, my father intending as an offering to God, to make me a minister of the church. My readiness in learning to read must have been very early as I do not remember when I could not read. Later my father sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic. I learned good writing pretty soon but I failed in the arithmetic. At ten years of age. I was taken home to help my father in his business. He was a tallow-candle-maker and soap-boiler. He was not brought up to follow this business. He had gone into it, when he came to New England; for he found his dyeing trade would not support his family. So I was at work cutting wick for the candles, filling the moulds for dipping the candles, keeping the shop, and going on errands. I disliked the business. I had a strong desire to go to sea; but my father declared against it. Living near the water, I was much in and about it. I learned early to swim well and to manage boats. And when in a boat or canoe with other boys, I was generally allowed to manage things, especially in any case of danger. Upon other occasions I was generally a leader among the boys Sometimes I led them into scrapes. I will tell of one such time. There was a salt marsh on one side of the mill pond. On the edge of this, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much trampling we had made it a mere quagmire. My plan was to build a wharf there fit for us to stand upon; and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh. These would very well suit our purpose. A SCHOOL-BOY'S TRUNK. Black and white illustration of a trunk. So, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I gathered together a number of my playfellows; we worked very hard, like so many ants. Sometimes two or three of us were needed for one stone. Finally we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. They began to ask who moved them. We were found out and complaint was made. Several of us were punished by our fathers. And although I said for excuse that it was a useful kind of work, my father convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest. My father was often visited by leading people, w ho asked his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church to which he belonged. They showed a good deal of respect for his judgement and advice. He liked to have some sensible friend or neighbor to talk with him at his table. He always took care to start some useful subject for conversation, which might help to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and wise in the affairs of life. Little or no notice was ever taken of the food on the table. If it was well or poorly prepared, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, better or worse than some other thing of the kind, we did not discuss it. I was brought up to pay so little attention to these things, that I cared little what kind of food was set before me. To this day, if I am asked, I can hardly tell a few hours after dinner what I had to eat. This has been a great convenience to me in travelling. When my companions have been very unhappy sometimes for want of what would suit their more delicate tastes I have been satisfied. I never knew my father or my mother to have any sickness but that of which they died, he at 89 and she at 8 5 years of age. They lie buried together at Boston, where I some years ago placed a tombstone over their grave. From a child I was ever fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. My father's little library was chiefly of books on religious discussions, most of which I read. I have since often been sorry that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way, since it was later decided I should not be a minister. My taste for books at last caused my father to make me a printer. I like it much better than my father's business, but I still had a hankering for the sea. To prevent this my father was in haste to have me bound to my brother as an apprentice in the printing business. THE NEW ENGLAND PRIMER. Black and white illustration of an open book, each page containing letters of the alphabet: each letter has a corresponding picture and aphorism: e.g. "N -Noah did view The old world &amp; new." I now had a chance to read better books. Knowing the apprentices of book-sellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one which I was careful to return clean. Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening anti had to be returned early in the morning. After some time, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had a pretty collection of books, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">77. School Days and School Fights BY JOHN BARNARD (1687-1700) I, JOHN BARNARD, was born at Boston, November 6, 1681. My parents were respectable and very pious and charitable. In the spring of my eighth year I was sent to the grammar school. My master was the aged and famous Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, and well he merited the fame so heartily given him. I have many interesting memories of him. He placed me in the lowest class, but finding that I soon read through my books, he put me, after a few weeks, into a higher class, and the next year made me the head of it. Although my master put me in a higher class, I was a very naughty boy, much given to play. So at last he said before all: "You, Barnard, I know you can do well enough if you will. But you are so full of play that you hinder your classmates from getting their lessons. Therefore, if any of them cannot say their lessons I shall correct you for it." One unlucky day, one of my classmates did not look into his book, so he could not say his lesson, although I had once and again told him to mind his book. Therefore, my master beat me. I told my master the reason why he could not-say his lesson was his saying that he would beat me if any of the class could not do their part in lessons. Ever since he said that this boy would not look into his book though I told him to mind his book as the class could prove. The boy was pleased with my being punished and kept on failing in his lessons. For this I was still punished, and so for several days. I thought in justice I ought to punish the boy, and make him do better. So, after school was done, I went up to him and told him I had been beaten several times for his failures. I told him that since the master would not punish him I would, and I should do so as often as I was punished for him. Then I drubbed him well. The boy never came to school any more. And so that unfortunate matter ended. Though I was often beaten for my play, and my little roguish tricks, yet I don't remember that I was ever beaten for my lessons more than once or twice. Once, in a Latin lesson, my master found fault with the way I used a word. It was not used so by me, carelessly, but on purpose. So I told him there was a plain grammar rule for it. He angrily replied there was no such rule. I took the grammar and showed the rule to him. Then he smilingly said, "Thou art a brave boy. I had forgotten it." And no wonder; for he was then more than eighty years old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">78. Indian Students at William and Mary College BY GOVERNOR SPOTSWOOD (1711-1712) VIRGINIA, NOV. 11, 1711. To my Lord Dartmouth, My Lord: I have given your lordship an account of my intention to meet and treat with the Tuscarora Indians for securing the peace of this colony and punishing the Indians who had part in the recent savage massacre. My messenger is returned. He brought with him five of the chief men of that nation to represent the rest. These chiefs came at a very good time, just as I had brought into view a body of militia consisting of about sixteen hundred men. So great an appearance of armed men in such good order very much surprised them. It gave them a better opinion of the strength of this government than they before had. I thought this a good time to let them know what I expected of their nation if they wished to keep our friendship. I told them that either they must themselves carry on a war with our Indian foes or help us to destroy them. And that we might be the better assured of their friendship I proposed that two of the sons of the chief men in each of their towns should be educated at our college. These sons were to be sent to our government as hostages. The king of the Nausemonds has sent his son and cousin. The Nottaways and Meherrins have each sent two of their chief men's sons to the college. They have consented for them to be brought up in the Christian religion. To encourage them I have taken care to have them well clothed and kindly treated. The queen of Pamunkey, upon seeing their good treatment has also promised that her son and one of the sons of a chief in her nation, shall soon be sent. I expect one from the Chickahominys. That they shall no longer pay tribute of skins is one of the conditions upon which they send their children to the college. It was as much with an intention to bring the Indians to accept Christianity, as to secure their friendship to the government, that I proposed to have their children here. There are now about twenty-five Indian children at the college. They have a master to teach them, and are decently clothed and cared for; so that they seem very well pleased. So also are their parents, and others of their nations, who come often to see them. These Indians express much satisfaction at the treatment which is given to their children. They often grieve that they were not so fortunate as to have such advantages in their young days. Among the Indian children now at the college there are several that can read and write quite well. They can repeat the church catechism and know how to take part in the service at church. Both the boys and the parents show a great desire that they should receive baptism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">79. A Philadelphia School-Boy BY ALEXANDER GRAYDEN (1760-1766) WHEN I was about eight years of age, it was deemed expedient to enter me at the academy, and I was accordingly introduced by my father to Mr. Kinnesley, the teacher of English and professor of oratory. The task of the younger boys, at least, consisted in learning to read and to write their mother tongue grammatically; and one day in the week, I think Friday, was set apart for the recitation of select passages in poetry and prose. IN SCHOOL. Black and white illustration: three scenes, depicting boys being instructed by two men, girls being instructed by a woman, and boys at play. For this purpose, each scholar, in his turn, ascended the stage, and said his speech, as the phrase was. This speech was carefully taught him by his master, both with respect to its pronunciation, and the action deemed suitable to its several parts. More profit attended my reading. After Æsop's fables, and an abridgement of the Roman history, Telemachus was put into our hands; [251] and if it be admitted that the human heart may be bettered by instruction, mine, I may aver, was benefited by this work of the virtuous Fenelon. A few days after I had been put under the care of Mr. Kinnersley, I was told by my class mates, that it was necessary for me to fight a battle with some one, in order to establish my claim to the honor of being an academy boy. I found that the place of battle was fixed, and that a certain John Appowen, a lad who was better set and older than myself, though not quite so tall, was pitted against me. A combat immediately began between Appowen and myself, which for some time was maintained on each side with equal vigor and determination, when unluckily, I received his fist directly in my gullet. The blow for a time depriving me of breath and the power of resistance, the victory was declared for my adversary, though not without the acknowledgment of the party, that I had at least behaved well, and shown myself not unworthy of the name of an academy boy. I have said that I was about to enter the Latin School. The person whose pupil I was consequently to become, was Mr. John Beveridge, a native of Scotland, who retained the smack of his mother tongue in its primitive purity. His acquaintance with the language which he taught, was, I believe, justly deemed to be very accurate and profound. But as to his other acquirements, after excepting the game of backgammon, in which he was said to excel, truth will not warrant me in saying a great deal. He was, however, diligent and laborious in his attention to his school; and if he had possessed the faculty of making himself beloved by the scholars, and of exciting their emulation and exertion, nothing would have been wanting in him to an entire qualification for his office. But unfortunately, he had no dignity of character, and was no less destitute of the art of making himself respected than beloved. Though not perhaps intolerably severe, he made a pretty free use of the rattan and the ferule, but to very little purpose. As my evil star would have it, I was thoroughly tired of books and confinement, and my mother's advice and even entreaties were overruled by my extreme repugnance to a longer continuance in the school. So, to my lasting regret, I bid it adieu when a little turned of fourteen, at the very season when the minds of the studious begin to profit by instruction. We were at this time reading Horace and Cicero, having passed through Ovid, Virgil, Cæsar, and Sallust. [252] [251] A French book. [252] Very few boys of fourteen nowadays have read these Latin authors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">80. A Word about Schools BY DR. ABEL ABBOT (ABOUT 1780) A WORD about schools. These were poor enough. We used to read, spell, write, and do numbers. The primer, spelling book, and the Bible were the books. My father became aware that the schools were useless and hired Mr. John Abbott, who was then in college, to teach a month in his vacation. He then invited other people to send their children free. This made the schools there of a different sort. For a number of years after this good teachers were hired for about eight weeks in the winter. They were usually students from college. Other places then began to have as good schools. I respect my father and mother deeply; for their anxiety and sacrifices to give their children the best education possible. Their children, grandchildren, and so on to the twentieth generation will have reason to bless the memory of parents of such true worth. Now for something else. For breakfast in olden times there was bread and milk, as soon as the cows were milked. About nine o'clock there was a luncheon of bread and cheese, or fried pork and potatoes. For dinner we had a good Indian pudding. Often there were blue-berries or suet in it. We had also for dinner pork and beef, through the winter and spring, besides potatoes, turnips, and cabbage. At four or five o'clock in the summer evenings, we had some bread and cheese or the like. For supper we had bread and milk. When there was company chocolate was used for breakfast, but no coffee. Pewter basins and sometimes wooden bowls were used. Wooden plates were used for dinner. When a friend dined pewter plates and spoons were used by father, mother, and the friend. I do not think that swearing was ever heard in the town until after the Revolution. I do not remember seeing my father or mother angry; but they were sometimes displeased no doubt. I do not remember more than one man being drunk. Rum was commonly used at the raising of buildings. If the raising was finished before night, the men amused themselves with wrestling, goal, and coits. Goal was the favorite game of the boys after thanksgiving and Election days, the only holidays which I remember.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">81. From Childhood to College BY SAMUEL KNEELAND (ABOUT 1750) THE most remarkable thing in my childhood was a wonderful talent which I possessed to imitate anything that I saw or heard. I could grunt like a hog, roar like a lion, or bellow like a bull. I was once very near being worried by a pack of rascally dogs, who took me for a fox, I deceived their ears with so natural a squeal. I was a particular favorite of all the hens in the neighborhood; I rivalled the cock with a crow as exquisite as it was inimitable. I will add for the satisfaction of my enemies, that when I hoot they would infallibly take me for an owl. Also on occasion, I can bray so very advantageously, that few donkeys can go beyond me. Nay, to such a perfection am I now arrived in the art of mimicry, that I am able not only to make any sound that I hear, but I have a faculty of looking like anybody I think fit. There is no person whom I have ever seen, but I can immediately throw all his features into my face, assume his air and monopolize his whole countenance. I remember when I was a school-boy my master once gave me an unlucky rap on my pate, for a fault committed by Giles Horror, whose visage I had at that time most unfortunately put on. Esau Absent may remember to this day, if he is living, how his mother took me for him, when I marched off in triumph, with a huge lunch of bread and butter, that was just spread for Esau's dinner. When I was three years old, I was sent to school to a mistress, where I learned to read with great dispatch; in my fifth year, I was taken away and put to A COLONIAL SCHOOL-GIRL (MISTRESS CAMPION). Black and white illustration: a portrait of a girl in fancy attire: she holds a Horn book (a kind of tablet) containing the alphabet; a dog is at her feet. a writing master. In my seventh year I could flourish a tolerable hand, and began my grammar. By the time that I was fourteen, I was considerably proficient in the Latin and Greek languages. and was admitted into Harvard College.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">82. A Tutor and his Pupils BY PHILIP FITHIAN(1773-1774) [253] Monday, November 1. We began school. The school consists of eight. Two of Mr. Carters sons, one nephew, and five daughters. The eldest son is reading Sallust; grammatical exercises, and Latin grammar. The second son is reading English grammar, and reading English writing, and ciphering in subtraction. The nephew is reading and writing as above; and ciphering in reduction. The eldest daughter is reading the Spectator, writing, and beginning to cipher. The second is reading now out of the spelling-book, and beginning to write. The next is reading in the spelling-book. The fourth is spelling in the beginning of the spelling-book. And the last is beginning her letters. Thursday, November 25. Rode this morning to Richmond Courthouse, where two horses ran for a purse of 500 pounds: besides small bets almost innumerable. One of the horses belonged to Colonel John Tayloe, and is called Yorick; the other to Dr. Flood, and is called Gift. The Assembly was remarkably numerous; beyond my expectation and exceedingly polite in general. [254] The horses started precisely at five minutes after three; the course was one mile in circumference, they performed the first round in two minutes, the third in two minutes and a half. Yorick came out the fifth time round about 40 rods ahead of Gift; both horses, when the riders dismounted proved very lame; they ran five miles, and carried 180 pounds. Almost every lady wears a red cloak; and when they ride out they tie a red handkerchief over their head and face, so that when I first came into Virginia, I was distressed whenever I saw a lady, for I thought she had the toothache. The people are extremely hospitable, and very polite, both of which are most certainly universal characteristics of the gentlemen in Virginia. Some swear bitterly, but the practice seems to be generally disapproved. I have heard that this country is notorious for gaming; however that may be, I have not seen a pack of cards, nor a die, since I left home, nor gaming nor betting of any kind except at the Richmond-race. Almost every gentleman of condition, keeps a chariot and four; many drive with six horses. I observe that all the merchants and shopkeepers in the sphere of my acquaintance are young Scotchmen, several of whom I know. It has been the custom heretofore to have all their tutors, and schoolmasters from Scotland, tho' they begin to be willing to employ their own countrymen. In the evening Ben Carter and myself had a long dispute on the practice of fighting. He thinks it best for two persons who have any dispute to go out in good-humour and fight manfully, and says that they will be sooner and longer friends than to brood and harbour malice. Mr. Carter is practicing this evening on the guitar. He has here at home a harpsichord, forte-piano, harmonica, guitar, violin, and German flutes, and at Williamsburg, he has a good pipe organ. In the morning so soon as it is light a boy knocks at my door to make a fire; after the fire is kindled, I rise which now in the winter is commonly by seven, or a little after. By the time I am drest the children commonly enter the school-room, which is under the room I sleep in; I hear them round one lesson, when the bell rings for eight o-clock (for Mr. Carter has a large good bell which may be heard some miles, and this is always rung at meal times ;) the children then go out; and at half after eight the bell rings for breakfast, we then repair to the dining-room; after breakfast, which is generally about half after nine, we go into school, and sit till twelve, when the bell rings, and they go out for noon; the dinner-bell rings commonly about half after two, often at three, but never before two. After dinner is over, which in common, when we have no company, is about half after three we go into school, and sit til the bell rings at five, when they separate til the next morning. We go into supper commonly about half after eight or at nine and I usually go to bed between ten and eleven. Saturday, December 18. After breakfast, we all retired into the dancing room, and after the scholars had their lesson singly round Mr. Christian, very politely, requested me to step a minuet; I excused myself, however, but signified my peculiar pleasure in the accuracy of their performance. There were several minuets danced with great ease and propriety; after which the whole company joined in country-dances, and it was indeed beautiful to admiration, to see such a number of young persons, set off by dress to the best advantage, moving easily, to the sound of well performed music, and with perfect regularity, IN A LIBRARY. Black and white illustration of a home library: four men look at maps; one holds a pair of compasses; a globe and books litter the floor. tho' apparently in the utmost disorder. The dance continued till two, we dined at half after three. Soon after dinner we repaired to the dancing-room again; I observe in the course of the lessons, that Mr. Christian is punctual, and rigid in his discipline, so strict indeed that he struck two of the young Misses for a fault in the course of their performance, even in the presence of the mother of one of them! And he rebuked one of the young fellows so highly as to tell him he must alter his manner, which he had observed through the course of the dance, to be insolent, and wanton, or else absent himself from the school. I thought this a sharp reproof to a young gentleman of seventeen, before a large number of ladies! Nothing is now to be heard of in conversation, but the balls, the fox-hunts, the fine entertainments, and the good fellowship, which are to be exhibited at the approaching Christmas. Mr. Goodlet was barred out of his school last Monday by his scholars, for Christmas holidays, which are to continue till twelfth-day; but my scholars are of a more quiet nature, and have consented to have four or five days now, and to have their full holiday in May next, when I propose by the permission of Providence to go home, where I hope to see the good and benevolent Laura. When the candles were lighted, we all repaired, for the last time, into the dancing-room; first each couple danced a minuet; then all joined as before in the country dances, these continued till half after seven when at the proposal of several, we played Button, to get pawns for redemption; here I could join with them, and indeed it was carried on with sprightliness, and decency; in the course of redeeming my pawns I had several kisses of the ladies! Half after eight we were rung in to supper. The room looked luminous and splendid; four very large candles burning on the table where we supped; three others in different parts of the room; a gay, sociable assembly, and four well instructed waiters! So soon as we rose from supper, the company formed into a semicircle round the fire, and Mr. Lee, by the voice of the Company was chosen Pope, and the rest of the company were appointed Friars, in the Play called "Break the Pope's Neck." Here we had great diversion in the respective judgments upon offenders, but we were all dismissed by ten, and retired to our several rooms. Saturday, December 25. I was waked this morning by guns fired all round the house. The morning is stormy, the wind at south east and it rains hard. Nelson the boy who makes my fire, blacks my shoes, does errands, &amp;c. was early in my room. He made me a vast fire, blacked my shoes, set my room in order, and wished me a joyful Christmas, for which I gave him half a bit. [255] Soon after he left the room and before I was drest, the fellow who makes the fire in our school room, dressed very neatly in green, but almost drunk, entered my chamber with three or four profound bows, and made me the same salutation; I gave him a bit, and dismissed him as soon as possible. Soon after my clothes and linen were sent in with a message for a Christmas box, as they call it; I sent the poor slave a hit, and my thanks. I was obliged for want of small change, to put off for some days the barber who shaves and dresses me. There were at table Mrs. Carter and her five daughters that are at school with me Miss Priscilla, Nancy, Fanny, Betsy, and Harriot, five as beautiful delicate, well-instructed children as I have ever known! Ben is abroad; Bob and Harry are out. Ben, the eldest, is a youth of genius: of warm impetuous disposition; desirous of acquiring knowledge, docile, vastly inquisitive and curious in mercantile, and mechanical matters, very fond of horses and takes great pleasure in exercising them. Bob, the other brother, is by no means destitute of capacity. He is extremely volatile and unsettled in his temper, which makes it almost wholly impossible to fix him for any time to the same thing, on which account he has made but very little advancement in any one branch of study, and this is attributed to barrenness of genius. He is slovenly, clumsy, very fond of shooting, of dogs, and of horses, but a very stiff rider, good natured, pleased with the society of persons much below his family, and estate and tho' quick and wrathful in his temper, yet he is soon moderated, and easily subdued. Harry, the nephew, is rather sullen in his make. He is obstinate, tho' steady, and makes a slow uniform advance in his learning, he is vastly kind to me, but in particular to my horse. Miss Priscilla, the eldest daughter, about 16 years old, is steady, studious, docile, quick of apprehension, and makes good progress in what she undertakes; she is small of her age, has a mild winning presence, a sweet obliging temper, never swears, which is here a distinguished virtue, dances finely, plays well on keyed instruments, and is on the whole in the first class of the female sex. Nancy, the second, is not without some few of those qualities which are by some (I think with great ill-nature, and with little or no truth) said to belong intirely to the fair sex. I mean great curiosity, eagerness for superiority, and or in friendship, but bitterness and rage where there is enmity. She is not constant in her disposition, nor diligent nor attentive to her business. But she has her excellencies; she is cheerful, tender in her temper, easily SCHOOL DAYS. Black and white illustration of a man in a chair with a boy on his lap: the boy holds a horn book (a kind of tablet) with the alphabet on it, to which he is pointing. The boy is learning the alphabet. managed by perswasion, and is never without what seems to have been a common gift of Heaven to the fair-sex, readiness of expression! Fanny, the next, is in her person, according to my judgment the flower of the family. She has a strong resemblance to her Mamma, who is an elegant, beautiful woman. Miss Fanny seems to have a remarkable sedateness, and simplicity in her countenance, which is always rather cheerful than melancholy; she has nothing with which we can find fault in her person, but has something in the features of her face which insensibly pleases us, and always when she is in sight draws our attention, and much the more because there seems to be for every agreeable feature a corresponding action which improves and adorns it. Betsy, the next, is young, quiet, and obedient. Harriet is bold, fearless, noisy and lawless; always merry, almost never displeased; she seems to have a heart easily moved by the force of music; she has learned many tunes and can strike any note, or succession of notes perfectly with the flute or harpsichord, and is never wearied with the sound of music either vocal or instrumental. These are the persons who are at present under my direction, and whose general character I have very imperfectly attempted to describe.

      <field name="fulltext">83. A Mock Examination [256] BY FRANCIS HOPKINSON (1784) METAPHYSICS PROFESSOR. WHAT is a salt-box ? STUDENT. It is a box made to contain salt. PROF. How is it divided ? STU. Into a salt-box, and a box of salt. PROF. Very well ! show the distinction. STU. A salt-box may be where there is no salt; but salt is absolutely necessary to the existence of a box of salt. PROF. Are not salt-boxes otherwise divided ? STU. Yes: by a partition. PROF. What is the use of this partition ? STU. TO separate the coarse salt from the fine. PROF. HOW ? -think a little. STU. TO separate the fine salt from the coarse. PROF To be sure: it is to separate the fine from the coarse: but are not salt-boxes yet otherwise distinguished ? STU. Yes: into possible, probable, and positive. PROF. Define these several kinds of salt-boxes. STU. A possible salt-box is a salt-box yet unsold in the hands of the joiner. PROF. Why so ? STU. Because it hath never yet become a salt-box in fact, having never had any salt in it; and it may possibly be applied to some other use. PROF. Very true: for a salt-box which never had, hath not now, and perhaps never may have, any salt in it, can only be termed a possible salt-box. What is a probable salt-box? STU. It is a salt-box in the hand of one going to a shop to buy salt, and who hath six-pence in his pocket to pay the grocer: and a positive salt-box is one which hath actually got salt in it. PROF. Very good: but is there no instance of a positive salt-box which hath no salt in it ? STU. I know of none. PROF. Yes: there is one mentioned by some author: it is where a box hath by long use been so impregnated with salt, that although all the salt hath been long since emptied out, it may yet be called a salt-box, with the same propriety that we say a salt herring, salt beef, &amp;c.
