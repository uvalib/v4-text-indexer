      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER I MISS POLLY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS POLLY HARRINGTON entered her kitchen a little hurriedly this June morning. Miss Polly did not usually make hurried movements; she specially prided herself on her repose of manner. But to-day she was hurrying—actually hurrying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy, washing dishes at the sink, looked up in surprise. Nancy had been working in Miss Polly's kitchen only two months, but already she knew that her mistress did not usually hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am." Nancy answered cheerfully, but she still continued wiping the pitcher in her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy,"—Miss Polly's voice was very stern now—"when I'm talking to you, I wish you to stop your work and listen to what I have to say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy flushed miserably. She set the pitcher down at once, with the cloth still about it, thereby nearly tipping it over—which did not add to her composure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am; I will, ma'am," she stammered, righting the pitcher, and turning hastily. "I was only keepin' on with my work 'cause you specially told me this mornin' ter hurry with my dishes, ye know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her mistress frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Nancy. I did not ask for explanations. I asked for your attention."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am." Nancy stifled a sigh. She was wondering if ever in any way she could please this woman. Nancy had never "worked out" before; but a sick mother suddenly widowed and left with three younger children besides Nancy herself, had forced the girl into doing something toward their support, and she had been so pleased when she found a place in the kitchen of the great house on the hill—Nancy had come from "The Corners," six miles away, and she knew Miss Polly Harrington only as the mistress of the old Harrington homestead, and one of the wealthiest residents of the town. That was two months before. She knew Miss Polly now as a stern, severe-faced woman who frowned if a knife clattered to the floor, or if a door banged—but who never thought to smile even when knives and doors were still.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When you've finished your morning work, Nancy," Miss Polly was saying now, "you may clear the little room at the head of the stairs in the attic, and make up the cot bed. Sweep the room and clean it, of course, after you clear out the trunks and boxes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am. And where shall I put the things, please, that I take out?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the front attic." Miss Polly hesitated, then went on: "I suppose I may as well tell you now, Nancy. My niece, Miss Pollyanna Whittier, is coming to live with me. She is eleven years old, and will sleep in that room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little girl—coming here, Miss Harrington? Oh, won't that be nice!" cried Nancy, thinking of the sunshine her own little sisters made in the home at "The Corners."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nice? Well, that isn't exactly the word I should use," rejoined Miss Polly, stiffly. "However, I intend to make the best of it, of course. I am a good woman, I hope; and I know my duty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy colored hotly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course, ma'am; it was only that I thought a little girl here might—might brighten things up for you," she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," rejoined the lady, dryly. "I can't say, however, that I see any immediate need for that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, of course, you—you'd want her, your sister's child," ventured Nancy, vaguely feeling that somehow she must prepare a welcome for this lonely little stranger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly lifted her chin haughtily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, really, Nancy, just because I happened to have a sister who was silly enough to marry and bring unnecessary children into a world that was already quite full enough, I can't see how I should particularly want to have the care of them myself. However, as I said before, I hope I know my duty. See that you clean the corners, Nancy," she finished sharply, as she left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am," sighed Nancy, picking up the half-dried pitcher—now so cold it must be rinsed again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In her own room, Miss Polly took out once more the letter which she had received two days before from the far-away Western town, and which had been so unpleasant a surprise to her. The letter was addressed to Miss Polly Harrington, Beldingsville, Vermont; and it read as follows:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"DEAR MADAM:—I regret to inform you that the Rev. John Whittier died two weeks ago, leaving one child, a girl eleven years old. He left practically nothing else save a few books; for, as you doubtless know, he was the pastor of this small mission church, and had a very meagre salary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe he was your deceased sister's husband, but he gave me to understand the families were not on the best of terms. He thought, however, that for your sister's sake you might wish to take the child and bring her up among her own people in the East. Hence I am writing to you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The little girl will be all ready to start by the time you get this letter; and if you can take her, we would appreciate it very much if you would write that she might come at once, as there is a man and his wife here who are going East very soon, and they would take her with them to Boston, and put her on the Beldingsville train. Of course you would be notified what day and train to expect Pollyanna on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hoping to hear favorably from you soon, I remain, "Respectfully yours, "JEREMIAH O. WHITE."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a frown Miss Polly folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope. She had answered it the day before, and she had said she would take the child, of course. She hoped she knew her duty well enough for that!—disagreeable as the task would be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As she sat now, with the letter in her hands, her thoughts went back to her sister, Jennie, who had been this child's mother, and to the time when Jennie, as a girl of twenty, had insisted upon marrying the young minister, in spite of her family's remonstrances. There had been a man of wealth who had wanted her—and the family had much preferred him to the minister; but Jennie had not. The man of wealth had more years, as well as more money, to his credit, while the minister had only a young head full of youth's ideals and enthusiasm, and a heart full of love. Jennie had preferred these—quite naturally, perhaps; so she had married the minister, and had gone south with him as a home missionary's wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The break had come then. Miss Polly remembered it well, though she had been but a girl of fifteen, the youngest, at the time. The family had had little more to do with the missionary's wife. To be sure, Jennie herself had written, for a time, and had named her last baby "Pollyanna" for her two sisters, Polly and Anna—the other babies had all died. This had been the last time that Jennie had written; and in a few years there had come the news of her death, told in a short, but heart-broken little note from the minister himself, dated at a little town in the West.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile, time had not stood still for the occupants of the great house on the hill. Miss Polly, looking out at the far-reaching valley below, thought of the changes those twenty-five years had brought to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was forty now, and quite alone in the world. Father, mother, sisters—all were dead. For years, now, she had been sole mistress of the house and of the thousands left her by her father. There were people who had openly pitied her lonely life, and who had urged her to have some friend or companion to live with her; but she had not welcomed either their sympathy or their advice. She was not lonely, she said. She liked being by herself. She preferred quiet. But now—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly rose with frowning face and closely-shut lips. She was glad, of course, that she was a good woman, and that she not only knew her duty, but had sufficient strength of character to perform it. But— Pollyanna !—what a ridiculous name!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II OLD TOM AND NANCY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN the little attic room Nancy swept and scrubbed vigorously, paying particular attention to the corners. There were times, indeed, when the vigor she put into her work was more of a relief to her feelings than it was an ardor to efface dirt—Nancy, in spite of her frightened submission to her mistress, was no saint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—just—wish—I could—dig—out—the corners—of—her—soul!" she muttered jerkily, punctuating her words with murderous jabs of her pointed cleaning-stick. "There's plenty of 'em needs cleanin' all right, all right! The idea of stickin' that blessed child 'way off up here in this hot little room—with no fire in the winter, too, and all this big house ter pick and choose from! Unnecessary children, indeed! Humph!" snapped Nancy, wringing her rag so hard her fingers ached from the strain; "I guess it ain't children what is most unnecessary just now, just now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For some time she worked in silence; then, her task finished, she looked about the bare little room in plain disgust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it's done—my part, anyhow," she sighed. "There ain't no dirt here—and there's mighty little else. Poor little soul!—a pretty place this is ter put a homesick, lonesome child into!" she finished, going out and closing the door with a bang, "Oh!" she ejaculated, biting her lip. Then, doggedly: "Well, I don't care. I hope she did hear the bang,—I do, I do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the garden that afternoon, Nancy found a few minutes in which to interview Old Tom, who had pulled the weeds and shovelled the paths about the place for uncounted years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Tom," began Nancy, throwing a quick glance over her shoulder to make sure she was unobserved; "did you know a little girl was comin' here ter live with Miss Polly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A—what?" demanded the old man, straightening his bent back with difficulty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A little girl—to live with Miss Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Go on with yer jokin'," scoffed unbelieving Tom. "Why don't ye tell me the sun is a-goin' ter set in the east ter-morrer?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it's true. She told me so herself," maintained Nancy. "It's her niece; and she's eleven years old."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man's jaw fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sho!—I wonder, now," he muttered; then a tender light came into his faded eyes. "It ain't—but it must be—Miss Jennie's little gal! There wasn't none of the rest of 'em married. Why, Nancy, it must be Miss Jennie's little gal. Glory be ter praise! ter think of my old eyes a-seein' this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was Miss Jennie?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She was an angel straight out of Heaven," breathed the man, fervently; "but the old master and missus knew her as their oldest daughter. She was twenty when she married and went away from here long years ago. Her babies all died, I heard, except the last one; and that must be the one what's a-comin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's eleven years old."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, she might be," nodded the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And she's goin' ter sleep in the attic—more shame ter her !" scolded Nancy, with another glance over her shoulder toward the house behind her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom frowned. The next moment a curious smile curved his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I'm a-wonderin' what Miss Polly will do with a child in the house," he said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! Well, I'm a-wonderin' what a child will do with Miss Polly in the house!" snapped Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid you ain't fond of Miss Polly," he grinned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if ever anybody could be fond of her!" scorned Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom smiled oddly. He stooped and began to work again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess maybe you didn't know about Miss Polly's love affair," he said slowly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Love affair— her ! No!—and I guess nobody else didn't, neither."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes they did," nodded the old man. "And the feller's livin' ter-day—right in this town, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't a-tellin' that. It ain't fit that I should." The old man drew himself erect. In his dim blue eyes, as he faced the house, there was the loyal servant's honest pride in the family he has served and loved for long years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it don't seem possible—her and a lover," still maintained Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't know Miss Polly as I did," he argued. "She used ter be real handsome—and she would be now, if she'd let herself be."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Handsome! Miss Polly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. If she'd just let that tight hair of hern all out loose and careless-like, as it used ter be, and wear the sort of bunnits with posies in 'em, and the kind o' dresses all lace and white things—you'd see she'd be handsome! Miss Polly ain't old, Nancy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ain't she, though? Well, then she's got an awfully good imitation of it—she has, she has!" sniffed Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I know. It begun then—at the time of the trouble with her lover," nodded Old Tom; "and it seems as if she'd been feedin' on wormwood an' thistles ever since—she's that bitter an' prickly ter deal with."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should say she was," declared Nancy, indignantly. "There's no pleasin' her, nohow, no matter how you try! I wouldn't stay if 'twa'n't for the wages and the folks at home what's needin' 'em. But some day—some day I shall jest b'ile over; and when I do, of course it'll be good-by Nancy for me. It will, it will."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know. I've felt it. It's nart'ral—but 'tain't best, child; 'tain't best. Take my word for it, 'tain't best." And again he bent his old head to the work before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy!" called a sharp voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Y-yes, ma'am," stammered Nancy; and hurried toward the house.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER III THE COMING OF POLLYANNA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN due time came the telegram announcing that Pollyanna would arrive in Beldingsville the next day, the twenty-fifth of June, at four o'clock. Miss Polly read the telegram, frowned, then climbed the stairs to the attic room. She still frowned as she looked about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room contained a small bed, neatly made, two straight-backed chairs, a washstand, a bureau—without any mirror—and a small table. There were no drapery curtains at the dormer windows, no pictures on the wall. All day the sun had been pouring down upon the roof, and the little room was like an oven for heat. As there were no screens, the windows had not been raised. A big fly was buzzing angrily at one of them now, up and down, up and down, trying to get out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly killed the fly, swept it through the window (raising the sash an inch for the purpose), straightened a chair, frowned again, and left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy," she said a few minutes later, at the kitchen door, "I found a fly up-stairs in Miss Pollyanna's room. The window must have been raised at some time. I have ordered screens, but until they come I shall expect you to see that the windows remain closed. My niece will arrive to-morrow at four o'clock. I desire you to meet her at the station. Timothy will take the open buggy and drive you over. The telegram says `light hair, red-checked gingham dress, and straw hat.' That is all I know, but I think it is sufficient for your purpose."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am; but—you—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly evidently read the pause aright, for she frowned and said crisply:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I shall not go. It is not necessary that I should, I think. That is all." And she turned away—Miss Polly's arrangements for the comfort of her niece, Pollyanna, were complete.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the kitchen, Nancy sent her flatiron with a vicious dig across the dish-towel she was ironing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Light hair, red-checked gingham dress, and straw hat'—all she knows, indeed! Well, I'd be ashamed ter own it up, that I would, I would— and her my onliest niece what was a-comin' from 'way across the continent!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Promptly at twenty minutes to four the next afternoon Timothy and Nancy drove off in the open buggy to meet the expected guest. Timothy was Old Tom's son. It was sometimes said in the town that if Old Tom was Miss Polly's right-hand man, Timothy was her left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Timothy was a good-natured youth, and a good-looking one, as well. Short as had been Nancy's stay at the house, the two were already good friends. To-day, however, Nancy was too full of her mission to be her usual talkative self; and almost in silence she took the drive to the station and alighted to wait for the train.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over and over in her mind she was saying it "light hair, red-checked dress, straw hat." Over and over again she was wondering just what sort of child this Pollyanna was, anyway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope for her sake she's quiet and sensible, and don't drop knives nor bang doors," she sighed to Timothy, who had sauntered up to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if she ain't, nobody knows what'll become of the rest of us," grinned Timothy. "Imagine Miss Polly and a noisy kid! Gorry! there goes the whistle now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Timothy, I—I think it was mean ter send me," chattered the suddenly frightened Nancy, as she turned and hurried to a point where she could best watch the passengers alight at the little station.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not long before Nancy saw her—the slender little girl in the red-checked gingham with two fat braids of flaxen hair hanging down her back. Beneath the straw hat, an eager, freckled little face turned to the right and to the left, plainly searching for some one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy knew the child at once, but not for some time could she control her shaking knees sufficiently to go to her. The little girl was standing quite by herself when Nancy finally did approach her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Are you Miss—Pollyanna?" she faltered. The next moment she found herself half smothered in the clasp of two gingham-clad arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad, glad , GLAD to see you," cried an eager voice in her ear. "Of course I'm Pollyanna, and I'm so glad you came to meet me! I hoped you would."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You—you did?" stammered Nancy, vaguely wondering how Pollyanna could possibly have known her—and wanted her. "You—you did?" she repeated, trying to straighten her hat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes; and I've been wondering all the way "`ARE YOU MISS—POLLYANNA?' SHE FALTERED." Illustration of Pollyanna and Nancy standing at the train station. A man carrying a box and a horse and carriage are in the background. here what you looked like," Cried the little girl, dancing on her toes, and sweeping the embarrassed Nancy from head to foot, with her eyes. "And now I know, and I'm glad you look just like you do look."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy was relieved just then to have Timothy come up. Pollyanna's words had been most confusing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is Timothy. Maybe you have a trunk," she stammered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I have," nodded Pollyanna, importantly. "I've got a brand-new one. The Ladies' Aid bought it for me—and wasn't it lovely of them, when they wanted the carpet so? Of course I don't know how much red carpet a trunk could buy, but it ought to buy some, anyhow—much as half an aisle, don't you think? I've got a little thing here in my bag that Mr. Gray said was a check, and that I must give it to you before I could get my trunk. Mr. Gray is Mrs. Gray's husband. They're cousins of Deacon Carr's wife. I came East with them, and they're lovely! And—there, here 'tis," she finished, producing the check after much fumbling in the bag she carried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy drew a long breath. Instinctively she felt that some one had to draw one—after that speech. Then she stole a glance at Timothy. Timothy's eyes were studiously turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The three were off at last, with Pollyanna's trunk in behind, and Pollyanna herself snugly ensconced between Nancy and Timothy. During the whole process of getting started, the little girl had kept up an uninterrupted stream of comments and questions, until the somewhat dazed Nancy found herself quite out of breath trying to keep up with her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There! Isn't this lovely? Is it far? I hope 'tis—I love to ride," sighed Pollyanna, as the wheels began to turn. "Of course, if 'tisn't far, I sha'n't mind, though, 'cause I'll be glad to get there all the sooner, you know. What a pretty street! I knew 'twas going to be pretty; father told me—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She stopped with a little choking breath. Nancy, looking at her apprehensively, saw that her small chin was quivering, and that her eyes were full of tears. In a moment, however, she hurried on, with a brave lifting of her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Father told me all about it. He remembered. And—and I ought to have explained before. Mrs. Gray told me to, at once—about this red gingham dress, you know, and why I'm not in black. She said you'd think 'twas queer. But there weren't any black things in the last missionary barrel, only a lady's velvet basque which Deacon Carr's wife said wasn't suitable for me at all; besides, it had white spots—worn, you know—on both elbows, and some other places. Part of the Ladies' Aid wanted to buy me a black dress and hat, but the other part thought the money ought to go toward the red carpet they're trying to get—for the church, you know. Mrs. White said maybe it was just as well, anyway, for she didn't like children in black—that is, I mean, she liked the children, of course, but not the black part."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna paused for breath, and Nancy managed to stammer:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm sure it—it'll be all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad you feel that way. I do, too," nodded Pollyanna, again with that choking little breath. "Of course, 'twould have been a good deal harder to be glad in black—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad!" gasped Nancy, surprised into an interruption.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—that father's gone to Heaven to be with mother and the rest of us, you know. He said I must be glad. But it's been pretty hard to—to do it, even in red gingham, because I—I wanted him, so; and I couldn't help feeling I ought to have him, specially as mother and the rest have God and all the angels, while I didn't have anybody but the Ladies' Aid. But now I'm sure it'll be easier because I've got you, Aunt Polly. I'm so glad I've got you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's aching sympathy for the poor little forlornness beside her turned suddenly into shocked terror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but—but you've made an awful mistake, d-dear," she faltered. "I'm only Nancy. I ain't your Aunt Polly, at all!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You—you aren't ?" stammered the little girl, in plain dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No. I'm only Nancy. I never thought of your takin' me for her. We—we ain't a bit alike we ain't, we ain't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Timothy chuckled softly; but Nancy was too disturbed to answer the merry flash from his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But who are you?" questioned Pollyanna. "You don't look a bit like a Ladies' Aider!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Timothy laughed outright this time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm Nancy, the hired girl. I do all the work except the washin' an' hard ironin'. Mis' Durgin does that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But there is an Aunt Polly?" demanded the child, anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You bet your life there is," cut in Timothy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna relaxed visibly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's all right, then." There was a moment's silence, then she went on brightly: "And do you know? I'm glad, after all, that she didn't come to meet me; because now I've got her still coming, and I've got you besides."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy flushed. Timothy turned to her with a quizzical smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I call that a pretty slick compliment," he said. "Why don't you thank the little lady?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I was thinkin' about—Miss Polly," faltered Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sighed contentedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was, too. I'm so interested in her. You know she's all the aunt I've got, and I didn't know I had her for ever so long. Then father told me. He said she lived in a lovely great big house 'way on top of a hill."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She does. You can see it now," said Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It's that big white one with the green blinds, 'way ahead."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, how pretty!—and what a lot of trees and grass all around it! I never saw such a lot of green grass, seems so, all at once. Is my Aunt Polly rich, Nancy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Miss."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm so glad. It must be perfectly lovely to have lots of money. I never knew any one that did have, only the Whites—they're some rich. They have carpets in every room and ice-cream Sundays. Does Aunt Polly have ice-cream Sundays?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy shook her head. Her lips twitched. She threw a merry look into Timothy's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Miss. Your aunt don't like ice-cream, I guess; leastways I never saw it on her table."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's face fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, doesn't she? I'm so sorry! I don't see how she can help liking ice-cream. But—anyhow, I can be kinder glad about that, 'cause the ice-cream you don't eat can't make your stomach ache like Mrs. White's did—that is, I ate hers, you know, lots of it. Maybe Aunt Polly has got the carpets, though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, she's got the carpets."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In every room?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, in almost every room," answered Nancy, frowning suddenly at the thought of that bare little attic room where there was no carpet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad," exulted Pollyanna. "I love carpets. We didn't have any, only two little rugs that came in a missionary barrel, and one of those had ink spots on it. Mrs. White had pictures, too, perfectly beautiful ones of roses and little girls kneeling and a kitty and some lambs and a lion—not together, you know—the lambs and the lion. Oh, of course the Bible says they will sometime, but they haven't yet—that is, I mean Mrs. White's haven't. Don't you just love pictures?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I don't know," answered Nancy in a half-stifled voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do. We didn't have any pictures. They don't come in the barrels much, you know. There did two come once, though. But one was so good father sold it to get money to buy me some shoes with; and the other was so bad it fell to pieces just as soon as we hung it up. Glass—it broke, you know. And I cried. But I'm glad now we didn't have any of those nice things, 'cause I shall like Aunt Polly's all the better—not being used to 'em, you see. Just as it is when the pretty hair-ribbons come in the barrels after a lot of faded-out brown ones. My! but isn't this a perfectly beautiful house?" she broke off fervently, as they turned into the wide driveway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was when Timothy was unloading the trunk that Nancy found an opportunity to mutter low in his ear:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you never say nothin' ter me again about leavin', Timothy Durgin. You couldn't hire me ter leave!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Leave! I should say not," grinned the youth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You couldn't drag me away. It'll be more fun here now, with that kid 'round, than movin'-picture shows, every day!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fun!—fun!" repeated Nancy, indignantly, "I guess it'll be somethin' more than fun for that blessed child—when them two tries ter live tergether; and I guess she'll be a-needin' some rock ter fly to for refuge. Well, I'm a-goin' ter be that rock, Timothy; I am, I am!" she vowed, as she turned and led Pollyanna up the broad steps. "FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER AUNT'S SCANDALIZED, UNYIELDING LAP."

      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IV THE LITTLE ATTIC ROOM</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS POLLY HARRINGTON did not rise to meet her niece. She looked up from her book, it is true, as Nancy and the little girl appeared in the sitting-room doorway, and she held out a hand with "duty" written large on every coldly extended finger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Pollyanna? I—" She had no chance to say more. Pollyanna, had fairly flown across the room and flung herself into her aunt's scandalized, unyielding lap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, I don't know how to be glad enough that you let me come to live with you," she was sobbing. "You don't know how perfectly lovely it is to have you and Nancy and all this after you've had just the Ladies' Aid!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very likely—though I've not had the pleasure of the Ladies' Aid's acquaintance," rejoined Miss Polly, stiffly, trying to unclasp the small, clinging fingers, and turning frowning eyes on Nancy in the doorway. "Nancy, that will do. You may go. Pollyanna, be good enough, please, to stand erect in a proper manner. I don't know yet what you look like."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna drew back at once, laughing a little hysterically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I suppose you don't; but you see I'm not very much to look at, anyway, on account of the freckles. Oh, and I ought to explain about the red gingham and the black velvet basque with white spots on the elbows. I told Nancy how father said—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; well, never mind now what your father said," interrupted Miss Polly, crisply. "You had a trunk, I presume?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, indeed, Aunt Polly. I've got a beautiful trunk that the Ladies' Aid gave me. I haven't got so very much in it—of my own, I mean. The barrels haven't had many clothes for little girls in them lately; but there were all father's books, and Mrs. White said she thought I ought to have those. You see, father—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna," interrupted her aunt again, sharply, "there is one thing that might just as well be understood right away at once; and that is, I do not care to have you keep talking of your father to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl drew in her breath tremulously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, you—you mean—" She hesitated, and her aunt filled the pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We will go up-stairs to your room. Your trunk is already there, I presume. I told Timothy to take it up—if you had one. You may follow me, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Without speaking, Pollyanna turned and followed her aunt from the room. Her eyes were brimming with tears, but her chin was bravely high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"After all, I—I reckon I'm glad she doesn't want me to talk about father," Pollyanna was thinking. "It'll be easier, maybe—if I don't talk about him. Probably, anyhow, that is why she told me not to talk about him." And Pollyanna, convinced anew of her aunt's "kindness," blinked off the tears and looked eagerly about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was on the stairway now. just ahead, her aunt's black silk skirt rustled luxuriously. Behind her an open door allowed a glimpse of soft-tinted rugs and satin-covered chairs. Beneath her feet a marvellous carpet was like green moss to the tread. On every side the gilt of picture frames or the glint of sunlight through the filmy mesh of lace curtains flashed in her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly," breathed the little girl, rapturously; "what a perfectly lovely, lovely house! How awfully glad you must be you're so rich!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Polly anna !" ejaculated her aunt, turning sharply about as she reached the head of the stairs. "I'm surprised at you—making a speech like that to me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, aren't you?" queried Pollyanna, in frank wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not, Pollyanna. I hope I could not so far forget myself as to be sinfully proud of any gift the Lord has seen fit to bestow upon me," declared the lady; "certainly not, of riches !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly turned and walked down the hall toward the attic stairway door. She was glad, now, that she had put the child in the attic room. Her idea at first had been to get her niece as far away as possible from herself, and at the same time place her where her childish heedlessness would not destroy valuable furnishings. Now—with this evident strain of vanity showing thus early—it was all the more fortunate that the room planned for her was plain and sensible, thought Miss Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eagerly Pollyanna's small feet pattered behind her aunt. Still more eagerly her big blue eyes tried to look in all directions at once, that no thing of beauty or interest in this wonderful house might be passed unseen. Most eagerly of all her mind turned to the wondrously exciting problem about to be solved: behind which of all these fascinating doors was waiting now her room—the dear, beautiful room full of curtains, rugs, and pictures, that was to be her very own? Then, abruptly, her aunt opened a door and ascended another stairway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was little to be seen here. A bare wall rose on either side. At the top of the stairs, wide reaches of shadowy space led to far corners where the roof came almost down to the floor, and where were stacked innumerable trunks and boxes. It was hot and stifling, too. Unconsciously Pollyanna lifted her head higher—it seemed so hard to breathe. Then she saw that her aunt had thrown open a door at the right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, Pollyanna, here is your room, and your trunk is here, I see. Have you your key?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna nodded dumbly. Her eyes were a little wide and frightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her aunt frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When I ask a question, Pollyanna, I prefer that you should answer aloud not merely with your head."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you; that is better. I believe you have everything that you need here," she added, glancing at the well-filled towel rack and water pitcher. "I will send Nancy up to help you unpack. Supper is at six o'clock," she finished, as she left the room and swept down-stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment after she had gone Pollyanna stood quite still, looking after her. Then she turned her wide eyes to the bare wall, the bare floor, the bare windows. She turned them last to the little trunk that had stood not so long before in her own little room in the far-away Western home. The next moment she stumbled blindly toward it and fell on her knees at its side, covering her face with her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy found her there when she came up a few minutes later.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, you poor lamb," she crooned, dropping to the floor and drawing the little girl into her arms. "I was just a-fearin! I'd find you like this, like this."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I'm bad and wicked, Nancy—awful wicked," she sobbed. "I just can't make myself understand that God and the angels needed my father more than I did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No more they did, neither," declared Nancy, stoutly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh-h!— Nancy !" The burning horror in Pollyanna's eyes dried the tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy gave a shamefaced smile and rubbed her own eyes vigorously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, child, I didn't mean it, of course," she cried briskly. "Come, let's have your key and we'll get inside this trunk and take our your dresses in no time, no time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somewhat tearfully Pollyanna produced the key.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There aren't very many there, anyway," she faltered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then they're all the sooner unpacked," declared Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna gave a sudden radiant smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so! I can be glad of that, can't I?" she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy stared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of—course," she answered a little uncertainly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's capable hands made short work of unpacking the books, the patched undergarments, and the few pitifully unattractive dresses. Pollyanna, smiling bravely now, flew about, hanging the dresses in the closet, stacking the books on the table, and putting away the undergarments in the bureau drawers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm sure it—it's going to be a very nice room. Don't you think so?" she stammered, after a while.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer. Nancy was very busy, apparently, with her head in the trunk. Pollyanna, standing at the bureau, gazed a little wistfully at the bare wall above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I can be glad there isn't any looking-glass here, too, 'cause where there isn't any glass I can't see my freckles."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy made a sudden queer little sound with her mouth—but when Pollyanna turned, her head was in the trunk again. At one of the windows, a few minutes later, Pollyanna gave a glad cry and clapped her hands joyously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Nancy, I hadn't seen this before," she breathed. "Look—'way off there, with those trees and the houses and that lovely church spire, and the river shining just like silver. Why, Nancy, there doesn't anybody need any pictures with that to look at. Oh, I'm so glad now she let me have this room!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Pollyanna's surprise and dismay, Nancy burst into tears. Pollyanna hurriedly crossed to her side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Nancy, Nancy—what is it?" she cried; then, fearfully: "This wasn't— your room, was it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My room! stormed Nancy, hotly, choking back the tears. If you ain't a little angel straight from Heaven, and if some folks don't eat dirt before—Oh, land! there's her bell!" After which amazing speech, Nancy sprang to her feet, dashed out of the room, and went clattering down the stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Left alone, Pollyanna went back to her "picture," as she mentally designated the beautiful view from the window. After a time she touched the sash tentatively. It seemed as if no longer could she endure the stifling heat. To her joy the sash moved under her fingers. The next moment the window was wide open, and Pollyanna was leaning far out, drinking in the fresh, sweet air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She ran then to the other window. That, too, soon flew up under her eager hands. A big fly swept past her nose, and buzzed noisily about the room. Then another came, and another; but Pollyanna paid no heed. Pollyanna had made a wonderful discovery—against this window a huge tree flung great branches. To Pollyanna they looked like arms outstretched, inviting her. Suddenly she laughed aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I believe I can do it," she chuckled. The next moment she had climbed nimbly to the window ledge. From there it was an easy matter to step to the nearest tree-branch. Then, clinging like a monkey, she swung herself from limb to limb until the lowest branch was reached. The drop to the ground was—even for Pollyanna, who was used to climbing trees—a little fearsome. She took it, however, with bated breath, swinging from her strong little arms, and landing on all fours in the soft grass. Then she picked herself up and looked eagerly about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She was at the back of the house. Before her lay a garden in which a bent old man was working. Beyond the garden a little path through an open field led up a steep hill, at the top of which a lone pine tree stood on guard beside the huge rock. To Pollyanna, at the moment, there seemed to be just one place in the world worth being in—the top of that big rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a run and a skilful turn, Pollyanna skipped by the bent old man, threaded her way between the orderly rows of green growing things, and—a little out of breath—reached the path that ran through the open field. Then, determinedly, she began to climb. Already, however, she was thinking what a long, long way off that rock must be, when back at the window it had looked so near!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fifteen minutes later the great clock in the hallway of the Harrington homestead struck six. At precisely the last stroke Nancy sounded the bell for supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One, two, three minutes passed. Miss Polly frowned and tapped the floor with her slipper. A little jerkily she rose to her feet, went into the hall, and looked up-stairs, plainly impatient. For a minute she listened intently; then she turned and swept into the dining room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy," she said with decision, as soon as the little serving-maid appeared; "my niece is late. No, you need not call her," she added severely, as Nancy made a move toward the hall door. "I told her what time supper was, and now she will have to suffer the consequences. She may as well begin at once to learn to be punctual. When she comes down she may have bread and milk in the kitchen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am." It was well, perhaps, that Miss Polly did not happen to be looking at Nancy's face just then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the earliest possible moment after supper, Nancy crept up the back stairs and thence to the attic room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bread and milk, indeed!—and when the poor lamb hain't only just cried herself to sleep," she was muttering fiercely, as she softly pushed open the door. The next moment she gave a frightened cry. "Where are you? Where've you gone? Where have you gone?" she panted, looking in the closet, under the bed, and even in the trunk and down the water pitcher. Then she flew down-stairs and out to Old Tom in the garden.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Tom, Mr. Tom, that blessed child's gone," she wailed. "She's vanished right up into Heaven where she come from, poor lamb—and me told ter give her bread and milk in the kitchen—her what's eatin' angel food this minute, I'll warrant, I'll warrant!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old man straightened up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gone? Heaven?" he repeated stupidly, unconsciously sweeping the brilliant sunset sky with his gaze. He stopped, stared a moment intently, then turned with a slow grin. "Well, Nancy, it do look like as if she'd tried ter get as nigh Heaven as she could, and that's a fact," he agreed, pointing with a crooked finger to where, sharply outlined against the reddening sky, a slender, wind-blown figure was poised on top of a huge rock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, she ain't goin' ter Heaven that way ternight—not if I has my say," declared Nancy, doggedly. "If the mistress asks, tell her I ain't furgettin' the dishes, but I gone on a stroll," she flung back over her shoulder, as she sped toward the path that led through the open field.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER V THE GAME</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"FOR the land's sake, Miss Pollyanna, what a scare you did give me," panted Nancy, hurrying up to the big rock, down which Pollyanna had just regretfully slid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Scare? Oh, I'm so sorry; but you mustn't, really, ever get scared about me, Nancy. Father and the Ladies' Aid used to do it, too, till they found I always came back all right."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I didn't even know you'd went," cried Nancy, tucking the little girl's hand under her arm and hurrying her down the hill. "I didn't see you go, and nobody didn't. I guess you flew right up through the roof; I do, I do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna skipped gleefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I did, 'most—only I flew down instead of up. I came down the tree."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy stopped short.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did—what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Came down the tree, outside my window."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My stars and stockings!" gasped Nancy, hurrying on again. "I'd like ter know what yer aunt would say ter that!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you? Well, I'll tell her, then, so you can find out," promised the little girl, cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mercy!" gasped Nancy. "No—no!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you don't mean she'd care !" cried Pollyanna, plainly disturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No—er—yes—well, never mind. I—I ain't so very particular about knowin' what she'd say, truly," stammered Nancy, determined to keep one scolding from Pollyanna, if nothing more. "But, say, we better hurry. I've got ter get them dishes done, ye know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll help," promised Pollyanna, promptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Miss Pollyanna!" demurred Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment there was silence. The sky was darkening fast. Pollyanna took a firmer hold of her friend's arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon I'm glad, after all, that you did get scared—a little, 'cause then you came after me," she shivered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor little lamb! And you must be hungry, too. I—I'm afraid you'll have ter have bread and milk in the kitchen with me. Yer aunt didn't like it—because you didn't come down ter supper, ye know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I couldn't. I was up here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; but—she didn't know that, you see!" observed Nancy, dryly, stifling a chuckle. "I'm sorry about the bread and milk; I am, I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm not. I'm glad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad! Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I like bread and milk, and I'd like to eat with you. I don't see any trouble about being glad about that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't seem ter see any trouble bein' glad about everythin'," retorted Nancy, choking a little over her remembrance of Pollyanna's brave attempts to like the bare little attic room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's the game, you know, anyway."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The— game ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; the `just being glad' game."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whatever in the world are you talkin' about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it's a game. Father told it to me, and it's lovely," rejoined Pollyanna. "We've played it always, ever since I was a little, little girl. I told the Ladies' Aid, and they played it—some of them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is it? I ain't much on games. though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed again, but she sighed, too; and in the gathering twilight her face looked thin and wistful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, we began it on some crutches that came in a missionary barrel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Crutches!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. You see I'd wanted a doll, and father had written them so; but when the barrel came the lady wrote that there hadn't any dolls come in, but the little crutches had. So she sent 'em along as they might come in handy for some child, sometime. And that's when we began it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I must say I can't see any game about that, about that," declared Nancy, almost irritably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes; the game was to just find something about everything to be glad about—no matter what 'twas," rejoined Pollyanna, earnestly. "And we began right then—on the crutches."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, goodness me! I can't see anythin' ter be glad about—gettin' a pair of crutches when you wanted a doll!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna clapped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There is—there is," she crowed. "But I couldn't see it, either, Nancy, at first," she added, with quick honesty. "Father had to tell it to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, then, suppose you tell me ," almost snapped Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Goosey! Why, just be glad because you don't— need —' em !" exulted Pollyanna, triumphantly. "You see it's just as easy—when you know how!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of all the queer doin's!" breathed Nancy, regarding Pollyanna with almost fearful eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but it isn't queer—it's lovely," maintained Pollyanna enthusiastically. "And we've played it ever since. And the harder 'tis, the more fun 'tis to get 'em out; only—only—sometimes it's almost too hard—like when your father goes to Heaven, and there isn't anybody but a Ladies' Aid left."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, or when you're put in a snippy little room 'way at the top of the house with nothin' in it," growled Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That was a hard one, at first," she admitted, "specially when I was so kind of lonesome. I just didn't feel like playing the game, anyway, and I had been wanting pretty things, so! Then I happened to think how I hated to see my freckles in the looking-glass, and I saw that lovely picture out the window, too; so then I knew I'd found the things to be glad about. You see, when you're hunting for the glad things, you sort of forget the other kind—like the doll you wanted, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!" choked Nancy, trying to swallow the lump in her throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Most generally it doesn't take so long," sighed Pollyanna; "and lots of times now I just think of them without thinking, you know. I've got so used to playing it. It's a lovely game. F-father and I used to like it so much," she faltered. "I suppose, though, it—it'll be a little harder now, as long as I haven't anybody to play it with. Maybe Aunt Polly will play it, though," she added, as an after-thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My stars and stockings!— her !" breathed Nancy, behind her teeth. Then, aloud, she said doggedly: "See here, Miss Pollyanna, I ain't sayin' that I'll play it very well, and I ain't sayin' that I know how, anyway; but I'll play it with ye, after a fashion—I just will, I will!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Nancy!" exulted Pollyanna, giving her a rapturous hug. "That'll be splendid! Won't we have fun?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Er—maybe," conceded Nancy, in open doubt. "But you mustn't count too much on me, ye know. I never was no case fur games. but I'm a-goin' ter make a most awful old try on this one. You're goin' ter have some one ter play it with, anyhow," she finished, as they entered the kitchen together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna ate her bread and milk with good appetite; then, at Nancy's suggestion, she went into the sitting room, where her aunt sat reading. Miss Polly looked up coldly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you had your supper, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm very sorry, Pollyanna, to have been obliged so soon to send you into the kitchen to eat bread and milk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I was real glad you did it, Aunt Polly. I like bread and milk, and Nancy, too. You mustn't feel bad about that one bit."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly sat suddenly a little more erect in her chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, it's quite time you were in bed. You have had a hard day, and to-morrow we must plan your hours and go over your clothing to see what it is necessary to get for you. Nancy will give you a candle. Be careful how you handle it. Breakfast will be at half-past seven. See that you are down to that. Good-night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite as a matter of course, Pollyanna came straight to her aunt's side and gave her an affectionate hug.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've had such a beautiful time, so far," she sighed happily. I know I'm going to just love living with you but then, I knew I should before I came. Good-night," she called cheerfully, as she ran from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, upon my soul!" ejaculated Miss Polly, half aloud. "What a most extraordinary child!" Then she frowned. "She's `glad' I punished her, and I `mustn't feel bad one bit,' and she's going to `love to live' with me! Well, upon my soul!" ejaculated Miss Polly again, as she took up her book.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fifteen minutes later, in the attic room, a lonely little girl sobbed into the tightly-clutched sheet:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know, father-among-the-angels, I'm not playing the game one bit now—not one bit; but I don't believe even you could find anything to be glad about sleeping all alone 'way off up here in the dark—like this. If only I was near Nancy or Aunt Polly, or even a Ladies' Aider, it would be easier!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down-stairs in the kitchen, Nancy, hurrying with her belated work, jabbed her dish-mop into the milk pitcher, and muttered Jerkily:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If playin' a silly-fool game—about bein' glad you've got crutches when you want dolls—is got ter be—my way—o' bein' that rock o' refuge—why, I'm a-goin' ter play it—I am, I am!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VI A QUESTION OF DUTY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was nearly seven o'clock when Pollyanna awoke that first day after her arrival. Her windows faced the south and the west, so she could not see the sun yet; but she could see the hazy blue of the morning sky, and she knew that the day promised to be a fair one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little room was cooler now, and the air blew in fresh and sweet. Outside, the birds were twittering joyously, and Pollyanna flew to the window to talk to them. She saw then that down in the garden her aunt was already out among the rosebushes. With rapid fingers, therefore, she made herself ready to join her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down the attic stairs sped Pollyanna, leaving both doors wide open. Through the hall, down the next flight, then bang through the front screened-door and around to the garden, she ran.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly, with the bent old man, was leaning over a rose-bush when Pollyanna, gurgling with delight, flung herself upon her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, I reckon I am glad this morning just to be alive!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Polly anna !" remonstrated the lady, sternly, pulling herself as erect as she could with a dragging weight of ninety pounds hanging about her neck. Is this the usual way you say good morning?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl dropped to her toes, and danced lightly up and down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, only when I love folks so I just can't help it! I saw you from my window, Aunt Polly, and I got to thinking how you weren't a Ladies' Aider, and you were my really truly aunt; and you looked so good I just had to come down and hug you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The bent old man turned his back suddenly. Miss Polly attempted a frown—with not her usual success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, you—I—Thomas, that will do for this morning. I think you understand—about those rose-bushes," she said stiffly. Then she turned and walked rapidly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you always work in the garden, Mr.—Man?" asked Pollyanna, interestedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man turned. His lips were twitching, but his eyes looked blurred as if with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Miss. I'm Old Tom, the gardener," he answered. Timidly, but as if impelled by an irresistible force, he reached out a shaking hand and let it rest for a moment on her bright hair. "You are so like your mother. little Miss! I used ter know her when she was even littler than you be. You see, I used ter work in the garden—then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna caught her breath audibly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You did? And you knew my mother, really—when she was just a little earth angel, and not a Heaven one? Oh, please tell me about her!" And down plumped Pollyanna in the middle of the dirt path by the old man's side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A bell sounded from the house. The next moment Nancy was seen flying out the back door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Pollyanna, that bell means breakfast—mornin's," she panted, pulling the little girl to her feet and hurrying her back to the house; "and other times it means other meals. But it always means that you're ter run like time when ye hear it, no matter where ye be. If ye don't—well, it'll take somethin' smarter'n we be ter find anythin ' ter be glad about in that!" she finished, shooing Pollyanna into the house as she would shoo an unruly chicken into a coop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Breakfast, for the first five minutes, was a silent meal; then Miss Polly, her disapproving eyes following the airy wings of two flies darting here and there over the table, said sternly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy, where did those flies come from?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, ma'am. There wasn't one in the kitchen." Nancy had been too excited to notice Pollyanna's up-flung windows the afternoon before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon maybe they're my flies, Aunt Polly," observed Pollyanna, amiably. "There were lots of them this morning having a beautiful time upstairs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy left the room precipitately, though to do so she had to carry out the hot muffins she had just brought in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yours!" gasped Miss Polly. "What do you mean? Where did they come from?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, they came from out of doors of course, through the windows. I saw some of them come in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You saw them! You mean you raised those windows without any screens?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes. There weren't any screens there, Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy, at this moment, came in again with the muffins. Her face was grave, but very red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy," directed her mistress, sharply, "you may set the muffins down and go at once to Miss Pollyanna's room and shut the windows. Shut the doors, also. Later, when your morning work is done, go through every room with the spatter. See that you make a thorough search."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To her niece she said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, I have ordered screens for those windows. I knew, of course, that it was my duty to do that. But it seems to me that you have quite forgotten your duty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My—duty?" Pollyanna's eyes were wide with wonder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly. I know it is warm, but I consider it your duty to keep your windows closed till those screens come. Flies, Pollyanna, are not only unclean and annoying, but very dangerous to health. After breakfast I will give you a little pamphlet on this matter to read."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To read? Oh, thank you, Aunt Polly. I love to read!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly drew in her breath audibly, then she shut her lips together hard. Pollyanna, seeing her stern face, frowned a little thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I'm sorry about the duty I forgot, Aunt Polly," she apologized timidly. "I won't raise the windows again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her aunt made no reply. She did not speak, indeed, until the meal was over. Then she rose, went to the bookcase in the sitting room, took out a small paper booklet, and crossed the room to her niece's side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This is the article I spoke of, Pollyanna. I desire you to go to your room at once and read it. I will be up in half an hour to look over your things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna, her eyes on the illustration of a fly's head, many times magnified, cried joyously:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, thank you, Aunt Polly!" The next moment she skipped merrily from the room, banging the door behind her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly frowned, hesitated, then crossed the room majestically and opened the door; but Pollyanna was already out of sight, clattering up the attic stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Half an hour later when Miss Polly, her face expressing stern duty in every line, climbed those stairs and entered Pollyanna's room, she was greeted with a burst of eager enthusiasm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, I never saw anything so perfectly lovely and interesting in my life. I'm so glad you gave me that book to read! Why, I didn't suppose flies could carry such a lot of things on their feet, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do," observed Aunt Polly, with dignity. "Pollyanna, you may bring out your clothes now, and I will look them over. What are not suitable for you I shall give to the Sullivans, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With visible reluctance Pollyanna laid down the pamphlet and turned toward the closet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid you'll think they're worse than the Ladies' Aid did—and they said they were shameful," she sighed. "But there were mostly things for boys and older folks in the last two or three barrels; and—did you ever have a missionary barrel, Aunt Polly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At her aunt's look of shocked anger, Pollyanna corrected herself at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no, of course you didn't, Aunt Polly!" she hurried on, with a hot blush. "I forgot; rich folks never have to have them. But you see sometimes I kind of forget that you are rich—up here in this room, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly's lips parted indignantly, but no words came. Pollyanna, plainly unaware that she had said anything in the least unpleasant, was hurrying on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, as I was going to say, you can't tell a thing about missionary barrels—except that you won't find in 'em what you think you're going to—even when you think you won't. It was the barrels every time, too, that were hardest to play the game on, for father and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just in time Pollyanna remembered that she was not to talk of her father to her aunt. She dived into her closet then, hurriedly, and brought out all the poor little dresses in both her arms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They aren't nice, at all," she choked, "and they'd been black if it hadn't been for the red carpet for the church; but they're all I've got."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With the tips of her fingers Miss Polly turned over the conglomerate garments, so obviously made for anybody but Pollyanna. Next she bestowed frowning attention on the patched undergarments in the bureau drawers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got the best ones on," confessed Pollyanna, anxiously. "The Ladies' Aid bought me one set straight through all whole. Mrs. Jones—she's the president—told 'em I should have that if they had to clatter down bare aisles themselves the rest of their days. But they won't. Mr. White doesn't like the noise. He's got nerves, his wife says; but he's got money, too, and they expect he'll give a lot toward the carpet—on account of the nerves, you know. I should think he'd be glad that if he did have the nerves he'd got money, too; shouldn't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly did not seem to hear. Her scrutiny of the undergarments finished, she turned to Pollyanna somewhat abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have been to school, of course, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, Aunt Polly. Besides, fath—I mean, I was taught at home some, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very good. In the fall you will enter school here, of course. Mr. Hall, the principal, will doubtless settle in which grade you belong. Meanwhile, I suppose I ought to hear you read aloud half an hour each day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love to read; but if you don't want to hear me I'd be just glad to read to myself—truly, Aunt Polly. And I wouldn't have to half try to be glad, either, for I like best to read to myself—on account of the big words, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't doubt it," rejoined Miss Polly, grimly. Have you studied music?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much. I don't like my music—I like other people's, though. I learned to play on the piano a little. Miss Gray—she plays for church—she taught me. But I'd just as soon let that go as not, Aunt Polly. I'd rather, truly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very likely," observed Aunt Polly, with slightly uplifted eyebrows. "Nevertheless I think it is my duty to see that you are properly instructed in at least the rudiments of music. You sew, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am." Pollyanna sighed. The Ladies' Aid taught me that. But I had an awful time. Mrs. Jones didn't believe in holding your needle like the rest of 'em did on buttonholing, and Mrs. White thought backstitching ought to be taught you before hemming (or else the other way), and Mrs. Harriman didn't believe in putting you on patchwork ever, at all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, there will be no difficulty of that kind any longer, Pollyanna. I shall teach you sewing myself, of course. You do not know how to cook, I presume."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They were just beginning to teach me that this summer, but I hadn't got far. They were more divided up on that than they were on the sewing. They were going to begin on bread; but there wasn't two of 'em that made it alike, so after arguing it all one sewing-meeting, they decided to take turns at me one forenoon a week—in their own kitchens, you know. I'd only learned chocolate fudge and fig cake, though, when—when I had to stop." Her voice broke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Chocolate fudge and fig cake, indeed!" scorned Miss Polly. "I think we can remedy that very soon." She paused in thought for a minute, then went on slowly: "At nine o'clock every morning you will read aloud one half-hour to me. Before that you will use the time to put this room in order. Wednesday and Saturday forenoons, after half-past nine, you will spend with Nancy in the kitchen, learning to cook. Other mornings you will sew with me. That will leave the afternoons for your music. I shall, of course, procure a teacher at once for you," she finished decisively, as she arose from her chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna cried out in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, you haven't left me any time at all just to—to live."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To live, child! What do you mean? As if you weren't living all the time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, of course I'd be breathing all the time I was doing those things, Aunt Polly, but I wouldn't be living. You breathe all the time you're asleep, but you aren't living. I mean living—doing the things you want to do: playing outdoors, reading (to myself, of course), climbing hills, talking to Mr. Tom in the garden, and Nancy, and finding out all about the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday. That's what I call living, Aunt Polly. Just breathing isn't living!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly lifted her head irritably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, you are the most extraordinary child! You will be allowed a proper amount of playtime, of course. But, surely, it seems to me if I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and instruction, you ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, as if I ever could be ungrateful—to you ! Why, I love you —and you aren't even a Ladies' Aider; you're an aunt!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; then see that you don't act ungrateful," vouchsafed Miss Polly, as she turned toward the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had gone halfway down the stairs when a small, unsteady voice called after her:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please, Aunt Polly, you didn't tell me which of my things you wanted to—to give away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly emitted a tired sigh—a sigh that ascended straight to Pollyanna's ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I forgot to tell you, Pollyanna. Timothy will drive us into town at half-past one this afternoon. Not one of your garments is fit for my niece to wear. Certainly I should be very far from doing my duty by you if I should let you appear out in any one of them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sighed now—she believed she was going to hate that word—duty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly, please," she called wistfully, "isn't there any way you can be glad about all that—duty business?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?" Miss Polly looked up in dazed surprise; then, suddenly, with very red cheeks, she turned and swept angrily down the stairs. "Don't be impertinent, Pollyanna!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the hot little attic room Pollyanna dropped herself on to one of the straight-backed chairs. To her, existence loomed ahead one endless round of duty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see, really, what there was impertinent about that," she sighed. "I was only asking her if she couldn't tell me something to be glad about in all that duty business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For several minutes Pollyanna sat in silence, her rueful eyes fixed on the forlorn heap of garments on the bed. Then, slowly, she rose and began to put away the dresses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There just isn't anything to be glad about, that I can see," she said aloud; "unless—it's to be glad when the duty's done!" Whereupon she laughed suddenly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VII POLLYANNA AND PUNISHMENTS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT half-past one o'clock Timothy drove Miss Polly and her niece to the four or five principal dry goods stores, which were about half a mile from the homestead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fitting Pollyanna with a new wardrobe proved to be more or less of an exciting experience for all concerned. Miss Polly came out of it with the feeling of limp relaxation that one might have at finding oneself at last on solid earth after a perilous walk across the very thin crust of a volcano. The various clerks who had waited upon the pair came out of it with very red faces, and enough amusing stories of Pollyanna to keep their friends in gales of laughter the rest of the week. Pollyanna herself came out of it with radiant smiles and a heart content; for, as she expressed it to one of the clerks: "When you haven't had anybody but missionary barrels and Ladies' Aiders to dress you, it is perfectly lovely to just walk right in and buy clothes that are brand-new, and that don't have to be tucked up or let down because they don't fit!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The shopping expedition consumed the entire afternoon; then came supper and a delightful talk with Old Tom in the garden, and another with Nancy on the back porch, after the dishes were done, and while Aunt Polly paid a visit to a neighbor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom told Pollyanna wonderful things of her mother, that made her very happy indeed; and Nancy told her all about the little farm six miles away at "The Corners," where lived her own dear mother, and her equally dear brother and sisters. She promised, too, that sometime, if Miss Polly were willing, Pollyanna should be taken to see them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And they've got lovely names, too. You'll like their names," sighed Nancy. "They're `Algernon,' and `Florabelle' and `Estelle.' I—I just hate `Nancy'!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Nancy, what a dreadful thing to say! Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because it isn't pretty like the others. You see, I was the first baby, and mother hadn't begun ter read so many stories with the pretty names in 'em, then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I love `Nancy,' just because it's you," declared Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! Well, I guess you could love `Clarissa Mabelle' just as well," retorted Nancy, and it would be a heap happier for me. I think that name's just grand!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, anyhow," she chuckled, "you can be glad it isn't `Hephzibah.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hephzibah!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Mrs. White's name is that. Her husband calls her `Hep,' and she doesn't like it. She says when he calls out `Hep—Hep!' she feels just as if the next minute he was going to yell `Hurrah!' And she doesn't like to be hurrahed at."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's gloomy face relaxed into a broad smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you don't beat the Dutch! Say, do you know?—I sha'n't never hear `Nancy' now that I don't think o' that `Hep—Hep!' and giggle. My, I guess I am glad—" She stopped short and turned amazed eyes on the little girl. "Say, Miss Pollyanna, do you mean—was you playin' that 'ere game then —about my bein' glad I wa'n't named Hephzibah'?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned; then she laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Nancy, that's so! I was playing the game—but that's one of the times I just did it without thinking, I reckon. You see, you do , lots of times; you get so used to it—looking for something to be glad about, you know. And most generally there is something about everything that you can be glad about, if you keep hunting long enough to find it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, m-maybe," granted Nancy, with open doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At half-past eight Pollyanna went up to bed. The screens had not yet come, and the close little room was like an oven. With longing eyes Pollyanna looked at the two fast-closed windows—but she did not raise them. She undressed, folded her clothes neatly, said her prayers, blew out her candle and climbed into bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just how long she lay in sleepless misery, tossing from side to side of the hot little cot, she did not know; but it seemed to her that it must have been hours before she finally slipped out of bed, felt her way across the room and opened her door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out in the main attic all was velvet blackness save where the moon flung a path of silver half-way across the floor from the east dormer window. With a resolute ignoring of that fearsome darkness to the right and to the left, Pollyanna drew a quick breath and pattered straight into that silvery path, and on to the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She had hoped, vaguely, that this window might have a screen, but it did not. Outside, however, there was a wide world of fairy-like beauty, and there was, too, she knew, fresh, sweet air that would feel so good to hot cheeks and hands!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As she stepped nearer and peered longingly out, she saw something else: she saw, only a little way below the window, the wide, flat tin roof of Miss Polly's sun parlor built over the porte-cochère. The sight filled her with longing. If only, now, she were out there!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fearfully she looked behind her. Back there, somewhere, were her hot little room and her still hotter bed; but between her and them lay a horrid desert of blackness across which one must feel one's way with outstretched, shrinking arms; while before her, out on the sun-parlor roof, were the moonlight and the cool, sweet night air.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If only her bed were out there! And folks did sleep out of doors. Joel Hartley at home, who was so sick with the consumption, had to sleep out of doors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly Pollyanna remembered that she had seen near this attic window a row of long white bags hanging from nails. Nancy had said that they contained the winter clothing, put away for the summer. A little fearfully now, Pollyanna felt her way to these bags, selected a nice fat soft one (it contained Miss Polly's sealskin coat) for a bed; and a thinner one to be doubled up for a pillow, and still another (which was so thin it seemed almost empty) for a covering. Thus equipped, Pollyanna in high glee pattered to the moonlit window again, raised the sash, stuffed her burden through to the roof below, then let herself down after it, closing the window carefully behind her—Pollyanna had not forgotten those flies with the marvellous feet that carried things.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How deliciously cool it was! Pollyanna quite danced up and down with delight, drawing in long, full breaths of the refreshing air. The tin roof under her feet crackled with little resounding snaps that Pollyanna rather liked. She walked, indeed, two or three times back and forth from end to end—it gave her such a pleasant sensation of airy space after her hot little room; and the roof was so broad and flat that she had no fear of falling off. Finally, with a sigh of content, she curled herself up on the sealskin-coat mattress, arranged one bag for a pillow and the other for a covering, and settled herself to sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm so glad now that the screens didn't come," she murmured, blinking up at the stars; "else I couldn't have had this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down-stairs in Miss Polly's room next the sun parlor, Miss Polly herself was hurrying into dressing gown and slippers, her face white and frightened. A minute before she had been telephoning in a shaking voice to Timothy:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come up quick!—you and your father. Bring lanterns. Somebody is on the roof of the sun parlor. He must have climbed up the rose-trellis or somewhere, and of course he can get right into the house through the east window in the attic. I have locked the attic door down here—but hurry, quick!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some time later, Pollyanna, just dropping off to sleep, was startled by a lantern flash, and a trio of amazed ejaculations. She opened her eyes to find Timothy at the top of a ladder near her, Old Tom just getting through the window, and her aunt peering out at her from behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, what does this mean?" cried Aunt Polly then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna blinked sleepy eyes and sat up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Tom—Aunt Polly!" she stammered. "Don't look so scared! It isn't that I've got the consumption, you know, like Joel Hartley. It's only that I was so hot—in there. But I shut the window, Aunt Polly, so the flies couldn't carry those germ-things in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Timothy disappeared suddenly down the ladder. Old Tom, with almost equal precipitation, handed his lantern to Miss Polly, and followed his son. Miss Polly bit her lip hard—until the men were gone; then she said sternly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, hand those things to me at once and come in here. Of all the extraordinary children!" she ejaculated a little later, as, with Pollyanna by her side, and the lantern in her hand, she turned back into the attic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Pollyanna the air was all the more stifling after that cool breath of the out of doors; but she did not complain. She only drew a long quivering sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the top of the stairs Miss Polly jerked out crisply:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"For the rest of the night, Pollyanna, you are to sleep in my bed with me. The screens will be here to-morrow, but until then I consider it my duty to keep you where I know where you are."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna drew in her breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With you?—in your bed?" she cried rapturously. "Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, how perfectly lovely of you! And when I've so wanted to sleep with some one sometime—some one that belonged to me, you know; not a Ladies' Aider. I've had them. My! I reckon I am glad now those screens didn't come! Wouldn't you be?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no reply. Miss Polly was stalking on ahead. Miss Polly, to tell the truth, was feeling curiously helpless. For the third time since Pollyanna's arrival, Miss Polly was punishing Pollyanna—and for the third time she was being confronted with the amazing fact that her punishment was being taken as a special reward of merit. No wonder Miss Polly was feeling curiously helpless.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER VIII POLLYANNA PAYS A VISIT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was not long before life at the Harrington homestead settled into something like order—though not exactly the order that Miss Polly had at first prescribed. Pollyanna sewed, practised, read aloud, and studied cooking in the kitchen, it is true; but she did not give to any of these things quite so much time as had first been planned. She had more time, also, to "just live," as she expressed it, for almost all of every afternoon from two until six o'clock was hers to do with as she liked—provided she did not "like" to do certain things already prohibited by Aunt Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is a question, perhaps, whether all this leisure time was given to the child as a relief to Pollyanna from work—or as a relief to Aunt Polly from Pollyanna. Certainly, as those first July days passed, Miss Polly found occasion many times to ejaculate "What an extraordinary child!" and certainly the reading and sewing lessons found her at their conclusion each day somewhat dazed and wholly exhausted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy, in the kitchen, fared better. She was not dazed nor exhausted. Wednesdays and Saturdays came to be, indeed, red-letter days to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were no children in the immediate neighborhood of the Harrington homestead for Pollyanna to play with. The house itself was on the outskirts of the village, and though there were other houses not far away, they did not chance to contain any boys or girls near Pollyanna's age. This, however, did not seem to disturb Pollyanna in the least.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, I don't mind it at all," she explained to Nancy. "I'm happy just to walk around and see the streets and the houses and watch the people. I just love people. Don't you, Nancy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I can't say I do—all of 'em," retorted Nancy, tersely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Almost every pleasant afternoon found Pollyanna begging for "an errand to run," so that she might be off for a walk in one direction or another; and it was on these walks that frequently she met the Man. To herself Pollyanna always called him "the Man," no matter if she met a dozen other men the same day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Man often wore a long black coat and a high silk hat—two things that the "just men" never wore. His face was clean shaven and rather pale, and his hair, showing below his hat, was somewhat gray. He walked erect, and rather rapidly, and he was always alone, which made Pollyanna vaguely sorry for him. Perhaps it was because of this that she one day spoke to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, sir? Isn't this a nice day?" she called cheerily, as she approached him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man threw a hurried glance about him, then stopped uncertainly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you speak—to me?" he asked in a sharp voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna. "I say, it's a nice day, isn't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh? Oh! Humph!" he grunted; and strode on again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed. He was such a funny man, she thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day she saw him again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tisn't quite so nice as yesterday, but it's pretty nice," she called out cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh? Oh! Humph!" grunted the man as before; and once again Pollyanna laughed happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When for the third time Pollyanna accosted him in much the same manner, the man stopped abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, child, who are you, and why are you speaking to me every day?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm Pollyanna Whittier, and I thought you looked lonesome. I'm so glad you stopped. Now we're introduced—only I don't know your name yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of all the—" The man did not finish his sentence, but strode on faster than ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked after him with a disappointed droop to her usually smiling lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe he didn't understand—but that was only half an introduction. I don't know his name, yet," she murmured, as she proceeded on her way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was carrying calf's-foot jelly to Mrs. Snow to-day. Miss Polly Harrington always sent something to Mrs. Snow once a week. She said she thought that it was her duty, inasmuch as Mrs. Snow was poor, sick, and a member of her church—it was the duty of all the church members to look out for her, of course. Miss Polly did her duty by Mrs. Snow usually on Thursday afternoons—not personally, but through Nancy. To-day Pollyanna had begged the privilege, and Nancy had promptly given it to her in accordance with Miss Polly's orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And it's glad that I am ter get rid of it," Nancy had declared in private afterwards to Pollyanna; "though it's a shame ter be tuckin' the job off on ter you, poor lamb, so it is, it is!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I'd love to do it, Nancy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you won't—after you've done it once," predicted Nancy, sourly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why not?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because nobody does. If folks wa'n't sorry for her there wouldn't a soul go near her from mornin' till night, she's that cantankerous. All is, I pity her daughter what has ter take care of her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, why, Nancy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy shrugged her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, in plain words, it's just that nothin' what ever has happened, has happened right in Mis' Snow's eyes. Even the days of the week ain't run ter her mind. If it's Monday she's bound ter say she wished 'twas Sunday; and if you take her jelly you're pretty sure ter hear she wanted chicken—but if you did bring her chicken, she'd be jest hankerin' for lamb broth!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what a funny woman," laughed Pollyanna. "I think I shall like to go to see her. She must be so surprising and—and different. I love different folks."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! Well, Mis' Snow's `different,' all right—I hope, for the sake of the rest of us!" Nancy had finished grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was thinking of these remarks to-day as she turned in at the gate of the shabby little cottage. Her eyes were quite sparkling, indeed, at the prospect of meeting this "different" Mrs. Snow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A pale-faced, tired-looking young girl answered her knock at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do?" began Pollyanna politely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I'm from Miss Polly Harrington, and I'd like to see Mrs. Snow, please."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you would, you're the first one that ever `liked' to see her," muttered the girl under her breath; but Pollyanna did not hear this. The girl had turned and was leading the way through the hall to a door at the end of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the sick-room, after the girl had ushered her in and closed the door, Pollyanna blinked a little before she could accustom her eyes to the gloom. Then she saw, dimly outlined, a woman half-sitting up in the bed across the room. Pollyanna advanced at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Mrs. Snow? Aunt Polly says she hopes you are comfortable to-day, and she's sent you some calf's-foot jelly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear me! jelly?" murmured a fretful voice, "Of course I'm very much obliged, but I was hoping 'twould be lamb broth to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I thought it was chicken you wanted when folks brought you jelly," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What?" The sick woman turned sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, nothing, much," apologized Pollyanna, hurriedly; "and of course it doesn't really make any difference. It's only that Nancy said it was chicken you wanted when we brought jelly, and lamb broth when we brought chicken—but maybe 'twas the other way, and Nancy forgot."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sick woman pulled herself up till she sat erect in the bed—a most unusual thing for her to do, though Pollyanna did not know this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Miss Impertinence, who are you?" she demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed gleefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that isn't my name, Mrs. Snow—and I'm so glad 'tisn't, too! That would be worse than `Hephzibah,' wouldn't it? I'm Pollyanna Whittier, Miss Polly Harrington's niece, and I've come to live with her. That's why I'm here with the jelly this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All through the first part of this sentence, the sick woman had sat interestedly erect; but at the reference to the jelly she fell back on her pillow listlessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well; thank you. Your aunt is very kind, of course, but my appetite isn't very good this morning, and I was wanting lamb—" She stopped suddenly, then went on with an abrupt change of subject. "I never slept a wink last night—not a wink!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O dear, I wish I didn't," sighed Pollyanna, placing the jelly on the little stand and seating herself comfortably in the nearest chair. "You lose such a lot of time just sleeping! Don't you think so?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lose time—sleeping!" exclaimed the sick woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, when you might be just living, you know. It seems such a pity we can't live nights, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once again the woman pulled herself erect in her bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you ain't the amazing young one!" she cried. "Here! do you go to that window and pull up the curtain," she directed. "I should like to know what you look like!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna rose to her feet, but she laughed a little ruefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O dear! then you'll see my freckles, won't you?" she sighed, as she went to the window; "—and just when I was being so glad it was dark and you couldn't see 'em. There! Now you can—oh!" she broke off excitedly, as she turned back to the bed; "I'm so glad you wanted to see me, because now I can see you! They didn't tell me you were so pretty!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me!—pretty!" scoffed the woman, bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes. Didn't you know it?" cried Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, no, I didn't," retorted Mrs. Snow, dryly. Mrs. Snow had lived forty years, and for fifteen of those years she had been too busy wishing things were different to find much time to enjoy things as they were.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but your eyes are so big and dark, and your hair's all dark, too, and curly," cooed Pollyanna. "I love black curls. (That's one of the things I'm going to have when I get to Heaven.) And you've got two little red spots in your cheeks. Why, Mrs. Snow, you are pretty! I should think you'd know it when you looked at yourself in the glass."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The glass!" snapped the sick woman, falling back on her pillow. "Yes, well, I hain't done much prinkin' before the mirror these days—and you wouldn't, if you was flat on your back as I am!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, no, of course not," agreed Pollyanna, sympathetically. "But wait—just let me show you," she exclaimed, skipping over to the bureau and picking up a small hand-glass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the way back to the bed she stopped, eyeing the sick woman with a critical gaze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon maybe, if you don't mind, I'd like to fix your hair just a little before I let you see it," she proposed. "May I fix your hair, please?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I—suppose so, if you want to," permitted Mrs. Snow, grudgingly; "but 'twon't stay, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, thank you. I love to fix people's hair," exulted Pollyanna, carefully laying down the hand-glass and reaching for a comb. "I sha'n't do much to-day, of course—I'm in such a hurry for you to see how pretty you are; but some day I'm going to take it all down and have a perfectly lovely time with it, she cried, touching with soft fingers the waving hair above the sick woman's forehead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For five minutes Pollyanna worked swiftly, deftly, combing a refractory curl into fluffiness, perking up a drooping ruffle at the neck, or shaking a pillow into plumpness so that the head might have a better pose. Meanwhile the sick woman, frowning prodigiously, and openly scoffing at the whole procedure, was, in spite of herself, beginning to tingle with a feeling perilously near to excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There!" panted Pollyanna, hastily plucking a pink from a vase near by and tucking it into the dark hair where it would give the best effect. "Now I reckon we're ready to be looked at!" And she held out the mirror in triumph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!" grunted the sick woman, eyeing her reflection severely. "I like red pinks better than pink ones; but then, it'll fade, anyhow, before night, so what's the difference!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I should think you'd be glad they did fade," laughed Pollyanna, "'cause then you can have the fun of getting some more. I just love your hair fluffed out like that," she finished with a satisfied gaze. "Don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hm-m; maybe. Still—'twon't last, with me tossing back and forth on the pillow as I do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not—and I'm glad, too," nodded Pollyanna, cheerfully, "because then I can fix it again. Anyhow, I should think you'd be glad it's black—black shows up so much nicer on a pillow than yellow hair like mine does."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe; but I never did set much store by black hair—shows gray too soon," retorted Mrs. Snow. "SHE HELD OUT THE MIRROR IN TRIUMPH." Illustration of Pollyanna standing over Mrs. Snow in her bed, holding up a mirror. S he spoke fretfully, but she still held the mirror before her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I love black hair! I should be so glad if I only had it," sighed Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Snow dropped the mirror and turned irritably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you wouldn't!—not if you were me. You wouldn't be glad for black hair nor anything else—if you had to lie here all day as I do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna bent her brows in a thoughtful frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, 'twould be kind of hard—to do it then, wouldn't it?" she mused aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be glad about things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be glad about things—when you're sick in bed all your days? Well, I should say it would," retorted Mrs. Snow. "If you don't think so, just tell me something to be glad about; that's all!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mrs. Snow's unbounded amazement, Pollyanna sprang to her feet and clapped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, goody! That'll be a hard one—won't it? I've got to go, now, but I'll think and think all the way home; and maybe the next time I come I can tell it to you. Good-by. I've had a lovely time! Good-by," she called again, as she tripped through the doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I never! Now, what does she mean by that?" ejaculated Mrs. Snow, staring after her visitor. By and by she turned her head and picked up the mirror, eyeing her reflection critically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That little thing has got a knack with hair and no mistake," she muttered under her breath. "I declare, I didn't know it could look so pretty. But then, what's the use?" she sighed, dropping the little glass into the bedclothes, and rolling her head on the pillow fretfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later, when Milly, Mrs. Snow's daughter, came in, the mirror still lay among the bedclothes it had been carefully hidden from sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, mother—the curtain is up!" cried Milly, dividing her amazed stare between the window and the pink in her mother's hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what if it is?" snapped the sick woman. "I needn't stay in the dark all my life, if I am sick, need I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, n-no, of course not," rejoined Milly, in hasty conciliation, as she reached for the medicine bottle. "It's only—well, you know very well that I've tried to get you to have a lighter room for ages and you wouldn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no reply to this. Mrs. Snow was picking at the lace on her nightgown. At last she spoke fretfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I should think somebody might give me a new nightdress—instead of lamb broth, for a change!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why—mother!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No wonder Milly quite gasped aloud with bewilderment. In the drawer behind her at that moment lay two new nightdresses that Milly for months had been vainly urging her mother to wear.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER IX WHICH TELLS OF THE MAN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT rained the next time Pollyanna saw the Man. She greeted him, however, with a bright smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It isn't so nice to-day, is it?" she called blithesomely. "I'm glad it doesn't rain always, anyhow!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man did not even grunt this time, nor turn his head. Pollyanna decided that of course he did not hear her. The next time, therefore (which happened to be the following day), she spoke up louder. She thought it particularly necessary to do this, anyway, for the Man was striding along, his hands behind his back, and his eyes on the ground—which seemed, to Pollyanna, preposterous in the face of the glorious sunshine and the freshly-washed morning air: Pollyanna, as a special treat, was on a morning errand to-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do?" she chirped. "I'm so glad it isn't yesterday, aren't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man stopped abruptly. There was an angry scowl on his face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, little girl, we might just as well settle this thing right now, once for all," he began testily. "I've got something besides the weather to think of. I don't know whether the sun shines or not." Pollyanna beamed joyously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; I thought you didn't. That's why I told you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; well— Eh? What?" he broke off sharply, in sudden understanding of her words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, that's why I told you—so you would notice it, you know—that the sun shines, and all that. I knew you'd be glad it did if you only stopped to think of it—and you didn't look a bit as if you were thinking of it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of all the—" ejaculated the man, with an oddly impotent gesture. He started forward again, but after the second step he turned back, still frowning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, why don't you find some one your own age to talk to?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd like to, sir, but there aren't any 'round here, Nancy says. Still, I don't mind so very much. I like old folks just as well, maybe better, sometimes—being used to the Ladies' Aid, so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph! The Ladies' Aid, indeed! Is that what you took me for?" The man's lips were threatening to smile, but the scowl above them was still trying to hold them grimly stern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed gleefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, sir. You don't look a mite like a Ladies' Aider—not but that you're just as good, of course—maybe better," she added in hurried politeness. "You see, I'm sure you're much nicer than you look!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man made a queer noise in his throat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of all the—" he ejaculated again, as he turned and strode on as before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next time Pollyanna met the Man, his eyes were gazing straight into hers, with a quizzical directness that made his face look really pleasant, Pollyanna thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good afternoon," he greeted her a little stiffly. "Perhaps I'd better say right away that I know the sun is shining to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you don't have to tell me," nodded Pollyanna, brightly. "I knew you knew it just as soon as I saw you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you did, did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir; I saw it in your eyes, you know, and in your smile."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!" grunted the man, as he passed on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Man always spoke to Pollyanna after this, and frequently he spoke first, though usually he said little but "good afternoon." Even that, however, was a great surprise to Nancy, who chanced to be with Pollyanna one day when the greeting was given.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sakes alive, Miss Pollyanna," she gasped, "did that man speak to you ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes, he always does—now," smiled Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"`He always does'! Goodness! Do you know who—he—is?" demanded Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned and shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon he forgot to tell me one day. You see, I did my part of the introducing, but he didn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's eyes widened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he never speaks ter anybody, child—he hain't for years, I guess, except when he just has to, for business, and all that. He's John Pendleton. He lives all by himself in the big house on Pendleton Hill. He won't even have any one 'round ter cook for him—comes down ter the hotel for his meals three times a day. I know Sally Miner, who waits on him, and she says he hardly opens his head enough ter tell what he wants ter eat. She has ter guess it more'n half the time—only it'll be somethin' cheap ! She knows that without no tellin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna nodded sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know. You have to look for cheap things when you're poor. Father and I took meals out a lot. We had beans and fish balls most generally. We used to say how glad we were we liked beans—that is, we said it specially when we were looking at the roast turkey place, you know, that was sixty cents. Does Mr. Pendleton like beans?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Like 'em! What if he does—or don't? Why, Miss Pollyanna, he ain't poor. He's got loads of money, John Pendleton has—from his father. There ain't nobody in town as rich as he is. He could eat dollar bills, if he wanted to—and not know it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna giggled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if anybody could eat dollar bills and not know it, Nancy, when they come to try to chew 'em!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ho! I mean he's rich enough ter do it," shrugged Nancy. "He ain't spendin' his money, that's all. He's a-savin' of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, for the heathen," surmised Pollyanna. "How perfectly splendid! That's denying yourself and taking up your cross. I know; father told me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's lips parted abruptly, as if there were angry words all ready to come; but her eyes, resting on Pollyanna's jubilantly trustful face, saw something that prevented the words being spoken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!" she vouchsafed. Then, showing her old-time interest, she went on: "But, say, it is queer, his speakin' to you, honestly, Miss Pollyanna. He don't speak ter no one; and he lives all alone in a great big lovely house all full of jest grand things, they say. Some says he's crazy, and some jest cross; and some says he's got a skeleton in his closet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Nancy!" shuddered Pollyanna. "How can he keep such a dreadful thing? I should think he'd throw it away!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy chuckled. That Pollyanna had taken the skeleton literally instead of figuratively, she knew very well; but, perversely, she refrained from correcting the mistake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And everybody says he's mysterious," she went on. "Some years he jest travels, week in and week out, and it's always in heathen countries—Egypt and Asia and the Desert of Sarah, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, a missionary," nodded Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy laughed oddly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I didn't say that, Miss Pollyanna. When he comes back he writes books—queer, odd books, they say, about some gimcrack he's found in them heathen countries. But he don't never seem ter want ter spend no money here—leastways, not for jest livin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not—if he's saving it for the heathen," declared Pollyanna. "But he is a funny man, and he's different, too, just like Mrs. Snow, only he's a different different."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I guess he is—rather," chuckled Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm gladder'n ever now, anyhow, that he speaks to me," sighed Pollyanna contentedly.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER X A SURPRISE FOR MRS. SNOW</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE next time Pollyanna went to see Mrs. Snow, she found that lady, as at first, in a darkened room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's the little girl from Miss Polly's, mother," announced Milly, in a tired manner; then Pollyanna found herself alone with the invalid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it's you, is it?" asked a fretful voice from the bed. "I remember you. Any body'd remember you, I guess, if they saw you once. I wish you had come yesterday. I wanted you yesterday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you? Well, I'm glad 'tisn't any farther away from yesterday than to-day is, then," laughed Pollyanna, advancing cheerily into the room, and setting her basket carefully down on a chair. "My! but aren't you dark here, though? I can't see you a bit," she cried, unhesitatingly crossing to the window and pulling up the shade. "I want to see if you've fixed your hair like I did—oh, you haven't! But, never mind; I'm glad you haven't, after all, 'cause maybe you'll let me do it—later. But now I want you to see what I've brought you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman stirred restlessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just as if how it looks would make any difference in how it tastes," she scoffed—but she turned her eyes toward the basket. "Well, what is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Guess! What do you want?" Pollyanna had skipped back to the basket. Her face was alight. The sick woman frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I don't want anything, as I know of," she sighed. "After all, they all taste alike!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"This won't. Guess! If you did want something, what would it be?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman hesitated. She did not realize it herself, but she had so long been accustomed to wanting what she did not have, that to state off-hand what she did want seemed impossible—until she knew what she had. Obviously, however, she must say something. This extraordinary child was waiting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of course, there's lamb broth—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've got it!" crowed Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But that's what I didn't want," sighed the sick woman, sure now of what her stomach craved. "It was chicken I wanted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I've got that, too," chuckled Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman turned in amazement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Both of them?" she demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—and calf's-foot jelly," triumphed Pollyanna. "I was just bound you should have what you wanted for once; so Nancy and I fixed it. Oh, of course, there's only a little of each—but there's some of all of 'em! I'm so glad you did want chicken," she went on contentedly, as she lifted the three little bowls from her basket. "You see, I got to thinking on the way here—what if you should say tripe, or onions, or something like that, that I didn't have! Wouldn't it have been a shame—when I'd tried so hard?" she laughed merrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no reply. The sick woman seemed to be trying—mentally—to find something she had lost.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There! I'm to leave them all," announced Pollyanna, as she arranged the three bowls in a row on the table. "Like enough it'll be lamb broth you want to-morrow. How do you do to-day?" she finished in polite inquiry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very poorly, thank you," murmured Mrs. Snow, falling back into her usual listless attitude. "I lost my nap this morning. Nellie Higgins next door has begun music lessons, and her practising drives me nearly wild. She was at it all the morning—every minute! I'm sure, I don't know what I shall do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Polly nodded sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know. It is awful! Mrs. White had it once—one of my Ladies' Aiders, you know. She had rheumatic fever, too, at the same time, so she couldn't thrash 'round. She said 'twould have been easier if she could have. Can you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can I—what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thrash 'round—move, you know, so as to change your position when the music gets too hard to stand."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Snow stared a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of course I can move—anywhere—in bed," she rejoined a little irritably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you can be glad of that, then, anyhow. can't you?" nodded Pollyanna. "Mrs. White couldn't. You can't thrash when you have rheumatic fever—though you want to something awful, Mrs. White says. She told me afterwards she reckoned she'd have gone raving crazy if it hadn't been for Mr. White's sister's ears—being deaf, so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sister's— ears ! What do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I reckon I didn't tell it all, and I forgot you didn't know Mrs. White. You see, Miss White was deaf—awfully deaf; and she came to visit 'em and to help take care of Mrs. White and the house. Well, they had such an awful time making her understand anything , that after that, every time the piano commenced to play across the street, Mrs. White felt so glad she could hear it, that she didn't mind so much that she did hear it, 'cause she couldn't help thinking how awful 'twould be if she was deaf and couldn't hear anything, like her husband's sister. You see, she was playing the game, too. I'd told her about it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The—game?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna clapped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There! I 'most forgot; but I've thought it up, Mrs. Snow—what you can be glad about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad about! What do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I told you I would. Don't you remember? You asked me to tell you something to be glad about—glad, you know, even though you did have to lie here abed all day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!" scoffed the woman. "That ? Yes, I remember that; but I didn't suppose you were in earnest any more than I was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, I was," nodded Pollyanna, triumphantly; "and I found it, too. But ' twas hard. It's all the more fun, though, always, when 'tis hard. And I will own up, honest to true, that I couldn't think of anything for a while. Then I got it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you, really? Well, what is it?" Mrs. Snow's voice was sarcastically polite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna drew a long breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought—how glad you could be—that other folks weren't like you—all sick in bed like this, you know," she announced impressively. Mrs, Snow stared. Her eyes were angry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, really!" she ejaculated then, in not quite an agreeable tone of voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And now I'll tell you the game," proposed Pollyanna, blithely confident. "It'll be just lovely for you to play—it'll be so hard. And there's so much more fun when it is hard! You see, it's like this." And she began to tell of the missionary barrel, the crutches, and the doll that did not come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The story was just finished when Milly appeared at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your aunt is wanting you, Miss Pollyanna," she said with dreary listlessness. "She telephoned down to the Harlows' across the way. She says you're to hurry—that you've got some practising to make up before dark."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna rose reluctantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," she sighed. "I'll hurry." Suddenly she laughed. "I suppose I ought to be glad I've got legs to hurry with, hadn't I, Mrs., Snow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer. Mrs. Snow's eyes were closed. But Milly, whose eyes were wide open with surprise, saw that there were tears on the wasted cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-by," flung Pollyanna over her shoulder, as she reached the door. "I'm awfully sorry about the hair—I wanted to do it. But maybe I can next time!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One by one the July days passed. To Pollyanna, they were happy days, indeed. She often told her aunt, joyously, how very happy they were. Whereupon her aunt would usually reply, wearily:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, Pollyanna. I am gratified, of course, that they are happy; but I trust that they are profitable, as well—otherwise I should have failed signally in my duty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Generally Pollyanna would answer this with a hug and a kiss—a proceeding that was still always most disconcerting to Miss Polly; but one day she spoke. It was during the sewing hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean that it wouldn't be enough then, Aunt Polly, that they should be just happy days?" she asked wistfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I mean, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They must be pro-fi-ta-ble as well?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What is being pro-fi-ta-ble?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it—it's just being profitable—having profit, something to show for it, Pollyanna. What an extraordinary child you are!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then just being glad isn't pro-fi-ta-ble?" questioned Pollyanna, a little anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O dear! Then you wouldn't like it, of course. I'm afraid, now, you won't ever play the game, Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Game? What game?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, that father—" Pollyanna clapped her hand to her lips. "N-nothing," she stammered. Miss Polly frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do for this morning, Pollyanna," she said tersely. And the sewing lesson was over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was that afternoon that Pollyanna, coming down from her attic room, met her aunt on the stairway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, how perfectly lovely!" she cried. "You were coming up to see me! Come right in. I love company," she finished, scampering up the stairs and throwing her door wide open.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now Miss Polly had not been intending to call on her niece. She had been planning to look for a certain white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window. But to her unbounded surprise now, she found herself, not in the main attic before the cedar chest, but in Pollyanna's little room sitting in one of the straight-backed chairs—so many, many times since Pollyanna came, Miss Polly had found herself like this, doing some utterly unexpected, surprising thing, quite unlike the thing she had set out to do!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I love company," said Pollyanna, again, flitting about as if she were dispensing the hospitality of a palace; "specially since I've had this room, all mine, you know. Oh, of course, I had a room, always, but 'twas a hired room, and hired rooms aren't half as nice as owned ones, are they? And of course I do own this one, don't I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, y-yes, Pollyanna," murmured Miss Polly, vaguely wondering why she did not get up at once and go to look for that shawl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And of course now I just love this room, even if it hasn't got the carpets and curtains and pictures that I'd been want—" With a painful blush Pollyanna stopped short. She was plunging into an entirely different sentence when her aunt interrupted her sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"N-nothing, Aunt Polly, truly. I didn't mean to say it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably not," returned Miss Polly, coldly; "but you did say it, so suppose we have the rest of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it wasn't anything only that I'd been kind of planning on pretty carpets and lace curtains and things, you know. But, of course—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Planning on them!" interrupted Miss Polly, sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna blushed still more painfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ought not to have, of course, Aunt Polly," she apologized. "It was only because I'd always wanted them and hadn't had them, I suppose. Oh, we'd had two rugs in the barrels, but they were little, you know, and one had ink spots, and the other holes; and there never were only those two pictures; the one fath—I mean the good one we sold, and the bad one that broke. Of course if it hadn't been for all that I shouldn't have wanted them, so—pretty things, I mean; and I shouldn't have got to planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be here, and—and—But, truly, Aunt Polly, it wasn't but just a minute —I mean, a few minutes—before I was being glad that the bureau didn't have a looking-glass, because it didn't show my freckles; and there couldn't be a nicer picture than the one out my window there; and you've been so good to me, that—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet. Her face was very red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Pollyanna," she said stiffly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You have said quite enough, I'm sure." The next minute she had swept down the stairs—and not until she reached the first floor did it suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Less than twenty-four hours later, Miss Polly said to Nancy, crisply:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy, you may move Miss Pollyanna's things down-stairs this morning to the room directly beneath. I have decided to have my niece sleep there for the present."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, ma'am," said Nancy aloud.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O glory!" said Nancy to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Pollyanna, a minute later, she cried joyously:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And won't ye jest be listenin' ter this, Miss Pollyanna. You're ter sleep down-stairs in the room straight under this. You are—you are!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna actually grew white.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean—why, Nancy, not really—really and truly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you'll think it's really and truly," prophesied Nancy, exultingly, nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she had taken from the closet. "I'm told ter take down yer things, and I'm goin' ter take 'em, too, 'fore she gets a chance ter change her mind."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence. At the imminent risk of being dashed headlong, she was flying down-stairs, two steps at a time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bang went two doors and a chair before Pollyanna at last reached her goal—Aunt Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, did you mean it, really? Why, that room's got everything —the carpet and curtains and three pictures, besides the one outdoors, too, 'cause the windows look the same way. Oh, Aunt Polly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, Pollyanna. I am gratified that you like the change, of course; but if you think so much of all those things, I trust you will take proper care of them; that's all. Pollyanna, please pick up that chair; and you have banged two doors in the last half-minute." Miss Polly spoke sternly, all the more sternly because, for some inexplicable reason, she felt inclined to cry—and Miss Polly was not used to feeling inclined to cry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna picked up the chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm; I know I banged 'em—those doors," she admitted cheerfully. "You see I'd just found out about the room, and I reckon you'd have banged doors if—" Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest. "Aunt Polly, did you ever bang doors?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope—not, Pollyanna!" Miss Polly's voice was properly shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, what a shame!" Pollyanna's face expressed only concerned sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A shame!" repeated Aunt Polly, too dazed to say more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes. You see, if you'd felt like banging doors you'd have banged 'em, of course; and if you didn't, that must have meant that you weren't ever glad over anything—or you would have banged 'em. You couldn't have helped it. And I'm so sorry you weren't ever glad over anything!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Polly an na!" gasped the lady; but Pollyanna was gone, and only the distant bang of the attic-stairway door answered for her. Pollyanna had gone to help Nancy bring down "her things."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly, in the sitting room, felt vaguely disturbed;—but then, of course she had been glad—over some things!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XI INTRODUCING JIMMY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AUGUST came. August brought several surprises and some changes—none of which, however, were really a surprise to Nancy. Nancy, since Pollyanna's arrival, had come to look for surprises and changes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First there was the kitten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna found the kitten mewing pitifully some distance down the road. When systematic questioning of the neighbors failed to find any one who claimed it, Pollyanna brought it home at once, as a matter of course.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I was glad I didn't find any one who owned it, too," she told her aunt in happy confidence; "'cause I wanted to bring it home all the time. I love kitties. I knew you'd be glad to let it live here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly looked at the forlorn little gray bunch of neglected misery in Pollyanna's arms, and shivered: Miss Polly did not care for cats—not even pretty, healthy, clean ones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ugh! Pollyanna! What a dirty little beast! And it's sick, I'm sure, and all mangy and fleay."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it, poor little thing," crooned Pollyanna, tenderly, looking into the little creature's frightened eyes. "And it's all trembly, too, it's so scared. You see it doesn't know, yet, that we're going to keep it, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No—nor anybody else," retorted Miss Polly, with meaning emphasis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, they do," nodded Pollyanna, entirely misunderstanding her aunt's words. "I told everybody we should keep it, if I didn't find where it belonged. I knew you'd be glad to have it—poor little lonesome thing!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly opened her lips and tried to speak; but in vain. The curious helpless feeling that had been hers so often since Pollyanna's arrival, had her now fast in its grip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course I knew," hurried on Pollyanna, gratefully, "that you wouldn't let a dear little lonesome kitty go hunting for a home when you'd just taken me in; and I said so to Mrs. Ford when she asked if you'd let me keep it. Why, I had the Ladies' Aid, you know, and kitty didn't have anybody I knew you'd feel that way," she nodded happily, as she ran from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Pollyanna, Pollyanna," remonstrated Miss Polly. "I don't—" But Pollyanna was already halfway to the kitchen, calling:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy, Nancy, just see this dear little kitty that Aunt Polly is going to bring up along with me!" And Aunt Polly, in the sitting room—who abhorred cats—fell back in her chair with a gasp of dismay, powerless to remonstrate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next day it was a dog, even dirtier and more forlorn, perhaps, than was the kitten; and again Miss Polly, to her dumfounded amazement, found herself figuring as a kind protector and an angel of mercy—a rôle that Pollyanna so unhesitatingly thrust upon her as a matter of course, that the woman—who abhorred dogs even more than she did cats, if possible—found herself as before, powerless to remonstrate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When, in less than a week, however, Pollyanna brought home a small, ragged boy, and confidently claimed the same protection for him, Miss Polly did have something to say. It happened after this wise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On a pleasant Thursday morning Pollyanna had been taking calf's-foot jelly again to Mrs. Snow. Mrs. Snow and Pollyanna were the best of friends now. Their friendship had started from the third visit Pollyanna had made, the one after she had told Mrs. Snow of the game. Mrs. Snow herself was playing the game now, with Pollyanna. To be sure, she was not playing it very well—she had been sorry for everything for so long, that it was not easy to be glad for anything now. But under Pollyanna's cheery instructions and merry laughter at her mistakes, she was learning fast. To-day, even, to Pollyanna's huge delight, she had said that she was glad Pollyanna brought calf's-foot jelly, because that was just what she had been wanting—she did not know that Milly, at the front door, had told Pollyanna that the minister's wife had already that day sent over a great bowlful of that same kind of jelly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was thinking of this now when suddenly she saw the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy was sitting in a disconsolate little heap by the roadside, whittling half-heartedly at a small stick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo," smiled Pollyanna, engagingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy glanced up, but he looked away again, at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo yourself," he mumbled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now you don't look as if you'd be glad even for calf's-foot jelly," she chuckled, stopping before him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy stirred restlessly, gave her a surprised look, and began to whittle again at his stick, with the dull, broken-bladed knife in his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna hesitated, then dropped herself comfortably down on the grass near him. In spite of Pollyanna's brave assertion that she was "used to Ladies' Aiders," and "didn't mind," she had sighed at times for some companion of her own age. Hence her determination to make the most of this one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name's Pollyanna Whittier," she began pleasantly. "What's yours?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again the boy stirred restlessly. He even almost got to his feet. But he settled back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jimmy Bean," he grunted with ungracious indifference.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good! Now we're introduced. I'm glad you did your part—some folks don't, you know. I live at Miss Polly Harrington's house. Where do you live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nowhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nowhere! Why, you can't do that—everybody lives somewhere," asserted Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I don't—just now. I'm huntin' up a new place."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! Where is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy regarded her with scornful eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Silly! As if I'd be a-huntin' for it—if I knew!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna tossed her head a little. This was not a nice boy, and she did not like to be called "silly." Still, he was somebody besides—old folks. Where did you live—before?" she queried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you ain't the beat'em for askin' questions!" sighed the boy impatiently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have to be," retorted Pollyanna calmly, "else I couldn't find out a thing about you. If you'd talk more I wouldn't talk so much."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy gave a short laugh. It was a sheepish laugh, and not quite a willing one; but his face looked a little pleasanter when he spoke this time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right then—here goes! I'm Jimmy Bean, and I'm ten years old goin' on eleven. I come last year ter live at the Orphans' Home; but they've got so many kids there ain't much room for me, an' I wa'n't never wanted, anyhow, I don't "`OH, I KNOW JUST THE PLACE FOR YOU,' SHE CRIED." Illustration of Pollyanna sitting under a tree with Jimmy Bean. believe. So I've quit. I'm goin' ter live somewheres else—but I hain't found the place, yet. I'd like a home—jest a common one, ye know, with a mother in it, instead of a Matron. If ye has a home, ye has folks; an' I hain't had folks since—dad died. So I'm a-huntin' now. I've tried four houses, but—they didn't want me—though I said I expected ter work, 'course. There! Is that all you want ter know?" The boy's voice had broken a little over the last two sentences.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what a shame!" sympathized Pollyanna. "And didn't there anybody want you? O dear! I know just how you feel, because after—after my father died, too, there wasn't anybody but the Ladies' Aid for me, until Aunt Polly said she'd take—" Pollyanna stopped abruptly. The dawning of a wonderful idea began to show in her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I know just the place for you," she cried. "Aunt Polly'll take you—I know she will! Didn't she take me? And didn't she take Fluffy and Buffy, when they didn't have any one to love them, or any place to go?—and they're only cats and dogs. Oh, come, I know Aunt Polly'll take you! You don't know how good and kind she is!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy Bean's thin little face brightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Honest Injun? Would she, now? I'd work, ye know, an' I'm real strong!" He bared a small, bony arm.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course she would! Why, my Aunt Polly is the nicest lady in the world—now that my mama has gone to be a Heaven angel. And there's rooms—heaps of 'em," she continued, springing to her feet, and tugging at his arm. "It's an awful big house. Maybe, though," she added a little anxiously, as they hurried on, "maybe you'll have to sleep in the attic room. I did, at first. But there's screens there now, so 'twon't be so hot, and the flies can't get in, either, to bring in the germ-things on their feet. Did you know about that? It's perfectly lovely! Maybe she'll let you read the book if you're good—I mean, if you're bad. And you've got freckles, too,"—with a critical glance—"so you'll be glad there isn't any looking-glass; and the outdoor picture is nicer than any wall-one could be, so you won't mind sleeping in that room at all, I'm sure," panted Pollyanna, finding suddenly that she needed the rest of her breath for purposes other than talking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gorry!" exclaimed Jimmy Bean tersely and uncomprehendingly, but admiringly. Then he added: "I shouldn't think anybody who could talk like that, runnin', would need ter ask no questions ter fill up time with!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, anyhow, you can be glad of that," she retorted; "for when I'm talking, you don't have to!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the house was reached, Pollyanna unhesitatingly piloted her companion straight into the presence of her amazed aunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly," she triumphed. "just look a-here! I've got something ever so much nicer, even, than Fluffy and Buffy for you to bring up. It's a real live boy. He won't mind a bit sleeping in the attic, at first, you know, and he says he'll work; but I shall need him the most of the time to play with, I reckon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly grew white, then very red. She did not quite understand; but she thought she understood enough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, what does this mean? Who is this dirty little boy? Where did you find him?" she demanded sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "dirty little boy" fell back a step and looked toward the door. Pollyanna laughed merrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, if I didn't forget to tell you his name! I'm as bad as the Man. And he is dirty, too, isn't he?—I mean, the boy is—just like Fluffy and Buffy were when you took them in. But I reckon he'll improve all right by washing, just as they did, and—Oh, I 'most forgot again," she broke off with a laugh. "This is Jimmy Bean, Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what is he doing here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, I just told you!" Pollyanna's eyes were wide with surprise. "He's for you. I brought him home—so he could live here, you know. He wants a home and folks. I told him how good you were to me, and to Fluffy and Buffy, and that I knew you would be to him, because of course he's even nicer than cats and dogs."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly dropped back in her chair and raised a shaking hand to her throat. The old helplessness was threatening once more to overcome her. With a visible struggle, however, Miss Polly pulled herself suddenly erect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Pollyanna. This is a little the most absurd thing you've done yet. As if tramp cats and mangy dogs weren't bad enough but you must needs bring home ragged little beggars from the street, who—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a sudden stir from the boy. His eyes flashed and his chin came up. With two strides of his sturdy little legs he confronted Miss Polly fearlessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't a beggar, marm, an' I don't want nothin' o' you. I was cal'latin' ter work, of course, fur my board an' keep. I wouldn't have come ter your old house, anyhow, if this 'ere girl hadn't 'a' made me, a-tellin' me how you was so good an' kind that you'd be jest dyin' ter take me in. So, there!" And he wheeled about and stalked from the room with a dignity that would have been absurd had it not been so pitiful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly," choked Pollyanna. "Why, I thought you'd be glad to have him here! I'm sure, I should think you'd be glad—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly raised her hand with a peremptory gesture of silence. Miss Polly's nerves had snapped at last. The "good and kind" of the boy's words were still ringing in her ears, and the old helplessness was almost upon her, she knew. Yet she rallied her forces with the last atom of her will power.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna," she cried sharply, "will you stop using that everlasting word `glad'! It's `glad'—`glad'—`glad' from morning till night until I think I shall grow wild!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From sheer amazement Pollyanna's jaw dropped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly," she breathed, "I should think you'd be glad to have me gl—Oh!" she broke off, clapping her hand to her lips and hurrying blindly from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Before the boy had reached the end of the driveway, Pollyanna overtook him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Boy! Boy! Jimmy Bean, I want you to know how—how sorry I am," she panted, catching him with a detaining hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sorry nothin'! I ain't blamin' you," retorted the boy, sullenly. "But I ain't no beggar!" he added, with sudden spirit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course you aren't! But you mustn't blame auntie," appealed Pollyanna. "Probably I didn't do the introducing right, anyhow; and I reckon I didn't tell her much who you were. She is good and kind, really—she's always been; but I probably didn't explain it right. I do wish I could find some place for you, though!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy shrugged his shoulders and half turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind. I guess I can find one myself. I ain't no beggar, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was frowning thoughtfully. Of a sudden she turned, her face illumined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say, I'll tell you what I will do! The Ladies' Aid meets this afternoon. I heard Aunt Polly say so. I'll lay your case before them. That's what father always did, when he wanted anything—educating the heathen and new carpets, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boy turned fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I ain't a heathen or a new carpet. Besides—what is a Ladies' Aid?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stared in shocked disapproval.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Jimmy Bean, wherever have you been brought up?—not to know what a Ladies' Aid is!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, all right—if you ain't tellin'," grunted the boy, turning and beginning to walk away indifferently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sprang to his side at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's—it's—why, it's just a lot of ladies that meet and sew and give suppers and raise money and—and talk; that's what a Ladies' Aid is. They're awfully kind—that is, most of mine was, back home. I haven't seen this one here, but they're always good, I reckon. I'm going to tell them about you this afternoon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again the boy turned fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much you will! Maybe you think I'm goin' ter stand 'round an' hear a whole lot o' women call me a beggar, instead of jest one ! Not much!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but you wouldn't be there," argued Pollyanna, quickly. "I'd go alone, of course, and tell them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You would?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; and I'd tell it better this time," hurried on Pollyanna, quick to see the signs of relenting in the boy's face. "And there'd be some of 'em, I know, that would be glad to give you a home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd work—don't forget ter say that," cautioned the boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not," promised Pollyanna, happily, sure now that her point was gained. "Then I'll let you know to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By the road—where I found you to-day; near Mrs. Snow's house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. I'll be there." The boy paused before he went on slowly: "Maybe I'd better go back, then, for ter-night, ter the Home. You see I hain't no other place ter stay; and—and I didn't leave till this mornin'. I slipped out. I didn't tell 'em I wasn't comin' back, else they'd pretend I couldn't come—though I'm thinkin' they won't do no worryin' when I don't show up sometime. They ain't like folks , ye know. They don't care !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know," nodded Pollyanna, with understanding eyes. "But I'm sure, when I see you to-morrow, I'll have just a common home and folks that do care all ready for you. Good-by!" she called brightly, as she turned back toward the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the sitting-room window at that moment, Miss Polly, who had been watching the two children, followed with sombre eyes the boy until a bend of the road hid him from sight. Then she sighed, turned, and walked listlesly up-stairs—and Miss Polly did not usually move listlessly. In her ears still was the boy's scornful "you was so good and kind." In her heart was a curious sense of desolation—as of something lost.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XII BEFORE THE LADIES' AID</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DINNER, which came at noon in the Harrington homestead, was a silent meal on the day of the Ladies' Aid meeting. Pollyanna, it is true, tried to talk; but she did not make a success of it, chiefly because four times she was obliged to break off a "glad" in the middle of it, much to her blushing discomfort. The fifth time it happened, Miss Polly moved her head wearily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, child, say it, if you want to," she sighed. "I'm sure I'd rather you did than not if it's going to make all this fuss."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's puckered little face cleared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, thank you. I'm afraid it would be pretty hard—not to say it. You see I've played it so long."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've—what?" demanded Aunt Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Played it—the game, you know, that father—" Pollyanna stopped with a painful blush at finding herself so soon again on forbidden ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly frowned and said nothing. The rest of the meal was a silent one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was not sorry to hear Aunt Polly tell the minister's wife over the telephone, a little later, that she would not be at the Ladies' Aid meeting that afternoon, owing to a headache. When Aunt Polly went up-stairs to her room and closed the door, Pollyanna tried to be sorry for the headache; but she could not help feeling glad that her aunt was not to be present that afternoon when she laid the case of Jimmy Bean before the Ladies' Aid. She could not forget that Aunt Polly had called Jimmy Bean a little beggar; and she did not want Aunt Polly to call him that—before the Ladies' Aid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna knew that the Ladies' Aid met at two o'clock in the chapel next the church, not quite half a mile from home. She planned her going, therefore, so that she should get there a little before three.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I want them all to be there," she said to herself; "else the very one that wasn't there might be the one who would be wanting to give Jimmy Bean a home; and, of course, two o'clock always means three, really—to Ladies' Aiders."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quietly, but with confident courage, Pollyanna ascended the chapel steps, pushed open the door and entered the vestibule. A soft babel of feminine chatter and laughter came from the main room. Hesitating only a brief moment Pollyanna pushed open one of the inner doors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The chatter dropped to a surprised hush. Pollyanna advanced a little timidly. Now that the time had come, she felt unwontedly shy. After all, these half-strange, half-familiar faces about her were not her own dear Ladies' Aid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How do you do, Ladies' Aiders?" she faltered politely. "I'm Pollyanna Whittier. I—I reckon some of you know me, maybe; anyway, I do you —only I don't know you all together this way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The silence could almost be felt now. Some of the ladies did know this rather extraordinary niece of their fellow-member, and nearly all had heard of her; but not one of them could think of anything to say, just then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I've come to—to lay the case before you," stammered Pollyanna, after a moment, unconsciously falling into her father's familiar phraseology.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a slight rustle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did—did your aunt send you, my dear? asked Mrs. Ford, the minister's wife.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna colored a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no. I came all by myself. You see, I'm used to Ladies' Aiders. It was Ladies' Aiders that brought me up—with father."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somebody tittered hysterically, and the minister's wife frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear. What is it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it—it's Jimmy Bean," sighed Pollyanna. "He hasn't any home except the Orphan one, and they're full, and don't want him, anyhow, he thinks; so he wants another. He wants one of the common kind, that has a mother instead of a Matron in it—folks, you know, that'll care. He's ten years old going on eleven. I thought some of you might like him—to live with you, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, did you ever!" murmured a voice, breaking the dazed pause that followed Pollyanna's words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With anxious eyes Pollyanna swept the circle of faces about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I forgot to say; he will work," she supplemented eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still there was silence; then, coldly, one or two women began to question her. After a time they all had the story and began to talk among themselves, animatedly, not quite pleasantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna listened with growing anxiety. Some of what was said she could not understand. She did gather, after a time, however, that there was no woman there who had a home to give him, though every woman seemed to think that some of the others might take him, as there were several who had no little boys of their own already in their homes. But there was no one who agreed herself to take him. Then she heard the minister's wife suggest timidly that they, as a society, might perhaps assume his support and education instead of sending quite so much money this year to the little boys in far-away India.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A great many ladies talked then, and several of them talked all at once, and even more loudly and more unpleasantly than before. It seemed that their society was famous for its offering to Hindu missions, and several said they should die of mortification if it should be less this year. Some of what was said at this time Pollyanna again thought she could not have understood, too, for it sounded almost as if they did not care at all what the money did , so long as the sum opposite the name of their society in a certain "report" "headed the list"—and of course that could not be what they meant at all! But it was all very confusing, and not quite pleasant, so that Pollyanna was glad, indeed, when at last she found herself outside in the hushed, sweet air—only she was very sorry, too: for she knew it was not going to be easy, or anything but sad, to tell Jimmy Bean to-morrow that the Ladies' Aid had decided that they would rather send all their money to bring up the little India boys than to save out enough to bring up one little boy in their own town, for which they would not get "a bit of credit in the report," according to the tall lady who wore spectacles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not but that it's good, of course, to send money to the heathen, and I shouldn't want 'em not to send some there," sighed Pollyanna to herself, as she trudged sorrowfully along. "But they acted as if little boys here weren't any account—only little boys 'way off. I should think , though, they'd rather see Jimmy Bean grow—than just a report!</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII IN PENDLETON WOODS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POLLYANNA had not turned her steps toward home, when she left the chapel. She had turned them, instead, toward Pendleton Hill. It had been a hard day, for all it had been a "vacation one" (as she termed the infrequent days when there was no sewing or cooking lesson), and Pollyanna was sure that nothing would do her quite so much good as a walk through the green quiet of Pendleton Woods. Up Pendleton Hill, therefore, she climbed steadily, in spite of the warm sun on her back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't have to get home till half-past five, anyway," she was telling herself; "and it'll be so much nicer to go around by the way of the woods, even if I do have to climb to get there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was very beautiful in the Pendleton Woods, as Pollyanna knew by experience. But to-day it seemed even more delightful than ever, notwithstanding her disappointment over what she must tell Jimmy Bean to-morrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish they were up here—all those ladies who talked so loud," sighed Pollyanna to herself, raising her eyes to the patches of vivid blue between the sunlit green of the tree-tops. "Anyhow, if they were up here, I just reckon they'd change and take Jimmy Bean for their little boy, all right," she finished, secure in her conviction, but unable to give a reason for it, even to herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suddenly Pollyanna lifted her head and listened. A dog had barked some distance ahead. A moment later he came dashing toward her, still barking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hullo, doggie—hullo!" Pollyanna snapped her fingers at the dog and looked expectantly down the path. She had seen the dog once before, she was sure. He had been then with the Man, Mr. John Pendleton. She was looking now, hoping to see him. For some minutes she watched eagerly, but he did not appear. Then she turned her attention toward the dog.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The dog, as even Pollyanna could see, was acting strangely. He was still barking—giving little short, sharp yelps, as if of alarm. He was running back and forth, too, in the path ahead. Soon they reached a side path, and down this the little dog fairly flew, only to come back at once, whining and barking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ho! That isn't the way home," laughed Pollyanna, still keeping to the main path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little dog seemed frantic now. Back and forth, back and forth, between Pollyanna and the side path he vibrated, barking and whining pitifully. Every quiver of his little brown body, and every glance from his beseeching brown eyes were eloquent with appeal—so eloquent that at last Pollyanna understood, turned, and followed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Straight ahead, now, the little dog dashed madly; and it was not long before Pollyanna came upon the reason for it all: a man lying motionless at the foot of a steep, overhanging mass of rock a few yards from the side path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A twig cracked sharply under Pollyanna's foot, and the man turned his head. With a cry of dismay Pollyanna ran to his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pendleton! Oh, are you hurt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurt? Oh, no! I'm just taking a siesta in the sunshine," snapped the man irritably. "See here, how much do you know? What can you do? Have you got any sense?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna caught her breath with a little gasp, but—as was her habit—she answered the questions literally, one by one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I—I don't know so very much, and I can't do a great many things; but most of the Ladies' Aiders, except Mrs. Rawson, said I had real good sense. I heard 'em say so one day—they didn't know I heard, though."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man smiled grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, child, I beg your pardon, I'm sure; it's only this confounded leg of mine. Now listen." He paused, and with some difficulty reached his hand into his trousers pocket and brought out a bunch of keys, singling out one between his thumb and forefinger. "Straight through the path there, about five minutes' walk, is my house. This key will admit you to the side door under the porte-cochère. Do you know what a porte-cochère is?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir. Auntie has one with a sun parlor over it. That's the roof I slept on—only I didn't sleep, you know. They found me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh? Oh! Well, when you get into the house, go straight through the vestibule and hall to the door at the end. On the big, flat-topped desk in the middle of the room you'll find a telephone. Do you know how to use a telephone?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir! Why, once when Aunt Polly—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never mind Aunt Polly now," cut in the man scowlingly, as he tried to move himself a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hunt up Dr. Thomas Chilton's number on the card you'll find somewhere around there—it ought to be on the hook down at the side, but it probably won't be. You know a telephone card, I suppose, when you see one!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir! I just love Aunt Polly's. There's such a lot of queer names, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell Dr. Chilton that John Pendleton is at the foot of Little Eagle Ledge in Pendleton Woods with a broken leg, and to come at once with a stretcher and two men. He'll know what to do besides that. Tell him to come by the path from the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A broken leg? Oh, Mr. Pendleton, how perfectly awful!" shuddered Pollyanna. "But I'm so glad I came! Can't I do—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, you can—but evidently you won't! Will you go and do what I ask and stop talking," moaned the man, faintly. And, with a little sobbing cry, Pollyanna went.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna did not stop now to look up at the patches of blue between the sunlit tops of the trees. She kept her eyes on the ground to make sure that no twig nor stone tripped her hurrying feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was not long before she came in sight of the house. She had seen it before, though never so near as this. She was almost frightened now at the massiveness of the great pile of gray stone with its pillared verandas and its imposing entrance. Pausing only a moment, however, she sped across the big neglected lawn and around the house to the side door under the porte-cochère. Her fingers, stiff from their tight clutch upon the keys, were anything but skilful in their efforts to turn the bolt in the lock; but at last the heavy, carved door swung slowly back on its hinges.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna caught her breath. In spite of her feeling of haste, she paused a moment and looked fearfully through the vestibule to the wide, sombre hall beyond, her thoughts in a whirl. This was John Pendleton's house; the house of mystery; the house into which no one but its master entered; the house which sheltered, somewhere—a skeleton. Yet she, Pollyanna, was expected to enter alone these fearsome rooms, and telephone the doctor that the master of the house lay now—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a little cry Pollyanna, looking neither to the right nor the left, fairly ran through the hall to the door at the end and opened it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The room was large, and sombre with dark woods and hangings like the hall; but through the west window the sun threw a long shaft of gold across the floor, gleamed dully on the tarnished brass andirons in the fireplace, and touched the nickel of the telephone on the great desk in the middle of the room. It was toward this desk that Pollyanna hurriedly tiptoed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The telephone card was not on its hook; it was on the floor. But Pollyanna found it, and ran her shaking forefinger down through the C's to "Chilton." In due time she had Dr. Chilton himself at the other end of the wires, and was tremblingly delivering her message and answering the doctor's terse, pertinent questions. This done, she hung up the receiver and drew a long breath of relief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only a brief glance did Pollyanna give about her; then, with a confused vision in her eyes of crimson draperies, book-lined walls, a littered floor, an untidy desk, innumerable closed doors (any one of which might conceal a skeleton), and everywhere dust, dust, dust, she fled back through the hall to the great carved door, still half open as she had left it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In what seemed, even to the injured man, an incredibly short time, Pollyanna was back in the woods at the man's side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, what is the trouble? Couldn't you get in?" he demanded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna opened wide her eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of course I could! I'm here ," she answered. "As if I'd be here if I hadn't got in! And the doctor will be right up just as soon as possible with the men and things. He said he knew just where you were, so I didn't stay to show him. I wanted to be with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you?" smiled the man, grimly. "Well, I can't say I admire your taste. I should think you might find pleasanter companions."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you mean—because you're so—cross?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thanks for your frankness. Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you're only cross outside —You aren't cross inside a bit!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! How do you know that?" asked the man, trying to change the position of his head without moving the rest of his body.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, lots of ways; there—like that—the way you act with the dog," she added, pointing to the long, slender hand that rested on the dog's sleek head near him. "It's funny how dogs and cats know the insides of folks better than other folks do, isn't it? Say, I'm going to hold your head," she finished abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man winced several times and groaned once; softly while the change was being made; but in the end he found Pollyanna's lap a very welcome substitute for the rocky hollow in which his head had lain before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that is—better," he murmured faintly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not speak again for some time. Pollyanna, watching his face, wondered if he were asleep. She did not think he was. He looked as if his lips were tight shut to keep back moans of pain. Pollyanna herself almost cried aloud as she looked at his great, strong body lying there so helpless. One hand, with fingers tightly clenched, lay outflung, motionless. The other, limply open, lay on the dog's head. The dog, his wistful, eager eyes on his master's face, was motionless, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Minute by minute the time passed. The sun dropped lower in the west and the shadows grew deeper under the trees. Pollyanna sat so still she hardly seemed to breathe. A bird alighted fearlessly within reach of her hand, and a squirrel whisked his bushy tail on a tree-branch almost under her nose—yet with his bright little eyes all the while on the motionless dog.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last the dog pricked up his ears and whined softly; then he gave a short, sharp bark. The next moment Pollyanna heard voices, and very soon "POLLYANNA SAT SO STILL SHE HARDLY SEEMED TO BREATH." Illustration of Pollyanna sitting in the woods with John Pendleton's head in her lap. their owners appeared three men carrying a stretcher and various other articles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The tallest of the party—a smooth-shaven, kind-eyed man whom Pollyanna knew by sight as "Dr. Chilton"—advanced cheerily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my little lady, playing nurse?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, sir," smiled Pollyanna. "I've only held his head—I haven't given him a mite of medicine. But I'm glad I was here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So am I," nodded the doctor, as he turned his absorbed attention to the injured man.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV JUST A MATTER OF JELLY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POLLYANNA was a little late for supper on the night of the accident to John Pendleton; but, as it happened, she escaped without reproof.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy met her at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if I ain't glad ter be settin' my two eyes on you," she sighed in obvious relief. "It's half-past six!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it," admitted Pollyanna anxiously; "but I'm not to blame—truly I'm not. And I don't think even Aunt Polly will say I am, either."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She won't have the chance," retorted Nancy, with huge satisfaction. "She's gone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gone!" gasped Pollyanna. "You don't mean that I've driven her away?" Through Pollyanna's mind at the moment trooped remorseful memories of the morning with its unwanted boy, cat, and dog, and its unwelcome "glad" and forbidden "father that would spring to her forgetful little tongue. Oh, I didn't drive her away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much you did," scoffed Nancy. "Her cousin died suddenly down to Boston, and she had ter go. She had one o' them yeller telegram letters after you went away this afternoon, and she won't be back for three days. Now I guess we're glad all right. We'll be keepin' house tergether, jest you and me, all that time. We will, we will!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad! Oh, Nancy, when it's a funeral?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but 'twa'n't the funeral I was glad for, Miss Pollyanna. It was—" Nancy stopped abruptly. A shrewd twinkle came into her eyes. "Why, Miss Pollyanna, as if it wa'n't yerself that was teachin' me ter play the game," she reproached her gravely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna puckered her forehead into a troubled frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't help it, Nancy," she argued with a shake of her head. "It must be that there are some things that 'tisn't right to play the game on—and I'm sure funerals is one of them. There's nothing in a funeral to be glad about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We can be glad 'tain't our'n," she observed demurely. But Pollyanna did not hear. She had begun to tell of the accident; and in a moment Nancy, open-mouthed, was listening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the appointed place the next afternoon, Pollyanna met Jimmy Bean according to agreement. As was to be expected, of course, Jimmy showed keen disappointment that the Ladies' Aid preferred a little India boy to himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, maybe 'tis natural," he sighed. "Of course things you don't know about are always nicer'n things you do, same as the pertater on 'tother side of the plate is always the biggest. But I wish I looked that way ter somebody 'way off. Wouldn't it be jest great, now, if only somebody over in India wanted me ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna clapped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of course! That's the very thing, Jimmy! I'll write to my Ladies' Aiders about you. They aren't over in India; they're only out West—but that's awful far away, just the same. I reckon you'd think so if you'd come all the way here as I did!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy's face brightened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think they would—truly—take me?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course they would! Don't they take little boys in India to bring up? Well, they can just play you are the little India boy this time. I reckon you're far enough away to make a report, all right. You wait. I'll write 'em. I'll write Mrs. White. No, I'll write Mrs. Jones. Mrs. White has got the most money, but Mrs. Jones gives the most—which is kind of funny, isn't it?—when you think of it. But I reckon some of the Aiders will take you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right—but don't furgit ter say I'll work fur my board an' keep," put in Jimmy. "I ain't no beggar, an' biz'ness is biz'ness, even with Ladies' Aiders, I'm thinkin'." He hesitated, then added: "An' I s'pose I better stay where I be fur a spell yet—till you hear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course," nodded Pollyanna emphatically. "Then I'll know just where to find you. And they'll take you—I'm sure you're far enough away for that. Didn't Aunt Polly take— Say!" she broke off, suddenly, "do you suppose I was Aunt Polly's little girl from India?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, if you ain't the queerest kid," grinned Jimmy, as he turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was about a week after the accident in Pendleton Woods that Pollyanna said to her aunt one morning:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly, please would you mind very much if I took Mrs. Snow's calf's-foot jelly this week to some one else? I'm sure Mrs. Snow wouldn't— this once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear me, Pollyanna, what are you up to now? sighed her aunt. "You are the most extraordinary child!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned a little anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly, please, what is extraordinary? If you're ex traordinary you can't be or dinary, can you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You certainly can not."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's all right, then. I'm glad I'm ex traordinary," sighed Pollyanna, her face clearing. "You see, Mrs. White used to say Mrs. Rawson was a very ordinary woman—and she disliked Mrs. Rawson something awful. They were always fight—I mean, father had—that is, I mean, we had more trouble keeping peace between them than we did between any of the rest of the Aiders," corrected Pollyanna, a little breathless from her efforts to steer between the Scylla of her father's past commands in regard to speaking of church quarrels, and the Charybdis of her aunt's present commands in regard to speaking of her father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes; well, never mind," interposed Aunt Polly, a trifle impatiently. "You do run on so, Pollyanna, and no matter what we're talking about you always bring up at those Ladies' Aiders!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm," smiled Pollyanna, cheerfully, "I reckon I do, maybe. But you see they used to bring me up, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Pollyanna," interrupted a cold voice. "Now what is it about this jelly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing, Aunt Polly, truly, that you would mind, I'm sure. You let me take jelly to her , so I thought you would to him —this once. You see, broken legs aren't like—like lifelong invalids, so his won't last forever as Mrs. Snow's does, and she can have all the rest of the things after just once or twice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"`Him'? `He'? `Broken leg'? What are you talking about, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stared; then her face relaxed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I forgot. I reckon you didn't know. You see, it happened while you were gone. It was the very day you went that I found him in the woods, you know; and I had to unlock his house and telephone for the men and the doctor, and hold his head, and everything. And of course then I came away and haven't seen him since. But when Nancy made the jelly for Mrs. Snow this week I thought how nice it would be if I could take it to him instead of her, just this once. Aunt Polly, may I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes, I suppose so," acquiesced Miss Polly, a little wearily. "Who did you say he was?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The Man. I mean, Mr. John Pendleton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly almost sprang from her chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"John Pendleton!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Nancy told me his name. Maybe you know him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly did not answer this. Instead she asked:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you know him?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. He always speaks and smiles—now. He's only cross outside , you know. I'll go and get the jelly. Nancy had it 'most fixed when I came in," finished Pollyanna, already halfway across the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, wait! Miss Polly's voice was suddenly very stern. I've changed my mind. I would prefer that Mrs. Snow had that jelly to-day—as usual. That is all. You may go now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's face fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but Aunt Polly, hers will last. She can always be sick and have things, you know; but his is just a broken leg, and legs don't last—I mean, broken ones. He's had it a whole week now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I remember. I heard Mr. John Pendleton had met with an accident," said Miss Polly, a little stiffly; "but—I do not care to be sending jelly to John Pendleton, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know, he is cross—outside," admitted Pollyanna, sadly, "so I suppose you don't like him. But I wouldn't say 'twas you sent it. I'd say 'twas me. I like him. I'd be glad to send him jelly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly began to shake her head again. Then, suddenly, she stopped, and asked in a curiously quiet voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does he know who you—are, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon not. I told him my name, once, but he never calls me it—never."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does he know where you—live?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no. I never told him that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then he doesn't know you're my—niece?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think so."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment there was silence. Miss Polly was looking at Pollyanna with eyes that did not seem to see her at all. The little girl, shifting impatiently from one small foot to the other, sighed audibly. Then Miss Polly roused herself with a start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, Pollyanna," she said at last , still in that queer voice, so unlike her own; "you may you may take the jelly to Mr. Pendleton as your own gift. But understand: I do not send it. Be very sure that he does not think I do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm—no'm—thank you, Aunt Polly," exulted Pollyanna, as she flew through the door.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XV DR. CHILTON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE great gray pile of masonry looked very different to Pollyanna when she made her second visit to the house of Mr. John Pendleton. Windows were open, an elderly woman was hanging out clothes in the back yard, and the doctor's gig stood under the porte-cochère.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As before Pollyanna went to the side door. This time she rang the bell—her fingers were not stiff to-day from a tight clutch on a bunch of keys.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A familiar-looking small dog bounded up the steps to greet her, but there was a slight delay before the woman who had been hanging out the clothes opened the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you please, I've brought some calf's-foot jelly for Mr. Pendleton," smiled Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said the woman, reaching for the bowl in the little girl's hand. "Who shall I say sent it? And it's calf's-foot jelly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor, coming into the hall at that moment, heard the woman's words and saw the disappointed look on Pollyanna's face. He stepped quickly forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah! Some calf's-foot jelly?" he asked genially. "That will be fine! Maybe you'd like to see our patient, eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna; and the woman, in obedience to a nod from the doctor, led the way down the hall at once, though plainly with vast surprise on her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Behind the doctor, a young man (a trained nurse from the nearest city) gave a disturbed exclamation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Doctor, didn't Mr. Pendleton give orders not to admit—any one?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes," nodded the doctor, imperturbably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I'm giving orders now. I'll take the risk." Then he added whimsically: "You don't know, of course; but that little girl is better than a six-quart bottle of tonic any day. If anything or anybody can take the grouch out of Pendleton this afternoon, she can. That's why I sent her in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who is she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For one brief moment the doctor hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's the niece of one of our best known residents. Her name is Pollyanna Whittier. I—I don't happen to enjoy a very extensive personal acquaintance with the little lady as yet; but lots of my patients do—I'm thankful to say!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nurse smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! And what are the special ingredients of this wonder-working—tonic of hers?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know. As near as I can find out it is an overwhelming, unquenchable gladness for everything that has happened or is going to happen. At any rate, her quaint speeches are constantly being repeated to me, and, as near as I can make out, `just being glad' is the tenor of most of them. All is," he added, with another whimsical smile, as he stepped out on to the porch, "I wish I could prescribe her—and buy her—as I would a box of pills;—though if there gets to be many of her in the world, you and I might as well go to ribbon-selling and ditch-digging for all the money we'd get out of nursing and doctoring," he laughed, picking up the reins and stepping into the gig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna, meanwhile, in accordance with the doctor's orders, was being escorted to John Pendleton's rooms.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her way led through the great library at the end of the hall, and, rapid as was her progress through it, Pollyanna saw at once that great changes had taken place. The book-lined walls and the crimson curtains were the same; but there was no litter on the floor, no untidiness on the desk, and not so much as a grain of dust in sight. The telephone card hung in its proper place, and the brass andirons had been polished. One of the mysterious doors was open, and it was toward this that the maid led the way. A moment later Pollyanna found herself in a sumptuously furnished bedroom while the maid was saying in a frightened voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you please, sir, here—here's a little girl with some jelly. The doctor said I was to—to bring her in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next moment Pollyanna found herself alone with a very cross-looking man lying flat on his back in bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, didn't I say—" began an angry voice. "Oh, it's you!" it broke off not very graciously, as Pollyanna advanced toward the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," smiled Pollyanna. "Oh, I'm so glad they let me in! You see, at first the lady 'most took my jelly, and I was so afraid I wasn't going to see you at all. Then the doctor came, and he said I might. Wasn't he lovely to let me see you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of himself the man's lips twitched into a smile; but all he said was "Humph!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I've brought you some jelly," resumed Pollyanna; "—calf's-foot. I hope you like it?" There was a rising inflection in her voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never ate it." The fleeting smile had gone, and the scowl had come back to the man's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a brief instant Pollyanna's countenance showed disappointment; but it cleared as she set the bowl of jelly down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't you? Well, if you didn't, then you can't know you don't like it, anyhow, can you? So I reckon I'm glad you haven't, after all. Now, if you knew—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes; well, there's one thing I know all right, and that is that I'm flat on my back right here this minute, and that I'm liable to stay here—till doomsday, I guess."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no! It couldn't be till doomsday, you know, when the angel Gabriel blows his trumpet, unless it should come quicker than we think it will—oh, of course, I know the Bible says it may come quicker than we think, but I don't think it will—that is, of course I believe the Bible; but I mean I don't think it will come as much quicker as it would if it should come now, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton laughed suddenly—and aloud. The nurse, coming in at that moment, heard the laugh, and beat a hurried—but a very silent—retreat. He had the air of a frightened cook who, seeing the danger of a breath of cold air striking a half-done cake, hastily shuts the oven door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aren't you getting a little mixed?" asked John Pendleton of Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe. But what I mean is, that legs don't last—broken ones, you know—like lifelong invalids, same as Mrs. Snow has got. So yours won't last till doomsday at all. I should think you could be glad of that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I am," retorted the man grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you didn't break but one. You can be glad 'twasn't two." Pollyanna was warming to her task.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course! So fortunate," sniffed the man, with uplifted eyebrows; "looking at it from that standpoint, I suppose I might be glad I wasn't a centipede and didn't break fifty!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's the best yet," she crowed. "I know what a centipede is; they've got lots of legs. And you can be glad—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, of course," interrupted the man, sharply, all the old bitterness coming back to his voice; "I can be glad, too, for all the rest, I suppose—the nurse, and the doctor, and that confounded woman in the kitchen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes, sir—only think how bad 'twould be if you didn't have them!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I—eh?" he demanded sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I say, only think how bad it would be if you didn't have 'em—and you lying here like this!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if that wasn't the very thing that was at the bottom of the whole matter," retorted the man, testily, "because I am lying here like this! And yet you expect me to say I'm glad because of a fool woman who disarranges the whole house and calls it `regulating,' and a man who aids and abets her in it, and calls it `nursing,' to say nothing of the doctor who eggs 'em both on—and the whole bunch of them, meanwhile, expecting me to pay them for it, and pay them well, too!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned sympathetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I know. That part is too bad—about the money—when you've been saving it, too, all this time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When—eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Saving it—buying beans and fish balls, you know. Say, do you like beans?—or do you like turkey better, only on account of the sixty cents?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Look a-here, child, what are you talking about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna smiled radiantly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About your money, you know—denying yourself, and saving it for the heathen. You see, I found out about it. Why, Mr. Pendleton, that's one of the ways I knew you weren't cross inside. Nancy told me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man's jaw dropped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy told you I was saving money for the—Well, may I inquire who Nancy is?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Our Nancy. She works for Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly! Well, who is Aunt Polly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's Miss Polly Harrington. I live with her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man made a sudden movement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss—Polly—Harrington!" he breathed. "You live with— her!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I'm her niece. She's taken me to bring up—on account of my mother, you know," faltered Pollyanna, in a low voice. "She was her sister. And after father—went to be with her and the rest of us in Heaven, there wasn't any one left for me down here but the Ladies' Aid; so she took me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man did not answer. His face, as he lay back on the pillow now, was very white—so white that Pollyanna was frightened. She rose uncertainly to her feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I reckon maybe I'd better go now," she proposed. "I—I hope you'll like—the jelly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man turned his head suddenly, and opened his eyes. There was a curious longing in their dark depths which even Pollyanna saw, and at which she marvelled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And so you are—Miss Polly Harrington's niece," he said gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still the man's dark eyes lingered on her face, until Pollyanna, feeling vaguely restless, murmured:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I suppose you know—her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton's lips curved in an odd smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes; I know her." He hesitated, then went on, still with that curious smile. "But—you don't mean—you can't mean that it was Miss Polly Harrington who sent that jelly—to me?" he said slowly,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked distressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"N-no, sir: she didn't. She said I must be very sure not to let you think she did send it. But I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought as much," vouchsafed the man, shortly, turning away his head. And Pollyanna, still more distressed, tiptoed from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the porte-cochère she found the doctor waiting in his gig. The nurse stood on the steps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Miss Pollyanna, may I have the pleasure of seeing you home?" asked the doctor smilingly. "I started to drive on a few minutes ago; then it occurred to me that I'd wait for you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, sir. I'm glad you did. I just love to ride," beamed Pollyanna, as he reached out his hand to help her in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you?" smiled the doctor, nodding his head in farewell to the young man on the steps. "Well, as near as I can judge, there are a good many things you `love' to do—eh?" he added, as they drove briskly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I don't know. I reckon perhaps there are," she admitted. "I like to do 'most everything that's living . Of course I don't like the other things very well—sewing, and reading out loud, and all that. But they aren't living ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No? What are they, then?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly says they're `learning to live,' sighed Pollyanna, with a rueful smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor smiled now—a little queerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does she? Well, I should think she might say—just that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," responded Pollyanna. "But I don't see it that way at all. I don't think you have to learn how to live. I didn't, anyhow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor drew a long sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"After all, I'm afraid some of us—do have to, little girl," he said. Then, for a time he was silent. Pollyanna, stealing a glance at his face, felt vaguely sorry for him. He looked so sad. She wished, uneasily, that she could "do something." It was this, perhaps, that caused her to say in a timid voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton, I should think being a doctor would, be the very gladdest kind of a business there was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor turned in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"`Gladdest'!—when I see so much suffering always, everywhere I go?" he cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know; but you're helping it—don't you see?—and of course you're glad to help it! And so that makes you the gladdest of any of us, all the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor's eyes filled with sudden hot tears. The doctor's life was a singularly lonely one. He had no wife and no home save his two-room office in a boarding house. His profession was very dear to him. Looking now into Pollyanna's shining eyes, he felt as if a loving hand had been suddenly laid on his head in blessing. He knew, too, that never again would a long day's work or a long night's weariness be quite without that new-found exaltation that had come to him through Pollyanna's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God bless you, little girl," he said unsteadily. Then, with the bright smile his patients knew and loved so well, he added: "And I'm thinking, after all, that it was the doctor, quite as much as his patients, that needed a draft of that tonic!" All of which puzzled Pollyanna very much—until a chipmunk, running across the road, drove the whole matter from her mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor left Pollyanna at her own door, smiled at Nancy, who was sweeping off the front porch, then drove rapidly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've had a perfectly beautiful ride with the doctor," announced Pollyanna, bounding up the steps. "He's lovely, Nancy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. And I told him I should think his business would be the very gladdest one there was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What!—goin' ter see sick folks—an' folks what ain't sick but thinks they is, which is worse? Nancy's face showed open skepticism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed gleefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. That's 'most what he said, too; but there is a way to be glad, even then. Guess!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy frowned in meditation. Nancy was getting so she could play this game of "being glad" quite successfully, she thought. She rather enjoyed studying out Pollyanna's "posers," too, as she called some of the little girl's questions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I know," she chuckled. "It's just the opposite from what you told Mis' Snow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Opposite?" repeated Pollyanna, obviously puzzled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. You told her she could be glad because other folks wasn't like her—all sick, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," nodded Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, the doctor can be glad because he isn't like other folks—the sick ones, I mean, what he doctors," finished Nancy in triumph.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was Pollyanna's turn to frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, y-yes," she admitted. "Of course that is one way, but it isn't the way I said; and—someway, I don't seem to quite like the sound of it. It isn't exactly as if he said he was glad they were sick, but—You do play the game so funny, sometimes Nancy," she sighed, as she went into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna found her aunt in the sitting room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who was that man—the one who drove into the yard, Pollyanna?" questioned the lady a little sharply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, that was Dr. Chilton! Don't you know him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton! What was he doing—here?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He drove me home. Oh, and I gave the jelly to Mr. Pendleton, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly lifted her head quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, he did not think I sent it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, Aunt Polly. I told him you didn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly grew a sudden vivid pink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You told him I didn't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna opened wide her eyes at the remonstrative dismay in her aunt's voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, you said to!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I said , Pollyanna, that I did not send it, and for you to be very sure that he did not think I did !—which is a very different matter from telling him outright that I did not send it." And she turned vexedly away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dear me! Well, I don't see where the difference is," sighed Pollyanna, as she went to hang her hat on the one particular hook in the house upon which Aunt Polly had said that it must be hung.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVI A RED ROSE AND A LACE SHAWL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was on a rainy day about a week after Pollyanna's visit to Mr. John Pendleton, that Miss Polly was driven by Timothy to an early afternoon committee meeting of the Ladies' Aid Society. When she returned at three o'clock, her cheeks were a bright, pretty pink, and her hair, blown by the damp wind, had fluffed into kinks and curls wherever the loosened pins had given leave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna had never before seen her aunt look like this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh—oh—oh! Why, Aunt Polly, you've got 'em, too," she cried rapturously, dancing round and round her aunt, as that lady entered the sitting room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Got what, you impossible child?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna was still revolving round and round her aunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I never knew you had 'em! Can folks have 'em when you don't know they've got 'em? Do you suppose I could?—'fore I get to Heaven, I mean," she cried, pulling out with eager fingers the straight locks above her ears. "But then, they wouldn't be black, if they did come. You can't hide the black part."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, what does all this mean?" demanded Aunt Polly, hurriedly removing her hat, and trying to smooth back her disordered hair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, no—please, Aunt Polly!" Pollyanna's jubilant voice turned to one of distressed appeal. "Don't smooth 'em out! It's those that I'm talking about—those darling little black curls. Oh, Aunt Polly, they're so pretty!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nonsense! What do you mean, Pollyanna, by going to the Ladies' Aid the other day in that absurd fashion about that beggar boy?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it isn't nonsense," urged Pollyanna, answering only the first of her aunt's remarks. "You don't know how pretty you look with your hair like that! Oh, Aunt Polly, please, mayn't I do your hair like I did Mrs. Snow's, and put in a flower? I'd so love to see you that way! Why, you'd be ever so much prettier than she was!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!" (Miss Polly spoke very sharply—all the more sharply because Pollyanna's words had given her an odd throb of joy: when before had anybody cared how she, or her hair looked? When before had anybody "loved" to see her "pretty"?) "Pollyanna, you did not answer my question. Why did you go to the Ladies' Aid in that absurd fashion?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm, I know; but, please, I didn't know it was absurd until I went and found out they'd rather see their report grow than Jimmy. So then I wrote to my Ladies' Aiders—'cause Jimmy is far away from them, you know; and I thought maybe he could be their little India boy same as—Aunt Polly, was I your little India girl? And, Aunt Polly, you will let me do your hair, won't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly put her hand to her throat—the old, helpless feeling was upon her, she knew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Pollyanna, when the ladies told me this afternoon how you came to them, I was so ashamed! I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna began to dance up and down lightly on her toes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't!—You didn't say I couldn't do your hair," she crowed triumphantly; "and so I'm sure it means just the other way 'round, sort of—like it did the other day about Mr. Pendleton's jelly that you didn't send, but didn't want me to say you "'OH, MY! WHAT PRETTY HAIR YOU'VE GOT.'" Illustration of Pollyanna fixing her aunt's hair in front of a mirror. didn't send, you know. Now wait just where you are. I'll get a comb."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But Pollyanna, Pollyanna," remonstrated Aunt Polly, following the little girl from the room and panting up-stairs after her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, did you come up here?" Pollyanna greeted her at the door of Miss Polly's own room. "That'll be nicer yet! I've got the comb. Now sit down, please, right here. Oh, I'm so glad you let me do it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Pollyanna, I—I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly did not finish her sentence. To her helpless amazement she found herself in the low chair before the dressing table, with her hair already tumbling about her ears under ten eager, but very gentle fingers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, my! what pretty hair you've got," prattled Pollyanna; "and there's so much more of it than Mrs. Snow has, too! But, of course, you need more, anyhow, because you're well and can go to places where folks can see it. My! I reckon folks'll be glad when they do see it—and surprised, too, 'cause you've hid it so long. Why, Aunt Polly, I'll make you so pretty everybody'll just love to look at you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!" gasped a stifled but shocked voice from a veil of hair. I—I'm sure I don't know why I'm letting you do this silly thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, I should think you'd be glad to have folks like to look at you! Don't you like to look at pretty things? I'm ever so much happier when I look at pretty folks, 'cause when I look at the other kind I'm so sorry for them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But—but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I just love to do folks' hair," purred Pollyanna, contentedly. "I did quite a lot of the Ladies' Aiders'—but there wasn't any of them so nice as yours. Mrs. White's was pretty nice, though, and she looked just lovely one day when I dressed her up in—Oh, Aunt Polly, I've just happened to think of something! But it's a secret, and I sha'n't tell. Now your hair is almost done, and pretty quick I'm going to leave you just a minute; and you must promise—promise— promise not to stir nor peek, even, till I come back. Now remember! she finished, as she ran from the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aloud Miss Polly said nothing. To herself she said that of course she should at once undo the absurd work of her niece's fingers, and put her hair up properly again. As for "peeking just as if she cared how—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At that moment—unaccountably—Miss Polly caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror of the dressing table. And what she saw sent such a flush of rosy color to her cheeks that—she only flushed the more at the sight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She saw a face—not young, it is true—but just now alight with excitement and surprise. The cheeks were a pretty pink. The eyes sparkled. The hair, dark, and still damp from the outdoor air, lay in loose waves about the forehead and curved back over the ears in wonderfully becoming lines, with softening little curls here and there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So amazed and so absorbed was Miss Polly with what she saw in the glass that she quite forgot her determination to do over her hair, until she heard Pollyanna enter the room again. Before she could move, then, she felt a folded something slipped across her eyes and tied in the back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, Pollyanna! What are you doing?" she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's just what I don't want you to know, Aunt Polly, and I was afraid you would peek, so I tied on the handkerchief. Now sit still. It won't take but just a minute, then I'll let you see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Pollyanna," began Miss Polly, struggling blindly to her feet, "you must take this off! You —child, child! what are you doing?" she gasped, as she felt a soft something slipped about her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna only chuckled the more gleefully. With trembling fingers she was draping about her aunt's shoulders the fleecy folds of a beautiful lace shawl, yellowed from long years of packing away, and fragrant with lavender. Pollyanna had found the shawl the week before when Nancy had been regulating the attic; and it had occurred to her to-day that there was no reason why her aunt, as well as Mrs. White of her Western home, should not be "dressed up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her task completed, Pollyanna surveyed her work with eyes that approved, but that saw yet one touch wanting. Promptly, therefore, she pulled her aunt toward the sun parlor where she could see a belated red rose blooming on the trellis within reach of her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, what are you doing? Where are you taking me to?" recoiled Aunt Polly, vainly trying to hold herself back. "Pollyanna, I shall not—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's just to the sun parlor—only a minute! I'll have you ready now quicker'n no time," panted Pollyanna, reaching for the rose and thrusting it into the soft hair above Miss Polly's left ear. "There!" she exulted, untying the knot of the handkerchief and flinging the bit of linen far from her. "Oh, Aunt Polly, now I reckon you'll be glad I dressed you up!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For one dazed moment Miss Polly looked at her bedecked self, and at her surroundings; then she gave a low cry and fled to her room. Pollyanna, following the direction of her aunt's last dismayed gaze, saw, through the open windows of the sun parlor, the horse and gig turning into the driveway. She recognized at once the man who held the reins. Delightedly she leaned forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton, Dr. Chilton! Did you want to see me? I'm up here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," smiled the doctor, a little gravely. "Will you come down, please?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the bedroom Pollyanna found a flushed-faced, angry-eyed woman plucking at the pins that held a lace shawl in place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, how could you?" moaned the woman. "To think of your rigging me up like this, and then letting me— be seen !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stopped in dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you looked lovely—perfectly lovely, Aunt Polly; and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Lovely'!" scorned the woman, flinging the shawl to one side and attacking her hair with shaking fingers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly, please, please let the hair stay!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Stay? Like this? As if I would!" And Miss Polly pulled the locks so tightly back that the last curl lay stretched dead at the ends of her fingers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O dear! And you did look so pretty," almost sobbed Pollyanna, as she stumbled through the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Down-stairs Pollyanna found the doctor waiting in his gig.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've prescribed you for a patient, and he's sent me to get the prescription filled," announced the doctor. "Will you go?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean—an errand—to the drug store?" asked Pollyanna, a little uncertainly. "I used to go some—for the Ladies' Aiders."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor shook his head with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not exactly. It's Mr. John Pendleton. He would like to see you to-day, if you'll be so good as to come. It's stopped raining, so I drove down after you. Will you come? I'll call for you and bring you back before six o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'd love to!" exclaimed Pollyanna. "Let me ask Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few moments she returned, hat in hand, but with rather a sober face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Didn't—your aunt want you to go?" asked the doctor, a little diffidently, as they drove away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Y-yes," sighed Pollyanna. "She—she wanted me to go too much, I'm afraid."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wanted you to go too much !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sighed again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I reckon she meant she didn't want me there. You see, she said: `Yes, yes, run along, run along—do! I wish you'd gone before.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor smiled—but with his lips only. His eyes were very grave. For some time he said nothing; then, a little hesitatingly, he asked:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wasn't it—your aunt I saw with you a few minutes ago—in the window of the sun parlor?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna drew a long breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; that's what's the whole trouble, I suppose. You see I'd dressed her up in a perfectly lovely lace shawl I found up-stairs, and I'd fixed her hair and put on a rose, and she looked so pretty. Didn't you think she looked just lovely?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment the doctor did not answer. When he did speak his voice was so low Pollyanna could but just hear the words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Pollyanna, I—I thought she did look—just lovely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you? I'm so glad! I'll tell her," nodded the little girl, contentedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To her surprise the doctor gave a sudden exclamation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never! Pollyanna, I—I'm afraid I shall have to ask you not to tell her—that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Dr. Chilton! Why not? I should think you'd be glad—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But she might not be," cut in the doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna considered this for a moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's so—maybe she wouldn't," she sighed. "I remember now; 'twas 'cause she saw you that she ran. And she—she spoke afterwards about her being seen in that rig."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought as much," declared the doctor, under his breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Still, I don't see why," maintained Pollyanna, "—when she looked so pretty!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor said nothing. He did not speak again, indeed, until they were almost to the great stone house in which John Pendleton lay with a broken leg.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVII "JUST LIKE A BOOK"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN PENDLETON greeted Pollyanna to-day with a smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Miss Pollyanna, I'm thinking you must be a very forgiving little person, else you wouldn't have come to see me again to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I was real glad to come, and I'm sure I don't see why I shouldn't be, either."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, well, you know, I was pretty cross with you, I'm afraid, both the other day when you so kindly brought me the jelly, and that time when you found me with the broken leg at first. By the way, too, I don't think I've ever thanked you for that. Now I'm sure that even you would admit that you were very forgiving to come and see me, after such ungrateful treatment as that!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stirred uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I was glad to find you—that is, I don't mean I was glad your leg was broken, of course," she corrected hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton smiled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I understand. Your tongue does get away with you once in a while, doesn't it, Miss Pollyanna? I do thank you, however; and I consider you a very brave little girl to do what you did that day. I thank you for the jelly, too," he added in a lighter voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did you like it?" asked Pollyanna with interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very much. I suppose—there isn't any more to-day that—that Aunt Polly didn't send, is there?" he asked with an odd smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His visitor looked distressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"N-no, sir." She hesitated, then went on with heightened color. "Please, Mr. Pendleton, I didn't mean to be rude the other day when I said Aunt Polly did not send the jelly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer. John Pendleton was not smiling now. He was looking straight ahead of him with eyes that seemed to be gazing through and beyond the object before them. After a time he drew a long sigh and turned to Pollyanna. When he spoke his voice carried the old nervous fretfulness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, well, this will never do at all! I didn't send for you to see me moping this time. Listen! Out in the library—the big room where the telephone is, you know—you will find a carved box on the lower shelf of the big case with glass doors in the corner not far from the fireplace. That is, it'll be there if that confounded woman hasn't `regulated' it to somewhere else! You may bring it to me. It is heavy, but not too heavy for you to carry, I think."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm awfully strong," declared Pollyanna, cheerfully, as she sprang to her feet. In a minute she had returned with the box.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a wonderful half-hour that Pollyanna spent then. The box was full of treasures—curios that John Pendleton had picked up in years of travel—and concerning each there was some entertaining story, whether it were a set of exquisitely carved chessmen from China, or a little jade idol from India.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was after she had heard the story about the idol that Pollyanna murmured wistfully:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I suppose it would be better to take a little boy in India to bring up—one that didn't know any more than to think that God was in that doll-thing—than it would be to take Jimmy Bean, a little boy who knows God is up in the sky. Still, I can't help wishing they had wanted Jimmy Bean, too, besides the India boys."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton did not seem to hear. Again his, eyes were staring straight before him, looking at nothing. But soon he had roused himself, and had picked up another curio to talk about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The visit, certainly, was a delightful one, but before it was over, Pollyanna was realizing that they were talking about something besides the wonderful things in the beautiful carved box. They were talking of herself, of Nancy, of Aunt Polly, and of her daily life. They were talking, too, even of the life and home long ago in the far Western town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not until it was nearly time for her to go, did the man say, in a voice Pollyanna had never before heard from stern John Pendleton:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Little girl, I want you to come to see me often. Will you? I'm lonesome, and I need you. There's another reason—and I'm going to tell you that, too. I thought, at first, after I found out who you were, the other day, that I didn't want you to come any more. You reminded me of—of something I have tried for long years to forget. So I said to myself that I never wanted to see you again; and every day, when the doctor asked if I wouldn't let him bring you to me, I said no.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But after a time I found I was wanting to see you so much that—that the fact that I wasn't seeing you was making me remember all the more vividly the thing I was so wanting to forget. So now I want you to come. Will you—little girl?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes, Mr. Pendleton," breathed Pollyanna, her eyes luminous with sympathy for the sad-faced man lying back on the pillow before her. "I'd love to come!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," said John Pendleton, gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After supper that evening, Pollyanna, sitting on the back porch, told Nancy all about Mr. John Pendleton's wonderful carved box, and the still more wonderful things it contained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And ter think," sighed Nancy, "that he showed ye all them things, and told ye about 'em like that—him that's so cross he never talks ter no one—no one!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but he isn't cross, Nancy, only outside," demurred Pollyanna, with quick loyalty. "I don't see why everybody thinks he's so bad, either. They wouldn't, if they knew him. But even Aunt Polly doesn't like him very well. She wouldn't send the jelly to him, you know, and she was so afraid he'd think she did send it!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Probably she didn't call him no duty," shrugged Nancy. "But what beats me is how he happened ter take ter you so, Miss Pollyanna—meanin' no offence ter you, of course—but he ain't the sort o' man what gen'rally takes ter kids; he ain't, he ain't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna smiled happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he did, Nancy," she nodded, "only I reckon even he didn't want to— all the time. Why, only to-day he owned up that one time he just felt he never wanted to see me again, because I reminded him of something he wanted to forget. But afterwards—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's that?" interrupted Nancy, excitedly. "He said you reminded him of something he wanted to forget?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. But afterwards—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was it?" Nancy was eagerly insistent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He didn't tell me. He just said it was something."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The mystery !" breathed Nancy, in an awestruck voice. "That's why he took to you in the first place. Oh, Miss Pollyanna! Why, that's just like a book—I've read lots of 'em; `Lady Maud's Secret,' and `The Lost Heir,' and `Hidden for Years'—all of 'em had mysteries and things just like this. My stars and stockings! Just think of havin' a book lived right under yer nose like this an' me not knowin' it all this time! Now tell me everythin'—everythin' he said, Miss Pollyanna, there's a dear! No wonder he took ter you; no wonder—no wonder!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he didn't," cried Pollyanna, "not till I talked to him , first. And he didn't even know who I was till I took the calf's-foot jelly, and had to make him understand that Aunt Polly didn't send it, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy sprang to her feet and clasped her hands together suddenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Miss Pollyanna, I know, I know—I know —I know!" she exulted rapturously. The next minute she was down at Pollyanna's side again. "Tell me—now think, and answer straight and true," she urged excitedly. "It was after he found out you was Miss Polly's niece that he said he didn't ever want ter see ye again, wa'n't it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. I told him that the last time I saw him, and he told me this to-day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought as much," triumphed Nancy. "And Miss Polly wouldn't send the jelly herself, would she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you told him she didn't send it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, yes; I—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And he began ter act queer and cry out sudden after he found out you was her niece. He did that, didn't he?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, y-yes; he did act a little queer—over that jelly," admitted Pollyanna, with a thoughtful frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy drew a long sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I've got it, sure! Now listen. Mr. John Pendleton was Miss Polly Harrington's lover!" she announced impressively, but with a furtive glance over her shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Nancy, he couldn't be! She doesn't like him," objected Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy gave her a scornful glance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course she don't! That's the quarrel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna still looked incredulous, and with another long breath Nancy happily settled herself to tell the story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's like this. Just before you come, Mr. Tom told me Miss Polly had had a lover once. I didn't believe it. I couldn't—her and a lover! But Mr. Tom said she had, and that he was livin' now right in this town. And now I know, of course. It's John Pendleton. Hain't he got a mystery in his life? Don't he shut himself up in that grand house alone, and never speak ter no one? Didn't he act queer when he found out you was Miss Polly's niece? And now hain't he owned up that you remind him of somethin' he wants ter forget? Just as if anybody couldn't see 'twas Miss Polly!—an' her sayin' she wouldn't send him no jelly, too. Why, Miss Pollyanna, it's as plain as the nose on yer face; it is, it is!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh-h!" breathed Pollyanna, in wide-eyed amazement. "But, Nancy, I should think if they loved each other they'd make up some time. Both of 'em all alone, so, all these years. I should think they'd be glad to make up!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy sniffed disdainfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess maybe you don't know much about lovers, Miss Pollyanna. You ain't big enough yet, anyhow. But if there is a set o' folks in the world that wouldn't have no use for that 'ere `glad game' o' your'n, it'd be a pair o' quarrellin' lovers; and that's what they be. Ain't he cross as sticks, most gen'rally?—and ain't she—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy stopped abruptly, remembering just in time to whom, and about whom, she was speaking. Suddenly, however, she chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I ain't sayin', though, Miss Pollyanna, but what it would be a pretty slick piece of business if you could get 'em ter playin' it—so they would be glad ter make up. But, my land! wouldn't folks stare some—Miss Polly and him! I guess, though, there ain't much chance, much chance!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna said nothing; but when she went into the house a little later, her face was very thoughtful.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XVIII PRISMS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AS the warm August days passed, Pollyanna went very frequently to the great house on Pendleton Hill. She did not feel, however, that her visits were really a success. Not but that the man seemed to want her there—he sent for her, indeed, frequently; but that when she was there, he seemed scarcely any the happier for her presence—at least, so Pollyanna thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He talked to her, it was true, and he showed her many strange and beautiful things—books, pictures, and curios. But he still fretted audibly over his own helplessness, and he chafed visibly under the rules and "regulatings" of the unwelcome members of his household. He did, indeed, seem to like to hear Pollyanna talk, however, and Pollyanna talked, Pollyanna liked to talk—but she was never sure that she would not look up and find him lying back on his pillow with that white, hurt look that always pained her; and she was never sure which—if any—of her words had brought it there. As for telling him the "glad game," and trying to get him to play it—Pollyanna had never seen the time yet when she thought he would care to hear about it. She had twice tried to tell him; but neither time had she got beyond the beginning of what her father had said—John Pendleton had on each occasion turned the conversation abruptly to another subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna never doubted now that John Pendleton was her Aunt Polly's one-time lover; and with all the strength of her loving, loyal heart, she wished she could in some way bring happiness into their to her mind—miserably lonely lives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just how she was to do this, however, she could not see. She talked to Mr. Pendleton about her aunt; and he listened, sometimes politely, sometimes irritably, frequently with a quizzical smile on his usually stern lips. She talked to her aunt about Mr. Pendleton—or rather, she tried to talk to her about him. As a general thing, however, Miss Polly would not listen—long. She always found something else to talk about. She frequently did that, however, when Pollyanna was talking of others—of Dr. Chilton, for instance. Pollyanna laid this, though, to the fact that it had been Dr. Chilton who had seen her in the sun parlor with the rose in her hair and the lace shawl draped about her shoulders. Aunt Polly, indeed, seemed particularly bitter against Dr. Chilton, as Pollyanna found out one day when a hard cold shut her up in the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are not better by night I shall send for the doctor," Aunt Polly said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shall you? Then I'm going to be worse," gurgled Pollyanna. "I'd love to have Dr. Chilton come to see me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She wondered, then, at the look that came to her aunt's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It will not be Dr. Chilton, Pollyanna," Miss Polly said sternly. "Dr. Chilton is not our family physician. I shall send for Dr. Warren—if you are worse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna did not grow worse, however, and Dr. Warren was not summoned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'm so glad, too," Pollyanna said to her aunt that evening. "Of course I like Dr. Warren, and all that; but I like Dr. Chilton better, and I'm afraid he'd feel hurt if I didn't have him. You see, he wasn't really to blame, after all, that he happened to see you when I'd dressed you up so pretty that day, Aunt Polly," she finished wistfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That will do, Pollyanna. I really do not wish to discuss Dr. Chilton—or his feelings," reproved Miss Polly, decisively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked at her for a moment with mournfully interested eyes; then she sighed:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I just love to see you when your cheeks are pink like that, Aunt Polly; but I would so like to fix your hair. If—Why, Aunt Polly!" But her aunt was already out of sight down the hall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was toward the end of August that Pollyanna, making an early morning call on John Pendleton, found the flaming band of blue and gold and green edged with red and violet lying across his pillow. She stopped short in awed delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, it's a baby rainbow—a real rainbow come in to pay you a visit!" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together softly. "Oh—oh—oh, how pretty it is! But how did it get in?" she cried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man laughed a little grimly: John Pendleton was particularly out of sorts with the world this morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I suppose it `got in' through the bevelled edge of that glass thermometer in the window," he said wearily. "The sun shouldn't strike it at all but it does in the morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but it's so pretty, Mr. Pendleton! And does just the sun do that? My! if it was mine I'd have it hang in the sun all day long!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lots of good you'd get out of the thermometer, then," laughed the man. "How do you suppose you could tell how hot it was, or how cold it was, if the thermometer hung in the sun all day?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I shouldn't care," breathed Pollyanna, her fascinated eyes on the brilliant band of colors across the pillow. "Just as if anybody'd care when they were living all the time in a rainbow!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man laughed. He was watching Pollyanna's rapt face a little curiously. Suddenly a new thought came to him. He touched the bell at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nora," he said, when the elderly maid appeared at the door, "bring me one of the big brass candle-sticks from the mantel in the front drawing-room."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir," murmured the woman, looking slightly dazed. In a minute she had returned. A musical tinkling entered the room with her as she advanced wonderingly toward the bed. It came from the prism pendants encircling the old-fashioned candelabrum in her hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you. You may set it here on the stand," directed the man. "Now get a string and fasten it to the sash-curtain fixtures of that window there. Take down the sash-curtain, and let the string reach straight across the window from side to side. That will be all. Thank you," he said, when she had carried out his directions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As she left the room he turned smiling eyes toward the wondering Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bring me the candlestick now, please, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With both hands she brought it; and in a moment he was slipping off the pendants, one by one, until they lay, a round dozen of them, side by side, on the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, my dear, suppose you take them and hook them to that little string Nora fixed across the window. If you really want to live in a rainbow—I don't see but we'll have to have a rainbow for you to live in!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna had not hung up three of the pendants in the sunlit window before she saw a little of what was going to happen. She was so excited then she could scarcely control her shaking fingers enough to hang up the rest. But at last her task was finished, and she stepped back with a low cry of delight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It had become a fairyland—that sumptuous, but dreary bedroom. Everywhere were bits of dancing red and green, violet and orange, gold and blue. The wall, the floor, and the furniture, even to the bed itself, were aflame with shimmering bits of color.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, oh, oh, how lovely!" breathed Pollyanna; then she laughed suddenly. "I just reckon the sun himself is trying to play the game now, don't you?" she cried, forgetting for the moment that Mr. Pendleton could not know what she was talking about. "Oh, how I wish I had a lot of those things! How I would like to give them to Aunt Polly and Mrs. Snow and—lots of folks. I reckon then they'd be glad all right! Why, I think even Aunt Polly'd get so glad she couldn't help banging doors if she lived in a rainbow like that. Don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Pendleton laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, from my remembrance of your aunt, Miss Pollyanna, I must say I think it would take something more than a few prisms in the sunlight to—to make her bang many doors—for gladness. But come, now, really, what do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stared slightly; then she drew a long breath.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I forgot. You don't know about the game. I remember now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you tell me, then."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And this time Pollyanna told him. She told him the whole thing from the very first—from the crutches that should have been a doll. As she talked, she did not look at his face. Her rapt eyes were still on the dancing flecks of color from the prism pendants swaying in the sunlit window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that's all," she sighed, when she had finished. "And now you know why I said the sun was trying to play it—that game."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment there was silence. Then a low voice from the bed said unsteadily:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps; but I'm thinking that the very finest prism of them all is yourself, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but I don't show beautiful red and green and purple when the sun shines through me, Mr. Pendleton!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you?" smiled the man. And Pollyanna, looking into his face, wondered why there were tears in his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No," she said. Then, after a minute she added mournfully: "I'm afraid, Mr. Pendleton, the sun doesn't make anything but freckles out of me. Aunt Polly says it does make them!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man laughed a little; and again Pollyanna looked at him: the laugh had sounded almost like a sob.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIX WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POLLYANNA entered school in September. Preliminary examinations showed that she was well advanced for a girl of her years, and she was soon a happy member of a class of girls and boys her own age.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">School, in some ways, was a surprise to Pollyanna; and Pollyanna, certainly, in many ways, was very much of a surprise to school. They were soon on the best of terms, however, and to her aunt Pollyanna confessed that going to school was living, after all—though she had had her doubts before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of her delight in her new work, Pollyanna did not forget her old friends. True, she could not give them quite so much time now, of course; but she gave them what time she could. Perhaps John Pendleton, of them all, however, was the most dissatisfied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One Saturday afternoon he spoke to her about it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"See here, Pollyanna, how would you like to come and live with me? he asked, a little impatiently. "I don't see anything of you, nowadays."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed—Mr. Pendleton was such a funny man!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I thought you didn't like to have folks 'round," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He made a wry face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but that was before you taught me to play that wonderful game of yours. Now I'm glad to be waited on, hand and foot! Never mind, I'll be on my own two feet yet, one of these days; then I'll see who steps around," he finished, picking up one of the crutches at his side and shaking it playfully at the little girl. They were sitting in the great library to-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but you aren't really glad at all for things; you just say you are," pouted Pollyanna, her eyes on the dog, dozing before the fire. "You know you don't play the game right ever , Mr. Pendleton—you know you don't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man's face grew suddenly very grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's why I want you, little girl—to help me play it. Will you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna turned in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pendleton, you don't really mean—that?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I do. I want you. Will you come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked distressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, I can't—you know I can't. Why, I'm—Aunt Polly's!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A quick something crossed the man's face that Pollyanna could not quite understand. His head came up almost fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're no more hers than— Perhaps she would let you come to me," he finished more gently. "Would you come—if she did?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned in deep thought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But Aunt Polly has been so—good to me," she began slowly; "and she took me when I didn't have anybody left but the Ladies' Aid, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again that spasm of something crossed the man's face; but this time, when he spoke, his voice was low and very sad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, long years ago I loved somebody very much. I hoped to bring her, some day, to this house. I pictured how happy we'd be together in our home all the long years to come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," pitied Pollyanna, her eyes shining with sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But—well, I didn't bring her here. Never mind why. I just didn't that's all. And ever since then this great gray pile of stone has been a house—never a home. It takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence, to make a home, Pollyanna; and I have not had either. Now will you come, my dear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sprang to her feet. Her face was fairly illumined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pendleton, you—you mean that you wish you—you had had that woman's hand and heart all this time?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, y-yes, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad! Then it's all right," sighed the little girl. "Now you can take us both, and everything will be lovely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take—you—both?" repeated the man, dazedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A faint doubt crossed Pollyanna's countenance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of course, Aunt Polly isn't won over, yet; but I'm sure she will be if you tell it to her just as you did to me, and then we'd both come, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A look of actual terror leaped to the man's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly come— here !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's eyes widened a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you rather go there ?" she asked. Of course the house isn't quite so pretty, but it's nearer—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, what are you talking about?" asked the man, very gently now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, about where we're going to live, of course," rejoined Pollyanna, in obvious surprise. "I thought you meant here, at first. You said it was here that you had wanted Aunt Polly's hand and heart all these years to make a home, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">An inarticulate cry came from the man's throat. He raised his hand and began to speak; but the next moment he dropped his hand nervelessly at his side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The doctor, sir," said the maid in the doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna rose at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton turned to her feverishly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, for Heaven's sake, say nothing of what I asked you—yet," he begged, in a low voice. Pollyanna dimpled into a sunny smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not! Just as if I didn't know you'd rather tell her yourself!" she called back merrily over her shoulder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton fell limply back in his chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what's up?" demanded the doctor, a minute later, his fingers on his patient's galloping pulse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A whimsical smile trembled on John Pendleton's lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Overdose of your—tonic, I guess," he laughed, as he noted the doctor's eyes following Pollyanna's little figure down the driveway.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XX WHICH IS MORE SURPRISING</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUNDAY mornings Pollyanna usually attended church and Sunday school. Sunday afternoons she frequently went for a walk with Nancy. She had planned one for the day after her Saturday afternoon visit to Mr. John Pendleton; but on the way home from Sunday school Dr. Chilton overtook her in his gig, and brought his horse to a stop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you let me drive you home, Pollyanna," he suggested. "I want to speak to you a minute. I, was just driving out to your place to tell you," he went on, as Pollyanna settled herself at his side. "Mr. Pendleton sent a special request for you to go to see him this afternoon, sure . He says it's very important."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna nodded happily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, it is, I know. I'll go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor eyed her with some surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm not sure I shall let you, after all," he declared, his eyes twinkling. "You seemed more upsetting than soothing yesterday, young lady."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, it wasn't me, truly—not really, you know; not so much as it was Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor turned with a quick start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your—aunt!" he ejaculated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna gave a happy little bounce in her seat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. And it's so exciting and lovely, just like a story, you know. I—I'm going to tell you," she burst out, with sudden decision. He said not to mention it; but he wouldn't mind your knowing, of course. He meant not to mention it to her ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Her ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; Aunt Polly. And, of course he would want to tell her himself instead of having me do it—lovers, so!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lovers!" As the doctor said the word, the horse started violently, as if the hand that held the reins had given them a sharp jerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," nodded Pollyanna, happily. "That's the story-part, you see. I didn't know it till Nancy told me. She said Aunt Polly had a lover years ago, and they quarrelled. She didn't know who it was at first. But we've found out now. It's Mr. Pendleton, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor relaxed suddenly, The hand holding the reins fell limply to his lap.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! No; I—didn't know," he said quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna hurried on—they were nearing the Harrington homestead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; and I'm so glad now. It's come out lovely. Mr. Pendleton asked me to come and live with him, but of course I wouldn't leave Aunt Polly like that—after she'd been so good to me. Then he told me all about the woman's hand and heart that he used to want, and I found out that he wanted it now; and I was so glad! For of course if he wants to make up the quarrel, everything will be all right now, and Aunt Polly and I will both go to live there, or else he'll come to live with us. Of course Aunt Polly doesn't know yet, and we haven't got everything settled; so I suppose that is why he wanted to see me this afternoon, sure."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor sat suddenly erect. There was an odd smile on his lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; I can well imagine that Mr. John Pendleton does—want to see you, Pollyanna," he nodded, as he pulled his horse to a stop before the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's Aunt Polly now in the window," cried Pollyanna; then, a second later: "Why, no, she isn't—but I thought I saw her!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No; she isn't there—now," said the doctor, His lips had suddenly lost their smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna found a very nervous John Pendleton waiting for her that afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna," he began at once. "I've been trying all night to puzzle out what you meant by all that, yesterday—about my wanting your Aunt Polly's hand and heart here all those years. What did you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, because you were lovers, you know once; and I was so glad you still felt that way now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Lovers!—your Aunt Polly and I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the obvious surprise in the man's voice, Pollyanna opened wide her eyes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, Nancy said you were!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man gave a short little laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Indeed! Well, I'm afraid I shall have to say that Nancy—didn't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then you—weren't lovers? Pollyanna's Voice was tragic with dismay.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Never!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And it isn't all coming out like a book?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no answer. The man's eyes were moodily fixed out the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O dear! And it was all going so splendidly," almost sobbed Pollyanna. "I'd have been so glad to come—with Aunt Polly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you won't—now?" The man asked the question without turning his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course not! I'm Aunt Polly's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man turned now, almost fiercely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Before you were hers, Pollyanna, you were—your mother's. And—it was your mother's hand and heart that I wanted long years ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My mother's!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I had not meant to tell you, but perhaps it's better, after all, that I do—now." John Pendleton's face had grown very white. He was speaking with evident difficulty. Pollyanna, her eyes wide and frightened, and her lips parted, was gazing at him fixedly. "I loved your mother; but she—didn't love me. And after a time she went away with—your father. I did not know until then how much I did—care. The whole world suddenly seemed to turn black under my fingers, and—But, never mind. For long years I have been a cross, crabbed, unlovable, unloved old man—though I'm not nearly sixty, yet, Pollyanna. Then, One day, like one of the prisms that you love so well, little girl, you danced into my life, and flecked my dreary old world with dashes of the purple and gold and scarlet of your own bright cheeriness. I found out, after a time, who you were, and—and I thought then I never wanted to see you again. I didn't want to be reminded of—your mother. But—you know how that came out. I just had to have you come. And now I want you always. Pollyanna, won't you come now ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Mr. Pendleton, I— There's Aunt Polly!" Pollyanna's eyes were blurred with tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man made an impatient gesture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What about me? How do you suppose I'm going to be `glad' about anything—without you? Why, Pollyanna, it's only since you came that I've been even half glad to live! But if I had you for my own little girl, I'd be glad for—anything; and I'd try to make you glad, too, my dear. You shouldn't have a wish ungratified. All my money, to the last cent, should go to make you happy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked shocked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, as if I'd let you spend it on me—all that money you've saved for the heathen!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A dull red came to the man's face. He started to speak, but Pollyanna was still talking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Besides, anybody with such a lot of money as you have doesn't need me to make you glad about things. You're making other folks so glad giving them things that you just can't help being glad yourself! Why, look at those prisms you gave Mrs. Snow and me, and the gold piece you gave Nancy on her birthday, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes—never mind about all that," interrupted the man. His face was very, very red now—and no wonder, perhaps: it was not for "giving things" that John Pendleton had been best known in the past. "That's all nonsense. 'Twasn't much, anyhow—but what there was, was because of you. You gave those things; not I! Yes, you did," he repeated, in answer to the shocked denial in her face. "And that only goes to prove all the more how I need you, little girl," he added, his voice softening into tender pleading once more. "If ever, ever I am to play the `glad game,' Pollyanna, you'll have to come and play it with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The little girl's forehead puckered into a wistful frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly has been so good to me," she began; but the man interrupted her sharply. The old irritability had come back to his face. Impatience which would brook no opposition had been a part of John Pendleton's nature too long to yield very easily now to restraint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of course she's been good to you! But she doesn't want you, I'll warrant, half so much as I do," he contested.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Mr. Pendleton, she's glad, I know, to have—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad!" interrupted the man, thoroughly losing his patience now. "I'll wager Miss Polly doesn't know how to be glad—for anything! Oh, she does her duty, I know. She's a very dutiful woman. I've had experience with her `duty,' before. I'll acknowledge we haven't been the best of friends for the last fifteen or twenty years. But I know her. Every one knows her—and she isn't the `glad' kind, Pollyanna. She doesn't know how to be. As for your coming to me—you just ask her and see if she won't let you come. And, oh, little girl, little girl, I want you so!" he finished brokenly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna rose to her feet with a long sigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right. I'll ask her," she said wistfully. "Of course I don't mean that I wouldn't like to live here with you, Mr. Pendleton, but—" She did not complete her sentence. There was a moment's silence, then she added: "Well, anyhow, I'm glad I didn't tell her yesterday;—'cause then I supposed she was wanted, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton smiled grimly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, yes, Pollyanna; I guess it is just as well you didn't mention it—yesterday."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I didn't—only to the doctor; and of course he doesn't count."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The doctor!" cried John Pendleton, turning quickly. "Not—Dr.—Chilton?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; when he came to tell me you wanted to see me to-day, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, of all the—" muttered the man, falling back in his chair. Then he sat up with sudden interest. "And what did Dr. Chilton say?" he asked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I don't remember. Not much, I reckon. Oh, he did say he could well imagine you did want to see me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, did he, indeed!" answered John Pendleton. And Pollyanna wondered why he gave that sudden queer little laugh.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXI A QUESTION ANSWERED</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE sky was darkening fast with what appeared to be an approaching thunder shower when Pollyanna hurried down the hill from John Pendleton's house. Half-way home she met Nancy with an umbrella. By that time, however, the clouds had shifted their position and the shower was not so imminent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Guess it's goin' 'round ter the north," announced Nancy, eyeing the sky critically. I thought 'twas, all the time, but Miss Polly wanted me ter come with this. She was worried about ye!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was she?" murmured Pollyanna abstractedly, eyeing the clouds in her turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy sniffed a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't seem ter notice what I said," she observed aggrievedly. "I said yer aunt was worried about ye!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh," sighed Pollyanna, remembering suddenly the question she was so soon to ask her aunt. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'm glad," retorted Nancy, unexpectedly. "I am, I am."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna stared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad that Aunt Polly was scared about me! Why, Nancy, that isn't the way to play the game—to be glad for things like that!" she objected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There wa'n't no game in it," retorted Nancy. "Never thought of it. You don't seem ter sense what it means ter have Miss Polly worried about ye, child!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it means worried—and worried is horrid—to feel," maintained Pollyanna. "What else can it mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy tossed her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll tell ye what it means. It means she's at last gettin' down somewheres near human—like folks; an' that she ain't jest doin' her duty by ye all the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Nancy," demurred the scandalized Pollyanna, "Aunt Polly always does her duty. She—she's a very dutiful woman!" Unconsciously Pollyanna repeated John Pendleton's words of half an hour before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You're right she is—and she always was, I guess! But she's somethin' more, now, since you came."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's face changed. Her brows drew into a troubled frown.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, that's what I was going to ask you, Nancy," she sighed. "Do you think Aunt Polly likes to have me here? Would she mind—if if I wasn't here any more?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy threw a quick look into the little girl's absorbed face. She had expected to be asked this question long before, and she had dreaded it. She had wondered how she should answer it—how she could answer it honestly without cruelly hurting the questioner. But now, now , in the face of the new suspicions that had become convictions by the afternoon's umbrella-sending—Nancy only welcomed the question with open arms. She was sure that, with a clean conscience to-day, she could set the love-hungry little girl's heart at rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Likes ter have ye here? Would she miss ye if ye wa'n't here?" cried Nancy, indignantly. "As if that wa'n't jest what I was tellin' of ye! Didn't she send me posthaste with an umbrella 'cause she see a little cloud in the sky? Didn't she make me tote yer things all down-stairs, so you could have the pretty room you wanted? Why, Miss Pollyanna, when ye remember how at first she hated ter have—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a choking cough Nancy pulled herself up just in time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And it ain't jest things I can put my fingers on, neither," rushed on Nancy, breathlessly. "It's little ways she has, that shows how you've been softenin' her up an' mellerin' her down—the cat, and the dog, and the way she speaks ter me, and oh, lots o' things. Why, Miss Pollyanna, there ain't no tellin' how she'd miss ye—if ye wa'n't here," finished Nancy, speaking with an enthusiastic certainty that was meant to hide the perilous admission she had almost made before. Even then she was not quite prepared for the sudden joy that illumined Pollyanna's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Nancy, I'm so glad—glad—glad! You don't know how glad I am that Aunt Polly—wants me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if I'd leave her now!" thought Pollyanna, as she climbed the stairs to her room a little later. "I always knew I wanted to live with Aunt Polly—but I reckon maybe I didn't know quite how much I wanted Aunt Polly—to want to live with me !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The task of telling John Pendleton of her decision would not be an easy one, Pollyanna knew, and she dreaded it. She was very fond of John Pendleton, and she was very sorry for him—because he seemed to be so sorry for himself. She was sorry, too, for the long, lonely life that had made him so unhappy; and she was grieved that it had been because of her mother that he had spent those dreary years. She pictured the great gray house as it would be after its master was well again, with its silent rooms, its littered floors, its disordered desk; and her heart ached for his loneliness. She wished that somewhere, some one might be found who—And it was at this point that she sprang to her feet with a little cry of joy at the thought that had come to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as she could, after that, she hurried up the hill to John Pendleton's house; and in due time she found herself in the great dim library, with John Pendleton himself sitting near her, his long, thin hands lying idle on the arms of his chair, and his faithful little dog at his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, Pollyanna, is it to be the `glad game' with me, all the rest of my life?" asked the man, gently.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes," cried Pollyanna. "I've thought of the very gladdest kind of a thing for you to do, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With— you ?" asked John Pendleton, his mouth growing a little stern at the corners.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"N-no; but—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, you aren't going to say no!" interrupted a voice deep with emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I've got to, Mr. Pendleton; truly I have. Aunt Polly—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did she refuse —to let you—come?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I didn't ask her," stammered the little girl, miserably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna turned away her eyes. She could not meet the hurt, grieved gaze of her friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So you didn't even ask her!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't, sir—truly," faltered Pollyanna. "You see, I found out—without asking. Aunt Polly wants me with her, and—and I want to stay, too," she confessed bravely. "You don't know how good she's been to me; and—and I think, really, sometimes she's beginning to be glad about things—lots of things. And you know she never used to be. You said it yourself. Oh, Mr. Pendleton, I couldn't leave Aunt Polly—now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a long pause. Only the snapping of the wood fire in the grate broke the silence. At last, however, the man spoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Pollyanna; I see. You couldn't leave her—now," he said. "I won't ask you—again." The last word was so low it was almost inaudible; but Pollyanna heard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, but you don't know about the rest of it," she reminded him eagerly. "There's the very gladdest thing you can do—truly there is!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not for me, Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, for you. You said it. You said only a—a woman's hand and heart or a child's presence could make a home. And I can get it for you—a child's presence;—not me, you know, but another one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if I would have any but you!" resented an indignant voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But you will—when you know; you're so kind and good! Why, think of the prisms and the gold pieces, and all that money you save for the heathen, and—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!" interrupted the man, savagely. "Once for all let us end that nonsense! I've tried to tell you half a dozen times before. There is no money for the heathen. I never sent a penny to them in my life. There!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He lifted his chin and braced himself to meet what he expected—the grieved disappointment of Pollyanna's eyes. To his amazement, however, there was neither grief nor disappointment in Pollyanna's eyes. There was only surprised joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, oh!" she cried, clapping her hands. "I'm so glad! That is," she corrected, coloring distressfully, "I don't mean that I'm not sorry for the heathen, only just now I can't help being glad that you don't want the little India boys, because all the rest have wanted them. And so I'm glad you'd rather have Jimmy Bean. Now I know you'll take him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take— who ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jimmy Bean. He's the `child's presence,' you know; and he'll be so glad to be it. I had to tell him last week that even my Ladies' Aid out West wouldn't take him, and he was so disappointed. But now—when he hears of this—he'll be so glad!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will he? Well, I won't," ejaculated the man, decisively. "Pollyanna, this is sheer nonsense!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't mean—you won't take him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I certainly do mean just that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But he'd be a lovely child's presence," faltered Pollyanna. She was almost crying now. "And you couldn't be lonesome—with Jimmy 'round."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't doubt it," rejoined the man; "but—I think I prefer the lonesomeness."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was then that Pollyanna, for the first time in weeks, suddenly remembered something Nancy had once told her. She raised her chin aggrievedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you think a nice live little boy wouldn't be better than that old dead skeleton you keep somewhere; but I think it would!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Skeleton ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Nancy said you had one in your closet, somewhere."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, what—" Suddenly the man threw back his head and laughed. He laughed very heartily indeed—so heartily that Pollyanna began to cry from pure nervousness. When he saw that, John Pendleton sat erect very promptly. His face grew grave at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, I suspect you are right—more right than you know," he said gently. "In fact, I know that a `nice live little boy' would be far better than—my skeleton in the closet; only—we aren't always willing to make the exchange. We are apt to still cling to—our skeletons, Pollyanna. However, suppose you tell me a little more about this nice little boy." And Pollyanna told him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps the laugh cleared the air; or perhaps the pathos of Jimmy Bean's story as told by Pollyanna's eager little lips touched a heart already strangely softened. At all events, when Pollyanna went home that night she carried with her an invitation for Jimmy Bean himself to call at the great house with Pollyanna the next Saturday afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And I'm so glad, and I'm sure you'll like him," sighed Pollyanna, as she said good-by. "I do so want Jimmy Bean to have a home—and folks that care, you know."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXII SERMONS AND WOODBOXES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON the afternoon that Pollyanna told John Pendleton of Jimmy Bean, the Rev. Paul Ford climbed the hill and entered the Pendleton Woods, hoping that the hushed beauty of God's out-of-doors would still the tumult that His children of men had wrought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Rev. Paul Ford was sick at heart. Month by month, for a year past, conditions in the parish under him had been growing worse and worse; until it seemed that now, turn which way he would, he encountered only wrangling, backbiting, scandal, and jealousy. He had argued, pleaded, rebuked, and ignored by turns; and always and through all he had prayed—earnestly, hopefully. But to-day miserably he was forced to own that matters were no better, but rather worse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two of his deacons were at swords' points over a silly something that only endless brooding had made of any account. Three of his most energetic women workers had withdrawn from the Ladies' Aid Society because a tiny spark of gossip had been fanned by wagging tongues into a devouring flame of scandal. The choir had split over the amount of solo work given to a fanciedly preferred singer. Even the Christian Endeavor Society was in a ferment of unrest owing to open criticism of two of its officers. As to the Sunday school—it had been the resignation of its superintendent and two of its teachers that had been the last straw, and that had sent the harassed minister to the quiet woods for prayer and meditation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under the green arch of the trees the Rev. Paul Ford faced the thing squarely. To his mind, the crisis had come. Something must be done—and done at once. The entire work of the church was at a standstill. The Sunday services, the week-day prayer meeting, the missionary teas, even the suppers and socials were becoming less and less well attended. True, a few conscientious workers were still left. But they pulled at cross purposes, usually; and always they showed themselves to be acutely aware of the critical eyes all about them, and of the tongues that had nothing to do but to talk about what the eyes saw.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And because of all this, the Rev. Paul Ford understood very well that he (God's minister), the church, the town, and even Christianity itself was suffering; and must suffer still more unless—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Clearly something must be done, and done at once. But what?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly the minister took from his pocket the notes he had made for his next Sunday's sermon. Frowningly he looked at them. His mouth settled into stern lines, as aloud, very impressively, he read the verses on which he had determined to speak:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was a bitter denunciation. In the green aisles of the woods, the minister's deep voice rang out with scathing effect. Even the birds and squirrels seemed hushed into awed silence. It brought to the minister a vivid realization of how those words would sound the next Sunday when he should utter them before his people in the sacred hush of the church.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">His people!—they were his people. Could he do it? Dare he do it? Dare he not do it? It was a fearful denunciation, even without the words that would follow—his own words. He had prayed and prayed. He had pleaded earnestly for help, for guidance. He longed—oh, how earnestly he longed!—to take now, in this crisis, the right step. But was this—the right step?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slowly the minister folded the papers and thrust them back into his pocket. Then, with a sigh that was almost a moan, he flung himself down at the foot of a tree, and covered his face with his hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was there that Pollyanna, on her way home from the Pendleton house, found him. With a little cry she ran forward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, oh, Mr. Ford! You— you haven't broken your leg or—or anything, have you?" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The minister dropped his hands, and looked up quickly. He tried to smile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, dear—no, indeed! I'm just—resting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh," sighed Pollyanna, falling back a little. "That's all right, then. You see, Mr. Pendleton had broken his leg when I found him—but he was lying down, though. And you are sitting up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I am sitting up; and I haven't broken anything—that doctors can mend."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The last words were very low, but Pollyanna heard them. A swift change crossed her face. Her eyes glowed with tender sympathy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know what you mean—something plagues you. Father used to feel like that, lots of times. I reckon ministers do—most generally. You see there's such a lot depends on 'em, somehow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Rev. Paul Ford turned a little wonderingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was your father a minister, Pollyanna?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. Didn't you know? I supposed everybody knew that. He married Aunt Polly's sister, and she was my mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I understand. But, you see, I haven't been here many years, so I don't know all the family histories."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir—I mean, no, sir," smiled Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a long pause. The minister, still sitting at the foot of the tree, appeared to have forgotten Pollyanna's presence. He had pulled some papers from his pocket and unfolded them; but he was not looking at them. He was gazing, instead, at a leaf on the ground a little distance away—and it was not even a pretty leaf. It was brown and dead. Pollyanna, looking at him, felt vaguely sorry for him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It—it's a nice day," she began hopefully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment there was no answer; then the minister looked up with a start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What? Oh!—yes, it is a very nice day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And 'tisn't cold at all, either, even if 'tis October," observed Pollyanna, still more hopefully. "Mr. Pendleton had a fire, but he said he didn't need it. It was just to look at. I like to look at fires, don't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was no reply this time, though Pollyanna waited patiently, before she tried again—by a new route.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do You like being a minister?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Rev. Paul Ford looked up now, very quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do I like—Why, what an odd question! Why do you ask that, my dear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing—only the way you looked. It made me think of my father. He used to look like that—sometimes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he?" The minister's voice was polite, but his eyes had gone back to the dried leaf on the ground.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and I used to ask him just as I did you if he was glad he was a minister."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man under the tree smiled a little sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well—what did he say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, he always said he was, of course, but 'most always he said, too, that he wouldn't stay a minister a minute if 'twasn't for the rejoicing texts."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The— what ?" The Rev. Paul Ford's eyes left the leaf and gazed wonderingly into Pollyanna's merry little face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, that's what father used to call 'em," she laughed. "Of course the Bible didn't name 'em that. But it's all those that begin `Be glad in the Lord,' or `Rejoice greatly,' or `Shout for joy,' and all that, you know—such a lot of 'em. Once, when father felt specially bad, he counted 'em. There were eight hundred of 'em."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eight hundred!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—that told you to rejoice and be glad, you know; that's why father named 'em the `rejoicing texts.'"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh!" There was an odd look on the minister's face. His eyes had fallen to the words on the top paper in his hands—"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" "And so your father—liked those `rejoicing texts,'" he murmured.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes," nodded Pollyanna, emphatically. "He said he felt better right away, that first day he thought to count 'em. He said if God took the trouble to tell us eight hundred times to be glad and rejoice, He must want us to do it— some . And father felt ashamed that he hadn't done it more. After that, they got to be such a comfort to him, you know, when things went wrong; when the Ladies' Aiders got to fight—I mean, when they didn't agree about something," corrected Pollyanna, hastily. "Why, it was those texts, too, father said, that made him think of the game—he began with me on the crutches—but he said 'twas the rejoicing texts that started him on it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And what game might that be?" asked the minister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"About finding something in everything to be glad about, you know. As I said, he began with me on the crutches." And once more Pollyanna told her story—this time to a man who listened with tender eyes and understanding ears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later Pollyanna and the minister descended the hill, hand in hand. Pollyanna's face was radiant. Pollyanna loved to talk, and she had been talking now for some time: there seemed to be so many, many things about the game, her father, and the old home life that the minister wanted to know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the foot of the hill their ways parted, and Pollyanna down one road, and the minister down another, walked on alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the Rev. Paul Ford's study that evening the minister sat thinking. Near him on the desk lay a few loose sheets of paper—his sermon notes. Under the suspended pencil in his fingers lay other sheets of paper, blank—his sermon to be. But the minister was not thinking either of what he had written, or of what be intended to write. In his imagination he was far away in a little Western town with a missionary minister who was poor, sick, worried, and almost alone in the world—but who was poring over the Bible to find how many times his Lord and Master had told him to "rejoice and be glad."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a time, with a long sigh, the Rev. Paul Ford roused himself, came back from the far Western town, and adjusted the sheets of paper under his hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Matthew twenty-third; 13—14 and 23," he wrote; then, with a gesture of impatience, he dropped his pencil and pulled toward him a magazine left on the desk by his wife a few minutes before. Listlessly his tired eyes turned from paragraph to paragraph until these words arrested them:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A father one day said to his son, Tom, who, he knew, had refused to fill his mother's woodbox that morning: `Tom, I'm sure you'll be glad to go and bring in some wood for your mother.' And without a word Tom went. Why? Just because his father showed so plainly that he expected him to do the right thing. Suppose he had said: `Tom, I overheard what you said to your mother this morning, and I'm ashamed of you. Go at once and fill that woodbox!' I'll warrant that woodbox, would be empty yet, so far as Tom was concerned!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On and on read the minister—a word here, a line there, a paragraph somewhere else:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What men and women need is encouragement. Their natural resisting powers should be strengthened, not weakened. . . . Instead of always harping on a man's faults, tell him of his virtues. Try to pull him out of his rut of bad habits. Hold up to him his better self, his real self that can dare and do and win out! . . . The influence of a beautiful, helpful, hopeful character is contagious, and may revolutionize a whole town. . . . People radiate what is in their minds and in their hearts. If a man feels kindly and obliging, his neighbors will feel that way, too, before long. But if he scolds and scowls and criticizes—his neighbors will return scowl for scowl, and add interest! . . . When you look for the bad, expecting it, you will get it. When you know you will find the good—you will get that. . . . Tell your son Tom you know he'll be glad to fill that woodbox—then watch him start, alert and interested!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The minister dropped the paper and lifted his chin. In a moment he was on his feet, tramping the narrow room back and forth, back and forth. Later, some time later, he drew a long breath, and dropped himself in the chair at his desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"God helping me, I'll do it!" he cried softly. "I'll tell all my Toms I know they'll be glad to fill that woodbox! I'll give them work to do, and I'll make them so full of the very joy of doing it that they won't have time to look at their neighbors' woodboxes!" And he picked up his sermon notes, tore straight through the sheets, and cast them from him, so that on one side of his chair lay "But woe unto you," and on the other, "scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" while across the smooth white paper before him his pencil fairly flew—after first drawing one black line through Matthew twenty-third; 13—14 and 23."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus it happened that the Rev. Paul Ford's sermon the next Sunday was a veritable bugle-call to the best that was in every man and woman and child that heard it; and its text was one of Pollyanna's shining eight hundred:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, ye righteous, and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIII AN ACCIDENT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AT Mrs. Snow's request, Pollyanna went one day to Dr. Chilton's office to get the name of a medicine which Mrs. Snow had forgotten. As it chanced, Pollyanna had never before seen the inside of Dr. Chilton's office.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I've never been to your home before! This is your home, isn't it?" she said, looking interestedly about her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor smiled a little sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—such as 'tis," he answered, as he wrote something on the pad of paper in his hand; "but it's a pretty poor apology for a home, Pollyanna. They're just rooms, that's all—not a home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna nodded her head wisely. Her eyes glowed with sympathetic understanding.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know. It takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence to make a home," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh?" The doctor wheeled about abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pendleton told me," nodded Pollyanna, again; "about the woman's hand and heart, or the child's presence, you know. Why don't you get a woman's hand and heart, Dr. Chilton? Or maybe you'd take Jimmy Bean—if Mr. Pendleton doesn't want him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Chilton laughed a little constrainedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So Mr. Pendleton says it takes a woman's hand and heart to make a home, does he?" he asked evasively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. He says his is just a house, too. Why don't you, Dr. Chilton?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why don't I—what?" The doctor had turned back to his desk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Get a woman's hand and heart. Oh—and I forgot." Pollyanna's face showed suddenly a painful color. "I suppose I ought to tell you. It wasn't Aunt Polly that Mr. Pendleton loved long ago; and so we—we aren't going there to live. You see, I told you it was—but I made a mistake. I hope you didn't tell any one," she finished anxiously.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No—I didn't tell any one, Pollyanna," replied the doctor, a little queerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that's all right, then," sighed Pollyanna in relief. "You see you're the only one I told, and I thought Mr. Pendleton looked sort of funny when I said I'd told you ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did he?" The doctor's lips twitched.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. And of course he wouldn't want many people to know it—when 'twasn't true. But why don't you get a woman's hand and heart, Dr. Chilton?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a moment's silence; then very gravely the doctor said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They're not always to be had—for the asking, little girl."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I should think you could get 'em," she argued. The flattering emphasis was unmistakable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," laughed the doctor, with uplifted eyebrows. Then, gravely again: "I'm afraid some of your older sisters would not be quite so—confident. At least, they—they haven't shown themselves to be so—obliging," he observed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna frowned again. Then her eyes widened in surprise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Dr. Chilton, you don't mean—you didn't try to get somebody's hand and heart once, like Mr. Pendleton, and—and couldn't, did you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor got to his feet a little abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, Pollyanna, never mind about that now. Don't let other people's troubles worry your little head. Suppose you run back now to Mrs. Snow. I've written down the name of the medicine, and the directions how she is to take it. Was there anything else?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, Sir; thank you, Sir," she murmured soberly, as she turned toward the door. From the little hallway she called back, her face suddenly alight: "Anyhow, I'm glad 'twasn't my mother's hand and heart that you wanted and couldn't get, Dr. Chilton. Good-by!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was on the last day of October that the accident occurred. Pollyanna, hurrying home from school, crossed the road at an apparently safe distance in front of a swiftly approaching motor car.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just what happened, no one could seem to tell afterward. Neither was there any one found who could tell why it happened or who was to blame that it did happen. Pollyanna, however, at five o'clock, was borne, limp and unconscious, into the little room that was so dear to her. There, by a white-faced Aunt Polly and a weeping Nancy she was undressed tenderly and put to bed, while from the village, hastily summoned by telephone, Dr. Warren was hurrying as fast as another motor car could bring him. "BORNE, LIMP AND UNCONSCIOUS, INTO THE LITTLE ROOM THAT WAS SO DEAR TO HER." Illustration of a man carrying Pollyanna into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And ye didn't need ter more'n look at her aunt's face," Nancy was sobbing to Old Tom in the garden, after the doctor had arrived and was closeted in the hushed room; "ye didn't need ter more'n look at her aunt's face ter see that 'twa'n't no duty that was eatin' her. Yer hands don't shake, and yer eyes don't look as if ye was tryin' ter hold back the Angel o' Death himself, when you're jest doin' yer duty , Mr. Tom they don't, they don't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is she hurt—bad?" The old man's voice shook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There ain't no tellin'," sobbed Nancy. "She lay back that white an' still she might easy be dead; but Miss Polly said she wa'n't dead—an' Miss Polly had oughter know, if any one would—she kept up such a listenin' an' a feelin' for her heartbeats an' her breath!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Couldn't ye tell anythin' what it done to her?—that—that—" Old Tom's face worked convulsively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy's lips relaxed a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish ye would call it somethin', Mr. Tom an' somethin' good an' strong, too. Drat it! Ter think of its runnin' down our little girl! I always hated the evil-smellin' things, anyhow—I did, I did!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But where is she hurt?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, I don't know," moaned Nancy. There's a little cut on her blessed head, but 'tain't bad—that ain't—Miss Polly says. She says she's afraid it's infernally she's hurt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A faint flicker came into Old Tom's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you mean internally, Nancy," he said dryly. "She's hurt infernally, all right—plague take that autymobile!—but I don't guess Miss Polly'd be usin' that word, all the same."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh? Well, I don't know, I don't know," moaned Nancy, with a shake of her head as she turned away. "Seems as if I jest couldn't stand it till that doctor gits out o' there. I wish I had a washin' ter do—the biggest washin' I ever see, I do, I do!" she wailed, wringing her hands helplessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even after the doctor was gone, however, there seemed to be little that Nancy could tell Mr. Tom. There appeared to be no bones broken, and the cut was of slight consequence; but the doctor had looked very grave, had shaken his head slowly, and had said that time alone could tell. After he had gone, Miss Polly had shown a face even whiter and more drawn looking than before. The patient had not fully recovered consciousness, but at present she seemed to be resting as comfortably as could be expected. A trained nurse had been sent for, and would come that night. That was all. And Nancy turned sobbingly, and went back to her kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was sometime during the next forenoon that Pollyanna opened conscious eyes and realized where she was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, what's the matter? Isn't it daytime? Why don't I get up?" she cried. "Why, Aunt Polly, I can't get up," she moaned, falling back on the pillow, after an ineffectual attempt to lift herself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, dear, I wouldn't try—just yet," soothed her aunt quickly, but very quietly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But what is the matter? Why can't I get up?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly's eyes asked an agonized question of the white-capped young woman standing in the window, out of the range of Pollyanna's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The young woman nodded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tell her," the lips said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly cleared her throat, and tried to swallow the lump that would scarcely let her speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You were hurt, dear, by the automobile last night. But never mind that now. Auntie wants you to rest and go to sleep again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hurt? Oh, yes; I—I ran." Pollyanna's eyes were dazed. She lifted her hand to her forehead. "Why, it's—done up, and it—hurts!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear; but never mind. Just—just rest."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Aunt Polly, I feel so funny, and so bad! My legs feel so—so queer—only they don't feel —at all!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With an imploring look into the nurse's face, Miss Polly struggled to her feet, and turned away. The nurse came forward quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you let me talk to you now," she began cheerily. "I'm sure I think it's high time we were getting acquainted, and I'm going to introduce myself. I am Miss Hunt, and I've come to help your aunt take care of you. And the very first thing I'm going to do is to ask you to swallow these little white pills for me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's eyes grew a bit wild.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I don't want to be taken care of—that is, not for long! I want to get up. You know I go to school. Can't I go to school to-morrow?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From the window where Aunt Polly stood now there came a half-stifled cry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To-morrow?" smiled the nurse, brightly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, I may not let you out quite so soon as that, Miss Pollyanna. But just swallow these little pills for me, please, and we'll see what they'll do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right," agreed Pollyanna, somewhat doubtfully; "but I must go to school day after to-morrow—there are examinations then, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She spoke again, a minute later. She spoke of school, and of the automobile, and of how her head ached; but very soon her voice trailed into silence under the blessed influence of the little white pills she had swallowed.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIV JOHN PENDLETON</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POLLYANNA did not go to school "to-morrow," nor the "day after to-morrow." Pollyanna, however, did not realize this, except momentarily when a brief period of full consciousness sent insistent questions to her lips. Pollyanna did not realize anything, in fact, very clearly until a week had passed; then the fever subsided, the pain lessened somewhat, and her mind awoke to full consciousness. She had then to be told all over again what had occurred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And so it's hurt that I am, and not sick," she sighed at last. "Well, I'm glad of that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"G-glad, Pollyanna?" asked her aunt, who was sitting by the bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I'd so much rather have broken legs like Mr. Pendleton's than life-long-invalids like Mrs. Snow, you know. Broken legs get well, and life-long-invalids don't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly—who had said nothing whatever about broken legs—got suddenly to her feet and walked to the little dressing table across the room. She was picking up one object after another now, and putting each down, in an aimless fashion quite unlike her usual decisiveness. Her face was not aimless-looking at all, however; it was white and drawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the bed Pollyanna lay blinking at the dancing band of colors on the ceiling, which came from one of the prisms in the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm glad it isn't smallpox that ails me, too," she murmured contentedly. "That would be worse than freckles. And I'm glad 'tisn't whooping cough—I've had that, and it's horrid—and I'm glad 'tisn't appendicitis nor measles, 'cause they're catching—measles are, I mean—and they wouldn't let you stay here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You seem to—to be glad for a good many things, my dear," faltered Aunt Polly, putting her hand to her throat as if her collar bound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am. I've been thinking of 'em—lots of 'em—all the time I've been looking up at that rainbow. I love rainbows. I'm so glad Mr. Pendleton gave me those prisms! I'm glad of some things I haven't said yet. I don't know but I'm 'most glad I was hurt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna laughed softly again. She turned luminous eyes on her aunt. "Well, you see, since I have been hurt, you've called me `dear' lots of times—and you didn't before. I love to be called `dear'—by folks that belong to you, I mean. Some of the Ladies' Aiders did call me that; and of course that was pretty nice, but not so nice as if they had belonged to me, like you do. Oh, Aunt Polly, I'm so glad you belong to me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly did not answer. Her hand was at her throat again. Her eyes were full of tears. She had turned away and was hurrying from the room through the door by which the nurse had just entered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was that afternoon that Nancy ran out to Old Tom, who was cleaning harnesses in the barn. Her eyes were wild.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Tom, Mr. Tom. guess what's happened," she panted. "You couldn't guess in a thousand years—you couldn't, you couldn't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I cal'late I won't try," retorted the man, grimly, "specially as I hain't got more'n ten ter live, anyhow, probably. You'd better tell me first off, Nancy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, listen, then. Who do you s'pose is in the parlor now with the mistress? Who, I say?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's no tellin'," he declared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, there is. I'm tellin'. It's—John Pendleton!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sho, now! You're jokin', girl."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not much I am—an' me a-lettin' him in myself—crutches an' all! An' the team he come in a-waitin' this minute at the door for him, jest as if he wa'n't the cranky old crosspatch he is, what never talks ter no one! jest think, Mr. Tom— him a-callin' on her!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, why not?" demanded the old man, a little aggressively.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy gave him a scornful glance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As if you didn't know better'n me!" she derided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Eh?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, you needn't be so innercent," she retorted with mock indignation; "—you what led me wildgoose chasin' in the first place!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do ye mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy glanced through the open barn door toward the house, and came a step nearer to the old man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Listen! 'Twas you that was tellin' me Miss Polly had a lover in the first place, wa'n't it? Well, one day I thinks I finds two and two, and I puts 'em tergether an' makes four. But it turns out ter be five—an' no four at all, at all!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a gesture of indifference Old Tom turned and fell to work.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you're goin' ter talk ter me, you've got ter talk plain horse sense," he declared testily. "I never was no hand for figgers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it's this," she explained. "I heard somethin' that made me think him an' Miss Polly was lovers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Pendleton!" Old Tom straightened up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. Oh, I know now; he wasn't. It was that blessed child's mother he was in love with, and that's why he wanted—but never mind that part," she added hastily, remembering just in time her promise to Pollyanna not to tell that Mr. Pendleton had wished her to come and live with him. "Well, I've been askin' folks about him some, since, and I've found out that him an' Miss Polly hain't been friends for years, an' that she's been hatin' him like pizen owin' ter the silly gossip that coupled their names tergether when she was eighteen or twenty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I remember," nodded Old Tom. "It was three or four years after Miss Jennie give him the mitten and went off with the other chap. Miss Polly knew about it, of course, and was sorry for him. So she tried ter be nice to him. Maybe she overdid it a little—she hated that minister chap so who had took off her sister. At any rate, somebody begun ter make trouble. They said she was runnin' after him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Runnin' after any man—her!" interjected Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it; but they did," declared Old Tom, "and of course no gal of any spunk'll stand that. Then about that time come her own lover an' the trouble with him . After that she shut up like an oyster an' wouldn't have nothin' ter do with nobody fur a spell. Her heart jest seemed to turn bitter at the core."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I know. I've heard about that now," rejoined Nancy; "an' that's why you could 'a' knocked me down with a feather when I see him at the door—him, what she hain't spoke to for years! But I let him in an' went an' told her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did she say?" Old Tom held his breath suspended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin'—at first. She was so still I thought she hadn't heard; and I was jest goin' ter say it over when she speaks up quiet like: `Tell Mr. Pendleton I will be down at once.' An' I come an' told him. Then I come out here an' told you," finished Nancy, casting another backward glance toward the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Humph!" grunted Old Tom; and fell to work again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the ceremonious "parlor" of the Harrington homestead, Mr. John Pendleton did not have to wait long before a swift step warned him of Miss Polly's coming. As he attempted to rise, she made a gesture of remonstrance. She did not offer her hand, however, and her face was coldly reserved.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I called to ask for—Pollyanna," he began at once, a little brusquely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you. She is about the same," said Miss Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And that is—won't you tell me how she is? His voice was not quite steady this time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A quick spasm of pain crossed the woman's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't, I wish I could!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You mean—you don't know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But—the doctor?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Warren himself seems—at sea. He is in correspondence now with a New York specialist. They have arranged for a consultation at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But—but what were her injuries that you do know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A slight cut on the head, one or two bruises, and—and an injury to the spine which has seemed to cause—paralysis from the hips down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A low cry came from the man. There was a brief silence; then, huskily, he asked:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And Pollyanna—how does she—take it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She doesn't understand—at all—how things really are. And I can't tell her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But she must know—something!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly lifted her hand to the collar at her throat in the gesture that had become so common to her of late.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. She knows she can't—move; but she thinks her legs are—broken. She says she's glad it's broken legs like yours rather than `life-long-invalids' like Mrs. Snow's; because broken legs get well, and the other—doesn't. She talks like that all the time, until it—it seems as if I should—die!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Through the blur of tears in his own eyes, the man saw the drawn face opposite, twisted with emotion. Involuntarily his thoughts went back to what Pollyanna had said when he had made his final plea for her presence: "Oh, I couldn't leave Aunt Polly—now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was this thought that made him ask very gently, as soon as he could control his voice:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wonder if you know, Miss Harrington, how hard I tried to get Pollyanna to come and live with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With you !—Pollyanna!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man winced a little at the tone of her voice; but his own voice was still impersonally cool when he spoke again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I wanted to adopt her—legally, you understand; making her my heir, of course."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman in the opposite chair relaxed a little. It came to her, suddenly, what a brilliant future it would have meant for Pollyanna—this adoption; and she wondered if Pollyanna were old enough and mercenary enough—to be tempted by this man's money and position.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very fond of Pollyanna," the man was continuing. "I am fond of her both for her own sake, and for—her mother's. I stood ready to give Pollyanna the love that had been twenty-five years in storage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Love ." Miss Polly remembered suddenly why she had taken this child in the first place—and with the recollection came the remembrance of Pollyanna's own words uttered that very morning: "I love to be called `dear' by folks that belong to you!" And it was this love-hungry little girl that had been offered the stored-up affection of twenty-five years:—and she was old enough to be tempted by love! With a sinking heart Miss Polly realized that. With a sinking heart, too, she realized something else: the dreariness of her own future now without Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?" she said. And the man, recognizing the self-control that vibrated through the harshness of the tone, smiled sadly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She would not come," he answered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She would not leave you. She said you had been so good to her. She wanted to stay with you—and she said she thought you wanted her to stay," he finished, as he pulled himself to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He did not look toward Miss Polly. He turned his face resolutely toward the door. But instantly he heard a swift step at his side, and found a shaking hand thrust toward him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When the specialist comes, and I know anything—definite about Pollyanna, I will let you hear from me," said a trembling voice. "Good-by—and thank you for coming. Pollyanna will be pleased."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXV A WAITING GAME</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON the day after John Pendleton's call at the Harrington homestead, Miss Polly set herself to the task of preparing Pollyanna for the visit of the specialist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, my dear," she began gently, "we have decided that we want another doctor besides Dr. Warren to see you. Another one might tell us something new to do—to help you get well faster, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A joyous light came to Pollyanna's face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton! Oh, Aunt Polly, I'd so love to have Dr. Chilton! I've wanted him all the time, but I was afraid you didn't, on account of his seeing you in the sun parlor that day, you know; so I didn't like to say anything. But I'm so glad you do want him!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly's face had turned white, then red, then back to white again. But when she answered, she showed very plainly that she was trying to speak lightly and cheerfully.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, dear! It wasn't Dr. Chilton at all that I meant. It is a new doctor—a very famous doctor from New York, who—who knows a great deal about—about hurts like yours."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's face fell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't believe he knows half so much as Dr, Chilton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, he does, I'm sure, dear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it was Dr. Chilton who doctored Mr. Pendleton's broken leg, Aunt Polly. If—if you don't mind very much, I would like to have Dr. Chilton—truly I would!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A distressed color suffused Miss Polly's face. For a moment she did not speak at all; then she said gently—though yet with a touch of her old stern decisiveness:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I do mind, Pollyanna. I mind very much. I would do anything—almost anything for you, my dear; but I—for reasons which I do not care to speak of now, I don't wish Dr. Chilton called in on—on this case. And believe me, he can not know so much about—about your trouble, as this great doctor does, who will come from New York to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna still looked unconvinced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Aunt Polly, if you loved Dr. Chilton—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What , Pollyanna?" Aunt Polly's voice was very sharp now. Her cheeks were very red, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I say, if you loved Dr. Chilton, and didn't love the other one," sighed Pollyanna, "seems to me that would make some difference in the good he would do; and I love Dr. Chilton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nurse entered the room at that moment, and Aunt Polly rose to her feet abruptly, a look of relief on her face.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very sorry, Pollyanna," she said, a little stiffly; "but I'm afraid you'll have to let me be the judge, this time. Besides, it's already arranged. The New York doctor is coming to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As it happened, however, the New York doctor did not come "to-morrow." At the last moment a telegram told of an unavoidable delay owing to the sudden illness of the specialist himself. This led Pollyanna into a renewed pleading for the substitution of Dr. Chilton—"which would be so easy now, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But as before, Aunt Polly shook her head and said "no, dear," very decisively, yet with a still more anxious assurance that she would do anything —anything but that—to please her dear Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As the days of waiting passed, one by one, it did indeed, seem that Aunt Polly was doing everything (but that) that she could do to please her niece.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wouldn't 'a' believed it—you couldn't 'a' made me believe it," Nancy said to Old Tom one morning. "There don't seem ter be a minute in the day that Miss Polly ain't jest hangin' 'round waitin' ter do somethin' for that blessed lamb if 'tain't more than ter let in the cat—an' her what wouldn't let Fluff nor Buff up-stairs for love nor money a week ago; an' now she lets 'em tumble all over the bed jest 'cause it pleases Miss Pollyanna!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An' when she ain't doin' nothin' else, she's movin' them little glass danglers 'round ter diff'rent winders in the room so the sun'll make the `rainbows dance,' as that blessed child calls it. She's sent Timothy down ter Cobb's greenhouse three times for fresh flowers—an' that besides all the posies fetched in ter her, too. An' the other day, if I didn't find her sittin' 'fore the bed with the nurse actually doin' her hair, an' Miss Pollyanna lookin' on an' bossin' from the bed, her eyes all shinin' an' happy. An' I declare ter goodness, if Miss Polly hain't wore her hair like that every day now—jest ter please that blessed child!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, it strikes me Miss Polly herself ain't lookin' none the worse—for wearin' them 'ere curls 'round her forehead," he observed dryly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Course she ain't," retorted Nancy, indignantly. "She looks like folks , now. She's actually almost—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keerful, now, Nancy!" interrupted the old man, with a slow grin. "You know what you said when I told ye she was handsome once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy shrugged her shoulders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, she ain't handsome, of course; but I will own up she don't look like the same woman, what with the ribbons an' lace jiggers Miss Pollyanna makes her wear 'round her neck."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I told ye so," nodded the man. "I told ye she wa'n't—old."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll own up she hain't got quite so good an imitation of it—as she did have, 'fore Miss Pollyanna come. Say, Mr. Tom, who was her lover? I hain't found that out, yet; I hain't, I hain't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Hain't ye?" asked the old man, with an odd look on his face. "Well, I guess ye won't then from me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mr. Tom, come on, now," wheedled the girl. "Ye see, there ain't many folks here that I can ask."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe not. But there's one, anyhow, that ain't answerin'," grinned Old Tom. Then, abruptly, the light died from his eyes. "How is she, ter-day—the little gal?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy shook her head. Her face, too, had sobered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just the same, Mr. Tom. There ain't no special diff'rence, as I can see—or anybody, I guess. She jest lays there an' sleeps an' talks some, an' tries ter smile an' be `glad' 'cause the sun sets or the moon rises, or some other such thing, till it's enough ter make yer heart break with achin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know; it's the `game'—bless her sweet heart!" nodded Old Tom, blinking a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She told you , then, too, about that 'ere—game?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. She told me long ago." The old man hesitated, then went on, his lips twitching a little. "I was growlin' one day 'cause I was so bent up and crooked; an' what do ye s'pose the little thing said?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't guess. I wouldn't think she could find anythin ' about that ter be glad about!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She did. She said I could be glad, anyhow, that I didn't have ter stoop so far ter do my weedin ' 'cause I was already bent part way over."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy gave a wistful laugh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I ain't surprised, after all. You might know she'd find somethin'. We've been playin' it—that game—since almost the first, 'cause there wa'n't no one else she could play it with—though she did speak of—her aunt."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Polly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy chuckled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I guess you hain't got such an awful diff'rent opinion o' the mistress than I have," she bridled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Old Tom stiffened.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was only thinkin' 'twould be—some of a surprise—to her," he explained with dignity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, yes, I guess 'twould be— then ," retorted Nancy. "I ain't sayin' what 'twould be now . I'd believe anythin' o' the mistress now—even that she'd take ter playin' it herself!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But hain't the little gal told her—ever? She's told ev'ry one else, I guess. I'm hearin' of it ev'rywhere, now, since she was hurted," said Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, she didn't tell Miss Polly," rejoined Nancy. "Miss Pollyanna told me long ago that she couldn't tell her, 'cause her aunt didn't like ter have her talk about her father; an' 'twas her father's game, an' she'd have ter talk about him if she did tell it. So she never told her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I see, I see." The old man nodded his head slowly. "They was always bitter against the minister chap—all of 'em, 'cause he took Miss Jennie away from 'em. An' Miss Polly—young as she was—couldn't never forgive him; she was that fond of Miss Jennie—in them days. I see, I see. 'Twas a bad mess," he sighed, as he turned away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, 'twas—all 'round, all 'round," sighed Nancy in her turn, as she went back to her kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For no one were those days of waiting easy. The nurse tried to look cheerful, but her eyes were troubled. The doctor was openly nervous and impatient. Miss Polly said little; but even the softening waves of hair about her face, and the becoming laces at her throat, could not hide the fact that she was growing thin and pale. As to Pollyanna—Pollyanna petted the dog, smoothed the cat's sleek head, admired the flowers and ate the fruits and jellies that were sent in to her; and returned innumerable cheery answers to the many messages of love and inquiry that were brought to her bedside. But she, too, grew pale and thin; and the nervous activity of the poor little hands and arms only emphasized the pitiful motionlessness of the once active little feet and legs now lying so woefully quiet under the blankets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As to the game—Pollyanna told Nancy these days how glad she was going to be when she could go to school again, go to see Mrs. Snow, go to call on Mr. Pendleton, and go to ride with Dr. Chilton nor did she seem to realize that all this "gladness" was in the future, not the present. Nancy, however, did realize it—and cry about it, when she was alone.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVI A DOOR AJAR</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JUST a week from the time Dr. Mead, the specialist, was first expected, he came. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man with kind gray eyes, and a cheerful smile. Pollyanna liked him at once, and told him so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look quite a lot like my doctor, you see," she added engagingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your doctor?" Dr. Mead glanced in evident surprise at Dr. Warren, talking with the nurse a few feet away. Dr. Warren was a small, brown-eyed man with a pointed brown beard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, that isn't my doctor," smiled Pollyanna, divining his thought. "Dr. Warren is Aunt Polly's doctor. My doctor is Dr. Chilton."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh-h!" said Dr. Mead, a little oddly, his eyes resting on Miss Polly, who, with a vivid blush, had turned hastily away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes." Pollyanna hesitated, then continued with her usual truthfulness. "You see, I wanted Dr. Chilton all the time, but Aunt Polly wanted you. She said you knew more than Dr. Chilton, anyway about—about broken legs like mine. And of course if you do, I can be glad for that. Do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A swift something crossed the doctor's face that Pollyanna could not quite translate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only time can tell that, little girl," he said gently; then he turned a grave face toward Dr. Warren, who had just come to the bedside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every one said afterward that it was the cat that did it. Certainly, if Fluffy had not poked an insistent paw and nose against Pollyanna's unlatched door, the door would not have swung noiselessly open on its hinges until it stood perhaps a foot ajar; and if the door had not been open, Pollyanna would not have heard her aunt's words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the hall the two doctors, the nurse, and Miss Polly stood talking. In Pollyanna's room Fluffy had just jumped to the bed with a little purring "meow" of joy when through the open door sounded clearly and sharply Aunt Polly's agonized exclamation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not that! Doctor, not that! You don't mean—the child—will never walk again!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was all confusion then. First, from the bedroom came Pollyanna's terrified "Aunt Polly—Aunt Polly!" Then Miss Polly, seeing the open door and realizing that her words had been heard, gave a low little moan and—for the first time in her life—fainted dead away.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nurse, with a choking "She heard!" stumbled toward the open door. The two doctors stayed with Miss Polly. Dr. Mead had to stay—he had caught Miss Polly as she fell. Dr. Warren stood by, helplessly. It was not until Pollyanna cried out again sharply and the nurse closed the door, that the two men, with a despairing glance into each other's eyes, awoke to the immediate duty of bringing the woman in Dr. Mead's arms back to unhappy consciousness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In Pollyanna's room, the nurse had found a purring gray cat on the bed vainly trying to attract the attention of a white-faced, wild-eyed little girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Hunt, please, I want Aunt Polly. I want her right away, quick, please!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nurse closed the door and came forward hurriedly. Her face was very pale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She—she can't come just this minute, dear. She will—a little later. What is it? Can't I—get it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But I want to know what she said—just now. Did you hear her? I want Aunt Polly—she said something. I want her to tell me 'tisn't true—'tisn't true!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The nurse tried to speak, but no words came. Something in her face sent an added terror to Pollyanna's eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Hunt, you did hear her! It is true! Oh, it isn't true! You don't mean I can't ever—walk again?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, dear—don't, don't!" choked the nurse. "Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps he was mistaken. There's lots of things that could happen, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But Aunt Polly said he did know! She said he knew more than anybody else about—about broken legs like mine!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, yes, I know, dear; but all doctors make mistakes sometimes. Just—just don't think any more about it now—please don't, dear."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna flung out her arms wildly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I can't help thinking about it," she sobbed. "It's all there is now to think about. Why, Miss Hunt, how am I going to school, or to see Mr. Pendleton, or Mrs. Snow, or—or anybody?" She caught her breath and sobbed wildly for a moment. Suddenly she stopped and looked up, a new terror in her eyes. "Why, Miss Hunt, if I can't walk, how am I ever going to be glad for— anything ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Hunt did not know "the game;" but she did know that her patient must be quieted, and that at once. In spite of her own perturbation and heartache, her hands had not been idle, and she stood now at the bedside with the quieting powder ready.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, dear, just take this," she soothed; "and by and by we'll be more rested, and we'll see what can be done then. Things aren't half as bad as they seem, dear, lots of times, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Obediently Pollyanna took the medicine, and sipped the water from the glass in Miss Hunt's hand.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know; that sounds like things father used to say," faltered Pollyanna, blinking off the tears. "He said there was always something about everything that might be worse; but I reckon he'd never just heard he couldn't ever walk again. I don't see how there can be anything about that, that could be worse—do you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Hunt did not reply. She could not trust herself to speak just then.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVII TWO VISITS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was Nancy who was sent to tell Mr. John Pendleton of Dr. Mead's verdict. Miss Polly had remembered her promise to let him have direct information from the house. To go herself, or to write a letter, she felt to be almost equally out of the question. It occurred to her then to send Nancy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There had been a time when Nancy would have rejoiced greatly at this extraordinary opportunity to see something of the House of Mystery and its master. But to-day her heart was too heavy to, rejoice at anything. She scarcely even looked about her at all, indeed, during the few minutes, she waited for Mr. John Pendleton to appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm Nancy, sir," she said respectfully, in response to the surprised questioning of his eyes, when he came into the room. "Miss Harrington sent me to tell you about—Miss Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of the curt terseness of the word, Nancy quite understood the anxiety that lay behind that short "well?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It ain't well, Mr. Pendleton," she choked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't mean—" He paused, and she bowed her head miserably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. He says—she can't walk again—never."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a moment there was absolute silence in the room; then the man spoke, in a voice shaken with emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor—little—girl! Poor—little—girl!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy glanced at him, but dropped her eyes at once. She had not supposed that sour, cross, stern John Pendleton could look like that. In a moment he spoke again, still in the low, unsteady voice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It seems cruel—never to dance in the sunshine again! My little prism girl!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was another silence; then, abruptly, the man asked:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She herself doesn't know yet—of course—does she?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But she does, sir." sobbed Nancy, "an' that's what makes it all the harder. She found out—drat that cat! I begs yer pardon," apologized the girl, hurriedly. "It's only that the cat pushed open the door an' Miss Pollyanna overheard 'em talkin'. She found out—that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor—little—girl!" sighed the man again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir. You'd say so, sir, if you could see her," choked Nancy. "I hain't seen her but twice since she knew about it, an' it done me up both times. Ye see it's all so fresh an' new to her, an' she keeps thinkin' all the time of new things she can't do— now . It worries her, too, 'cause she can't seem ter be glad—maybe you don't know about her game, though," broke off Nancy, apologetically.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The `glad game'?" asked the man. "Oh, yes; she told me of that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, she did! Well, I guess she has told it generally ter most folks. But ye see, now she—she can't play it herself, an' it worries her. She says she can't think of a thing—not a thing about this not walkin' again, ter be glad about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, why should she?" retorted the man, almost savagely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy shifted her feet uneasily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's the way I felt, too—till I happened ter think—it would be easier if she could find somethin', ye know. So I tried to—to remind her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To remind her! Of what?" John Pendleton's voice was still angrily impatient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Of—of how she told others ter play it Mis' Snow, and the rest, ye know—and what she said for them ter do. But the poor little lamb just cries, an' says it don't seem the same, somehow. She says it's easy ter tell lifelong invalids how ter be glad, but 'tain't the same thing when you're the lifelong invalid yerself, an' have ter try ter do it. She says she's told herself over an' over again how glad she is that other folks ain't like her; but that all the time she's sayin' it, she ain't really thinkin ' of anythin' only how she can't ever walk again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy paused, but the man did not speak. He sat with his hand over his eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then I tried ter remind her how she used ter say the game was all the nicer ter play when—when it was hard," resumed Nancy, in a dull voice. "But she says that, too, is diff'rent—when it really is hard. An' I must be goin', now, sir," she broke off abruptly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the door she hesitated, turned, and asked timidly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I couldn't be tellin' Miss Pollyanna that—that you'd seen Jimmy Bean again, I s'pose, sir, could I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see how you could—as I haven't seen him," observed the man a little shortly. "Why?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothin', sir, only—well, ye see, that's one of the things that she was feelin' bad about, that she couldn't take him ter see you, now. She said she'd taken him once, but she didn't think he showed off very well that day, and that she was afraid you didn't think he would make a very nice child's presence, after all. Maybe you know what she means by that; but I didn't, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I know—what she means."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All right, sir. It was only that she was wantin' ter take him again, she said, so's ter show ye he really was a lovely child's presence. And now she—can't—drat that autymobile! I begs yer pardon, sir. Good-by!" And Nancy fled precipitately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It did not take long for the entire town of Beldingsville to learn that the great New York doctor had said Pollyanna Whittier would never walk again; and certainly never before had the town been so stirred. Everybody knew by sight now the piquant little freckled face that had always a smile of greeting; and almost everybody knew of the "game" that Pollyanna was playing. To think that now never again would that smiling face be seen on their streets—never again would that cheery little voice proclaim the gladness of some everyday experience! It seemed unbelievable, impossible, cruel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In kitchens and sitting rooms, and over back-yard fences women talked of it, and wept openly. On street corners and in store lounging-places the men talked, too, and wept—though not so openly. And neither the talking nor the weeping grew less when fast on the heels of the news itself, came Nancy's pitiful story that Pollyanna, face to face with what had come to her, was bemoaning most of all the fact that she could not play the game; that she could not now be glad over—anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was then that the same thought must have, in some way, come to Pollyanna's friends. At all events, almost at once, the mistress of the Harrington homestead, greatly to her surprise, began to receive calls: calls from people she knew, and people she did not know; calls from men, women, and children—many of whom Miss Polly had not supposed that her niece knew at all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some came in and sat down for a stiff five or ten minutes. Some stood awkwardly on the porch steps, fumbling with hats or hand-bags, according to their sex. Some brought a book, a bunch of flowers, or a dainty to tempt the palate. Some cried frankly. Some turned their backs and blew their noses furiously. But all inquired very anxiously for the little injured girl; and all sent to her some message—and it was these messages which, after a time, stirred Miss Polly to action.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First came Mr. John Pendleton. He came without his crutches to-day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't need to tell you how shocked I am," he began almost harshly. "But can—nothing be done?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly gave a gesture of despair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, we're `doing,' of course, all the time. Dr. Mead prescribed certain treatments and medicines that might help, and Dr. Warren is carrying them out to the letter, of course. But—Dr. Mead held out almost no hope."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton rose abruptly—though he had but just come. His face was white, and his mouth was set into stern lines. Miss Polly, looking at him, knew very well why he felt that he could not stay longer in her presence. At the door he turned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have a message for Pollyanna," he said. "Will you tell her, please, that I have seen Jimmy Bean and—that he's going to be my boy hereafter. Tell her I thought she would be— glad to know. I shall adopt him, probably."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For a brief moment Miss Polly lost her usual well-bred self-control.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You will adopt Jimmy Bean!" she gasped.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The man lifted his chin a little.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes. I think Pollyanna will understand. You will tell her I thought she would be— glad !"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of—of course," faltered Miss Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you," bowed John Pendleton, as he turned to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the middle of the floor Miss Polly stood, silent and amazed, still looking after the man who had just left her. Even yet she could scarcely believe what her ears had heard. John Pendleton adopt Jimmy Bean? John Pendleton, wealthy, independent, morose, reputed to be miserly and supremely selfish, to adopt a little boy—and such a little boy?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a somewhat dazed face Miss Polly went up-stairs to Pollyanna's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, I have a message for you from Mr. John Pendleton. He has just been here. He says to tell you he has taken Jimmy Bean for his little boy. He said he thought you'd be glad to know it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna's wistful little face flamed into sudden joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad? Glad ? Well, I reckon I am glad! Oh, Aunt Polly, I've so wanted to find a place for Jimmy—and that's such a lovely place! Besides, I'm so glad for Mr. Pendleton, too. You see, now he'll have the child's presence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The—what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna colored painfully. She had forgotten that she had never told her aunt of Mr. Pendleton's desire to adopt her—and certainly she would not wish to tell her now that she had ever thought for a minute of leaving her—this dear Aunt Polly!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The child's presence," stammered Pollyanna, hastily. "Mr. Pendleton told me once, you see, that only a woman's hand and heart or a child's presence could make a—a home. And now he's got it—the child's presence."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I—see," said Miss Polly very gently; and she did see—more than Pollyanna realized. She saw something of the pressure that was probably brought to bear on Pollyanna herself at the time John Pendleton was asking her to be the "child's presence," which was to transform his great pile of gray stone into a home. "I see," she finished, her eyes stinging with sudden tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna, fearful that her aunt might ask further embarrassing questions, hastened to lead the conversation away from the Pendleton house and its master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton says so, too—that it takes a woman's hand and heart, or a child's presence, to make a home, you know," she remarked.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly turned with a start.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton ! How do you know—that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He told me so. 'Twas when he said he lived in just rooms, you know—not a home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly did not answer. Her eyes were out the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"So I asked him why he didn't get 'em.—a woman's hand and heart, and have a home."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna!" Miss Polly had turned sharply. Her cheeks showed a sudden color.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I did. He looked so—so sorrowful."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What did he—say?" Miss Polly asked the question as if in spite of some force within her that was urging her not to ask it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He didn't say anything for a minute; then he said very low that you couldn't always get 'em for the asking."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There was a brief silence. Miss Polly's eyes had turned again to the window. Her cheeks were still unnaturally pink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna sighed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He wants one, anyhow, I know, and I wish he could have one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Pollyanna, how do you know?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Because, afterwards, on another day, he said something else. He said that low, too, but I heard him. He said that he'd give all the world if he did have one woman's hand and heart. Why, Aunt Polly, what's the matter?" Aunt Polly had risen hurriedly and gone to the window.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nothing, dear. I was changing the position of this prism," said Aunt Polly, whose whole face now was aflame.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXVIII THE GAME AND ITS PLAYERS</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IT was not long after John Pendleton's second visit that Milly Snow called one afternoon. Milly Snow had never before been to the Harrington homestead. She blushed and looked very embarrassed when Miss Polly entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I—I came to inquire for the little girl," she stammered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind. She is about the same. How is your mother?" rejoined Miss Polly, wearily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That is what I came to tell you—that is, to ask you to tell Miss Pollyanna," hurried on the girl, breathlessly and incoherently. "We think it's—so awful—so perfectly awful that the little thing can't ever walk again; and after all she's done for us, too—for mother, you know, teaching her to play the game, and all that. And when we heard how now she couldn't play it herself—poor little dear! I'm sure I don't see how she can , either, in her condition!—but when we remembered all the things she'd said to us, we thought if she could only know what she had done for us, that it would help , you know, in her own case, about the game, because she could be glad—that is, a little glad—" Milly stopped helplessly, and seemed to be waiting for Miss Polly to speak.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly had sat politely listening, but with a puzzled questioning in her eyes. Only about half of what had been said, had she understood. She was thinking now that she always had known that Milly Snow was "queer," but she had not supposed she was crazy. In no other way, however, could she account for this incoherent, illogical, unmeaning rush of words. When the pause came she filled it with a quiet:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't think I quite understand, Milly. Just what is it that you want me to tell my niece?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, that's it; I want you to tell her," answered the girl, feverishly. "Make her see what she's done for us. Of course she's seen some things, because she's been there, and she's known mother is different; but I want her to know how different she is—and me, too. I'm different. I've been trying to play it—the game—a little."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly frowned. She would have asked what Milly meant by this "game," but there was no opportunity. Milly was rushing on again with nervous volubility.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You know nothing was ever right before—for mother. She was always wanting 'em different. And, really, I don't know as one could blame her much—under the circumstances. But now she lets me keep the shades up, and she takes interest in things—how she looks, and her nightdress, and all that. And she's actually begun to knit little things—reins and baby blankets for fairs and hospitals. And she's so interested, and so glad to think she can do it!—and that was all Miss Pollyanna's doings, you know, 'cause she told mother she could be glad she'd got her hands and arms, anyway; and that made mother wonder right away why she didn't do something with her hands and arms. And so she began to do something—to knit, you know. And you can't think what a different room it is now, what with the red and blue and yellow worsteds, and the prisms in the window that she gave her—why, it actually makes you feel better just to go in there now; and before I used to dread it awfully, it was so dark and gloomy, and mother was so—so unhappy, you know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And so we want you to please tell Miss Pollyanna that we understand it's all because of her. And please say we're so glad we know her, that we thought, maybe if she knew it, it would make her a little glad that she knew us. And—and that's all," sighed Milly, rising hurriedly to her feet. "You'll tell her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, of course," murmured Miss Polly, wondering just how much of this remarkable discourse she could remember to tell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">These visits of John Pendleton and Milly Snow were only the first of many; and always there were the messages—the messages which were in some ways so curious that they caused Miss Polly more and more to puzzle over them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One day there was the little Widow Benton. Miss Polly knew her well, though they had never called upon each other. By reputation she knew her as the saddest little woman in town—one who was always in black. To-day, however, Mrs. Benton wore a knot of pale blue at the throat, though there were tears in her eyes. She spoke of her grief and horror at the accident; then she asked diffidently if she might see Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly shook her head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am sorry, but she sees no one yet. A little later—perhaps."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Benton wiped her eyes, rose, and turned to go. But after she had almost reached the hall door she came back hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Miss Harrington, perhaps, you'd give her—a message," she stammered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, Mrs. Benton; I shall be very glad to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Still the little woman hesitated; then she spoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you tell her, please, that—that I've put on this ," she said, just touching the blue bow at her throat. Then, at Miss Polly's ill-concealed look of surprise, she added: "The little girl has been trying for so long to make me wear—some color, that I thought she'd be—glad to know I'd begun. She said that Freddy would be so glad to see it, if I would. You know Freddy's all I have now. The others have all—" Mrs. Benton shook her head and turned away. "If you'll just tell Pollyanna— she'll understand." And the door closed after her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later, that same day, there was the other widow—at least, she wore widow's garments. Miss Polly did not know her at all. She wondered vaguely how Pollyanna could have known her. The lady gave her name as "Mrs. Tarbell."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm a stranger to you, of course," she began at once. "But I'm not a stranger to your little niece, Pollyanna. I've been at the hotel all summer, and every day I've had to take long walks for my health. It was on these walks that I've met your niece—she's such a dear little girl! I wish I could make you understand what she's been to me. I was very sad when I came up here; and her bright face and cheery ways reminded me of—my own little girl that I lost years ago. I was so shocked to hear of the accident; and then when I learned that the poor child would never walk again, and that she was so unhappy because she couldn't be glad any longer—the dear child!—I just had to come to you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are very kind," murmured Miss Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it is you who are to be kind," demurred the other. "I—I want you to give her a message from me. Will you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Will you just tell her, then, that Mrs. Tarbell is glad now. Yes, I know it sounds odd, and you don't understand. But—if you'll pardon me I'd rather not explain." Sad lines came to the lady's mouth, and the smile left her eyes. "Your niece will know just what I mean; and I felt that I must tell—her. Thank you; and pardon me, please, for any seeming rudeness in my call," she begged, as she took her leave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thoroughly mystified now, Miss Polly hurried up-stairs to Pollyanna's room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, do you know a Mrs. Tarbell?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes. I love Mrs. Tarbell. She's sick, and awfully sad; and she's at the hotel, and takes long walks. We go together. I mean—we used to." Pollyanna's voice broke, and two big tears rolled down her cheeks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly cleared her throat hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We'll, she's just been here, dear. She left a message for you—but she wouldn't tell me what it meant. She said to tell you that Mrs. Tarbell is glad now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna clapped her hands softly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did she say that—really? Oh, I'm so glad!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Pollyanna, what did she mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, it's the game, and—" Pollyanna stopped short, her fingers to her lips.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What game?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"N-nothing much, Aunt Polly; that is—I can't tell it unless I tell other things that—that I'm not to speak of."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was on Miss Polly's tongue to question her niece further; but the obvious distress on the little girl's face stayed the words before they were uttered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not long after Mrs. Tarbell's visit, the climax came. It came in the shape of a call from a certain young woman with unnaturally pink cheeks and abnormally yellow hair; a young woman who wore high heels and cheap jewelry; a young woman whom Miss Polly knew very well by reputation—but whom she was angrily amazed to meet beneath the roof of the Harrington homestead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly did not offer her hand. She drew back, indeed, as she entered the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman rose at once. Her eyes were very red, as if she had been crying. Half defiantly she asked if she might, for a moment, see the little girl, Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly said no. She began to say it very sternly; but something in the woman's pleading eyes made her add the civil explanation that no one was allowed yet to see Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The woman hesitated; then a little brusquely she spoke. Her chin was still at a slightly defiant tilt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My name is Mrs. Payson—Mrs. Tom Payson. I presume you've heard of me—most of the good people in the town have—and maybe some of the things you've heard ain't true. But never mind that. It's about the little girl I came. I heard about the accident, and—and it broke me all up. Last week I heard how she couldn't ever walk again, and—and I wished I could give up my two uselessly well legs for hers. She'd do more good trotting around on 'em one hour than I could in a hundred years. But never mind that. Legs ain't always given to the one who can make the best use of 'em, I notice."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paused, and cleared her throat; but when she resumed her voice was still husky.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Maybe you don't know it, but I've seen a good deal of that little girl of yours. We live on the Pendleton Hill road, and she used to go by often—only she didn't always go by . She came in and played with the kids and talked to me—and my man, when he was home. She seemed to like it, and to like us. She didn't know, I suspect, that her kind of folks don't generally call on my kind. Maybe if they did call more, Miss Harrington, there wouldn't be so many—of my kind," she added, with sudden bitterness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Be that as it may, she came; and she didn't do herself no harm, and she did do us good—a lot o' good. How much she won't know—nor can't know, I hope; 'cause if she did, she'd know other things—that I don't want her to know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But it's just this. It's been hard times with us this year, in more ways than one. We've been blue and discouraged—my man and me, and ready for—'most anything. We was reckoning on getting a divorce about now, and letting the kids well, we didn't know what we would do with the kids, Then came the accident, and what we heard about the little girl's never walking again. And we got to thinking how she used to come and sit on our doorstep and train with the kids, and laugh, and—and just be glad. She was always being glad about something; and then, one day, she told us why, and about the game, you know; and tried to coax us to play it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, we've heard now that she's fretting her poor little life out of her, because she can't play it no more—that there's nothing to be glad about. And that's what I came to tell her to-day—that maybe she can be a little glad for us, 'cause we've decided to stick to each other, and play the game ourselves. I knew she would be glad, because she used to feel kind of bad—at things we said, sometimes. Just how the game is going to help us, I can't say that I exactly see, yet; but maybe 'twill. Anyhow, we're going to try—'cause she wanted us to. Will you tell her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, I will tell her," promised Miss Polly, a little faintly. Then, with sudden impulse, she stepped forward and held out her hand. "And thank you for coming, Mrs. Payson," she said simply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The defiant chin fell. The lips above it trembled visibly. With an incoherently mumbled something, Mrs. Payson blindly clutched at the outstretched hand, turned, and fled.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The door had scarcely closed behind her before Miss Polly was confronting Nancy in the kitchen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly spoke sharply. The series of puzzling, disconcerting visits of the last few days, culminating as they had in the extraordinary experience of the afternoon, had strained her nerves to the snapping point. Not since Miss Pollyanna's accident had Nancy heard her mistress speak so sternly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Nancy, will you tell me what this absurd `game ' is that the whole town seems to be babbling about? And what, please, has my niece to do with it? Why does everybody, from Milly Snow to Mrs. Tom Payson, send word to her that they're `playing it'? As near as I can judge, half the town are putting on blue ribbons, or stopping family quarrels, or learning to like something they never liked before, and all because of Pollyanna. I tried to ask the child herself about it, but I can't seem to make much headway, and of course I don't like to worry her—now. But from something I heard her say to you last night, I should judge you were one of them, too. Now will you tell me what it all means?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Miss Polly's surprise and dismay, Nancy burst into tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It means that ever since last June that blessed child has jest been makin' the whole town glad, an' now they're turnin' 'round an' tryin' ter make her a little glad, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad of what?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Just glad! That's the game."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly actually stamped her foot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There you go like all the rest, Nancy. What game?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy lifted her chin. She faced her mistress and looked her squarely in the eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll tell ye, ma'am. It's a game Miss Pollyanna's father learned her ter play. She got a pair of crutches once in a missionary barrel when she was wantin' a doll; an' she cried, of course, like any child would. It seems 'twas then her father told her that there wasn't ever anythin' but what there was somethin' about it that you could be glad about; an' that she could be glad about them crutches."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad for— crutches !" Miss Polly choked back a sob—she was thinking of the helpless little legs on the bed up-stairs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm. That's what I said, an' Miss Pollyanna said that's what she said, too. But he told her she could be glad—'cause she didn't need 'em ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh-h!" cried Miss Polly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And after that she said he made a regular game of it—findin' somethin' in everythin' ter be glad about. An' she said ye could do it, too, and that ye didn't seem ter mind not havin' the doll so much, 'cause ye was so glad ye didn't need the crutches. An' they called it the `jest bein' glad' game. That's the game, ma'am. She's played it ever since."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, how—how—" Miss Polly came to a helpless pause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"An' you'd be surprised ter find how cute it works, ma'am, too," maintained Nancy, with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself. "I wish I could tell ye what a lot she's done for mother an' the folks out home. She's been ter see 'em, ye know, twice, with me. She's made me glad, too, on such a lot o' things—little things, an' big things; an' it's made 'em so much easier. For instance, I don't mind `Nancy' for a name half as much since she told me I could be glad 'twa'n't `Hephzibah.' An' there's Monday mornin's, too, that I used ter hate so. She's actually made me glad for Monday mornin's."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Glad—for Monday mornings!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy laughed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I know it does sound nutty, ma'am. But let me tell ye. That blessed lamb found out I hated Monday mornin's somethin' awful; an' what does she up an' tell me one day but this: `Well, anyhow, Nancy, I should think you could be gladder on Monday mornin' than on any other day in the week, because 'twould be a whole week before you'd have another one!' An' I'm blest if I hain't thought of it ev'ry Monday mornin' since—an' it has helped, ma'am. It made me laugh, anyhow, ev'ry time I thought of it; an' laughin' helps, ye know—it does, it does!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But why hasn't—she told me—the game?" faltered Miss Polly. "Why has she made such a mystery of it, when I asked her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nancy hesitated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Beggin' yer pardon, ma'am, you told her not ter speak of—her father; so she couldn't tell ye. 'Twas her father's game, ye see."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly bit her lip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She wanted ter tell ye, first off," continued Nancy, a little unsteadily. "She wanted somebody ter play it with, ye know. That's why I begun it, so she could have some one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And—and—these others?" Miss Polly's voice shook now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, ev'rybody, 'most, knows it now, I guess. Anyhow, I should think they did from the way I'm hearin' of it ev'rywhere I go. Of course she told a lot, and they told the rest. Them things go, ye know, when they gets started. An' she was always so smilin' an' pleasant ter ev'ry one, an' so—so jest glad herself all the time, that they couldn't help knowin' it, anyhow. Now, since she's hurt, ev'rybody feels so bad—specially when they heard how bad she feels 'cause she can't find anythin' ter be glad about. An' so they've been comin' ev'ry day ter tell her how glad she's made them , hopin' that'll help some. Ye see, she's always wanted ev'rybody ter play the game with her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I know somebody who'll play it—now," choked Miss Polly, as she turned and sped through the kitchen doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Behind her, Nancy stood staring amazedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I'll believe anythin'—anythin' now," she muttered to herself. "Ye can't stump me with anythin' I wouldn't believe, now—o' Miss Polly!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later, in Pollyanna's room, the nurse left Miss Polly and Pollyanna alone together.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And you've had still another caller to-day, my dear," announced Miss Polly, in a voice she vainly tried to steady. "Do you remember Mrs. Payson?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mrs. Payson? Why, I reckon I do! She lives on the way to Mr. Pendleton's, and she's got the prettiest little girl baby three years old, and a boy 'most five. She's awfully nice, and so's her husband—only they don't seem to know how nice each other is. Sometimes they fight—I mean, they don't quite agree. They're poor, too, they say, and of course they don't ever have barrels, 'cause he isn't a missionary minister, you know, like—well, he isn't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A faint color stole into Pollyanna's cheeks which was duplicated suddenly in those of her aunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But she wears real pretty clothes, sometimes, in spite of their being so poor," resumed Pollyanna, in some haste. "And she's got perfectly beautiful rings with diamonds and rubies and emeralds in them; but she says she's got one ring too many, and that she's going to throw it away and get a divorce instead. What is a divorce, Aunt Polly? I'm afraid it isn't very nice, because she didn't look happy when she talked about it. And she said if she did get it, they wouldn't live there any more, and that Mr. Payson would go 'way off, and maybe the children, too. But I should think they'd rather keep the ring, even if they did have so many more. Shouldn't you? Aunt Polly, what is a divorce?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But they aren't going 'way off, dear," evaded Aunt Polly, hurriedly. "They're going to stay right there together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad! Then they'll be there when I go up to see— O dear!" broke off the little girl, miserably. "Aunt Polly, why can't I remember that my legs don't go any more, and that I won't ever, ever go up to see Mr. Pendleton again?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, there, don't," choked her aunt. "Perhaps you'll drive up sometime. But listen! I haven't told you, yet, all that Mrs. Payson said. She wanted me to tell you that they—they were going to stay together and to play the game, just as you wanted them to."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna smiled through tear-wet eyes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Did they? Did they, really? Oh, I am glad of that!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, she said she hoped you'd be. That's why she told you, to make you— glad , Pollyanna."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna looked up quickly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, Aunt Polly, you—you spoke just as if you knew— Do you know about the game, Aunt Polly?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear." Miss Polly sternly forced her voice to be cheerfully matter-of-fact. "Nancy told me. I think it's a beautiful game. I'm going to play it now—with you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Aunt Polly— you ? I'm so glad! You see, I've really wanted you most of anybody, all the time."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly caught her breath a little sharply. It was even harder this time to keep her voice steady; but she did it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear; and there are all those others, too. Why, Pollyanna, I think all the town is playing that game now with you—even to the minister! I haven't had a chance to tell you, yet, but this morning I met Mr. Ford when I was down to the village, and he told me to say to you that just as soon as you could see him, he was coming to tell you that he hadn't stopped being glad over those eight hundred rejoicing texts that you told him about. So you see, dear, it's just you that have done it. The whole town is playing the game, and the whole town is wonderfully happier—and all because of one little girl who taught the people a new game, and how to play it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna clapped her hands.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I'm so glad," she cried. Then, suddenly, a wonderful light illumined her face. "Why, Aunt Polly, there is something I can be glad about, after all. I can be glad I've had my legs, anyway—else I couldn't have done—that!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXIX THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ONE by one the short winter days came and went—but they were not short to Pollyanna. They were long, and sometimes full of pain. Very resolutely, these days, however, Pollyanna was turning a cheerful face toward whatever came. Was she not specially bound to play the game, now that Aunt Polly was playing it, too? And Aunt Polly found so many things to be glad about! It was Aunt Polly, too, who discovered the story one day about the two poor little waifs in a snow-storm who found a blown-down door to crawl under, and who wondered what poor folks did that didn't have any door! And it was Aunt Polly who brought home the other story that she had heard about the poor old lady who had only two teeth, but who was so glad that those two teeth "hit"!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna now, like Mrs. Snow, was knitting wonderful things out of bright colored worsteds that trailed their cheery lengths across the white spread, and made Pollyanna—again like Mrs. Snow—so glad she had her hands and arms, anyway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna saw people now, occasionally, and always there were the loving messages from those she could not see; and always they brought her something new to think about—and Pollyanna needed new things to think about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once she had seen John Pendleton, and twice she had seen Jimmy Bean. John Pendleton had told her what a fine boy Jimmy was getting to be, and how well he was doing. Jimmy had told her what a first-rate home he had, and what bang-up "folks" Mr. Pendleton made; and both had said that it was all owing to her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Which makes me all the gladder, you know, that I have had my legs," Pollyanna confided to her aunt afterwards.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The winter passed, and spring came. The anxious watchers over Pollyanna's condition could see little change wrought by the prescribed treatment. There seemed every reason to believe, indeed, that Dr. Mead's worst fears would be realized—that Pollyanna would never walk again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Beldingsville, of course, kept itself informed concerning Pollyanna; and of Beldingsville, one man in particular fumed and fretted himself into a fever of anxiety over the daily bulletins which he managed in some way to procure from the bed of suffering. As the days passed, however, and the news came to be no better, but rather worse, something besides anxiety began to show in the man's face: despair, and a very dogged determination, each fighting for the mastery. In the end, the dogged determination won; and it was then that Mr. John Pendleton, somewhat to his surprise, received one Saturday morning a call from Dr. Thomas Chilton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pendleton," began the doctor, abruptly, "I've come to you because you, better than any one else in town, know something of my relations with Miss Polly Harrington."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton was conscious that he must have started visibly—he did know something of the affair between Polly Harrington and Thomas Chilton, but the matter had not been mentioned between them for fifteen years, or more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes," he said, trying to make his voice sound concerned enough for sympathy, and not eager enough for curiosity. In a moment he saw that he need not have worried, however: the doctor was quite too intent on his errand to notice how that errand was received.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pendleton, I want to see that child. I want to make an examination. I must make an examination."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well—can't you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Can't I! Pendleton, you know very well I haven't been inside that door for more than fifteen years. You don't know—but I will tell you—that the mistress of that house told me that the next time she asked me to enter it, I might take it that she was begging my pardon, and that all would be as before—which meant that she'd marry me. Perhaps you see her summoning me now—but I don't!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But couldn't you go—without a summons?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor frowned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, hardly. I have some pride, you know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if you're so anxious—couldn't you swallow your pride and forget the quarrel—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Forget the quarrel!" interrupted the doctor, savagely. "I'm not talking of that kind of pride. So far as that is concerned, I'd go from here there on my knees—or on my head—if that would do any good. It's professional pride I'm talking about. It's a case of sickness, and I'm a doctor. I can't butt in and say, `Here, take me!' can I?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Chilton, what was the quarrel?" demanded Pendleton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The doctor made an impatient gesture, and got to his feet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What was it? What's any lovers' quarrel after it's over?" he snarled, pacing the room angrily. "A silly wrangle over the size of the moon or the depth of a river, maybe—it might as well be, so far as its having any real significance compared to the years of misery that follow them! Never mind the quarrel! So far as I am concerned, I am willing to say there was no quarrel. Pendleton, I must see that child. It may mean life or death. It will mean—I honestly believe—nine chances out of ten that Pollyanna Whittier will walk again!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The words were spoken clearly, impressively; and they were spoken just as the one who uttered them had almost reached the open window near John Pendleton's chair. Thus it happened that very distinctly they reached the ears of a small boy kneeling beneath the window on the ground outside.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy Bean, at his Saturday morning task of pulling up the first little green weeds of the flowerbeds, sat up with ears and eyes wide open.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Walk! Pollyanna!" John Pendleton was saying. "What do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I mean that from what I can hear and learn—a mile from her bedside—that her case is very much like one that a college friend of mine has just helped. For years he's been making this sort of thing a special study. I've kept in touch with him, and studied, too, in a way. And from what I hear—but I want to see the girl!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">John Pendleton came erect in his chair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must see her, man! Couldn't you—say, through Dr. Warren?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The other shook his head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'm afraid not. Warren has been very decent, though. He told me himself that he suggested consultation with me at the first, but—Miss Harrington said no so decisively that he didn't dare venture it again, even though he knew of my desire to see the child. Lately, some of his best patients have come over to me—so of course that ties my hands still more effectually. But, Pendleton, I've got to see that child! Think of what it may mean to her—if I do!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, and think of what it will mean—if you don't!" retorted Pendleton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But how can I—without a direct request from her aunt?—which I'll never get!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She must be made to ask you!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, I guess you don't—nor anybody else. She's too proud and too angry to ask me—after what she said years ago it would mean if she did ask me. But when I think of that child, doomed to lifelong misery, and when I think that maybe in my hands lies a chance of escape, but for that confounded nonsense we call pride and professional etiquette, I—" He did not finish his sentence, but with his hands thrust deep into his pockets, he turned and began to tramp up and down the room again, angrily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if she could be made to see—to understand," urged John Pendleton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; and who's going to do it?" demanded the doctor, with a savage turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, I don't know," groaned the other, miserably.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Outside the window Jimmy Bean stirred suddenly. Up to now he had scarcely breathed, so intently had he listened to every word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, by Jinks, I know!" he whispered, exultingly. "I'm a-goin' ter do it!" And forthwith he rose to his feet, crept stealthily around the corner of the house, and ran with all his might down Pendleton Hill.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXX JIMMY TAKES THE HELM</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"IT'S Jimmy Bean. He wants ter see ye, ma'am," announced Nancy in the doorway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Me?" rejoined Miss Polly, plainly surprised. "Are you sure he did not mean Miss Pollyanna? He may see her a few minutes to-day, if he likes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes'm. I told him. But he said it was you he wanted."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very well, I'll come down." And Miss Polly arose from her chair a little wearily.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the sitting room she found waiting for her a round-eyed, flushed-faced boy, who began to speak at once.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ma'am, I s'pose it's dreadful—what I'm doin', an' what I'm sayin'; but I can't help it. It's for Pollyanna, and I'd walk over hot coals for her, or face you, or—or anythin' like that, any time. An' I think you would, too, if you thought there was a chance for her ter walk again. An' so that's why I come ter tell ye that as long as it's only pride an' et—et-somethin' that's keepin' Pollyanna from walkin', why I knew you would ask Dr. Chilton here if you understood—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wh-at?" interrupted Miss Polly, the look of stupefaction on her face changing to one of angry indignation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy sighed despairingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, I didn't mean ter make ye mad. That's why I begun by tellin' ye about her walkin' again. I thought you'd listen ter that."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jimmy, what are you talking about?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy sighed again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I'm tryin' ter tell ye."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, then tell me. But begin at the beginning, and be sure I understand each thing as you go. Don't plunge into the middle of it as you did before—and mix everything all up!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jimmy wet his lips determinedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, ter begin with, Dr. Chilton come ter see Mr. Pendleton, an' they talked in the library. Do you understand that?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Jimmy." Miss Polly's voice was rather faint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, the window was open, and I was weedin' the flower-bed under it; an' I heard 'em talk."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Jimmy! Listening ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Twa'n't about me, an' 'twa'n't sneak listenin'," bridled Jimmy. "And I'm glad I listened. You will be when I tell ye. Why, it may make Pollyanna—walk!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jimmy, what do you mean?" Miss Polly was leaning forward eagerly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There, I told ye so," nodded Jimmy, contentedly. "Well, Dr. Chilton knows some doctor somewhere that can cure Pollyanna, he thinks—make her walk, ye know; but he can't tell sure till he sees her. And he wants ter see her somethin' awful, but he told Mr. Pendleton that you wouldn't let him."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly's face turned very red.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, Jimmy, I—I can't—I couldn't! That is, I didn't know!" Miss Polly was twisting her fingers together helplessly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, an' that's what I come ter tell ye, so you would know," asserted Jimmy, eagerly. "They said that for some reason—I didn't rightly catch what—you wouldn't let Dr. Chilton come, an' you told Dr. Warren so; an' Dr. Chilton couldn't come himself, without you asked him, on account of pride an' professional et—et—well, et-somethin anyway. An' they was wishin' somebody could make you understand, only they didn't know who could; an' I was outside the winder, an' I says ter myself right away, `By Jinks, I'll do it!' An' I come—an' have I made ye understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes; but, Jimmy, about that doctor," implored Miss Polly, feverishly. "Who was he? What did he do? Are they sure he could make Pollyanna walk?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know who he was. They didn't say. Dr. Chilton knows him, an' he's just cured somebody just like her, Dr. Chilton thinks. Anyhow, they didn't seem ter be doin' no worryin' about him . 'Twas you they was worryin' about, 'cause you wouldn't let Dr. Chilton see her. An' say—you will let him come, won't you?—now you understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Polly turned her head from side to side. Her breath was coming in little uneven, rapid gasps. Jimmy, watching her with anxious eyes, thought she was going to cry. But she did not cry. After a minute she said brokenly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes—I'll let—Dr. Chilton—see her. Now run home, Jimmy—quick! I've got to speak to Dr. Warren. He's up-stairs now. I saw him drive in a few minutes ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A little later Dr. Warren was surprised to meet an agitated, flushed-faced Miss Polly in the hall. He was still more surprised to hear the lady say, a little breathlessly:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Warren, you asked me once to allow Dr. Chilton to be called in consultation, and—I refused. Since then I have reconsidered. I very much desire that you should call in Dr. Chilton. Will you not ask him at once—please? Thank you."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXI A NEW UNCLE</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE next time Dr. Warren entered the chamber where Pollyanna lay watching the dancing shimmer of color on the ceiling, a tall, broad-shouldered man followed close behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dr. Chilton!—oh, Dr. Chilton, how glad I am to see you !" cried Pollyanna. And at the joyous rapture of the voice, more than one pair of eyes in the room brimmed hot with sudden tears. "But, of course, if Aunt Polly doesn't want—"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is all right, my dear; don't worry," soothed Miss Polly, agitatedly, hurrying forward. "I have told Dr. Chilton that—that I want him to look you over—with Dr. Warren, this morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, then you asked him to come," murmured Pollyanna, contentedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dear, I asked him. That is—" But it was too late. The adoring happiness that had leaped to Dr. Chilton's eyes was unmistakable and Miss Polly had seen it. With very pink cheeks she turned and left the room hurriedly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Over in the window the nurse and Dr. Warren were talking earnestly. Dr. Chilton held out both his hands to Pollyanna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Little girl, I'm thinking that one of the very gladdest jobs you ever did has been done to-day," he said in a voice shaken with emotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At twilight a wonderfully tremulous, wonderfully different Aunt Polly crept to Pollyanna's bedside. The nurse was at supper. They had the room to themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, dear, I'm going to tell you—the very first one of all. Some day I'm going to give Dr. Chilton to you for your—uncle. And it's you that have done it all. Oh, Pollyanna, I'm so—happy! And so—glad!—darling!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pollyanna began to clap her hands; but even as she brought her small palms together the first time, she stopped, and held them suspended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Polly, Aunt Polly, were you the woman's hand and heart he wanted so long ago? You were—I know you were! And that's what he meant by saying I'd done the gladdest job of all—to-day. I'm so glad! Why, Aunt Polly, I don't know but I'm so glad that I don't mind—even my legs, now!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Polly swallowed a sob.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perhaps, some day, dear—" But Aunt Polly did not finish. Aunt Polly did not dare to tell, yet, the great hope that Dr. Chilton had put into her heart. But she did say this—and surely this was quite wonderful enough—to Pollyanna's mind:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pollyanna, next week you're going to take a journey. On a nice comfortable little bed you're going to be carried in cars and carriages to a great doctor who has a big house many miles from here made on purpose for just such people as you are. He's a dear friend of Dr. Chilton's, and we're going to see what he can do for you!"</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XXXII WHICH IS A LETTER FROM POLLYANNA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"DEAR AUNT POLLY AND UNCLE TOM:—Oh, I can—I can—I can walk! I did to-day all the way from my bed to the window! It was six steps. My, how good it was to be on legs again!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"All the doctors stood around and smiled, and all the nurses stood beside of them and cried. A lady in the next ward who walked last week first, peeked into the door, and another one who hopes she can walk next month, was invited in to the party, and she laid on my nurse's bed and clapped her hands. Even Black Tilly who washes the floor, looked through the piazza window and called me `Honey, child' when she wasn't crying too much to call me anything.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see why they cried. I wanted to sing and shout and yell! Oh—oh—oh! just think, I can walk—walk— walk ! Now I don't mind being here almost ten months, and I didn't miss the wedding, anyhow. Wasn't that just like you, Aunt Polly, to come on here and get married right beside my bed, so I could see you. You always do think of the gladdest things!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Pretty soon, they say, I shall go home. I wish I could walk all the way there. I do. I don't think I shall ever want to ride anywhere any more. It will be so good just to walk. Oh, I'm so glad! I'm glad for everything. Why, I'm glad now I lost my legs for a while, for you never, never know how perfectly lovely legs are till you haven't got them—that go, I mean. I'm going to walk eight steps to-morrow. "With heaps of love to everybody, "POLLYANNA."</field>
