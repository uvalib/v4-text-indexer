      <field name="heading_text">[From] CHAPTER I. THE RETURN HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[pp. 7-17 omitted.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, my dear husband, have you any law in Virginia to punish a master for cruelty to his slave?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Certainly, my dear; a man is not allowed to be cruel to his beasts; but as slaves are the only persons generally present, and as their testimony is not admissible against a white man, the law is rarely enforced against a cruel master."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have always thought it a shocking thing to prevent slaves from giving testimony against a white man; in our state the testimony of a black man is thought as good as that of a white."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my dear, as I have brought you to Virginia full of notions and prejudices against this peculiar institution of ours, it is my duty, and it is indispensable to your comfort here, that I should remove those prejudices as soon as possible. My first effort will be to reconcile you to what you call a shocking thing in our laws, and to show you how very shocking it would be (on the other hand), if slaves were allowed to give testimony against the whites.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I must allow that there are evils inseparable from a state of slavery, such (for instance) as a depressed and lowered standard of morals; a general feeling of antagonism on the part of the slave towards the white man; which latter feeling, operating upon the low moral standard, which rejects the proper appreciation of an oath, would not only tend to insecurity of the life and property of the white man, but would injure the slave himself, if he were by law placed in a situation where there was constant temptation to perjury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Moreover, there is always, in every community, a class of whites whose moral standard is as low as that of the slave, but who, on account of their freedom, are more connected than the slave with the property transactions of life; and if, in contests between the whites relative to those transactions, the slave was admitted to bear testimony, what an advantage would the villain litigant have over the conscientious one, when there was so wide a field open for suborning slaves to perjury! A master's influence, too, over his slave might be made to bear very beneficially upon his own interest, and defeat the purposes of justice, if the slave could testify in his behalf; or he might be liable to injury from the testimony of a slave given under feelings of exasperation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is entirely unsuited to the nature of slavery, to admit slaves as witnesses, for or against those who are connected with property transactions. If the slave were liable to be called to a court-house as a witness, where he might be kept for many days, what would become of the master's interest at home? What temptations also to vice would not be offered the idle slave at a public court-house; and above all, what chance would not occasional respite from labour at a public place give of success to the efforts of abolitionists to entice him for ever from servitude! We will dismiss the subject for the present; and if tomorrow is a good day, we will take a walk and see the condition of our servants."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER II. INSPECTIONS.—CONTRAST.—TAMPERINGS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A BALMY morning late in the month of November (the season being what is called Indian summer), reminded Dr. Boswell of his promise to his wife, of a walk to see the condition of their servants; and having hurried over her labours at the tea board, she was in a short time after breakfast ready to accompany him. They made directly for Cabin Row (as it was called). The first cabin of the row was Uncle Robin's, who had been confined by slight indisposition ever since the arrival of his new mistress, and whom he had never yet seen. After asking about his health, the Doctor said to him; "Well, Robin, I have brought your new mistress to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I mighty glad to see you, missis," said Robin; "how you been do, madam?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am very well, I thank you, Uncle Robin, and am glad to find you better."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thank you, missis, de Lord be praised, I feels myself considerable better dis mornin'; I's had a right tuff time of it, since you bin com' home, else I'd bin to see you 'fore dis; walk in, missis, I 'spose you never bin in nigger cabin befo'!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know that I ever was in a negro's cabin before, Uncle Robin, but I have been in a much worse house than yours; I am very fond of neatness and tidiness, and you seem to have everything neat and comfortable around you; I should think Aunt Elce was a very good wife."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"De Lord be praised, missis, she does suit me mighty well; you's bin see Elce, ain't you, missis?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O! yes, she's been several times at the house since I came."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where is she now, Robin?" asked the Doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, massa, bit ago, I see'd some sheeps on de young clober down in de fiel' 'pon de river, and I sends Elce to dribe 'em out, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many children have you, Uncle Robin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Only three, missis, dat gal Elce 'bout de house, my boy John, now at wuck in de fiel', and dis little boy Robin; whar is dat chile? Robin, com' here, boy, and see missis!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Robin came from the little bedroom, where he had been hiding, and held his hand to his mistress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Keep back you' dutty han', boy! 'spose missis is gwine shake sich a black dutty han' as yourn?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If it was clean, Uncle Robin, I would not refuse to shake it because it was black."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! no, missis, I don't say dat; my ole missis dat's dead and gone, and is now wid de angels in Hebbin, never thought she'd be tarminated by shakin' han's wid de poo' niggers."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Robin," said the Doctor, "I hope this new mistress that I have brought you will be like your old one in every respect."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Think so, masser? oh if she is, masser, I shall lobe her mo' 'an tung' can tell. When de Lord see'd fit to take my ole missis from me, I thought I neber should see any mo' peace in dis worl', and I did long so much to go wid my missis, but de Lord want me to stay here, and I did thought de Lord know'd bes', and I give up to de Lord, and tried to say, dy will be don', and de Lord healed de broken heart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see any bed in your room, Uncle Robin," said his mistress.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, we sleep, missis, in dat little room dar; dis room, my ole missis had built purpose for Sunday school and prayin' room, missis."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I intend, my dear, to explain all these things to you hereafter, about the Sunday school, &amp;c.," said the Doctor. "Let us now go and visit the other cabins. All the others you will find occupied by two families, one family in each room. This first room is Jim's and Dinah's; they are both at work in the field, and their children, when they are away, stay in the last cabin with old Aunt Juno, who takes care of all the small children, when their parents are at work from home. This next now, is Pheby's and George's; both doors seem to be open, we will take a peep into them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear husband, how very comfortable and neat they all seem to be!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The others," said the Doctor, "are pretty much like those you have seen; we will pass on to the last, one room of which is occupied by old Aunt Juno, a native African. She is past work, and her only business (as I mentioned before) is to take care of the children."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Aunt Juno, how are you to-day ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Bad nuff, massa, dese chillons pesse me tu much, dey fights, dey fights ebery time, make Juner no fire, poo' ole Juner cole now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll have some fire made for you. Aunt Juno, here's your new mistress come to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How you do, missy? Juner berry glad see you, Juner ole now, can't see you berry well."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How old do you suppose you are, Aunt Juno?" asked Mrs. Boswell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, missy, Juner seb-seb-sebinty; when Massa Braddec com' long here, Juner was big gal, missy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She is only a little out in her chronology, my dear," said the Doctor. "I have never yet seen a very old negro who hadn't something to say about Braddock; his march through Virginia seems to be a favourite epoch in their memories. There can be none left who remember that period; but many of those who are now living have some tradition, that there was such a person as Braddock; it is so with old Aunt Juno, for she can't be more than ninety years of age."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Juno," said her mistress, "how many children have you to take care of?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, missy, hundred."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How her arithmetic adds to my responsibilities!" said the Doctor. "Why, Aunt Juno, there are not more than fifteen."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah dem die, massa, dem die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor had a fire made for her, and as they were about to leave, old Juno said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missy, Juner wan' say som' 'tickler ting, missy, som' tickler ting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say on, old lady."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missy, Juner wan' som' sugar, som' coffy, and som' tommer, missy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What does she mean by 'tommer', my dear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I can't give you the derivation of the word; but the old negroes call wheat bread, 'tommer'. You will seldom hear a young negro use the word; it seems to be almost obsolete. She means that you must send her some flour with the sugar and coffee; and if you stay much longer, there will be various other little items added."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If you are not in too great a hurry, my dear, I should like to ask her something about Africa."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you won't get much from her; but take that chair, and see what you can make of it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Aunt Juno, do you remember anything about your own country, Africa?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Member, missy, yes, Juner much 'member. Juner big gal when Juner com' 'way; when dey put Juner 'pon dat big hous' 'pon top o' de water, whar Juner neber tun roun'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How did they catch you, and bring you there?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Juner farder gib Juner to one massa; Juner no' cry den, Juner be one conger, eat, eat Juner!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear," said the Doctor, "I have often heard her say the same thing, and I can only understand her, by supposing that the cannibal tribes of Africa selected beforehand those who were to be eaten, and that the selected ones were called congers; and that she was not sorry that she was taken away; because she was destined to be eaten."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do they eat each other now in Africa?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose they do among some of the interior tribes, even now. At the time she speaks of, the tribes on the Gold Coast were mostly cannibals; but their intercourse with European nations since, and missionary efforts, have made them less savage all along the coast than they formerly were."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Would you like to go back to Africa, Aunt Juno"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, missy, Juner no go back, Juner no conger now; Juner no frien' dar now; Juner 'tay wid massa 'til Juner die."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Where do you expect to go when you die?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ole missy tell Juner heap 'bout hebbin, and Juner fader in hebbin, an' say, if Juner good, Juner go to hebbin when she die. She tell Juner 'bout one man die for Juner to car' Juner to hebbin ; an' dat Juner mus' lobe dat man, an' Juner bin try lobe dat man; but mighty hard lobe when Juner no see um. Juner hope see um bimeby."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear," said the Doctor, "I ordered George to get the carriage, that we might take a ride down the new turnpike this morning; and I see it now at the door. You must postpone any further enlightenment from Aunt Juno about Africa, and heaven, until another day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missy, min' de 'ticklar ting."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-bye, Aunt Juno; I will send you some sugar and coffee, and some tommer too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tank you, missy; good-bye, missy, good-bye, massa."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Drive to the new turnpike, George," said the Doctor, as he shut the carriage door. And turning to his wife he said: "Now, my dear Ann, I will complete the imperfect sketch of the character, sentiments, and actings of one, who is now a saint in heaven: I mean my dear mother. I have before told you that my maternal grandfather was a minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and was considered one of the first pulpit orators of the state; and what is of far more importance, was one of the most evangelical divines of his day. My grandmother was a lady suited in every respect to be the wife of such a minister. My mother (an only child) received her education at home, which was by no means an ordinary one, as her father was a man of learning, and instructed her in all the important branches of literature. There was a union of effort in forming her moral and religious character, which was as lovely as could have been hoped for, from such training.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You may suppose that the individual who could obtain the heart and hand of such a woman must have had congenial endowments; and such a man was my father. After the house in which we now live was completed, he brought my mother to Selma, where they received an annual visit from my grandfather and grandmother during their lives; they died within a short time of each other, when I was about eight years of age. My grandfather had never owned a slave, though all the drudgery in his family had been performed by hired slaves. My mother, living in the midst of slavery, and having all her lifetime been waited upon by slaves, when brought to Selma, was not ignorant (as you now are, my Ann) of its relations, and its consequences either for weal or for woe. After I became old enough to understand and enjoy her conversation, she often talked to me upon that subject; she said that very early in life, long before she was married, her mind had been much exercised upon it, that she had prayerfully consulted her Bible, and had come to the conclusion that it was not sinful in the sight of her Heavenly Father, for one human being to hold another in that relation; but, that there were duties and responsibilities growing out of it, the neglect of which was highly sinful. That the slave had a soul to be saved as well as his master; that if the master was inhuman, and regardless of the slave's bodily comforts, and denied him facilities for obtaining religious instruction, he (the master) perilled his own soul. By a strict performance of such duties, she thought slavery might not only be tolerated, but might be made to subserve beneficial purposes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She saw in the black free population around her, no promise of moral good from emancipation; and she came to Selma with a firm reliance on Providence for support, strictly to perform the duties of a mistress. My father's views being in accordance with her own, the old wooden cabins in which the negroes were then living, were exchanged for the stone ones we have just visited. Robin's cabin was arranged differently from the others; the chimneys running up the middle of the others, make the two rooms of equal size; but in Robin's, one room is much larger than the other. My mother intended that large room for a sanctuary, where the negroes might assemble for Sabbath school exercises, and for preaching at such times as our parish minister might appoint for his plain lectures, adapted to their capacities, and for preaching by all other denominations of Christians, black or white. She soon established a Sabbath school, which she conducted herself, my father and some of the neighbours around assisting her. Robin was at that time a young man, waiting in the house. My mother finding him very truthful, tractable, and intelligent, bestowed more time and labour on his instruction than that of the others. She thought if she could qualify him as a teacher he would be of great assistance to her in the Sabbath school; and before her death, she found him sufficiently qualified to take the entire management of it. It was necessary, however, under the law of Virginia, that some white person should always be present, and take part in the instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father and mother suffered their slaves to join any denomination of Christians for which they had a preference. Most generally, throughout this country, negroes who have made a profession of religion, have joined the Baptist denomination. Robin reads with considerable fluency, sometimes exhorts, and I believe he is a sincere Christian. There are some others on the plantation who make a profession of religion. Elce, Robin's wife, is, I fear, a hard case, but I trust Robin's prayers for her may be blessed. I have myself (as I have told you before) joined the Episcopal church; it was what my dear parents unceasingly prayed for, but they did not live to see an answer to their prayers, and a consummation of their hopes. I have determined, my dear Ann, to carry out the wishes of my parents in regard to our slaves; the Sabbath school shall be continued, and every effort in my power made to train them up for heaven; and I trust that I shall find in my dear wife that zeal for the souls of our slaves which shone so brightly in the character of my sainted mother. We are now at the turnpike, and there are the Irish shanties."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What are they, my dear?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Shanty, my dear, comes from two Irish words, which mean an old dwelling; but with us, they mean what you now see before you: huts for human beings to live in. The women and children occupy them in the day, and the men who work on the public road, join them at night. As some of them are sick and may want medicine, we will get out and see them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Jerry," said the Doctor, addressing himself to a man at the door of the first shanty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Och, Docthur, but I'm glad to see you, the day; the ould woman lies very ailing, she is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What's the matter with her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She's got the agy and the faver, your honour, and I has to nurse and cook for the brats all the while. Come in, come in, and the leddy, if she isn't a fearing this stye, as it is, sure 'nough, of a shanty." It was a stye indeed; there lay the mother in one corner on a dirt floor, with nothing between her and the floor but an old worn out blanket, and half covered with something that looked like a black stained saddle-cloth. She was shaking with an ague. There were, in another corner, six children, half naked, and shivering as if they too had agues. The filth and stench was insupportable, and Mrs. Boswell had to make her escape to the fresh air as soon as possible; but the doctor, like a true son of Esculapius, stood his ground and administered medicine to the poor woman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Jerry," said he, "I am astonished to see your family in such a horrid situation. Why don't you get a bed for your poor sick wife to lie upon? A plain common tick, filled with straw, would make her much more comfortable, and there are your children, all naked; the winter's coming on, and if you don't give them some warm clothing they'll freeze in this open shanty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Faith, but there's little the danger o' that; they's used to it, do you see, Docthur; poor people's shildren, your honour, must be brought up hardy; many's the likes o' that in the ould counthry. I works very hard, your honour, for the ould mither and the brats."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here the old lady raised her head, and cried in an unearthly tone:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It's nothing a more but whiskey that's done it, Docthur, it is, it is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't mind what the ould woman says, Docthur, she talks the like o' that when the faver's in the brain, she does."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am afraid there's too much truth in what she says, Jerry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's not the word of truth in it, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take this phial, Jerry, and after the ague is off, give her ten drops every half-hour; do you understand?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Faith but I do, Docthur; I'm up to the draps ony how, many's the one I've give the poor sick crater."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor joined Mrs. Boswell, and they went on to the next shanty; there stood Dennis Flinn at the door.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Dennis," said the Doctor, "how goes the world with you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"As to that, Doctor, I can't say much; the world goes over bad with poor folks, but we'll be better off anyhow than some of our nebburs; the brats are all up, and the ould woman's a going; there's Jerry's wife been tak down with the faver."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you feel very thankful that your family has escaped."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, as to the matter o' that, Docthur, they'll tak' it some other time; there's Patrick O'Nale, in the next shanty, he thought he was too strong for the agy, but it gave him considerable shake, it did; and there's Bet Flannagin, poor cratur', she's been nearer t'other warld than I'd like to be, onyhow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Wouldn't you like to go to a better world than this?' said the Doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When the praist says I'm ready, and my time's come. It's a long time since the praist was bye, and I've got considerable score to wipe off."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Considerable score of what, do you mean?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, sins, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"And do you believe that the priest can wipe out your sins?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, besure, your honour; jis tell him what you've been doin', and he'll wipe it out as sure as my name's Dennis."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You didn't learn that from your Bible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Och! bother, your honour, I've no larning to read the Bible, and if I had, the praist wouldn't let me. The praist reads the Bible for all poor sinners, and they've no business with it onyhow, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Have you never learnt to read?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, your honour, in the ould counthry, the poor people warks so hard they've never a time for larning, no more."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you intend to send your children to school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Och! no, your honour; when the children gets big enough they must go to work, as I have done before them; no time for larning, at all, at all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But suppose you were to send them to the Sunday school?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The praist says the Sabbath's a day of rest, your honour; and the like of us, who work hard all the week, should tak' rest on that day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My negroes work hard all the week, and go to hear preaching, and some go to the Sabbath school; why can't you do the same?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, your honour shouldn't compare your nigger slaves with white people, onyhow; we go when we plase, and stay at home when we please; and your honour knows there's a warld of difference between free people and slaves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If slaves have more learning than free people, more religion than free people, and have better houses to live in than free people, I think the difference is in favour of slaves."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, your honour, there's something in liberty better than the like of onything else in the warld."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How many children have you, Dennis?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Four, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you expect to keep your wife and children in this shanty all the winter? If you do, you should get some more plank and make a floor to your shanty, and stop those large cracks in the roof, and get warm clothing for them; they are almost naked now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"When the money comes in for the wark, your honour, we'll try and do something o' that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There's none a bit of it behind, the jug's tak' it all," said Mrs. Flinn, looking at a jug in the corner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Ah! Dennis, Dennis, that won't do; you ought to think of your wife and children."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's what I'm doin' all the time, your honour; and the more I thinks on the like o' them, the more nade there is for the jug, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Suppose you were to die, Dennis, without having laid up anything for your wife and children; what would these poor creatures do after your death?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, your honour knows that the county would tak' care o' them; the ould woman would be sent to the house where they tends the poor, and the shildren would be bound out to trades, your honour."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Dennis, would it not be better to bind them out now before you die, and let them learn trades, and be taught to read?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Please God, my shildren shall never be taken from their poor mither and bound out to masters while Jenny Flinn's head's hot; no, my shildren shall never be made slaves onyhow," said Mrs. Flinn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If," said the Doctor, "the bare name of freedom is to you meat, drink, and wearing apparel, I will leave you to enjoy it. My dear, we will go to the next shanty and inquire how Patrick O'Neal is."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How are you, to-day, Patrick?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Och! botheration, Docthur, I'm bad enough, bad enough; my head's in a flame, Docthur."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You've been drinking too much, Patrick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That's jist what the owld 'oman said; I drank too much cowld water the morning, I did."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But that is not what I meant; you've been making too free with the whiskey, Patrick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, your honour jist thinks so, because your honour knows how good it is to drive off the cowld when a body's shakin' and shivrin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I now tell you, once for all, that if you do not leave off drinking whiskey, you'll be a dead man in a very short time, Patrick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, then, whiskey and I'll shake hands, Docthur, and be no friends any more, at all, at all, we won't."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is not worth while to give you any more medicine, Patrick; I will not throw away any more physic or advice upon a patient who will neither take the one or listen to the other." In a low voice he said: "We will not go in here, my dear, it is worse than anything we have seen yet."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">George, who had followed with the carriage, already had the door open, and the steps down; and when the Doctor and Mrs. Boswell had taken their seats, he turned back towards Selma.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear Ann," said the Doctor, "I have carried you to-day among our slaves, and into the hut of the free white man. There are no words in our language more indefinite in their meaning than liberty and slavery; they are used for the most part as mere sounds: the one conveying to the mind everything that is precious and to be desired, the other, everything that is horrid and to be avoided, without any reference to the various modifications of each, to be found in different countries, and surrounded by different circumstances. You have seen, today, specimens of those modifications; and your good sense will determine whether the halo around the one, and the dimness around the other, are the unvarying characteristics of each; whether there are most of the true substantial blessings, which make life desirable, in the shanty of Dennis Flinn, or the cabin of Robin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear, I can't hesitate in assigning to the cabin of Uncle Robin a vastly greater amount of every procurement of real happiness in this world, than is to be found in the shanty of Dennis Flinn; but is not the estimate which is formed of the relative excellence of two conditions of life, from viewing the extremes of each, apt to be erroneous?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not allow that your estimate has been the result of a presentation of the extremes of each. To be sure, on our plantation, you see slavery in one of its best modications; but you will see similar modifications of it on many, very many plantations in Virginia; and on the other hand, the Irish shanties do not present liberty in its most degraded modification; in the ould country (as they call it) it is infinitely worse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The carriage was at the door; and Uncle Robin, who had felt himself better, had come down to see his master on business, and was ready to open the door when the carriage stopped. They got out, and Mrs. Boswell went into the house. But the Doctor, supposing that Robin (who was his foreman), wanted to see him on plantation business, remained in the portico.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser," said Uncle Robin, "I want talk to you pon som' very serious business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come along with me, Robin, down the garden walk, and I will hear what you have to say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser, you put me here as foreman 'pon you' plantation, and you specks me to tell you whatsomever I sees goin' wrong pun de place, sir. Now, 'bout two weeks gone, masser, one day 'bout twelve o'clock, I reckon, I goes to de new grown corn fiel' to see how de boys com' on puttin up corn, sir, and when I gets dar, Tom and Dick wos'n dar wid de oder han's. I stay dar least one half a hour, an dey did'n com.' You know, masser, dar's piece a wood ain't cleared in de corner of de fiel'. I creep 'long de fence 'til I com' near de wood, and who should I see, but Tom, and Dick, and one white man, settin down 'long side of one tree, dat had been blow' down; de man was ider readin' or talkin' to 'em; I couldn' see which. I waits dar for som' time, dey didn' see me; after a while I gits up and show'd myself. De boys den dey gits up and comes to whar I was; de white man gits up too, an I sees him put som'thin' in he pocket like one newspaper, an I sees him git over de fence into de road.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I didn' say one word to de boys. I thought, masser, though, I'd keep my eyes 'pon 'um well, masser, I bin think 'pon dis thing often sence, and I didn' know whether 'twould be woth while to tell you, or wait 'til I seed somthin' else in um, an I thought I'd wait. Well, sir, Elce com' home from de kitchen las' night 'bout nine o'clock, an she tell me she hear voice 'long de paff, and she stop and listen, an she hear Tom say to Dick: Der's no danger, Dick, we can get off esy 'nough; dat man you know, say, when we gets 'cross de 'Tomuck, it's all safe, an you know he teld us whar to cros'. Well, Tom, says Dick, I don' want to leave my daddy and mammy, but if you goes, Tom, I goes too. Well, Dick, is it one bargin? Yes, dat 'tis, clinched. Well, Tom, we'll wan' somthin' to eat. Never mind, Dick, I'll put you up to dat. Elce lef' um, den, an if missis hadn' been wid you dis mornin, I'd bin tell you den, masser. I seed dat same white man in one carryall, dat day I car'd de wool to do factry."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Say nothing about this to anybody, Robin, and tell Elce not to mention it to a soul. I will think about it, and see what is to be done."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser, I bin try my bes' 'pon dem boys, but dey too much for me, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my dear," said the Doctor after reaching the parlour, "Robin has just made a communication which turns the dark side of the slavery picture; he has told me that two of my boys have laid a plan for getting off to Pennsylvania; and he thinks that they have been put up to it by some white person, with whom they were seen talking in the woods the other day. I cannot believe otherwise than that those boys have been tampered with by some abolitionist. I won't hint where I think he came from; but I hope for your sake, not from Pennsylvania."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! my dear husband, the Pennsylvanians wouldn't think of doing such a thing."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You don't know, my dear, what the Pennsylvanians are up to, particularly in the matter of runaway negroes, whom they love so well. I have formed one determination, and that is, if any of my negroes run off, and are brought back, they shall never stay here. I can reconcile it to myself under such circumstances, and for certain other offences, to sell them off to the traders."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! my dear, the thought of selling a human being, and separating him from all his relations, is shocking to me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is not so bad as you think, Ann. There are Tom and Dick, just as comfortably situated as they could possibly wish, both having on the plantation, parents, brothers, and sisters; determining to leave them, and be separated from them for ever; I do not see the great difference to their parents, whether it is my act or their act, which causes the separation: in every instance, however, it will be their act, and not mine; for I shall never sell unless they force me to do it by their own act."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the following morning, as Dr. Boswell was about to take his customary ride over his farm, he saw three individuals approaching the house: one, he recognised as a neighbouring farmer, Mr. Green, another, Mr. Green's overseer, Mr. Glover, and the third, Mr. Johnson, a constable. After the usual salutations were exchanged, Mr. Green asked the Doctor to walk with him in the grove before the door, and informed him that he had come on business which was exceedingly disagreeable to him, and he supposed would be equally, if not more so, to himself. "I am come, sir, with a warrant from Squire Brown, to apprehend and carry before the Squire two of your boys, Tom and Dick, under a charge of having perpetrated burglary, by breaking open my meat-house, and stealing therefrom several pieces of bacon. My overseer, Mr. Glover, came upon them just as they were coming out of the house, and saw one of them with a bag, in which he supposed there was meat. There are five hams of bacon missing. They were too fleet for Mr. Glover, but he says he knows your boys Tom and Dick, and seeing them by moonlight, he will swear to their identity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The case is a very clear one, Doctor, and if they are taken before a justice, they must be sent on for trial before a called court, and will probably be condemned to be hung. I have thought, to prevent so disagreeable a termination of this affair, that I would propose to you to sell them off to a trader; and that if you would do that, I would drop further proceedings on the warrant; if not, the warrant will be put into the hands of the constable to be executed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I do not, Mr. Green, see any objection to your proposal. Those two boys, I have reason to believe, are making preparation for a trip to Pennsylvania; and your bacon, no doubt, was intended for that trip. Although I had some hint of their intention, I felt so great a reluctance to selling them, that I had determined to take no notice of the communication. Now, however, the case is altered by their having committed an offence which will cause them either to be hung or sent out of the country, and I shall be reconciled to the necessity of selling them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your negroes, Doctor, treated as they are, I am confident, would have no disposition to leave you, unless they had been tampered with by some white person. There was a very suspicious character seen in the neighbourbood about a fortnight ago, a man in a carryall, pretending to offer some little matters for sale."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I will, Mr. Green, send a note immediately to town, and request Mr. Bosher, the trader, to come down forthwith. There is some danger, however, of the boys making their escape before he arrives, particularly if they should find out that you and Mr. Glover are here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't know, Doctor, that we have been seen by any of your servants but old Robin ; and I suppose he would never do or say anything which he thought contrary to your wishes. We will go away at once."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor, seeing Robin near the house, directed him to get a horse immediately, to take a note to Mr. Bosher. Robin was soon ready, received the note, and was on his way to town in a few minutes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About three o'clock in the afternoon, Dr. Boswell directed Charles, a boy who waited in the house, to carry two chairs into the grove, intending one for himself, and the other for Mr. Bosher when he should arrive; and in a very short time he rode up, with Robin at a respectful distance behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mr. Bosher," said the Doctor, "I have sent for you on business, which is to me new, and extremely disagreeable. Two of my boys have been guilty of an offence for which I shall be forced to sell them, very much against my inclination."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir," said Mr. Bosher, "my trade is that of buying and selling; and if we can agree as to the price, I will soon relieve you of them. I have a fixed price, sir, for tiptop young men, No. 1, that is, six hundred dollars; and if I like them, we will not be long in making a bargain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robin," said the Doctor, "go after those two boys, and bring them here."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We had better go where they are at work," said Mr. Bosher, "for if you send for them they might take the alarm and be off: if I once lay my hands on them I shall not fear their getting away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charles came with a message from his mistress, requesting the Doctor to come into the house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As he entered the parlour, Mrs. Boswell threw her arms around his neck, and in tears said: "Oh! my dear busband, don't, don't sell those boys away from their parents; I can't bear it, indeed I can't. I almost wish I had never come to Virginia to witness such a heartrending scene. Oh! for my sake, let them stay."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear Ann, it is forced upon me; I can't help myself. Those boys intended to leave their parents of their own accord; and now that they have been guilty of breaking open Mr. Green's meat-house, they can't stay here. If I don't sell them, Mr. Green will have them in jail before to-morrow morning, and they will perhaps be condemned to be hung; if not hung, they will certainly be transported. You must make up your mind, Ann, to bear what cannot possibly be avoided."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O! horrid, horrid; I wish there was not a slave upon earth."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor unloosed her hands, which were clasped around his neck, placed her in a chair, and leaving her almost frantic, returned to Mr. Bosher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir, we will now walk to the potato ground, where those boys are at work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they approached, he pointed out two very fine-looking young men in front of the gang, saying: "Those two are Tom and Dick, the boys we were talking about."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They are fine-looking boys, sir. I suppose, Doctor, they are sound in every respect?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Perfectly so, sir, as far as I know and believe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir, I will give you your price. Boys, put down your hoes; (which being immediately done, he said), how would you like to go with me to a warm country, where negroes do nothing but eat and make cotton?" Both answered together,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Not a bit, sir, can't go wid you any how; don't want leave masser for anybody."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You'll have to go, anyhow," said Mr. Bosher (seizing both by the collar); "I have bought you, and you are now my property."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By this time, all the other hands had stopped from work, and a look of horror was on every countenance. The parents of Tom and Dick moved towards, and made, a circle around their master, and with most piteous wail, they all exclaimed: "Oh! masser, you aint dun sell our boys sure 'nough?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Boswell, with tears in his eyes, replied; "Yes, I have been forced to it. I have not only found out that your boys intended to run off to Pennsylvania; but that they have broken open Mr. Green's meat-house, and stolen his bacon; and, if they are not sold, they would in all probability be condemned to be hung."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, masser, if dat's de case, let 'em go; it go mighty hard wid us to part from dem boys, but if dey bring it 'pon deselves, dey mus' 'bide by it. We always telled dem, dat dem white mens we see dem talkin' wid, wou'd bring 'em to trouble som' day or ruther."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinah," said the Doctor, "you and Kate go and put their clothes in as small bundles as possible, and bring them down to the house."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor, Mr. Bosher, the two boys, and Robin, returned to the grove in the yard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now that you have broken the ice, Doctor," said Mr. Bosher, "suppose you sell me some more? I haven't made up my number yet. What will you take for that man there?" (pointing to Robin, who had stopped some distance off.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Take for him, sir!" said the Doctor with vehemence; "why, sir, all the money in Mississippi couldn't buy him. I would just as soon think of cutting off my right hand, as of selling Robin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir, there's no harm done by asking the question; Robin anyhow is too far advanced in years for the Southern market; Southern planters prefer young negroes just grown up; children under six or eight years old, they wouldn't have at all."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I suppose you find it a difficult matter to get as many as you would wish to buy?" said the Doctor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! no, sir, we gets whole lots of runaways: whenever they are caught, they all come into our nets. Our trade would be completely broken up, Doctor, if 'twant for runaway negroes; and I think, sir, we have to thank the abolitionists for that; they entice them off, and we grabs them flying. I know a Yankee trader who gets whole lots in that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Doctor could not stand the parting scene, and went into the parlour. Not finding Mrs. Boswell there, he followed her into her chamber, and found her lying upon the bed, weeping bitterly; he said not a word, but opened his desk and deposited the money he had received from Bosher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Bosher took the boys off, and their parents in deep grief returned to their work. Robin followed them to the potato ground, and said: "Well, I trust dis gwine be a good lessin to de young people 'pon dis plantation; dey got one of de very bes' masters dat niggers eber had; and for him to be force' wid tear runnin' down he face to sell 'em cause dey misbehabe, is raly too bad. I knowd what 'twould com' to at last; dem boys bin too fond of leffin der work, and talkin' wid strange white folks, and see what it don com' to: dey been 'ticed to go off, and dey mus' den steal somethin' to carry 'long to eat."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robin," said Dinah, "I bin mistrus' my boy Tom for sum time; he ain bin like what he used to be for sum weeks; he bin sassy to he daddy an me, an a don' care sort of 'haviour 'bout 'im. Robin, I never did thought Tom would broke open house and steal; but, Robin, he did do dat sure as you an' I's alive. When I was rummaging for he clothes up in de loff, I fine a bag wid five piece of bacon in it, and dar 'tis now, Robin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinah," said Robin, "dat bag musn' stay any longer 'mong you' stuff; 'twill bring trubble 'pon us all if it do. De Lord will punish us for dat accussed thing as he did de Isralites for de wedge o' gold. You mus' jus' go at once, and car' it to masser."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Robin, I was so 'stress' 'bout my boy, dat I didn' know what to do; but you's right, Robin, and I'll go dis minit and car' it to masser."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser, here's Mr. Green bacon I fine up in my loff, when I bin hunt for Tom clothes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dinah, that is proof positive enough that Tom broke open Mr. Green's smoke-house and stole his bacon. You were right, Dinah, in bringing it to me. Go into the chamber and see your mistress, and when you go back, tell Robin to get a horse and come to the house for this bag of bacon. It must be sent to Mr. Green."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How you do, dis ebenin, missis?" said Dinah, as she approached the bed where her mistress was lying, with her face and head under the counterpane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! Dinah, Dinah, what a shocking thing it was to sell your poor child away from you! I feel as if I never should be happy again."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, missis, 'taint wuf while, madam, to grieve so much. To be sure, I does feel mighty bad at partin' wid Tom, but he bring it all 'pon heself, madam. If he had been satisfied here, dis wouldn' bin happin. Tom had fine chance; good house to liv' in, good clothes to war', and Robin try he bes' to giv' him good 'struction in de Sun-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">day school, madam, and he daddy and I giv' him good device out o' school; 'twas he own fault, missis. Masser wou'd never hav' sell him, if he hadn' brake open dat hous'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you think our boys did certainly break open that house and steal the meat?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No doubt on it, madam, I dun fine de bag o' meat up in my loff, an nobody but Tom could have bin put it dar, madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One thing, Dinah, which made me take on so much about it was, that I thought it possible, they might have been innocent of the charge."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! missis, you may depend dem boys was guilty. I hope de Lord will pardon um, and bring um to see der wickedness. I does wish it cou'd bin so happen dat dey might bin stay here and git more 'struction from Robin, but de Lord chuse sen' dem away, and we mus' 'bide by his 'cision, madam; you sarvant, missis."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Boswell, finding that Dinah was not so overwhelmed with grief as she expected, and that she bore the separation from Tom with commendable resignation, began to think that she herself had given way too much; and adjusting some little derangement in her person, consequent upon the violence of her grief, she repaired to the parlour, and found the Doctor reclining on the sofa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Uncle Robin wants you at the door, my dear," she said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robin, take that bag of meat and carry it to Mr. Green, and tell him that Tom's mother found it up in her loft."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear, I think you have grieved more for Tom and Dick than their parents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You must consider, my dear husband, that, although I have heard of this thing at a distance, it is the first time I have ever corne in contact with it. Their parents, I suppose, have become familiar with it, from its everyday occurrence around them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear Ann, I find no fault in your exhibition of feeling; I like a soft heart, and I had much rather attempt to harden a soft one (if necessary), than to soften one upon which you could make no more impression than upon a millstone. Of all animals in creation, I think a female devoid of feeling and sensibility is the least engaging. It will be necessary perhaps to harden that little heart of yours, as our kind friends the abolitionists may make frequent drafts upon your sympathy. It is astonishing to me that they won't mind their own business, and let us alone, to manage ours as we think proper."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My, dear, their intentions must be good; if they err it must be from mistaken philanthropy; they can have no other motive than a humane desire to better the situation of these poor creatures."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"They have sense enough, my dear, to know that every effort they make to entice a slave from his master, injures not only those enticed away, but all the others. The laws regulating that kind of property are made more stringent, their privileges are abridged, and they are rendered unhappy by being made dissatisfied with their situation. Even those who are successful in making their escape, in most instances, exchange comfort and ease for a life of wandering to and fro, without the means of support; and of abiding inquietude and apprehension, lest they should be recaptured. And, when recaptured, they are in every instance subject to all the horrors of sale, so pathetically depicted by abolition writers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Their motive is miscalled, when denominated mistaken philanthropy; there can. be no mistake about it. They know very well, that in fact they themselves are the very bitterest enemies of those whom they pretend to succour. Their true motive is to be found either in a vain desire to set themselves up as philanthropists, or to agitate for political effect; which latter is the most prevalent motive, if we form our judgment from the characters who lead and control the masses. It is a most preposterous notion, that corrupt politicians, working their way to inglorious preferment, are vicegerents of heaven, comissioned to do away an institution which has existed through out all ages, even in a theocracy. Its presumption can be equalled by nothing but its folly."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Robin," said Mr. Green (as Robin rode into the yard), "what have you in your bag?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your bacon, sir. Tom mammy fine it in her loff, and masser tell me to bring it to you, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Carry it round to the smoke-house, Robin; and I'll get the key."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After he had opened the door, he said:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Now, Robin, empty the bag, and we will compare it with this bacon. I cut my hams somewhat different from most people."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No mistake, masser," said Robin, "dis your bacon; nobody else in dis neighbourhood cuts der hams in dat way, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I think it probable, Robin, that having to break open this house last night, and being seen by Mr. Glover, prevented your boys from going off. I have just heard that two of Major Scott's boys, and two of old Mr. Preble's, went off last night, and I suppose it was all planned that they should go off together."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Very like, sir, very like. I s'pose, masser, old Mr. Preble won't try to git he boys back, cause he always sayin' what bad thing slabery is?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Let him alone for that, Robin; George Preble and two other young men went off in pursuit, as soon as it was known that they were gone. I haven't heard whether Major Scott employed anybody to go after his. These abolitionists, Robin, when they own negroes, are the very worst masters in the country. I shall be very glad to hear that old Preble's negroes get off; he gave one of those boys a cruel flogging, some days ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, masser, I don' know how 'tis; dey always pityin' poor niggers, and 'suadin' dem to run off, and still, when dey have um, dey mighty bad to um; and when dey git um way back dar north, dey let um go almos' naked, and let um almos' starve."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"The fact is, Robin, they don't care half as much about negroes as we do, but they take pleasure in teasing and vexing us about them; and that's the whole secret of the business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"'Tis mighty unchristian, masser, for dem to do so to der nabbers; de bible say we should do to oders as we wish dem to do to us; and I's sure dey wou'dn' like you, masser, to take der property."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I had forgotten to ask you, Robin, whether you saw Mr. Bosher?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh yes, sir; he did cum 'long wid me, and dun take dem boys off, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was very sorry, Robin, to force your master to sell those boys, as I know he is much opposed to selling negroes. They are going, however, to a country where the labour is very light; and you know, Robin, it is the master's interest, everywhere, to take care of his slaves. It is certainly a great deal better for them, than if they had gotten off, and gone to a free state, where they would have found it very difficult to got work enough to support them comfortably."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dem boys, masser, whether der situation is better or wus, have deselves only to blame; der's no people better off dan my masser's servants. Masser, now I think on it, will you let you people know dat de Reverend Mr. Grattan gwine preach to de black people, nex' Sunday ebenin, in my cabin?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Robin; and I will try and make them go. What time do you hold your Sunday school? I should like some of my little ones to go, if you will take them in."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, masser, as for dat, I don' know; we got heap o' young ones o' our own dat go; and you see, masser, I's almos' de only teacher: Dinah does help me little. I hopes my young missis will help after while; and der's Miss Ebelina Preble, she promise com'; and if we kin git dat much 'ecruit to our teachers, masser, I'll let you know, and you kin sen' some o' your'n. Der's your boy Jim, sir, would make fus' rate teacher, if he would com'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I will speak to Jim, Robin, and I think he will be inclined to go, as he is religious, and I hope inclined to do good in that way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sunday school, properly tended, masser, mighty good thing for de souls of young folks. Well, masser, can't stay any longer from my masser's business; your sarvant, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Good-bye, Robin. Tell your master that I am very thankful to him for sending the bacon."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Robin had put away his horse, he went to the house to see his master.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Robin," said the Doctor, "I suppose Mr. Green was very glad to get his bacon again?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, masser; he say he mighty thankful to you for sen'in' it. He telled me, masser, dat two o' Major Scott's boys, and two o' old Mr. Preble's dun gon' off; and dat Mas' George Preble dun gon' after um, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope no more of ours will take such notions into their heads. You should take every opportunity of talking to them, Robin, and telling them that the design of these abolitionists is not to do them good; that the inevitable consequence will be, that they will be hunted like wild beasts, that their lives will be endangered, and that, as soon as they get into a free state, they will find that their pretended friends won't do for them what they promised. They have plenty of white people there to labour for them, and they won't employ the blacks. There is our neighbour, old Mr. Preble, who pretends to hate slavery, and as soon as his negroes run off, he is the very first to send after them."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser, I don't fear any more of ourn will go off. I does give um, sir, line 'pon line, and precep' 'pon precep'; we dun got rid now o' de only two 'pon dis plantation I had any mistrus' of. Whar you wan' dem taturs put, masser?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the barn, Robin, for the present; see that they are removed to the cellar before the hard frosts come."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIII. A TRIP TO BOSTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Chapters 3-12 (pp. 54-239) omitted.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ARRANGEMENTS had been made by Mr. Benson to leave for Boston, on the day after the sale: he, his wife, Mr. Hicks, and Mammy Betty, left Major Scott's early in the morning of that day for the depot. Mrs. Scott and the Major had suffered so much in anticipation of that event, that the reality was rather a relief than otherwise. Amelia promised, when she left, to pay them a visit at the end of twelve months; to which Mr. Benson consented conditionally, if trade was slack in the following June. We will follow them to Boston; nothing of importance occurring in their journey, except that an effort was made in Philadelphia to prevail upon Mammy Betty to leave them. Old Mr. Benson's house was on State street, at which they arrived in the afternoon of the fourth day from Virginia. Amelia was received by her father and mother-in-law, not with that warmth of affection with which a Bostonian daughter-in-law would have been received in Virginia, but, with as much kindness and politeness as the old people were capable of manifesting. Mr. Benson, Sr., was prototype of Mr. Benson, Jr. Trade and its incidents, with him, never gave way to any protracted exhibition of kindness or politeness; and, in a few minutes after his first introduction, he was in his counting-room again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Benson the elder was a middle-aged lady, cold and formal in her manners, extremely neat and precise in her dress, the style of which was that which prevailed in New Enyland a hundred years before; she was unquestionably of Pilgrim descent, and, to all appearance, not many generations distant from Pilgrims of the olden time. She and her son conducted Amelia to the parlour, and Mammy Betty, not knowing where else to go, followed them. Mrs. Benson the elder eyed the latter with intense curiosity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robert," she said, "who have you brought here with your bride? I trust you haven't brought a slave along with you, my son?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mother, you know there can be no slaves in Massachusetts; this old woman was a slave in Virginia, but she is now free, and as she is very fond of Amelia, having nursed her, I consented to her coming with us; we should have to hire a servant at any rate for our chamber, and she will answer very well as Amelia's chamber cleaner, at lower wages too than we could possibly get a white one."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You are so accustomed to black waiters, child, that you don't want to be waited on by white ones, I guess?" addressing herself to Amelia. "Moth—moth—Mrs. Benson," said Amelia, "I have no dislike to white servants, madam, but my old Mammy Betty and myself are so fond of each other that we couldn't bear to be separated."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is it possible, child, you call her mammy? That's like the poor people here, who, when they say mammy, mean mother."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In Virginia, madam, all the children call their black nurses mammy."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, child, it does sound mighty strange; the people here will laugh at you, child, but I guess it won't be long before this old woman you call mammy will take herself off from a person who has so long held her in bondage."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, missis," said Mammy Betty, "I'll never leff my 'Melia, madam, while my head hot; ebery body in dis big town, madam, can't 'duce me to leff my 'Melia."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, old woman, if you stay here, you'll have to keep Amelia's room very nice, and bring her water, and in the winter keep her in fire."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missis, madam, I kin do all dat, if so be dat de wood ant too far to brung, madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How curious she talks, child; is that the way the slaves in Virginia all talk? You needn't be afraid, old woman, of having too much to do—the wood and water won't be very far off. Amelia, child, I hear the bell ringing for supper; come along with me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whar mus' I go, missis?" said Mammy Betty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, you don't expect to go with us to supper, I hope we don't eat with blacks in this country."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dey don' do so nudder in Fugginny, madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Do you go up those stairs, and turn into the first right hand room, that's Amelia's room, and I will send you some supper. Does she know which is her right hand, child?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, madam," answered Amelia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When supper was over, the old lady carried her daughter-in-law up into the room which had been prepared for her, and which had all the comforts and adornments of a bridal chamber. Mrs. Benson the elder opened a door into a small apartment, and told Mammy Betty that although it had been intended as a closet to Amelia's room, she might occupy it as a bedroom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benson, Sr., and his son repaired to the countingroom when the ladies left the supper-table. "Robert," said the old man, "how did you make out in Virginia; any cash, my son?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, yes, sir, I got property which I converted into cash; the old gentleman gave me ten negroes, which I sold for about four thousand dollars."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Upon my word, Robert, it won't tell well in Boston, that you have been selling slaves in Virginia; but as that was your wife's dowry, and you were not allowed to bring them here, I don't see how you could have done otherwise."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, sir; if we come lawfully into possession of what is property in the South, in our hands it must carry along, and be subject to all the incidents of property; and sale and barter, you know, are its incidents."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I see, Robert, you have brought an old woman with you; what are you going to do with her?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have just told mother of our arrangements in regard to her; she is an old woman much attached to Amelia, and Amelia to her; she will live with us on very moderate wages, and will do all the work of a chamber servant."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But she is old, and can't be useful many years; what will you do with her when she is past work?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My father-in-law, Major Scott, will take her back at any time; and at some future period, when she seems to be failing, Amelia and I can take her back to Virginia, and leave her there. Well, father, how has trade gone in my absence?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It has been as brisk as it usually is in the summer season; there's every promise of a good fall business."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Any shaking, father, within the last month?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, the firm of Coots &amp; Co. like to have gone; we are clear of that concern, however; I saw the danger ahead, and prepared for it. Benson &amp; Son are off their paper, but I think they will recover from the shock and keep up."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Their conversation about trade and its incidents was kept up until a late hour. Mrs. Benson saw but little of her husband during the day; her mother-in-law was not very agreeable to her, and she was perhaps less so to the old lady; consequently, she spent most of her time in her own room, where she enjoyed the company of her mammy more than she would have done even that of her husband. In the afternoon of the third day after their arrival in Boston, old mammy Betty came suddenly into the chamber and threw herself on the floor, frightened almost into a state of insensibility, exclaiming, "Oh, my 'Melia, my 'Melia, I don' see jus' now in de street one crazy man, an' if you b'leve me, he jump at me jus' like he gwine seize me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, mammy, don't be frightened; he can't hurt you now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, my 'Melia, he's great big nigger man, he hardly got any clothes on, an' when I fus' see him he was bent almos' double, coughin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mammy, I don't reckon he's mad, it's some poor old beggar; he didn't intend to hurt you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, he did, 'Melia; if he had cotched me he'd a tare my very life out o' me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman had to go into the street every afternoon for water; the next time she went she came back, if possible more frightened than before; she hastily put down her pitcher, and wringing her hands, cried, "Oh, my 'Melia, I don see dat mad man 'gin; he follow me to de do', and jus' miss ketchin' me by my frock; he now at de do' if you b'leve me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, I will hoist the window, and see what he wants."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She hoisted the front window, and saw a black man standing before the door, half bent, and coughing. He had a few rags around him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"What do you want here, my man?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missis, I seed one ole black 'oman go in at dis do', an' I knows her, madam. Please, missis, ax her to come down here; I wan' talk wid her. I wouldn' hut her, missis, for anything in de worl'; I loves her too much, missis, to hut 'er. Ax her please come down."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a great deal of persuasion, she consented to go, provided her 'Melia would hoist the window again, and look out while she was talking with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As soon as she reached the door, the man threw his arms round her neck, burst into tears, and said, "Mammy Betty, don' you know Tom?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My goodness!" said she; "is dis my masser boy Tom? Oh! Tom, I's so glad to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, how you lef' my poo' mammy an' daddy? Mam Betty, I ain' bin see any peace sence I lef' my masser house. Oh, Mam Betty, if I was but back dar 'gin, how happy I would be! I mos' gone in 'sumption, Mam Betty; I bin 'blige to sleep out 'pon de ground, and I shill neber git shut of dis cole I bin cotch. Tell me, Mam Betty, what brung you to dis place?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, you daddy an' mammy was bofe well; and dey was moughty sorry when you lef'. I com' here, Tom, wid my 'Melia, who dun marry one man in dis very house, Tom."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Was dat my Miss 'Melia dat hice de winder?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Tom; she dun gone from dare, now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! what shill I do? I does wan' go back so much to Fugginny, to see my daddy an' my mammy, my masser and my missis, an' all de black folks. Oh! Mam Betty, ax my young missis to sen' her pa word I's here, an' dat I does wan' so much to go back to he plantation. Oh! Mam Betty, if I could but lay dis poo' achin' head 'pon my mammy bres, how happy I should be! Poo' Tom gwine neber see he daddy an' he mammy 'gin. Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! what is I to do?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, you does 'stress me mightly; I wishes I could do somethid' fur you. I'll ax my 'Melia to git you som' clothes, Tom."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, I almost starve', an' mos' naked, but I don' wan' anything to eat or to war. All I now want in dis worl' is to go back home, and die 'pon my mammy bres."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, what becom' o' Harry?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Harry dun ded, Mam Betty. When we fus' com' here, we gits som' wuck 'pon de street; an' Harry an' one white man begin to quarrel, an' de white man say, 'If ebery master had he due, you wou'dn' be here now,' meaning dat Harry was one runaway; and Harry, thinkin' he was free, strike de white man, and he tak' up one bar o' iron an' hit Harry 'pon de head, an' kill him, Mammy Betty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, does dey let white man kill niggers, here?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Dey try him fur it, Mam Betty, but t'other white mens swar Harry was gwine kill him; an' dey let him off. Dese very folks who tell Tom he was runaway, if my masser was to come here fur me to-morrow, would swar dey know'd I was born free."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom was too much distressed by his cough to say more. Mammy Betty told him he must meet her at the door the next afternoon about the same time. She returned to the chamber, told Mrs. Benson who he was, and what had passed between them. Mrs. Benson said she would write to her pa after supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At the supper table, Mrs. Benson the elder said to her child, "What is the matter with the old woman? I met her running up stairs very much alarmed, as I thought."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"She saw in the street, madam, a negro man, and supposed he was crazy; but she afterwards found out, that he was a man who had run away from my pa, some months ago. Poor fellow, he is in a mighty bad way, and wants to get pa to come for him; and I'm going to write to pa this night, and ask him to come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Amelia," said Mr. Benson, Sr., "I shouldn't like that any owner of a runaway slave should be informed by any member of my family where he might find and recover him; and I had rather you wouldn't write."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He belongs to pa, sir, and don't you think pa ought to have him?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"By no means; your father had no right to hold him in bondage; and as he has escaped, it would be cruel to give information where he was."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My Mammy Betty says he's mighty low in consumption; he can't work, and I think it would be more cruel to let him stay here and starve to death, than for my pa to come after him, and take care of him until he dies; at my pa's house, he would be with his father and mother, too."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But if he gets well, child," said Mrs. Benson the elder, "after your father got him back, he would make him work as a slave again, and that would never do."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He's never going to work any more, from what my Mammy Betty tells me." Saying this, she left the table, and returned to her room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mammy, these people say I mustn't write to pa about Tom; but I will write, no matter what they say."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benson, Jr., was in the habit of writing letters on business after he retired to his chamber at night, and Mrs. Benson found pen, ink, and paper at hand. She wrote a letter to her father, from which we extract that portion which relates to Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My good old Mammy Betty saw your man Tom in the street, and he begged her to ask me to write and request that you would come for him. Please, pa, come."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning the old woman carried the letter to the post-office; and when she returned from the office, she said to Mrs. Benson:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My 'Melia, I does wish poo' Tom had one blanket, som' baker bread, an' som' tea, an' som' sugar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish he had, my dear mammy; but I haven't one cent of money."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, I hab plenty, my 'Melia; Mas' George an' my Julia giv' me heap when we did com' 'way."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She paraded the foot of an old yarn stocking, and with much delight exhibited two dollars and fifty cents; she put it carefully back in the stocking, which she wrapped in a piece of newspaper, and went out upon a shopping expedition, in which angels might have participated. In about an hour she returned, and the display of her purchases gave her 'Melia and herself more heartfelt satisfaction than is experienced by the votaries of fashion, after lavish expenditure upon jewelry, silks, and velvet. She had only fifty cents left, which was put away carefully in her box; that day she spent in restless anxiety for the hour of meeting with Tom to arrive. In the afternoon she told Mrs. Benson she would go into the kitchen and make Tom some tea, and put it into a bottle for him to carry to his home; where that was, she had not yet learned from Tom. When she was about pouring the boiling water into the tea-pot, Mrs. Benson the elder came in, and said, "What in the world are you about, old woman?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I dun buy som' tea, madam, for dat poo' half-starved cretur, Tom, my masser black man who run away from masser. Nobody in dis town seem to take any pity 'pon him, and I mus' do what I kin for him, 'cause he bin my feller sarvant in ole Fugginny, an' I knows he mammy an' he daddy, madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If he's so poor and so sick and half starved, as you say he is, the town authorities had better send him to the almshouse."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Does dey sen' black folks to dat sort o' house, madam?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, everybody that's sick and poor and naked."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I's sure, den, madam, dey ought to bin sen' Tom dar, long time ago."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Your masser, as you call him, hadn't ought to have held him in bondage; you see what's come of it, old woman."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Madam, if Tom had stay where he was, dis thing never wou'd bin com' 'pon him; he'd bin well now, madam, an' look mighty diff'rent from what de poo' cretur look now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When her tea was ready, she carried it up into her chamber, put it into a bottle, and carried the bread, tea, and blanket to the door, where she found Tom waiting for her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Tom, how you do to-day, my chil'?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, I gwine mighty fas'. I does feel poorlier to-day den I bin feel yit; and de misry in my bres' is more den I can 'scribe."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, here's som' good tea, and som' good baker bread, and one good blanket for you, chil', an' I hopes you'll feel better, 'fore to-morrow."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, I doesn' thinks I shill eber feel better in dis worl'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, does you eber pray to de Lord to pardon you' sins? does you eber think of leavin' dis worl', and whar you goin' to when you die?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, I does try heap to 'member what I bin hear Mr. Grattan say in my masser house, an' what I bin hear Uncle Robin say in he cabin, over at Dr. Boswell; but, Mam Betty, I's bin so sinful, I fears de Lord ain' gwine pardon me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, did you neber hear Uncle Robin say dat de blood of Jesus Christ can 'stroy the biggest sins, dat you mus' pray to him to take he blood an' wash you wid it?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Mam Betty, I bin hear 'im say so, an' I try o' nights to pray; but den I begin to think 'pon my daddy an' my mammy, an' den I doos forgit all 'bout prayin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, now, Tom, dat de very thing dat ought to make you pray dat the Lord will let you meet you daddy an' mammy in Hebbin."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, does you thinks I bin sin when I run away an' lef' my masser?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, dat I does, Tom; de Lord say servants mus' 'bey der masters; an' in de room of 'beyin' you masser, Tom, you bin runaway from him; and besides, Tom, de Lord giv' you good sitiation, an' you lef' it, an' brung all dis 'pun you. Don' you call dat sinnin', Tom?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh! Mam Betty! Mam Betty! I is so sorry for what I bin do! Does you thinks de Lord will pardon me, Mam Betty?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Tom, if you pray to him to take dat sin, an' all you oder sins, an' wash 'em wid de blood of he son. Where 'bouts does you stay o' nights, Tom?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"One hos'ler, Mam Betty, giv' me leave to sleep 'pun de hay in he stable-loff; an' I is gittin' so weak, Mam Betty, I's feard dat I can't git here 'gin. I wan' show you whar de stable is; an', if I don' com' back here tomorrow evenin', you mus' com' an' see me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She went with him to the next cross street, and he pointed out the stable in which he lodged; when they parted, she said, "Tom, I gwine hav' som' mo' tea ready fur you to-morrow evenin', an' you mus' com' if you kin; an' 'member, Tom, what I bin talk to you 'bout."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I'll try, Mammy Betty; an' I mighty thankful to you, seein' you is de only frien' I got in dis worl'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tom came the three following afternoons, and received his tea and bread, but Mammy Betty discovered at every visit that he was getting weaker, and his cough more troublesome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mammy Betty Handing Tom his Blanket and Tea. Page 250.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the fourth afternoon he was not at the door; she concluded that he was worse, and determined to go to the stable. When she got there, she inquired of the hostler if that was the stable in which a sick negro man slept; and being informed that it was, she requested to be permitted to go up and see him; he pointed to a ladder, which she ascended; although it was early in the afternoon, it was quite dark in the loft; in a low voice she said "Tom!" no answer being returned, she was much alarmed; she repeated, "Tom!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is dat Mam Betty?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, Tom, 'tis me."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mam Betty, I is so glad to see you. I is too weak to go up an' down dat ladder, an' I couldn't go to see you. Cum here an tak' hold o' my han', Mam Betty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She followed the direction of his voice, and took hold of his hand; it was hot and wet with clammy perspiration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, I brung you som' tea an' bread."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mam Betty, how good you is to po' Tom; but I can't eat anything, now. Mam Betty, when you call me I was 'sleep, and dream I seed my daddy an' my mammy; an' I thought mammy say, 'What make you go'way from us, Tom?' an' I say, 'Mammy, I bin mighty sorry eber sence I leff you;' and den she say, 'You dun com' back, Tom, an' say you mighty sorry, an' now I tak' you to my arms, an' I is so glad to see my poo' boy, 'gin'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Tom, dat's jest de way wid you Farder in Hebben if you tell Him you sorry, and dun com' back to Him, He'll tak' you in He arms an' say He so glad to see you com' back 'gin, jest like you mammy in dat dream."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mam Betty, I bin pray heap sence I see you, an' I hope de Lord dun wash my sins in dat blood you tell me 'bout. Mam Betty, is Miss 'Melia bin hear from her pa, yit? Oh, Mam Betty, all I want now is to git back an' die in my daddy an' mammy house. I's 'fraid poo' Tom gwine die here pun dis bay; an' when you gone, no frien' here wid 'im. Oh, Mam Betty, if my daddy an' mammy was jus' but here to close dese eyes, I could die in peace. Oh, Tom, Tom, what mak' you do so? to lef you daddy and mammy, and com' here to die in dis lof'."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The old woman had told Mrs. Benson that she was afraid Tom was worse, from his not meeting her at the door; and said if she found him very low, she should like to stay with him all night. Mrs. Benson with great reluctance consented, and throwing her arms round her neck, gave her a kiss at parting. As soon as she felt the cold clammy sweat of death upon his hand, Mammy Betty had determined to stay with him; she sat by him the whole night, and talked much to him about his God and Saviour; about midnight he seemed inclined to sleep; a still, solemn darkness reigned in that loft until the dawn of day. The old woman became alarmed—she took his hand—it was cold in death. There he lay, a corpse, with his blanket around him, a monument to Northern philanthropy, entwined in the drapery of Southern barbarity. We will direct the hand of Mammy Betty while she sketches an inscription in her own language. "Poo' Tom! dey didn't treat you as dey promise to do; if you had bin know you own good, you wouldn't bin here now." It is hoped that the hostler, for his own comfort's sake, informed the town authorities that there was a dead body in that loft, and that it was decently disposed of.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Betty restrained the violence of her grief until she arrived at home. As soon as she entered the chamber, she threw herself into a chair, and in a flood of tears, exclaimed, "My 'Melia, my 'Melia, poo' Tom dun dead." Mrs. Benson, not ordinarily very sensitive, appeared to sympathize deeply with her mammy at the death of Tom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few days after that event she received a letter from her father, from which we extract that portion which was responsive to Tom's application.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear Amelia:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I received this morning your letter requesting me to come for poor Tom, which I must decline doing for several reasons: in the first place, I know it is highly probable that the people of your town would not suffer me to bring him back to Virginia; in the next, my neighbours would be up in arms against my keeping a negro who had run away to a free state, and been recovered; and after the trouble and vexation attending his recovery (if it was effected), I should be obliged to sell him to a trader. I am truly sorry to hear of his nakedness and cough; enclosed are twenty dollars, with which you must get him clothing, and whatever is necessary to make him comfortable."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Mammy Betty," said Mrs. Benson, "now that Tom is dead, you must have back your two dollars out of this note, and I will send the balance back to pa."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear 'Melia, when I did buy dem things for Tom, I neber 'spect anybody was gwine pay me back de money. I ain gwine take it, 'Melia, dat I aint."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My dear mammy, pa's got plenty of money, and you have but a very little left; and you must take it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"No, dat I won't, my 'Melia; you s'pose I gwine take pay for de little I gin poo' Tom? Neber, no neber; poo' Tom dead now, an' de poo' feller welcome to what I bin giv' 'im."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, Mammy Betty, you can do as you please; but if pa knew that you had spent two dollars for Tom, and that I had not paid you back, he would not like it, I know."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"He ant 'bliged to know anything 'bout it; jest sen' back he money, and say nothin' to anybody 'bout what I bin do for poo' Tom."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Old woman," said Mrs. Benson the elder, as she unexpectedly entered the chamber, "I have just heard that you were out all night a few nights ago; and I am come to let you know that we don't suffer our servants to be out prowling about the streets at night."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missis, madam, I ain' bin prowlin' 'bout de street; I did stay out, madam, all night, but I stay in one hay-loft wid a poo' dyin' feller sarvant, madam. I's sure I wouldn't lef my 'Melia, an' my own bed, for sich a place as dat, but dat I thought 'twas my duty, madam, to be wid him when he fetch he last bref."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't see why it was your duty to be there with him, when there are so many other people in this town who might attend to the sick."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, missis, der's plenty oders mought bin tend to him, madam, in dis town, but from der lettin' Tom go 'bout as he did, an' die whar he did, dey can't be willin' to do much for black folks here, madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"There are plenty of houses here in town, old woman, where they would have taken him in, if he had applied."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Missis, if I had bin knowd dat, I'd a ax you to take him in, some o' dem ebenins when he was standin' here at the do', madam."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We are not fixed, old woman, for taking in such people. I wouldn't have a dirty negro man to be staying in my kitchen for any consideration. I'm sure I shouldn't be able to eat a meal while such as he remained there."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Madam, I reckon dar's heap o' tothers in dis town, ain't fixed for takin'in sich a poo' naked cretur' as he wus."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, old woman, there was certainly no necessity for his going off to a stable, and dying there with the brutes. Was there nobody with him when he died, but you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Madam, I hope Tom Lord an' Saviour, who wus born in one stable, wus wid Tom when he die dar."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I wish from my heart, old woman, there was no such thing as slavery in the world; it is really horrible to think upon the misery it produces."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, missis, I neber seed sich misry as poo' Tom's, tell I com' here, madam, an' if all de folks 'way down home, yonder, wus to set all der niggers free, we'd hab plenty o' Tom misry, madam."</field>
      <field name="heading_text">CHAPTER XIV. CRUEL MERCIES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. BENSON the younger was visited by many of the Boston ladies who were in that circle in which the Benson family moved. We regret that she was so poor a sample of Virginia refinement and cultivation. Many were the remarks which were made about her simplicity, and her calling an old black woman mammy; but it was generally allowed that she was good enough for that plodding, sombre, disagreeable-looking creature, Bob Benson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The months of July and August were mostly spent by her in receiving and returning visits, and in long conversations in her own room, with her dear Mammy Betty. Occasionally, Mrs. Benson the elder would come with her work, and spend some time in her chamber, and she returned the old lady's visits with as much punctiliousness as she did those of other visiters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About the first of September, when she was returning from a morning call, she was overtaken without umbrella, by a shower, and before she reached home was completely drenched. That night she complained of hoarseness and sore throat, and her mammy thought she had a slight fever when she retired to bed at a much earlier hour than usual. When Mr. Benson, Jr., came up to bed, the old woman said she thought her 'Melia was right sick. "Oh! she'll be well in the morning," he replied. Mammy Betty retired to her closet, not to sleep, however. About the middle of the night she went to her bedside, and called her in a low voice: "'Melia—my 'Melia!" "I'm not asleep, mammy," she answered, "my head aches so bad, and my temples throb so I can't sleep."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, my chil', I'll set by you, wid my han' 'pun you head; may be dat will do you som' good."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She remained by her until the day dawned, when she left the room to get her water, and some wood to make a little fire, as it was a damp drizzling morning. When she returned, Mr. Benson had dressed himself, and gone down to his counting-room as usual.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"How you do now, my chil'?" she inquired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, Mammy Betty, I'm mighty sick; I don't think I ever felt before as I do now."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You eyes does look mighty red; does de pain you, my chile?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, mammy, I'm in pain all over."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"My 'Melia, you ought to hav' one doctor to see you."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Oh, no, mammy, I hope I shall get better after a while."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After the old woman had made a little fire, she went down and told Mrs. Benson the elder, that she thought her 'Melia was mighty sick, and asked her to go up and see her. She went up immediately, and finding her much more unwell than she had expected, sent the old woman down to ask Robert to come up. When he came into the room, she said,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Robert, indeed I think Amelia is very sick; she should take some medicine, but you know we don't keep medicine, and if we did we don't know what kind to give. Don't you think we had better send over for Dr. Reid?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, mother, if you think her very sick, I will go over myself for the Doctor."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He soon returned with the Doctor, who examined the symptoms of her disease, and pronounced her quite sick. He gave her some medicine, and said he hoped she would be better after a while; that he would be back again, towards the afternoon. Mr. Benson, Jr., took a seat by his wife's bed, remained about an hour, and then returned to his business, leaving his mother and her mammy to take care of her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The medicine which she had taken was all thrown off her stomach in a very short time after it was administered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When the Doctor returned, towards night, he found her much worse, and repeated the dose which he had given in the morning. He told Mrs. Benson that the fever was increasing in violence, that she was a little flighty, and that if the last dose did not produce a change for the better, she would have a severe spell. Mammy Betty overheard what he said, and it was with much difficulty she could be restrained from breaking out into violent grief. The Doctor told her that her young mistress's recovery depended in a great measure upon her being kept quiet. With much exertion she suppressed her grief while in the chamber. She often went, however, into her closet, shut the door, and gave vent to her tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Benson, Jr., was informed by the Doctor that his wife's situation was dangerous. As soon as he heard it he left his business, went up into the chamber, where he remained all the afternoon, assisting in nursing her. She had a restless, sleepless night, and on the following morning the Doctor pronounced her in imminent danger. Her fever raged with such violence as to take from her all consciousness. It caused exquisite torture to Mammy Betty, to find that her 'Melia did not know her. During the day the Doctor proposed that her father should be telegraphed, thinking that she might possibly live until his arrival. Old Mr. Benson went to the office and sent a despatch to Winchester, with a request that a messenger should be sent with it to Major Scott's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Reid, at the suggestion of Mr. Benson, Jr., called in an assistant physician of high reputation, who confirmed the opinion before expressed by Dr. Reid, that her case was hopeless. Mammy Betty, now that she could no longer disturb her 'Melia, indulged in violent grief. She could be persuaded to take scarcely a mouthful of food, and no persuasions could induce her to take rest. She sat every night in a chair by the bed, wringing her bands, and weeping bitterly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon of the fifth day from the telegraphic despatch, Major Scott arrived. His daughter was still living, but in a state of insensibility. When he entered her chamber, Mammy Betty threw her arms round his neck, screaming, "O masser, my 'Melia gwine die." It was with difficulty he could disengage himself from her. He walked up to the bed, kissed his daughter's forehead, and sank into a chair by her side. Understanding that the family had been sitting up for several nights, Major Scott proposed they should take rest, and that he should be suffered to watch over his daughter that night. Mrs. Benson and her husband, who both required rest, retired early. Mr. Benson, Jr., remained, and occasionally took a little sleep on a trundle bed which had been brought into the room for his convenience. Mammy Betty and her master watched the whole night; in the morning there were no favourable symptoms. She lingered until the morning of the ninth day, when she expired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Betty's grief was beyond all description. She threw herself upon the bed near the corpse, and in agony exclaimed, "My 'Melia! my chil'! talk to you mammy; let you poo' mammy hear de soun' of dat voice once mo'. My darlin' chil' gone and lef' me here by my poo' lone self. What is I to do ? what is I to do, now my poo' chil' gone ?" Mr. Benson, Jr., was deeply distressed. Major Scott paced the room, in anguish of soul too deep for utterance. While those around him were bewailing their individual bereavement, his heart was stricken by his own, and the sorrows of a far distant mother and sister.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mammy Betty was carried and laid upon her own bed. The violence of her grief subsided into a deep settled melancholy, bordering on insensibility to everything around. At four o'clock the next day, a respectable procession followed the corpse to its final resting-place, where another frail tenement of clay was consigned to its kindred earth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Major Scott, on his return from the funeral in a hack with Mr. Benson, Jr., expressed his intention of leaving Boston in a steamship, which be understood would get under weigh for Philadelphia, from the harbour, about ten o'clock. He told Mr. Benson it was his wish to carry Betty back to Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I would wish you to do so, sir," he replied, "as I suppose she would like it above all things; but, Major Scott, it must be done with as much secrecy as possible, or she might be prevented from going."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I don't exactly understand you, Mr. Benson; who would think of preventing her from going?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If she were your own servant, Major, it is doubtful whether you would be suffered to take her; but, as she is known to be free, the difficulty will be greatly increased, from an apprehension that you, a Southern slave-owner, were about to carry a free negro from Boston to make a slave of her in Virginia."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"But, sir, I suppose free people of colour here have a right to go where they please; and if she proclaims to the mob, who were attempting to take her, not only her willingness, but her great anxiety to go, would they not let her exercise her own choice?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have understood, Major, that in some instances, where that willingness to go has been declared to the mob, they said the assent had been obtained by trick and deception, and that they did not regard it as any positive evidence of the inclination of the free person to go away."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, sir, what precaution had we better take to avoid these difficulties?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Why, I know of no other than to take her to the steamship in a hack, as secretly as possible."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"We will engage, then, the hack we are now in to be at your door about nine o'clock to-morrow morning."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When they returned, Major Scott went up into Mammy Betty's closet. A cold shuddering came over him as he passed through the chamber which had been once his daughter's, and from which he had seen her corpse taken but a short time before. He found the old woman in a doze, perhaps the first she had taken for several days and nights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Betty! Betty!" he called.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Who dat call me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Don't you know me, Betty?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Is dat my masser, my 'Melia pa ? Yes I does know my 'Melia pa: what dey gwine do wid my 'Melia? where dey gwine car' her to ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am come to know of you, old woman, whether you wish to go back with me to Virginia?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, masser, I go if dey let my 'Melia go."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Old woman, don't you know that your Miss Amelia is dead, and that she can't go back to Virginia ?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"If dey don' let my 'Melia go, masser, Betty no go nudder, masser."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Major, finding that her mind was wandering, either from want of rest or from excessive grief, postponed further conversation with her until the morning, when he hoped she would be more rational after a good night's rest. He returned below, and requested Mrs. Benson to have her removed to another room, and something given her to eat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The next morning, early, he went to the room to which she had been removed, found her awake, and quite rational.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Old woman, will you go back to Virginia with me?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, masser, dat I will, I neber gwine stay here, sir, now my 'Melia gone."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Well, you must get up and have everything ready by nine o'clock."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"O, my masser, I is so glad I gwine from dis place! I bin see nothin' but trouble an' sorrow here, masser. Poo' Tom he die, an' 'stress me mightly; but dis las' blow, O 'tis too hebby, too hebby for me to bear!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"It is indeed heavy, very heavy to us all, Betty; but it has come, and we must bear it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Masser, I hope de Lord wilI 'nable us to bear it, sir."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hope so indeed, Betty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After breakfast, the hack was soon at the door; Major Scott and Mammy Betty took a cordial leave of old Mr. and Mrs. Benson. Mr. Benson, Jr., went with them in the hack to the steamship; when they approached, they saw a crowd on the deck of the ship, and many persons on the wharf. The Major, Mr. Benson, and Mammy Betty went immediately on board. Just as they got there, a tall stout man, wearing the badge of office,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"WITH A SHRIEK, SHE FELL DEAD AT HIS FEET. Page 264"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">stepped up and asked, "Is this Major Scott of Virginia?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Yes, sir, my name is Scott."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am a constable, sir, of the city, and have a precept from Judge Thorndike, commanding me to take from your possession, and bring before him, a free negro woman called Betty, information having been given his honour, on oath, that you, Major Scott, are about to convey this said negro woman Betty to Virginia, with the supposed intention of making her a slave."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have no intention of doing any such thing, sir. The woman is free, and is very anxious to go back with me to Virginia, where all her relations reside, and she will be as free there as here; I can't let you take her, sir," taking hold of Mammy Betty as he spoke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The captain of the ship came up, and addressing himself to Major Scott said, "Stranger, you'd better mind what you are about; this is an officer of the law, and if you resist him we shall have the devil to pay here. You must give up this woman, sir. I shall be made to suffer as captain of this vessel if I take her away." The words "look out," were sounded with the bell; the crowd rushed to the wharf, the officer dragging away Mammy Betty, the vessel was off in a moment, and Major Scott and Mammy Betty were separated for ever. She uttered an unearthly shriek, and not another sigh or groan escaped her. She was led by the officer to the Judge, who said to her, "Old woman, were you willing to have gone with Major Scott to Virginia?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a shriek she fell dead at his feet; the word Virginia had fallen as a flash of lightning upon her heart, and riven its last chord. Another monument was there erected to Northern philanthropy, upon which we will inscribe from Holy Writ, "Thy prayers and thine alms have come up as a memorial before God," and "the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Great was the excitement in the crowd; many were heard to say, that that occurrence was only one of the many evils of slavery. A South Carolinian, however, who had been spending the summer in Boston, and was in that crowd, thought differently; and fearlessly expressed his thought, that it was the result of an officious meddling with Southern rights, miscalled philanthropy.</field>
