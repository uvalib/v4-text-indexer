      <field name="fulltext">"In St. Lucie's diſtant Iſle, "Still with Afric's love I burn; "Parted many a thouſand mile, "Never, never to return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Come, kind death! and give me reſt, "Yamba has no friend by thee; "Thou can'ſt eaſe my throbbing breaſt, "Thou can'ſt ſet the Priſoner free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Down my cheeks the tears are dripping, "Broken is my heart with grief; "Mangled my poor fleſh with whipping, "Come kind death! and bring relief.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Born on Afric's Golden Coaſt, "Once I was as bleſt as you; "Parents tender I could boaſt, "Husband dear, and children too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Whity Man he came from far, "Sailing o'er the briny flood, "Who, with help of Britiſh Tar, "Buys up human fleſh and blood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"With the Baby at my breaſt; "(Other two were ſleeping by) "In my Hut I ſat at reſt "With no thought of danger nigh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"From the buſh at even tide "Ruſh'd the fierce man-ſtealing Crew; "Seiz'd the Children by my ſide, "Seiz'd the wretched Yamba too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Then for love of filthy Gold, "Strait they bore me to the ſea; "Cramm'd me down a Slave-ſhip's hold, "Where were Hundreds ſtow'd like me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Naked on the platform lying, "Now we croſs the tumbling wave; "Shrieking, ſickening, fainting, dying, "Deed of ſhame for Britons brave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"At the ſavage Captain's beck, "Now like Brutes they make us prance; "Smack the Cat about the Deck, "And in ſcorn they bid us dance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I in groaning paſs'd the night, "And did roll my aching head; "At the break of morning light, "My poor Child was cold and dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Happy, happy there ſhe lies! "Thou ſhalt feel the laſh no more. "Thus full many a Negro dies, "Ere we reach the deſtin'd ſhore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Driven like Cattle to a fair, "See they ſell us young and old; "Child from Mother too they tear, "All for love of filthy Gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I was ſold to Maſſa hard, "Some have Maſſas kind and good; "And again my back was ſcarr'd "Bad and ſtinted was my food.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Poor and wounded, faint and ſick, "All expoſs'd to burning ſky, "Maſſa bids me graſs to pick, "And now I am near to die.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">"What and if to death he ſend me, "Savage murder tho' it be, "Britiſh Laws ſhall ne'er befriend me; "They protect not Slaves like me!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mouthing thus my wretched ſtate, (Ne'er may I forget the day) Once in duſk of evening late, Far from home I dared to ſtray;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dared, alas! with impious haſte, Tow'rds the roaring ſea to fly; Death itſelf I longed to taſte, Long'd to caſt me in and Die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There I met upon the Strand Engliſh Miſſionary Good, He had Bible book in hand, Which poor me no underſtood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then he led me to his Cot, Sooth'd and pity'd all my woe; Told me 'twas the Chriſtian's lot Much to ſuffer here below.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Told me then of God's dear Son, (Strange and wond'rous is the ſtory;) What ſad wrong was to him done, Tho' he was the Lord of Glory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Told me too, like one who knew him, (Can ſuch love as this be true?) How he dy'd for them that ſlew him. Died for wretched Yamba too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Freely he his mercy proffer'd, And to Sinners he was ſent; E'en to Maſſa pardon's offer'd; O if Maſſa would repent!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wicked deed full many a time Sinful Yamba too hath done; But ſhe wails to God her crime; But ſhe truſts his only Son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O ye ſlaves whom Maſſa beat, Ye are ſtained with guilt within As ye hope for mercy ſweet So forgive your Maſſas' Sin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And with grief when ſinking low, Mark the Road that Yamba trod; Think how all her pain and woe Brought the Captive home to God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now let Yamba too adore Gracious Heaven's myſterious Plan; Now I'll count thy mercies o'er, Flowing thro' the guilt of man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now I'll bleſs my cruel capture, (Hence I've known a Saviour's name) 'Till my Grief is turn'd to Rapture, And I half forget the blame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But tho' here a Convert rare Thanks her God for Grace divine, Let not man the glory ſhare, Sinner, ſtill the guilt is thine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duly now baptiz'd am I By good Miſſionary Man; Lord my nature purify As no outward water can!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All my former thoughts abhorr'd Teach me now to pray and praiſe; Joy and glory in my Lord, Truſt and ſerve him all my days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But tho' death this hour may find me, Still with Afric's love I burn, (There I've left a ſpouſe behind me) Still to native land I turn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when Yamba ſinks in death, This my lateſt prayer ſhall be, While I yield my parting breath, O that Afric might be free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ceaſe, ye Britiſh Sons of murder! Ceaſe from forging Afric's Chain; Mock your Saviour's name no further, Ceaſe your ſavage luſt of gain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ye that boaſt " Ye rule the waves, " Bid no Slave Ship ſoil the ſea, Ye that " never will be ſlaves " Bid poor Afric's land be free.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where ye gave to war it's birth, Where your traders fix'd their den, There go publiſh " Peace on Earth, " Go proclaim " good will to men. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where ye once have carried ſlaughter, Vice, and Slavery, and Sin; Seiz'd on Huſband, Wife, and Daughter, Let the Goſpel enter in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus where Yamba's native home, Humble Hut of Ruſhes flood, Oh if there ſhould chance to roam Some dear Miſſionary good,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thou in Afric's diſtant land, Still ſhalt ſee the man I love; Join him to the Chriſtian band, Guide his Soul to Realms above.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There no Fiend again ſhall ſever Thoſe whom God hath join'd and bleſt; There they dwell with Him for ever , There " weary are at rest. "</field>
