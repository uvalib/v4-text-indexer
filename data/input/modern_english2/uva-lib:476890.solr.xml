      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II A LIGHT SHINING IN DARKNESS In the rear of Mrs. Gaston's place, there stood in the midst of an orchard a log house of two rooms, with hallway between them. There was a mud-thatched wooden chimney at each end, and from the back of the hallway a kitchen extension of the same material with another mud chimney. The house stood in the middle of a ten acre lot, and a woman was busy in the garden with a little girl, planting seed. "Hurry up Annie, less finish this in time to fix up a fine dinner er greens and turnips an 'taters an a chicken. Yer Pappy 'll get home to-day sure. Colonel Gaston's Nelse come last night. Yer Pappy was in the Colonel's regiment an' Nelse said he passed him on the road comin' with two one-legged soldiers. He ain't got but one leg, he says. But, Lord, if there's a piece of him left we'll praise God an' be thankful for what we've got." "Maw, how did he look? I mos' forgot—'s been so long sence I seed him?" asked the child. "Look! Honey! He was the handsomest man in Campbell county! He had a tall fine figure, brown curly beard, and the sweetest mouth that was always smilin' at me, an' his eyes twinklin' over somethin' funny he'd seed or thought about. When he was young ev'ry gal around here was crazy about him. I got him all right, an' he got me too. Oh me! I can't help but cry, to think he's been gone so long. But he's comin' to-day! I jes feel it in my bones." "Look a yonder, Maw, what a skeer-crow ridin' er ole hoss!" cried the girl, looking suddenly toward the road. "Glory to God! It's Tom!" she shouted, snatching her old faded sun-bonnet off her head and fairly flying across the field to the gate, her cheeks aflame, her blond hair tumbling over her shoulders, her eyes wet with tears. Tom was entering the gate of his modest home in as fine style as possible, seated proudly on a stack of bones that had once been a horse, an old piece of wool on his head that once had been a hat, and a wooden peg fitted into a stump where once was a leg. His face was pale and stained with the red dust of the hill roads, and his beard, now iron grey, and his ragged buttonless uniform were covered with dirt. He was truly a sight to scare crows, if not of interest to buzzards. But to the woman whose swift feet were hurrying to his side, and whose lips were muttering half articulate cries of love, he was the knightliest figure that ever rode in the lists before the assembled beauty of the world. "Oh! Tom, Tom, Tom, my ole man! You've come at last!" she sobbed as she threw her arms around his neck, drew him from the horse and fairly smothered him with kisses. "Look out, ole woman, you'll break my new leg! cried Tom when he could get breath. "I don't care,—I'll get you another one," she laughed through her tears. "Look out there again you're smashing my game shoulder. Got er Minie hall in that one." "Well your mouth's all right I see," cried the delighted woman, as she kissed and kissed him. "Say, Annie, don't be so greedy, give me a chance at my young one." Tom's eyes were devouring the excited girl who had drawn nearer. "Come and kiss your Pappy and tell him how glad you are to see him!" said Tom, gathering her in his arms and attempting to carry her to the house. He stumbled and fell. In a moment the strong arms of his wife were about him and she was helping him into the house. She laid him tenderly on the bed, petted him and cried over him. "My poor old man, he's all shot and cut to pieces. You're so weak, Tom—I can't believe it. You were so strong. But we'll take care of you. Don't you worry. You just sleep a week and then rest all summer and watch us work the garden for you!" He lay still for a few moments with a smile playing around his lips. "Lord, ole woman, you don't know how nice it is to be petted like that, to hear a woman's voice, feel her breath on your face and the touch of her hand, warm and soft, after four years sleeping on dirt and living with men and mules, and fightin' and runnin' and diggin' trenches like rats and moles, killin' men, buryin' the dead like carrion, holdin' men while doctors sawed their legs off, till your turn came to be held and sawed! You can't believe it, but this is the first feather bed I've touched in four years. "Well, well!—Bless God it's over now," she cried. "S'long as I've got two strong arms to slave for you—as long as there's a piece of you left big enough to hold on to—I'll work for you," and again she bent low over his pale face, and crooned over him as she had so often done over his baby in those four lonely years of war and poverty. Suddenly Tom pushed her aside and sprang up in bed. "Geemimy, Annie, I forgot my pardners—there's two more peg-legs out at the gate by this time waiting for us to get through huggin' and carryin' on before they come in. Run, fetch 'em in quick!" Tom struggled to his feet and met them at the door. "Come right into my palace, boys, I've seen some fine places in my time, but this is the handsomest one I ever set eyes on. Now, Annie, put the big pot in the little one and don't stand back for expenses. Let's have a dinner these fellers 'll never forget." It was a feast they never forgot. Tom's wife had raised a brood of early chickens, and managed to keep them from being stolen. She killed four of them and cooked them as only a Southern woman knows how. She had sweet potatoes carefully saved in the mound against the kitchen chimney. There were turnips and greens and radishes, young onions and lettuce and hot corn dodgers fit for a king; and in the centre of the table she deftly fixed a pot of wild flowers little Annie had gathered. She did not tell them that it was the last peck of potatoes and the last pound of meal. This belonged to the morrow. To-day they would live. They laughed and joked over this splendid banquet, and told stories of days and nights of hunger and exhaustion, when they had filled their empty stomachs with dreams of home. "Miss Camp, you've got the best husband in seven states, did you know that? "asked one of the soldiers, a mere boy. "Of course she'll agree to that, sonny," laughed Tom. "Well it's so. If it hadn't been for him, M'am, we'd a been peggin' along somewhere way up in Virginny 'stead o' bein' so close to home. You see he let us ride his hoss a mile and then he'd ride a mile. We took it turn about, and here we are." "Tom, how in this world did you get that horse?" asked his wife. "Honey, I got him on my good looks," said he with a wink. "You see I was a settin' out there in the sun the day o' the surrender. I was sorter cryin' and wonderin' how I'd get home with that stump of wood instead of a foot, when along come a chunky heavy set Yankee General, looking as glum as though his folks had surrendered instead of Marse Robert. He saw me, stopped, looked at me a minute right hard and says, "Where do you live?" "Way down in ole No'th Caliny," I says, "at Hambright, not far from King's Mountain." "How are you going to get home?" says he. "God knows, I don't, General. I got a wife and baby down there I ain't seed fer nigh four years, and I want to see 'em so bad I can taste 'em. I was lookin' the other way when I said that, fer I was purty well played out, and feelin' weak and watery about the eyes, an' I didn't want no Yankee General to see water in my eyes." "He called a feller to him and sorter snapped out to him, "Go bring the best horse you can spare for this man and give it to him." "Then he turns to me and seed I was all choked up and couldn't say nothin' and says: "I'm General Grant. Give my love to your folks when you get home. I've known what it was to be a poor white man down South myself once for awhile." "God bless you, General. I thanks you from the bottom of my heart," I says as quick as I could find my tongue, "if it had to be surrender I'm glad it was to such a man as you. "He never said another word, but just walked slow along smoking a big cigar. So ole woman, you know the reason I named that hoss, 'General Grant.' It may be I have seen finer hosses than that one, but I couldn't recollect anything about 'em on the road home." Dinner over, Tom's comrades rose and looked wistfully down the dusty road leading southward. "Well, Tom, ole man, we gotter be er movin'," said the older of the two soldiers. "We're powerful obleeged to you fur helpin' us along this fur." "All right, boys, you'll find yer train standin' on the side o' the track eatin' grass. Jes climb up, pull the lever and let her go." The men's faces brightened, their lips twitched. They looked at Tom, and then at the old horse. They looked down the long dusty road stretching over hill and valley, hundreds of miles south, and then at Tom's wife and child, whispered to one another a moment, and the elder said: "No, pardner, you've been awful good to us, but we'll get along somehow—we can't take yer hoss. It's all yer got now ter make a livin' on yer place." "All I got?" shouted Tom, "man alive, ain't you seed my ole woman, as fat and jolly and han'some as when I married her 'leven years ago? Didn't you hear her cryin' an' shoutin' like she's crazy when I got home? Didn't you see my little gal with eyes jes like her daddy's? Don't you see my cabin standin' as purty as a ripe peach in the middle of the orchard when hundreds of fine houses are lyin' in ashes? Ain't I got ten acres of land? Ain't I got God Almighty above me and all around me, the same God that watched over me on the battlefields? All I got? That old stack o' bones that looks like er hoss? Well I reckon not!" "Pardner, it ain't right," grumbled the soldier, with more of cheerful thanks than protest in his voice. "Oh! Get off you fools," said Tom good-naturedly, "ain't it my hoss? Can't I do what I please with him?" So with hearty hand-shakes they parted, the two astride the old horse's back. One had lost his right leg, the other, his left, and this gave them a good leg on each side to hold the cargo straight. "Take keer yerself, Tom!" they both cried in the same breath as they moved away. "Take keer yerselves, boys. I'm all right!" answered Tom, as he stumped his way back to the home. "It's all right, it's all right," he muttered to himself. "He'd a come in handy, but I'd a never slept thinkin' o' them peggin' along them rough roads." Before reaching the house he sat down on a wooden bench beneath a tree to rest. It was the first week in May and the leaves were not yet grown. The sun was pouring his hot rays down into the moist earth, and the heat began to feel like summer. As he drank in the beauty and glory of the spring his soul was melted with joy. The fruit trees were laden with the promise of the treasures of the summer and autumn, a cat-bird was singing softly to his mate in the tree over his head, and a mockingbird seated in the topmost branch of an elm near his cabin home was leading the oratorio of feathered songsters. The wild plum and blackberry briars were in full bloom in the fence corners, and the sweet odour filled the air. He heard his wife singing in the house. "It's a fine old world after all!" he exclaimed leaning back and half closing his eyes, while a sense of ineffable peace filled his soul. "Peace at last! Thank God! May I never see a gun or a sword, or hear a drum or a fife's scream on this earth again!" A hound came close wagging his tail and whining for a word of love and recognition. "Well, Bob, old boy, you're the only one left. You'll have to chase cotton-tails by yourself now." Bob's eyes watered and he licked his master's hand apparently understanding every word he said. Breaking from his master's hands the dog ran toward the gate barking, and Tom rose in haste as he recognised the sturdy tread of the Preacher, Rev. John Durham, walking rapidly toward the house. Grasping him heartily by the hand the Preacher said, "Tom, you don't know how it warms my soul to look into your face again. When you left, I felt like a man who had lost one hand. I've found it to-day. You're the same stalwart Christian full of joy and love. Some men's religion didn't stand the wear and tear of war. You've come out with your soul like gold tried in the fire. Colonel Gaston wrote me you were the finest soldier in the regiment, and that you were the only Chaplain he had seen that he could consult for his own soul's cheer. That's the kind of a deacon to send to the front! I'm proud of you, and you're still at your old tricks. I met two one-legged soldiers down the road riding your horse away as though you had a stable full at your command. You needn't apologise or explain, they told me all about it." "Preacher, it's good to have the Lord's messenger speak words like them. I can't tell you how glad I am to be home again and shake your hand. I tell you it was a comfort to me when I lay awake at night an them battlefields, a wonderin' what had become of my ole woman and the baby, to recollect that you were here, and how often I'd heard you tell us how the Lord tempered the wind to the shorn lamb. Annie's been telling me who watched out for her them dark days when there was nothin' to eat. I reckon you and your wife knows the way to this house about as well as you do to the church." Tom had pulled the Preacher down on the seat beside him while he said this. "The dark days have only begun, Tom. I've come to see you to have you cheer me up. Somehow you always seemed to me to be closer to God than any man in the church. You will need all your faith now. It seems to me that every second woman I know is a widow. Hundreds of families have no seed even to plant, no horse to work crops, no men who will work if they had horses. What are we to do? I see hungry children in every house." "Preacher, the Lord is looking down here to-day and sees all this as plain as you and me. As long as He is in the sky everything will come all right on the earth." "How's your pantry?" asked the Preacher. "Don't know. 'Man shall not live by bread alone,' you know. When I hear these birds in the trees an' see this old dog waggin' his tail at me, and smell the breath of them flowers, and it all comes over me that I'm done killin' men, and I'm at home, with a bed to sleep on, a roof over my head, a woman to pet me and tell me I'm great and handsome, I don't feel like I'll ever need anything more to eat! I believe I could live a whole mouth here without eatin' a bite." "Good. You come to the prayer meeting to-night and say a few things like that, and the folks will believe they have been eating three square meals every day." "I'll be there. I ain't asked Annie what she's got, but I know she's got greens and turnips, onions and collards, and strawberries in the garden. Irish taters 'll be big enough to eat in three weeks, and sweets comin' right on. We've got a few chickens. The blackberries and plums and peaches and apples are all on the road. Ah! Preacher, it's my soul that's been starved away from my wife and child!" "You don't know how much I need help sometimes Tom. I am always giving, giving myself in sympathy and help to others, I'm famished now and then. I feel faint and worn out. You seem to fill me again with life." "I'm glad to hear you say that, Preacher. I get down-hearted sometimes, when I recollect I'm nothin' but a poor white man. I'll remember your words. I'm goin' to do my part in the church work. You know where to find me." "Well, that's partly what brought me here this morning. I want you to help me look after Mrs. Gaston and her little boy. She is prostrated over the death of the Colonel and is hanging between life and death. She is in a delirious condition all the time and must be watched day and night. I want you to watch the first half of the night with Nelse, and Eve and Mary will watch the last half." "Of course, I'll do anything in the world I can for my Colonel's widder. He was the bravest man that ever led a regiment, and he was a father to us boys. I'll be there. But I won't set up with that nigger. He can go to bed." "Tom, it's a funny thing to me that as good a Christian as you are should hate a nigger so. He's a human being. It's not right." "He may be human, Preacher, I don't know. To tell you the truth, I have my doubts. Anyhow, I can't help it. God knows I hate the sight of 'em like I do a rattlesnake. That nigger Nelse, they say is a good one. He was faithful to the Colonel, I know, but I couldn't bear him no more than any of the rest of 'em. I always hated a nigger since I was knee high. My daddy and my mammy hated 'em before me. Somehow, we always felt like they was crowdin' us to death on them big plantations, and the little ones too. And then I had to leave my wife and baby and fight four years, all on account of their stinkin' hides, that never done nothin' for me except make it harder to live. Every time I'd go into battle and hear them Minie balls begin to sing over us, it seemed to me I could see their black ape faces grinnin' and makin' fun of poor whites. At night when they'd detail me to help the ambulance corps carry off the dead and the wounded, there was a strange smell on the field ' that came from the blood and night damp and burnt powder. It always smelled like a nigger to me! It made me sick. Yes, Preacher, God forgive me, I hate 'em! I can't help it any more than I can the color of my skin or my hair." "I'll fix it with Nelse, then. You take the first part of the night 'till twelve clock. I'll go down with you from the church to-night," said the Preacber, as he shook Tom's hand and took his leave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI THE PREACHER AND THE WOMAN OF BOSTON The next day the Preacher had a call from Miss Susan Walker of Boston, whose liberality had built the new Negro school house and whose life and fortune was devoted to the education and elevation of the Negro race. She had been in the village often within the year, running up from Independence where she was building and endowing a magnificent classical college for negroes. He had often heard of her, but as she stopped with negroes when on her visits he had never met her. He was especially interested in her after hearing incidentally that she was a member of a Baptist church in Boston. On entering the parlour the Preacher greeted his visitor with the deference the typical Southern man instinctively pays to woman. "I am pleased to meet you, Madam," he said with a graceful bow and kindly smile, as he led her to the most comfortable seat he could find. She looked him squarely in the face for a moment as though surprised and smilingly replied, "I believe you Southern men are all alike, woman flatterers. You have a way of making every woman believe you think her a queen. It pleases me, I can't help confessing it, though I sometimes despise myself for it. But I am not going to give you an opportunity to feed my vanity this morning. I've come for a plain face to face talk with you on the one subject that fills my heart, my work among the Freedmen. You are a Baptist minister. I have a right to your friendship and co-operation." A cloud overshadowed the Preacher's face as he seated himself. He said nothing for a moment, looking curiously and thoughtfully at his visitor. He seemed to be studying her character and to be puzzled by the problem. She was a woman of prepossessing appearance, well past thirty-five, with streaks of grey appearing in her smoothly brushed black hair. She was dressed plainly in rich brown material cut in tailor fashion, and her heavy hair was drawn straight up pompadour style from her forehead with apparent carelessness and yet in a way that heightened the impression of strength and beauty in her face. Her nose was the one feature that gave warning of trouble in an encounter. She was plump in figure, almost stout, and her nose seemed too small for the breadth of her face. It was broad enough, but too short, and was pug tipped slightly at the end. She fell just a little short of being handsome and this nose was responsible for the failure. It gave to her face when agitated, in spite of evident culture and refinement, the expression of a feminine bull dog. Her eyes were flashing now, and her nostrils opened a little wider and began to push the tip of her nose upward. At last she snapped out suddenly, "Well which is it, friend or foe? What do you honestly think of my work?" "Pardon me, Miss Walker, I am not accustomed to speak rudely to a lady. If I am honest, I don't know where to begin." "Bah! Lay aside your Don Quixote Southern chivalry this morning and talk to me in plain English. It doesn't matter whether I am a woman or a man. I am an idea, a divine mission this morning. I mean to establish a high school in this village for the negroes, and to build a Baptist church for them. I learn from them that they have great faith in you. Many of them desire your approval and co-operation. Will you help me?" "To be perfectly frank, I will not. You ask me for plain English. I will give it to you. Your presence in this village as a missionary to the heathen is an insult to our intelligence and Christian manhood. You come at this late day a missionary among the heathen, the heathen whose heart and brain created this Republic with civil and religious liberty for its foundations, a missionary among the heathen who gave the world Washington, whose giant personality three times saved the cause of American Liberty from ruin when his army had melted away. You are a missionary among the children of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Madison, Jackson, Clay and Calhoun! Madam, I have baptised into the fellowship of the church of Christ in this county more negroes than you ever saw in all your life before you left Boston. "At the close of the war there were thousands of negro members of white Baptist churches in the state. Your mission is not to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ. Your mission is to teach crack-brained theories of social and political equality to four millions of ignorant negroes, some of whom are but fifty years removed from the savagery of African jungles. Your work is to separate and alienate the negroes from their former masters who can be their only real friends and guardians. Your work is to sow the dragon's teeth of an impossible social order that will bring forth its harvest of blood for our children." He paused a moment, and, suddenly facing her continued, "I should like to help the cause you have at heart and the most effective service I could render it now would be to box you up in a glass cage, such as are used for rattlesnakes, and ship you back to Boston." "Indeed! I suppose then it is still a crime in the South to teach the Negro?" she asked this in little gasps of fury, her eyes flashing defiance and her two rows of white teeth uncovering by the rising of her pugnacious nose. "For you, yes. It is always a crime to teach a lie." "Thank you. Your frankness is all one could wish!" "Pardon my apparent rudeness. You not only invited, you demanded it. While about it, let me make a clean breast of it. I do you personally the honour to acknowledge that you are honest and in dead earnest, and that you mean well. You are simply a fanatic." "Allow me again to thank you for your candour!" "Don't mention it, Madam. You will be canonised in due time. In the meantime let us understand one another. Our lives are now very far apart, though we read the same Bible, worship the same God and hold the same great faith. In the settlement of this Negro question you as an insolent interloper. You're worse, you are a wilful spoiled child of rich and powerful parents playing with matches in a powder mill. I not only will not help you, I would, If I had the power seize you, and return you to a place of safety. But I cannot oppose you. You are protected in your play by a million bayonets and back of these bayonets are banked the fires of passion in the North ready to burst into flame in a moment. The only thing I can do is to ignore your existence. You understand my position." "Certainly, Doctor," she replied good naturedly. She had recovered from the rush of her anger now and was herself again. A curious smile played round her lips as she quietly added: "I must really thank you for your candour. You have helped me immensely. I understand the situation now perfectly. I shall go forward cheerfully in my work and never bother my brain again about you, or your people, or your point of view. You have aroused all the fighting blood in me. I feel toned up and ready for a life struggle. I assure you I shall cherish no ill feeling toward you. I am only sorry to see a man of your powers so blinded by prejudice. I will simply ignore you." "Then, Madam, it is quite clear we agree upon establishing and maintaining a great mutual ignorance. Let us hope, paradoxical as it may seem, that it may be for the enlightenment of future generations!" She arose to go, smiling at his last speech. "Before we part, perhaps never to meet again, let me ask you one question," said the Preacher still looking thoughtfully at her. "Certainly, as many as you like." "Why is it that you good people of the North are spending your millions here now to help only the negroes who feel least of all the sufferings of this war? The poor white people of the South are your own flesh and blood. These Scotch Covenanters, are of the same Puritan stock, these German, Huguenot and English people are all your kinsmen, who stood at the stake with your fathers in the old world. They are, many of them, homeless, without clothes, sick and hungry and broken hearted. But one in ten of them ever owned a slave. They had to fight this war because your armies invaded their soil. But for their sorrows, sufferings and burdens you have no ear to hear and no heart to pity. This is a strange thing to me." "The white people of the South can take care of themselves. If they suffer, it is God's just punishment for their sins in owning slaves and fighting against the flag. Do I make myself clear?" she snapped. "Perfectly, I haven't another word to say." "My heart yearns for the poor dear black people who have suffered so many years in slavery and have been denied the rights of human beings. I am not only going to establish schools and colleges for them here, but I am conducting an experiment of thrilling interest to me which will prove that their intellectual, moral, and social capacity is equal to any white man's." "Is it so? "asked the Preacher. "Yes, I am collecting from every section of the South the most promising specimens of negro boys and sending them to our great Northern Universities where they will be educated among men who treat them as equals, and I expect from the boys reared in this atmosphere, men of transcendent genius, whose brilliant achievements in science, art and letters will forever silence the tongues of slander against their race. The most interesting of these students I have at Harvard now is young George Harris. His mother is Eliza Harris, the history of whose escape over the ice of the Ohio River fleeing from slavery thrilled the world. This boy is a genius, and if he lives he will shake this nation." "It may be, Miss Walker. There are more ways than one to shake a nation. And while I ignore your work, as a citizen and public man,—privately and personally, I shall watch this experiment with profound interest." "I know it will succeed. I believe God made us of one blood," she said with enthusiasm. "Is it true, Madam, that you once endowed a home for homeless cats before you became interested in the black people?" With a twinkle in his eye the Preacher softly asked this apparently irrelevant question. "Yes, sir, I did,—I am proud of it. I love cats. There an over a thousand in the home now, and they are well cared for. Whose business is it?" "I meant no offense by the question. I love cats too. But I wondered if you were collecting negroes only now, or, whether you were adding other specimens to your menagerie for experimental purposes." She bit her lips, and in spite of her efforts to restrain her anger, tears sprang to her eyes as she turned toward the Preacher whose face now looked calmly down upon her with ill-concealed pride. "Oh! the insolence of you Southern people toward those who dare to differ with you about the Negro!" she cried with rage. "I confess it humbly as a Christian, it is true. My scorn for these maudlin ideas is so deep that words have no power to convey it. But come," said the Preacher in the kindliest tone. "Enough of this. I am pained to see tears in your eyes. Pardon my thoughtlessness. Let us forget now for a little while that you are an idea, and remember only that you are a charming Boston woman of the household of our own faith. Let me call Mrs. Durham, and have you know her and discuss with her the thousand and one things dear to all women's hearts." "No, I thank you! I feel a little sore and bruised, and social amenities can have no meaning for those whose souls are on fire with such antagonistic ideas as yours and mine. If Mrs. Durham can give me any sympathy in my work Ill be delighted to see her, otherwise I must go." The Preacher laughed aloud. "Then let me beg of you, never meet Mrs. Durham. If you do, the war will break out again. I don't wish to figure in a case of assault and battery. Mrs. Durham was the owner of fifty slaves. She represents the bluest of the blue blood of the slave-holding aristocracy of the South. She has never surrendered and she never will. Wars, surrenders, constitutional amendments and such little things make no impression on her mind whatever. If you think I am difficult, you had better not puzzle your brain over her. I am a mildly constructive man of progress. She is a Conservative." "Then we will say good-bye," said Miss Walker, extending her small plump hand in friendly parting. "I accept your challenge which this interview implies. I will succeed if God lives," and she set her lips with a snap that spoke volumes. "And I will watch you from afar with sorrow and fear and trembling," responded the Preacher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI SIMON LEGREE In the death of Mr. Lincoln, a group of radical politicians, hitherto suppressed, saw their supreme opportunity to obtain control of the nation in the crisis of an approaching Presidential campaign. Now they could fasten their schemes of proscription, confiscation, and revenge upon the South. Mr. Lincoln had held these wolves at bay during his life by the power of his great personality. But the Lion was dead, and the Wolf, who had snarled and snapped at him in life, put on his skin and claimed the heritage of his power. The Wolf whispered his message of hate, and in the hour of partisan passion became the master of the nation. Busy feet had been hurrying back and forth from the Southern states to Washington whispering in the Wolf's ear the stories of sure success, if only the plan of proscription, disfranchisement of whites, and enfranchisement of blacks were carried out. This movement was inaugurated two years after the war, with every Southern state in profound peace, and in a life and death struggle with nature, to prevent famine. The new revolution destroyed the Union a second time, paralysed every industry in the South, and transformed ten peaceful states into roaring hells of anarchy. We have easily outlived the sorrows of the war. That was a surgery which healed the body. But the child has not yet been born whose children's children will live to see the healing of the wounds from those four years of chaos, when fanatics blinded by passion, armed millions of ignorant negroes and thrust them into mortal combat with the proud, bleeding, half-starving Anglo-Saxon race of the South. Such a deed once done, can never be undone. It fixes the status of these races for a thousand years, if not for eternity. The South was now rapidly gathering into two hostile armies under these influences, with race marks as uniforms—the Black against the White. The Negro army was under the command of a triumvirate, the Carpet-bagger from the North, the native Scalawag and the Negro Demagogue. Entirely distinct from either of these was the genuine Yankee soldier settler in the South after the war, who came because he loved its genial skies and kindly people. Ultimately some of these Northern settlers were forced into politics by conditions around them, and they constituted the only conscience and brains visible in public life during the reign of terror which the "Reconstruction" régime inaugurated. In the winter of 1866 the Union League at Hambright held a meeting of special importance. The attendance was large and enthusiastic. Amos Hogg, the defeated candidate for Governor in the last election, now the President of the Federation of "Loyal Leagues," had sent a special ambassador to this meeting to receive reports and give instructions. This ambassador was none other than the famous Simon Legree of Red River, who had migrated to North Carolina attracted by the first proclamation of the President, announcing his plan for readmitting the state to the Union. The rumours of his death proved a mistake. He had quit drink, and set his mind on greater vices. In his face were the features of the distinguished ruffian whose cruelty to his slaves had made him unique in infamy in the annals of the South. He was now pre-eminently the type of the "truly loyal". At the first rumour of war he had sold his negroes and migrated nearer the border land, that he might the better avoid service in either army. He succeeded in doing this. The last two years of the war, however, the enlisting officers pressed him hard, until finally he hit on a brilliant scheme. He shaved clean, and dressed as a German emigrant woman. He wore dresses for two years, did house work, milked the cows and cut wood for a good natured old German. He paid for his board, and passed for a sister, just from the old country. When the war closed, he resumed male attire, became a violent Union man, and swore that he had been hounded and persecuted without mercy by the Secessionist rebels. He was looking more at ease now than ever in his life. He wore a silk hat and a new suit of clothes made by a fashionable tailor in Raleigh. He was a little older looking than when he killed Uncle Tom on his farm some ten years before, but otherwise unchanged. He had the same short muscular body, round bullet head, light grey eyes and shaggy eyebrows, but his deep chestnut bristly hair had been trimmed by a barber. His coarse thick lips drooped at the corners of his mouth and emphasised the crook in his nose. His eyes, well set apart, as of old, were bold, commanding, and flashed with the cold light of glittering steel. His teeth that once were pointed like the fangs of a wolf had been filed by a dentist. But it required more than the file of a dentist to smooth out of that face the ferocity and cruelty that years of dissolute habits had fixed. He was only forty-two years old, but the flabby flesh under his eyes and his enormous square-cut jaw made him look fully fifty. It was a spectacle for gods and men, to see him harangue that Union League in the platitudes of loyalty to the Union, and to watch the crowd of negroes hang breathless on his every word as the inspired Gospel of God. The only notable change in him from the old days was in his speech. He had hired a man to teach him grammar and pronunciation. He had high ambitions for the future. "Be of good cheer, beloved!" he said to the negroes. "A great day is coming for you. You are to rule this land. Your old masters are to dig in the fields and you are to sit under the shade and be gentlemen. Old Andy Johnson will be kicked out of the White House or hung, and the farms you've worked on so long will be divided among you. You can rent them to your old masters and live in ease the balance of your life." "Glory to God!" shouted an old negro. "I have just been to Washington for our great leader, Amos Hogg. I've seen Mr. Sumner, Mr. Stevens and Mr. Butler. I have shown them that we can carry any state in the South, if they will only give you the ballot and take it away from enough rebels. We have promised them the votes in the Presidential election, and they are going to give us what we want." "Hallelujah! Amen! Yas Lawd!" The fervent exclamations came from every part of the room. After the meeting the negroes pressed around Legree and shook his hand with eagerness—the same hand that was red with the blood of their race. When the crowd had dispersed a meeting of the leaders was held. Dave Haley, the ex-slave trader from Kentucky who bad dodged back and forth from the mountains of his native state to the mountains of Western North Carolina and kept out of the armies, was there. He had settled in Hambright and hoped at least to get the post-office under the new dispensation. In the group was the full blooded negro, Tim Shelby. He had belonged to the Shelbys of Kentucky, but had escaped through Ohio into Canada before the war. He had returned home with great expectations of revolutions to follow in the wake of the victorious armies of the North. He had been disappointed in the programme of kindliness and mercy that immediately followed the fall of the Confederacy; but he had been busy day and night since the war in organising the negroes, in secretly furnishing them arms and wherever possible he had them grouped in military posts and regularly drilled. He was elated at the brilliant prospects which Legree's report from Washington opened. "Glorious news you bring us, brother!" he exclaimed as he slapped Legree on the back. "Yes, and it's straight." "Did Mr. Stevens tell you so? "He's the man that told me." "Well, you can tie to him. He's the master now that rules the country," said Tim with enthusiasm. "You bet he's runnin' it. He showed me his bill to confiscate the property of the rebels and give it to the truly loyal and the niggers. It's a hummer. You ought to have seen the old man's eyes flash fire when he pulled that bill out of his desk and read it to me." "When will he pass it?" "Two years, yet. He told me the fools up North were not quite ready for it; and that he had two other bills first, that would run the South crazy and so fire the North that he could pass anything he wanted and hang old Andy Johnson besides." "Praise God," shouted Tim, as he threw his arms around Legree and hugged him. Tim kept his kinky hair cut close, and when excited he had a way of wrinkling his scalp so as to lift his ears up and down like a mule. His lips were big and thick, and he combed assiduously a tiny mustache which he tried in vain to pull out in straight Napoleonic style. He worked his scalp and ears vigourously as he exclaimed, "Tell us the whole plan, brother!" "The plan's simple," said Legree. "Mr. Stevens is going to give the nigger the ballot, and take it from enough white men to give the niggers a majority. Then he will kick old Andy Johnson out of the White House, put the gag on the Supreme Court so the South can't appeal, pan his bill to confiscate the property of the rebels and give it to loyal men and the niggers, and run the rebels out." "And the beauty of the plan is," said Tim with unction, "that they are going to allow the Negro to vote to give himself the ballot and not allow the white man to vote against it. That's what I call a dead sure thing." Tim drew himself up, a sardonic grin revealing his white teeth from ear to ear, and burst into an impassioned harangue to the excited group. He was endowed with native eloquence, and had graduated from a college in Canada under the private tutorship of its professors. He was well versed in English History. He could hold an audience of negroes spell bound, and his audacity commanded the attention of the boldest white man who heard him. Legree, Perkins and Haley cheered his wild utterances and urged him to greater flights. He paused as though about to stop when Legree, evidently surprised and delighted at his powers said, "Go on! Go on!" THE HON. TIM SHELBY. Portrait from life Portrait of Time Shelby. "Yes, go on," shouted Perkins. "We are done with race and colour lines." A dreamy look came to Tim's eyes as he continued, "Our proud white aristocrats of the South are in a panic it seems. They fear the coming power of the Negro. They fear their Desdemonas may be fascinated again by an Othello! Well, Othello's day has come at last. If he has dreamed dreams in the past his tongue dared not speak, the day is fast coming when he will put these dreams into deeds, not words. "The South has not paid the penalties of her crimes. The work of the conqueror has not yet been done in this land. Our work now is to bring the proud low and exalt the lowly. This is the first duty of the conqueror. "The French Revolutionists established a tannery where they tanned the hides of dead aristocrats into leather with which they shod the common people. This was France in the eighteenth century with a thousand years of Christian culture. "When the English army conquered Scotland they hunted and killed every fugitive to a man, tore from the homes of their fallen foes their wives, stripped them naked, and made them follow the army begging bread, the laughing stock and sport of every soldier and camp follower! This was England in the meridian of Anglo-Saxon intellectual glory, the England of Shakespeare who was writing Othello to please the warlike populace. "I say to my people now in the language of the inspired Word, 'All things are yours!' I have been drilling and teaching them through the Union League, the young and the old. I have told the old men that they will be just as useful as the young. If they can't carry a musket they can apply the torch when the time comes. And they are ready now to answer the call of the Lord!" They crowded around Tim and wrung his hand. * * * * * * Early in 1867, two years after the war, Thaddeus Stevens passed through Congress his famous bill destroying the governments of the Southern states, and dividing them into military districts, enfranchising the whole negro race, and disfranchising one-fourth of the whites. The army was sent back to the South to enforce these decrees at the point of the bayonet. The authority of the Supreme Court was destroyed by a supplementary act and the South denied the right of appeal. Mr. Stevens then introduced his bill to confiscate the property of the white people of the 'South. The negroes laid down their hoes and plows and began to gather in excited meetings. Crimes of violence increased daily. Not a night passed but that a burning barn or home wrote its message of anarchy on the black sky. The negroes refused to sign any contracts to work, to pay rents, or vacate their houses on notice even from the Freedman's Bureau. The negroes on General Worth's Plantation, not only refused to work, or move, but organised to prevent any white man from putting his foot on the land. General Worth procured a special order from the headquarters of the Freedman's Bureau for the district located at Independence. When the officer appeared and attempted to serve this notice, the negroes mobbed him. A company of troops were ordered to Hambright, and the notice served again by the Bureau official accompanied by the Captain of this company. The negroes asked for time to hold a meeting and discuss the question. They held their meeting and gathered fully five hundred men from the neighbourhood, all armed with revolvers or muskets. They asked Legree and Tim Shelby to tell them what they should do. There was no uncertain sound in what Legree said. He looked over the crowd of eager faces with pride and conscious power. "Gentlemen, your duty is plain. Hold your land. It's yours. You've worked it for a lifetime. These officers here tell you that old Andy Johnson has pardoned General Worth and that you have no rights on the land without his contract. I tell you old Andy Johnson has no right to pardon a rebel, and that he will be hung before another year. Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner and B. F. Butler are running this country. Mr. Stevens has never failed yet on anything he has set his hand. He has promised to give you the land. Stick to it. Shake your fist in old Andy Johnson's face and the face of this Bureau and tell them so." "Dat we will!" shouted a negro woman, as Tim Shelby rose to speak. "You have suffered," said Tim. "Now let the white man suffer. Times have changed. In the old days the white man said, "John, come black my boots!" "And the poor negro had to black his boots. I expect to see the day when I will say to a white man, "Black my boots!" And the white man will tip his hat and hurry to do what I tell him." "Yes, Lawd! Glory to God! Hear dat now!" "We will drive the white men out of this country. That is the purpose of our friends at Washington. If white men want to live in the South they can become our servants. If they don't like their job they can move to a more congenial climate. You have Congress on your side, backed by a million bayonets. There is no President. The Supreme Court is chained. In San Domingo no white man is allowed to vote, hold office, or hold a foot of land. We will make this mighty South a more glorious San Domingo." A frenzied shout rent the air. Tim and Legree were carried on the shoulders of stalwart men in triumphant procession with five hundred crazy negroes yelling and screaming at their heels. The officers made their escape in the confusion and beat a hasty retreat to town. They reported the situation to headquarters, and asked for instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII DICK When Charlie Gaston reached his home after a never-to-be-forgotten day in the woods with the Preacher, he found a ragged little dirt-smeared negro boy peeping through the fence into the woodyard. "What you want?" cried Charlie. "Nuttin!" "What's your name?" "Dick." "Who's your father?" "Haint got none. My mudder say she was tricked, en I'se de trick!" he chuckled and walled his eyes. Charlie came close and looked him over. Dick giggled and showed the whites of his eyes. "What made that streak on your neck?" "Nigger done it wid er axe." "What nigger?" "Low life nigger name er Amos what stays roun' our house Sundays." "What made him do it?" "He low he wuz me daddy, en I sez he wuz er liar, en den he grab de axe en try ter chop me head off." "Gracious, he 'most killed you!" "Yassir, but de doctor sewed me head back, en hit grow'd." "Goodness me!" "Say!" grinned Dick. "What?" "I likes you." "Do you?" "Yassir, en I aint gwine home no mo'. I done run away, en I wants ter live wid you." "Will you help me and Nelse work?" "Dat I will. I can do mos' anything. You ax yer Ma fur me, en doan let dat nigger Nelse git holt er me." Charlie's heart went out to the ragged little waif. He took him by the hand, led him into the yard, found his mother, and begged her to give him a place to sleep and keep him. His mother tried to persuade him to make Dick go back to his own home. Nelse was loud in his objections to the new comer, and Aunt Eve looked at him as though she would throw him over the fence. But Dick stuck doggedly to Charlie's heels. "Mama dear, see, they tried to cut his head off with an axe," cried the boy, and he wheeled Dick around and showed the terrible scar across the back of his neck. "I spec hits er pity day didn't cut hit clean off," muttered Nelse. "Mama, you can't send him back to be killed!" "Well darling, I'll see about it to-morrow." "Come on Dick, I'll show you where to sleep!" The next day Dick's mother was glad to get rid of him by binding him legally to Mrs. Gaston, and a lonely boy found a playmate and partner in work, he was never to forget.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI LEGREE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE The new government was now in full swing and a saturnalia began. Amos Hogg was Governor, Simon Legree Speaker of the House, and the Hon. Tim Shelby leader of the majority on the floor of the House. Raleigh, the quaint little City of Oaks, never saw such an assemblage of law-makers gather in the grey stone Capitol. Ezra Perkins, who was a member of the Senate, was frugal in his habits and found lodgings at an unpretentious boarding house near the Capitol square. The room was furnished with six iron cots on which were placed straw mattresses and six honourable members of the new Legislature occupied these. They were close enough together to allow a bottle of whiskey to be freely passed from member to member at any hour of the night. They thought the beds were arranged with this in view and were much pleased. Ezra was the only man of the crowd who arrived in Raleigh with a valise or trunk. He had a carpet bag. The others simply had one shirt and a few odds and ends tied in red bandana handkerchiefs. Three of them had walked all the way to Raleigh and kept in the woods from habit as deserters. The other two rode on the train and handed their tickets to the first stranger they saw on the platform of the car they boarded. "What's this for?" said the stranger. "Them's our tickets. Ain't you the door keeper?" "No, but there ought to be one to every circus. You'll have me when you get to Raleigh." The landlady, Mrs. Duke, apologised for the poor beds, when she showed them to their room. "I'm sorry, gentlemen, I can't give you softer beds." "That's all right M'am! them's fine. Us fellows been sleeping in the woods and in straw stacks so long dodgin' ole Vance's officers, them white sheets is the finest thing we've seed in four years, er more." They were humble and made no complaints. But at the end of the week they gathered around the Rev. Ezra Perkins for a grave consultation. "When are we goin' ter draw?" said one. "Air we ever goin' ter draw?" asked another with sorrow and doubt. "What are we here fer ef we cain't draw?" pleaded another looking sadly at Ezra. "Gentlemen,"answered Ezra, "it will be all right in a little while. The Treasurer is just cranky. We can draw our mileage Monday anyhow." At daylight they took their places on the bank's steps, and at ten o'clock when the bank opened, the doors were besieged by a mob of members painfully anxious to draw before it might be too late. Next morning there was a disturbance at the breakfast table. The morning paper had in blazing head lines an amount of one James "Mileage" who was a member of the Legislature front an adjoining county thirty-seven miles distant. He had sworn to a mileage record of one hundred and seven dollars. "That's an unfortunate mistake, sir," said Perkins. "Ten' ter yer own business?" answered James "Mileage." "I call it er purty sharp trick," grinned his partner. "I call it stealin'," sneered an honourable member, evidently envious. And James "Mileage"was his name for all time, but "Mileage" shot a malicious look at the member who had called him a thief. The next morning the paper of the Opposition had another biographical sketch on the front page. "I see your name in the paper this morning, Mr. Scoggins?" remarked Mrs. Duke, looking pleasantly at the member who had spoken so rudely to James "Mileage" the day before. "Well I reckon I'll make my mark down here before it's over," chuckled Scoggins with pride. "What do they say about me, M'am?" "They say you stole a lot of hogs!" tittered the landlady. Mr. Scoggins turned red. "Oho, is there another thief in this hon'able body?" sneered James "Mileage." "That's all a lie, M'am, 'bout them hogs. I didn' steal 'em. I just pressed 'em from a Secessiner." "Jes so," said James "Mileage," "but they say you were a deserter at the time, and not exactly in the service of your country." "Ye can't pay no 'tention ter rebel lies ergin Union men!" explained Scoggins, eating faster. "Yes, that's so," said James "Mileage," "but there's another funny thing in the paper about you." "What's that?" cried Scoggins with new alarm. "That Mr. Scoggins met Sherman's army with loud talk about lovin' the Union, but that a mean Yankee officer gave him a cussin' fur not fightin' on one side or the other, took all that bacon he had stolen, hung him up by the heels, gave him thirty lashes and left him hanging in the air." "It's a lie! It's a lie!" bellowed Scoggins. "Gentlemen! Gentlemen! we must not have such behaviour at my table!" exclaimed Mrs. Duke. And "Hog" Scoggins was his name from that day. By the end of the week another painful story was printed about one of this group of statesmen. The newspaper brutally declared that he had been convicted of stealing a rawhide from a neighbour's tanyard. It could not be denied. And then a sad thing happened. The moral sentiment of the little community could not endure the strain. It suddenly collapsed. They laughed at these incidents of the sad past and agreed that they were jokes. They began to call each other James "Mileage," "Hog" Scoggins, and "Rawhide "in the friendliest way, and dared a scornful world to make them feel ashamed of anything! But the Rev. Ezra Perkins was pained by this breakdown. He felt that being safely removed two thousand miles from his own past, he might hope for a future. "Mrs. Duke," he complained to his landlady, "I will have to ask you to give me a room to myself. I'll pay double. I want quiet where I can read my Bible and meditate occasionally." "Certainly Mr. Perkins, if you are wining to pay for it." It was so arranged. But this assumption of moral superiority by Perkins grieved "Mileage," "Hog" and "Rawhide," and a coolness sprang up between them, until they found Ezra one night in his place of meditation dead drunk and his room on fire. He had gone to sleep in his chair with his empty bottle by his side, and knocked the candle over on the bed. Then they agreed that forever after they would all stand together, shoulder to shoulder, until they brought the haughty low and exalted the lowly and the "loyal." Tim Shelby early distinguished himself in this August assemblage. His wit and eloquence from the first commanded the admiration of his party. When he had fairly established himself as leader, he rose in his seat one day with unusual gravity. His scalp was working his ears with great rapidity showing his excitement. He had in his hands a bill on which he had spent months in secret study. He had not even hinted its contents to any of his associates. Under the call for bills his voice rang with deep emphasis, "Mr. Speaker!" Legree gave him instant recognition. "I desire to introduce the following: "A Bill to be Entitled An Act to Relieve Married Women from the Bonds of Matrimony when United to Felons, and to Define Felony." A page hurried to the Reading Clerk with his bill. The hum of voices ceased. The five or six representatives of the white race left their desks and walked quickly toward the Speaker. The Clerk read in a loud clear voice. "The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact: I "That all citizens of the State who took part in the Rebellion and fought against the Union, or held office in the so called Confederate States of America, shall be held guilty of felony, and shall be forever debarred from voting or holding office." II "That the married relations of all such felons are hereby dissolved and their wives absolutely divorced, and said felons shall be forever barred from contracting marriage or living under the same roof with their former wives." Instantly four Carpet-bagger members of some education rushed for Tim's seat. "Withdraw that bill, man, quick! My God, are you mad!" they all cried in a breath. Tim was dazed by this unexpected turn, and grinned in an obstinate way. "I can't see it gentlemen. That bill will kill out the breed of rebels and fix the status of every Southern state for five hundred years. It's just what we need to make this state loyal." "You pass that bill and hell will break loose!" "How so, brother? Ain't we on top and the rebels on the bottom? Ain't the army here to protect us?" persisted Tim. There was a brief consultation among the little group in opposition and the leader said, "Mr. Speaker, I move that the bill be at once printed and laid on the desk of the members for consideration." Tim was astonished at this move of his enemy. Legree looked at him and waited his pleasure. "Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that bill for the present," he said at length. That night the wires were hot between Washington and Raleigh, and the entire power of Congress was hurled upon the unhappy Tim. His bill was not only suppressed but the news agencies were threatened and subsidised to prevent accounts of its introduction being circulated throughout the country. Tim decided to lay this measure over until Congress was off his hands, and the state's autonomy fully recognised. Then he would dare interference. In the meantime he turned his great mind to financial matters. His success here was overwhelming. His first measure was to increase the per diem of the members from three to seven dollars a day. It passed with a whoop. Uncle Pete Sawyer a coal-black fatherly looking old darkey from an Eastern county made himself immortal in that debate. "Mistah Speakah!" he bawled drawing himself up with great dignity, and holding a pen in his left hand as though he had been writing. "What do dese white gem'men mean by exposen dis bill? Ef we doan pay de members enuf, day des be erbleeged ter steal. Hit aint right, sah, ter fo'ce de members er dis hon'able body ter prowl atter dark when day otter be here 'tendin' ter de business o' de country. En I moves you, sah, Mistah Speakah, dat dese rema'ks er mine be filed in de arkibes er grabity!" They were filed and embalmed in the archives of gravity where they will remain a monument to their author and his times. As Tim's great financial measures made progress, the members began to wear better clothes, assumed white linen shirts, had their shoes blacked, and put on the airs of overworked statesmen. When they had used up all the funds of the state in mileage and per diem, they sold and divided the school fund, railroad bonds worth a half million, for a hundred thousand ready cash. It was soon found that Simon Legree, the Speaker of the House, was the master of financial measures and Tim Shelby was his mouthpiece. Legree organised three groups of thieves composed of the officials needed to perfect the thefts in every branch of the government while he retained the leadership of the federated groups. The Treasurer, who was an honest man, was stripped of power by a special act. The Capitol Ring merely picked up the odds and ends about the Capitol building. They refurnished the Legislative Halls. They spent over two hundred thousand dollars for furniture, and when it was appraised, its value was found to be seventeen thousand dollars at the prices they actually paid for it. The Ring stole one hundred and seventy thousand dollars on this item alone. An appropriation of three hundred thousand dollars was made for "supplies, sundries and incidentals." With this they built a booth around the statue of Washington at the end of the Capitol and established a bar with fine liquors and cigars for the free use of the members and their friends. They kept it open every day and night during their reign, and in a suite of rooms in the Capitol they established a brothel. From the galleries a swarm of courtesans daily smiled on their favourites on the floor. The printing had never cost the state more than eight thousand dollars in any one year. This year it cost four hundred and eighty thousand. Legree drew thousands of warrants on the state for imaginary persons. There were eight pages in the House. He drew pay for one hundred and fifty-six pages. In this way he raised an enormous corruption fund for immediate use in bribing the lawmakers to carry through his schemes. The Railroad Ring was his most effective group of brigands. They passed bills authorising the issue of twenty-five millions of dollars in bonds, and actually issued and stole fourteen millions, and never built one foot of railroad. When Legree's movement was at its high tide, Ezra Perkins sought Uncle Pete Sawyer one night in behalf of a pet measure of his pending in the House. Peter was seated by his table counting by the light of a candle three big piles of gold. His face was wreathed in smiles. "Peter, you seem well pleased with the world tonight?" said Ezra gleefully. "Well, brudder, you see dem piles er yaller money?" "Yes, it is a fine sight." Uncle Pete smacked his lips and grinned from ear to ear. "Well, brudder, I tells you. I ben sol' seben times in my life, but 'fore Gawd dat's de fust time I ebber got de money!" Uncle Pete dreamed that night that Congress passed a law extending the blessings of a "republican form of government" to North Carolina for forty years and that the Legislature never adjourned. But the Legislature finally closed, and in a drunken revel which lasted all night. They had bankrupted the state, destroyed its school funds, and increased its debt from sixteen to forty-two millions of dollars, without adding one cent to its wealth or power. Legree then organized a Municipal and County Ring to exploit the towns, cities, and counties, having passed a bill vacating all county and city offices. This Ring secured the control of Hambright and levied a tax of twenty-five per cent for municipal purposes! Tom Camp's little home was assessed for eighty-five dollars in taxes. Mrs. Gaston's home was assessed for one hundred and sixty dollars. They could have raised a million as easily as the sum of these assessments. It cost the United States government two hundred millions of dollars that year to pay the army required to guard the Legrees and their "loyal" men while they were thus establishing and maintaining "a republican form of government" in the South.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII THE SECOND REIGN OF TERROR It was the bluest Monday the Rev. John Durham ever remembered in his ministry. A long drought had parched the corn into twisted and stunted little stalks that looked as though they had been burnt in a prairie fire. The fly had destroyed the wheat crop and the cotton was dying in the blistering sun of August, and a blight worse than drought, or flood, or pestilence, brooded over the stricken land, flinging the shadow of its Black Death over every home. The tax gatherer of the new "republican form of government," recently established in North Carolina now demanded his pound of flesh. The Sunday before had been a peculiarly hard one for the Preacher. He had tried by the sheer power of personal sympathy to lift the despairing people out of their gloom and make strong their faith in God. In his morning sermon he had torn his heart open and given them its red blood to drink. At the night service he could not rally from the nerve tension of the morning. He felt that lie had pitiably failed. The whole day seemed failure black and hopeless. All day long the sorrowful stories of ruin and loss of homes were poured into his ear. The Sheriff had advertised for sale for taxes two thousand three hundred and twenty homes in Campbell county. The land under such conditions had no value. It was only a formality for the auctioneer to cry it and knock it down for the amount of the tax bill. As he arose from bed with the burden of all this hopeless misery crushing his soul, a sense of utter exhaustion and loneliness came over him. "My love, I must go back to bed and try to sleep. I lay awake last night until two o'clock. I can't eat anything," he said to his wife as she announced breakfast. "John, dear, don't give up like that." "Can't help it." "But you must. Come, here is something that will tone you up. I found this note under the front door this morning." "What is it?" "A notice from some of your admirers that you must leave this county in forty-eight hours or take the consequences." He looked at this anonymous letter and smiled. "Not such a failure after all, am I?" he mused. "I thought that would help, you," she laughed. "Yes, I can eat breakfast on the strength of that." He spread this letter out beside his plate, and read and reread it as he ate while his eyes flashed with a strange half humourous light. "Really, that's fine, isn't it?" "You sower of sedition and rebellion, hypocrite and false prophet. The day has come to clean this county of treason and traitors. If you dare to urge the people to further resistance to authority, there will be one traitor less in this county." "That sounds like the voice of a Daniel come to judgment, don't it?" "I think Ezra Perkins might know something about it." "I am sure of it." "Well, I'm duly grateful, it's done for you what your wife couldn't do, cheered you up this morning!" "That is so, isn't it? It takes a violent poison sometimes to stimulate the heart's action." "Now if you will work the garden for me, where I've been watering it the past month, you will be yourself by dinner time." "I will. That's about all we've got to eat. I've had so salary in two months, and I've no prospects for the next two months." He was at work in the garden when Charlie Gaston suddenly ran through the gate toward him. His face was red, his eyes streaming with tears, and his breath coming in gasps. "Doctor, they've killed Nelse! Mama says please come down to our house as quick as you can." "Is he dead, Charlie?" "He's most dead. I found him down in the woods lying in a gully, one leg is broken, there's a big gash over his eye, his back is beat to a jelly, and one of his arms is broken. We put him in the wagon, and hauled him to the house. I'm afraid he's dead now. Oh me!" The boy broke down and choked with sobs. "Run, Charlie, for the doctor, and I'll be there in a minute." The boy flew through the gate to the doctor's house. When the Preacher reached Mrs. Gaston's, Aunt Eve was wiping the blood from Nelse's mouth. "De Lawd hab mussy! My po' ole man's done kilt." "Who could have done this, Eve?" "Dem Union Leaguers. Day say day wuz gwine ter kill him fur not jinin' 'em, en fur tryin' ter vote ergin 'em." "I've been afraid of it," sighed the Preacher as he felt Nelse's pulse. "Yassir, en now day's done hit. My po' ole man. I wish I'd a been better ter 'im. Lawd Jesus, help me now!" Eve knelt by the bed and laid her face against Nelse's while the tears rained down her black face. "Aunt Eve, it may not be so bad," said the Preacher hopefully. "His pulse is getting stronger. He has an iron constitution. I believe he will pull through, if there are no internal injuries." "Praise God! ef he do git well, I tell yer now, Marse John, I fling er spell on dem niggers bout dis!" "I am afraid you can do nothing with them. The courts are all in the hands of these scoundrels, and the Governor of the state is at the head of the Leagues." "I doan want no cotes, Marse John, I'se cote ennuf. I kin cunjure dem niggers widout any cote." The doctor pronounced his injuries dangerous but not necessarily fatal. Charlie and Dick watched with Eve that night until nearly midnight. Nelse opened his eyes, and saw the eager face of the boy, his eyes yet red from crying. "I aint dead, honey!" he moaned. "Oh! Nelse, I'm so glad!" "Doan you believe I gwine die! I gwine ter git eben wid dem niggers 'fore I leab dis worl'." Nelse spoke feebly, but there was a way about his saying it that boded no good to his enemies, and Eve was silent. As Nelse improved, Eve's wrath steadily rose. The next day she met in the street one of the negroes who had threatened Nelse. "How's Mistah Gaston dis mawnin 'M'am?" he asked. Without a word of warning she sprang on him like a tigress, bore him to the ground, grasped him by the throat and pounded his head against a stone. She would have choked him to death, had not a man who was passing come to the rescue. "Lemme lone, man, I'se doin' de wuk er God!" "You're committing murder, woman." When the negro got up he jumped the fence and tore down through a corn field, as though pursued by a hundred devils, now and then glancing over his shoulder to see if Eve were after him. The Preacher tried in vain to bring the perpetrators of this outrage on Nelse to justice. He identified six of them positively. They were arrested, and when put on trial immediately discharged by the judge who was himself a member of the League that had ordered Nelse whipped. * * * * * * Tom Camp's daughter was now in her sixteenth year and as plump and winsome a lassie, her Scotch mother declared, as the Lord ever made. She was engaged to be married to Hose Norman, a gallant poor white from the high hill country at the foot of the mountains. Hose came to see her every Sunday riding a black mule, gaily trapped out in martingales with red rings, double girths to his saddle and a flaming red tassel tied on each side of the bridle. Tom was not altogether pleased with his future so-in-law. He was too wild, went to too many frolics, danced too much, drank too much whiskey and was too handy with a revolver. "Annie, child, you'd better think twice before you step off with that young buck," Tom gravely warned his daughter as he stroked her fair hair one Sunday morning while she waited for Hose to escort her to church. "I have thought a hundred times, Paw, but what's the use. I love him. He can just twist me 'round his little finger. I've got to have him." "Tom Camp, you don't want to forget you were not a saint when I stood up with you one day," cried his wife with a twinkle in her eye. "That's a fact, ole woman," grinned Tom. "You never give me a day's trouble after I got hold of you. Sometimes the wildest colts make the safest horses" "Yes, that's so. It's owing to who has the breaking of 'em," thoughtfully answered Tom. "I like Hose. He's full of fun, but he'll settle down and make her a good husband." The girl slipped close to her mother and squeezed her hand. "Do you love him much, child?" asked her father. "Well enough to live and scrub and work for him and to die for him, I reckon." "All right, that settles it, you're too many for me, you and Hose and your Maw. Get ready for it quick. We'll have the weddin' Wednesday night. This home is goin' to be sold Thursday for taxes and it will be our last night under our own roof. We'll make the best of it." It was so fixed. On Wednesday night Hose came down from the foothills with three kindred spirits, and an old fiddler to make the music. He wanted to have a dance and plenty of liquor fresh from the mountain-dew district. But Tom put his foot down on it. "No dancin' in my house, Hose, and no licker," said Tom with emphasis. "I'm a deacon in the Baptist church. I used to be young and as good lookin' as you, my boy, but I've done with them things. You're goin' to take my little gal now. I want you to quit your foolishness be a man." "I will, Tom, I will. She is the prettiest sweetest little thing in this world, and to tell you the truth I'm goin' to settle right down now to the hardest work I ever did in my life." "That's the way to talk, my boy,"said Tom putting his hand an Hose's shoulder. "You'll have enough to do these hard times to make a livin'." They made a handsome picture, in that humble home, as they stood there before the Preacher. The young bride was trembling from head to foot with fright. Hose was trying to look grave and dignified and grinning in spite of himself whenever he looked into the face of his blushing mate. The mother was standing near, her face full of pride in her daughter's beauty and happiness, her heart all a quiver with the memories of her own wedding day seventeen years before. Tom was thinking of the morrow when he would be turned out of his home and his eyes filled with tears. The Rev. John Durham had pronounced them man and wife and hurried away to see some people who were sick. The old fiddler was doing his best. Hose and his bride were shaking hands with their friends, and the boys were trying to tease the bridegroom with hoary old jokes. Suddenly a black shadow fell across the doorway. The fiddle ceased, and every eye was turned to the door. The burly figure of a big negro trooper from a company stationed in the town stood before them. His face was in a broad grin, and his eyes bloodshot with whiskey. He brought his musket down on the floor with a bang. "My frien's, I'se sorry ter disturb yer but I has orders ter search dis house." "Show your orders," said Tom hobbling before him. "Well, deres one un 'em !" he said still grinning as be cocked his gun and presented it toward Tom. "En ef dat aint ennuf day's fifteen mo' stanin' 'roun' dis house. It's no use ter make er fuss. Come on, boys!" "COME ON BOYS!" Illustration of a group of people sitting or standing in a room looking at the door as a group of African Americans with guns enter the room. Before Tom could utter another word of protest six more negro troopers laughing and nudging one another crowded into the room. Suddenly one of them threw a bucket of water in the fire place where a pine knot blazed and two others knocked out the candles. There was a scuffle, the quick thud of heavy blows, and Hose Norman fell to the floor senseless. A piercing scream rang from his bride as she was seized in the arms of the negro who first appeared. He rapidly bore her toward the door surrounded by the six scoundrels who had accompanied him. "My God, save her! They are draggin' Annie out of the house," shrieked her mother. "Help! Help! Lord have mercy!" screamed the girl as they bore her away toward the woods, still laughing and yelling. Tom overtook one of them, snatched his wooden leg off, and knocked him down. Hose's mountain boys were crowding round Tom with their pistols in their hands. "What shall we do, Tom? If we shoot we may kill Annie." "Shoot, man! My God, shoot! There are things worse than death!" They needed no urging. Like young tigers they sprang across the orchard toward the woods whence came the sound of the laughter of the negroes. "Stop de screechin'!" cried the leader. "She nebber get dat gag out now." "Too smart fur de po' white trash dis time sho'!" laughed one. Three pistol shots rang out like a single report! Three more! and three more! There was a wild scramble. Taken completely by surprise, the negroes fled in confusion. Four lay on the ground. Two were dead, one mortally wounded and three more had crawled away with bullets in their bodies. There in the midst of the heap lay the unconscious girl gagged. "Is she hurt?" cried a mountain boy. "Can't tell, take her to the house quick." They laid her across the bed in the room that had been made sweet and tidy for the bride and groom. The mother bent over her quickly with a light. Just where the blue veins crossed in her delicate temple there was a round hole from which a scarlet stream was running down her white throat. Without a word the mother brought Tom, showed it to him, and then fell into his arms and burst into a flood of tears. "Don't, don't cry so Annie! It might have been worse. Let us thank God she was saved from them brutes." Hose's friends crowded round Tom now with tear-stained faces. "Tom, you don't know how broke up we all are over this. Poor child, we did the best we could." "It's all right, boys. You've been my friends to-night. You've saved my little gal. I want to shake hands with you and thank you. If you hadn't been here—My God, I can't think of what would 'a happened! Now it's all right. She's safe in God's hands." The next morning when Tom Camp called at the parsonage to see the Preacher and arrange for the funeral of his daughter he found him in bed. "Dr. Durham is quite sick, Mr. Camp, but he'll see you,"said Mrs. Durham. "Thank you, M'am." She took the old soldier by his hand and her voice choked as she said, "You have my heart's deepest sympathy in your awful sorrow." "It'll be all be the for best, M'am. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. I will still say, Blessed is the name of the Lord!" "I wish I had such faith." She led Tom into the room where the Preacher lay. "Why, what's this, Preacher? A bandage over your eye, looks like somebody knocked you in the head?" "Yes, Tom, but it's nothing. I'll be all right by to-morrow. You needn't tell me anything that happened at your house. I've heard the black hell-lit news. It will be all over this county by night and the town will be full of grim-visaged men before many hours. Your child has not died in vain. A few things like this will be the trumpet of the God of our fathers that will call the sleeping manhood of the Anglo-Saxon race to life again. I must be up and about this afternoon to keep down the storm. It is not time for it to break." "But, Preacher, what happened to you?" "Oh! nothing much, Tom." "I'll tell you what happened," cried Mrs. Durham standing erect with her great dark eyes flashing with anger. "As he came home last night from a visit to the sick, he was ambushed by a gang of negroes led by a white scoundrel, knocked down, bound and gagged and placed on a pile of dry fence rails. They set fire to the pile and left him to burn to death. It attracted the attention of Doctor Graham who was passing. He got to him in time to save him." "You don't say so!" "I'm sorry, Tom, I'm so weak this morning I couldn't come to see you. I know your poor wife is heartbroken." "Yes, sir, she is, and it cuts me to the quick when I think that I gave the orders to the boys to shoot. But, Preacher, I'd a killed her with own hand if I couldn't a saved her no other way. I'd do it over again a thousand times if I had to." "I don't blame you, I'd have done the same thing. I can't come to see you to-day, Tom, I'll be down to your house to-morrow a few minutes before we start for the cemetery. I must get up for dinner and prevent the men from attacking these troops. They'll not dare to try to sell your place to-day. The public square is full of men now, and it's only nine o'clock. You go home and cheer up your wife. How is Hose?" "He's still in bed. The Doctor says his skull is broken in one place, but he'll be over it in a few weeks." Tom hobbled back to his house, shaking hands with scores of silent men on the way. The Preacher crawled to his desk and wrote this note to the young officer in command of the post, MY DEAR CAPTAIN, In the interest of peace and order I would advise you to telegraph to Independence for two companies of white regulars to come immediately on a special, and that you start your negro troops on double quick marching order to meet them. There will be a thousand armed men in Hambright by sundown, and no power on earth can prevent the extermination of that negro company if they attack them. I will do my best to prevent further bloodshed but I can do nothing if these troops remain here to-day. Respectfully, JOHN DURHAM. The Commandant acted an the advice immediately. * * * * * * It was the week following before the sales began. There was no help for it. The town and the county were doomed to a ruin more complete and terrible than the four years of war had brought. Independence had been saved by a skillful movement of General Worth, who sought an interview with Legree when his council first issued their levy of thirty per cent for municipal purposes. "Mr. Legree, let's understand one another," said the General. "All right, I'm a man of reason." "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush!" "Every time, General." "Well, call off your dogs, and rescind your order for a thirty per cent tax levy, and I'll raise $30,000 in cash and pay it to you in two days." "Make it $50,000 and it's a bargain." "Agreed." The General raised twenty thousand in the city, went North and borrowed the remaining thirty thousand. Legree and his brigands received this ransom and moved on to the next town. Poor Hambright was but a scrawny little village on a red hill with no big values to be saved, and no mills to interest the commercial world, and the auctioneer lifted his hammer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX THE RALLY OF THE CLANSMEN When the Preacher took the train in Boston for the South, his friendly merchant, a deacon, was by his side. "Now, you put my name and address down in your note book, William Crane. And don't forget about us." "I'll never forget you, deacon." "Say, I just as well tell you," whispered the deacon bending close, "we are not going to allow you to stay down South. We'll be down after you before long—just as well be packing up." The Preacher smiled, looked out of the car window, and made no reply. "Well, good-bye, Doctor, good-bye. God bless you and your work and your people! You've brought me a message warm from God's heart. I'll never forget it." "Good-bye deacon." As the train whirled southward through the rich populous towns and cities of the North, again the sharp contrast with the desolation of his own land cut him like a knife. He thought of Legree and Haley, Perkins and Tim Shelby robbing widows and orphans and sweeping the poverty-stricken Southland with riot, pillage, murder and brigandage, and posing as the representatives of the conscience of the North. And his heart was heavy with sorrow. On reaching Hambright he was thunderstruck at the news of the sale of Mrs. Gaston's place and her tragic death. "Why, my dear, I sent the money to her on the first Monday I spent in Boston!" he declared to his wife. "It never reached her." "Then Dave Haley, the dirty slave driver, has held that letter. I'll see to this." He hurried to the post-office. "Mr. Haley," he exclaimed, "I sent a money order letter to Mrs. Gaston from Boston on Monday a week ago." "Yes, sir," answered Haley in his blandest manner, "it got here the day after the sale." "You're an infamous liar!" shouted the Preacher. "Of course! Of course! All Union men are liars to bear rebel traitors talk." "I'll report you to Washington for this rascality." "So do, so do. Mor'n likely the President and the Post-Office Department 'll be glad to have this information from so great a man." As the Preacher was leaving the post-office be encountered the Hon. Tim Shelby dressed in the height of fashion, his silk hat shining in the sun, and his eyes rolling with the joy of living. The Preacher stepped squarely in front of Tim. "Tim Shelby, I hear you have moved into Mrs. Gaston's home and are using her furniture. By whose authority do you dare such insolence?" "By authority of the law, sir. Mrs. Gaston died intestate. Her effects are in the hands of our County Administrator, Mr. Ezra Perkins. I'll be pleased to receive you, sir, any time you would like to call I!" said Tim with a bow. "I'll call in due time," replied the Preacher, looking Tim straight in the eye. Haley had been peeping through the window, watching and listening to this encounter. "'These charmin' preachers think they own this county, brother Shelby," laughed Haley as he grasped Tim's outstretched hand. "Yes, they are the curse of the state. I wish to God they had succeeded in burning him alive that night the boys tried it. They'll get him later on. Brother Haley, he's a dangerous man. He must be put out of the way, or we'll never have smooth sailing in this county." "I believe you're right, he's just been in here cussin' me about that letter of the widder's that didn't get to her in time. He thinks he can run the post-office." "Well, we'll show him this county's in the hands of the loyal!" added Tim. "Heard the news from Charleston?" "Heard it? I guess I have. I talked with the commanding General in Charleston two weeks ago. He told me then he was going to set aside that decision of the Supreme Court in a ringing order permitting the marriage of negroes to white women, and commanding its enforcement on every military post. I see he's done it in no uncertain words." "It's a great day, brother, for the world. There'll be no more colour line." "Yes, times have changed," said Tim with a triumphant smile. "I guess our white hot-bloods will sweat and bluster and swear a little when they read that order. But we've got the bayonets to enforce it. They'd just as well cool down." "That's the stuff," said Haley, taking a fresh chew of tobacco. "Let 'em squirm. They're flat on their backs. We are on top, and we are going to stay on top. I expect to lead a fair white bride into my house before another year and have poor white aristocrats to tend my lawn." Tim worked his ears and looked up at the ceiling in a dreamy sort of way. "That'll be a sight won't it!" exclaimed Haley with delight. "Where's that scoundrel Nelse that lived with Mrs. Gaston ?" "Oh, we fixed him," said Tim. "The black rascal wouldn't join the League, and wouldn't vote with his people, and still showed fight after we beat him half to death, so we put a levy of fifty dollars on his cabin, sold him out, and every piece of furniture, and every rag of clothes we could get hold of. He'll leave the country now, or we'll kill him next time." "You ought to a killed him the first time, and then the job would ha' been over." "Oh, we'll have the country in good shape in a little while, and don't you forget it." The news of the order of the military commandant at "District No. 2," comprising the Carolinas, abrogating the decisions of the North Carolina Supreme Court, forbidding the intermarriage of negroes and whites, fell like a bombshell on Campbell county. The people had not believed that the military authorities would dare go to the length of attempting to force social equality. This order from Charleston was not only explicit, its language was peculiarly emphatic. It apparently commanded intermarriage, and ordered the military to enforce the command at the point of the bayonet. The feelings of the people were wrought to the pitch of fury. It needed but a word from a daring leader, and a massacre of every negro, scalawag and carpet-bagger in the county might have followed. The Rev. John Durham was busy day and night seeking to allay excitement and prevent an uprising of the white population. Along with the announcement of this military order, came the startling news that Simon Legree, whose infamy was known from end to end of the state, was to be the next Governor, and that the Hon. Tim Shelby was a candidate for Chief justice of the Supreme Court. Legree was in Washington at the time an a mission to secure a stand of twenty thousand rifles from the Secretary of War, with which to arm the negro troop he was drilling for the approaching election. The grant was made and Legree came back in triumph with his rifles. Relief for the ruined people was now a hopeless dream. Black despair was clutching at every white man's heart. The taxpayers had held a convention and sent their representatives to Washington exposing the monstrous thefts that were being committed under the authority of the government by the organised band of thieves who were looting the state. But the thieves were the pets of politicians high in power. The committee of taxpayers were insulted and sent home to pay their taxes. And then a thing happened in Hambright that brought matters to a sudden crisis. The Hon. Tim Shelby as school commissioner, had printed the notices for an examination of school teachers for Campbell county. An enormous tax had been levied and collected by the county for this purpose, but no school had been opened. Tim announced, however, that the school would be surely opened the first Monday in October. Miss Mollie Graham, the pretty niece of the old doctor, was struggling to support a blind mother and four younger children. Her father and brother had been killed in the war. Their house had been sold for taxes, and they were required now to pay Tim Shelby ten dollars a month for rent. When she saw that school notice her heart gave a leap. If she could only get the place, it would save them from beggary. She fairly ran to the Preacher to get his advice. "Certainly, child, try for it. It's humiliating to ask such a favour of that black ape, but if you can save your loved ones, do it." So with trembling hand she knocked at Tim's door. He required all applicants to apply personally at his house. Tim met her with the bows and smirks of a dancing master. "Delighted to see your pretty face this morning, Miss Graham," he cried enthusiastically. The girl blushed and hesitated at the door. "Just walk right in the parlour, I'll join you in a moment." She bravely set her lips and entered. "And now what can I do for you, Miss Graham?" "I've come to apply for a teacher's place in the school." "Ah indeed, I'm glad to know that. There is only one difficulty. You must be loyal. Your people were rebels, and the new government has determined to have only loyal teachers." "I think I'm loyal enough to the old flag now that our people have surrendered," said the girl. "Yes, yes, I dare say, but do you think you can accept the new régime of government and society which we are now establishing in the South? We have abolished the colour line. Would you have a mixed school if assigned one?" "I think Id prefer to teach a negro school outright to a mixed one," she said after a moment's hesitation. Tim continued, "You know we are living in a new world. The supreme law of the land has broken down every barrier of race and we are henceforth to be one people. The struggle for existence knows no race or colour. It's a struggle now for bread. I'm in a position to be of great help to you and your family if you will only let me." The girl suddenly rose impelled by some resistless instinct. "May I have the place then?" she asked approaching the door. "Well, now you know it depends really altogether on my fancy. I'll tell you what I'll do. You're still full of silly prejudices. I can see that. But if you will overcome them enough to do one thing for me as a test, that will cost you nothing and of which the world will never be the wiser, I'll give you the place and more, I'll remit the ten dollars a month rent you're now paying. Will you do it?" "What is it?" the girl asked with pale quivering lips. "Let me kiss you—once!" he whispered. With a scream, she sprang past him out of the door, ran like a deer across the lawn, and fell sobbing in her mother's arms when she reached her home. The next day the town was unusually quiet. Tim had business with the Commandant of the company of regulars still quartered at Hambright. He spent most of the day with him, and walked about the streets ostentatiously showing his familiarity with the corporal who accompanied him. A guard of three soldiers was stationed around Tim's house for two nights and then withdrawn. The next night at twelve o'clock two hundred white-robed horses assembled around the old home of Mrs. Gaston where Tim was sleeping. The moon was full and flooded the lawn with silver glory. On those horses sat two hundred white-robed silent men whose close-fitting hood disguises looked like the mail helmets of ancient knights. It was the work of a moment to seize Tim, and bind him across a horse's back. Slowly the grim procession moved to the court house square. When the sun rose next morning the lifeless body of Tim Shelby was dangling from a rope tied to the iron rail of the balcony of the court house. His neck was broken and his body was hanging low—scarcely three feet from the ground. His thick lips had been split with a sharp knife and from his teeth hung this placard: "The answer of the Anglo-Saxon race to Negro lips that dare pollute with words the womanhood of the South. K. K. K." And the Ku Klux Klan was master of Campbell county. The origin of this Law and Order League which sprang up like magic in a night and nullified the programme of Congress though backed by an army of a million veteran soldiers, is yet a mystery. The simple truth is, it was a spontaneous and resistless racial uprising of clansmen of highland origin living along the Appalachian mountains and foothills of the South, and it appeared almost simultaneously in every Southern state produced by the same terrible conditions. It was the answer to their foes of a proud and indomitable race of men driven to the wall. In the hour of their defeat they laid down their arms and accepted in good faith the results of the war. And then, when unarmed and defenceless, a group of pot-house politicians for political ends, renewed the war, and attempted to wipe out the civilisation of the South. This Invisible Empire of White Robed Anglo-Saxon Knights was simply the old answer of organised manhood to organised crime. Its purpose was to bring order out of chaos, protect the weak and defenseless, the widows and orphans of brave men who had died for their country, to drive from power the thieves who were robbing the people, redeem the commonwealth from infamy, and reestablish civilisation. Within one week from its appearance, life and property were as safe as in any Northern community. When the negroes came home from their League meeting one night they ran terror stricken past long rows of white horsemen. Not a word was spoken, but that was the last meeting the "Union League of America" ever held in Hambright. Every negro found guilty of a misdemeanor was promptly thrashed and warned against its recurrence. The sudden appearance of this host of white cavalry grasping at their throats with the grip of cold steel struck the heart of Legree and his followers with the chill of a deadly fear. It meant inevitable ruin, overthrow, and a prison cell for the "loyal" statesmen who were with him in his efforts to maintain the new "republican form of government" in North Carolina. At the approaching election, this white terror could intimidate every negro in the state unless he could arm them all, suspend the writ of Habeas Corpus, and place every county under the strictest martial law. Washington was besieged by a terrified army of the "loyal" who saw their occupation threatened. They begged for more troops, more guns for negro militia, and for the reestablishment of universal martial law until the votes were properly counted. But the great statesmen laughed them to scorn as a set of weak cowards and fools frightened by negro stories of ghosts. It was incredible to them that the crushed, poverty stricken and unarmed South could dare challenge the power of the National Government. They were sent back with scant comfort. The night that Ezra Perkins and Haley got back from Washington, where they had gone summoned by Legree and Hogg, to testify to the death of Tim Shelby, they saw a sight that made their souls quake. At ten o'clock, the Ku Klux Klan held a formal parade through the streets of Hambright. How the news was circulated nobody knew, but it seemed everybody in the county knew of it. The streets were lined with thousands of people who had poured in town that afternoon. At exactly ten o'clock, a bugle call was heard on the hill to the west of the town, and the muffled tread of soft shod horses came faintly on their ears. Women stood on the sidewalks, holding their babies and smiling, and children were laughing and playing in the streets. They rode four abreast in perfect order slowly through the town. It was utterly impossible to recognise a man or a horse, so complete was the simple disguise of the white sheet which blanketed the horse fitting closely over his head and ears and falling gracefully over his form toward the ground. No citizen of Hambright was in the procession. They were all in the streets watching it pass. There were fifteen hundred men in line. But the reports next day all agreed in fixing the number at over five thousand. Perkins and Haley had watched it from a darkened room. "Brother Haley, that's the end! Lord I wish I was back in Michigan, jail er no jail," said Perkins mopping the perspiration from his brow. "We'll have ter dig out purty quick, I reckon," answered Haley. "And to think them fools at Washington laughed at us!" cried Perkins clinching his fists. And that night, mothers and fathers gathered their children to bed with a sense of grateful security not felt through years of war and turmoil.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX HOW CIVILISATION WAS SAVED The success of the Ku Klux Klan was so complete, its organisers were dazed. Its appeal to the ignorance and superstition of the Negro at once reduced the race to obedience and order. Its threat against the scalawag and carpet-bagger struck terror to their craven souls, and the "Union League," "Red Strings," and "Heroes of America" went to pieces with incredible rapidity. Major Stuart Dameron, the chief of the Klan in Campbell county, was holding a conference with the Rev. John Durham in his study. "Doctor, our work has succeeded beyond our wildest dream." "Yes, and I thank God we can breathe freely if only for a moment, Major. The danger now lies in our success. We are necessarily playing with fire." "I know it, and it requires my time day and night to prevent reckless men from disgracing us." "It will not be necessary to enforce the death penalty against any other man in this county, Major. The execution of Tim Shelby was absolutely necessary at the time and it has been sufficient." "I agree with you. I've impressed this on the matter of every lodge, but some of them are growing reckless." "Who are they?" "Young Allan McLeod for one. He is a dare devil and only eighteen years old." "He's a troublesome boy. I don't seem to have any influence with him. But I think Mrs. Durham can manage him. He seems to think a great deal of her, and in spite of his wild habits, he comes regularly to her Sunday School class." "I hope she can bring him to his senses." "Leave him to me then a while. We will see what can be done." * * * * * * Hogg's Legislature promptly declared the Scotch-Irish hill counties in a state of insurrection, passed a militia bill, and the Governor issued a proclamation suspending the writ of Habeas Corpus in these counties. Fearing the effects of negro militia in the hill districts, he surprised Hambright by suddenly marching into the court house square a regiment of white mountain guerillas recruited from the outlaws of East Tennessee and commanded by a noted desperado, Colonel Henry Berry. The regiment had two pieces of field artillery. It was impossible for them to secure evidence against any member of the Klan unless by the intimidation of some coward who could be made to confess. Not a disguise had even been penetrated. It was the rule of the order for its decrees to be executed in the district issuing the decree by the lodge furthest removed in the county from the scene. In this way not a man or a horse was ever identified. The Colonel made an easy solution of this difficulty, however. Acting under instructions from Governor Hogg, he secured from Haley and Perkins a list of every influential man in every precinct in the county, and a list of possible turncoats and cowards. He detailed five hundred of his men to make arrests, distributed them throughout the county and arrested without warrants over two hundred citizens in one day. The next day Berry hand-cuffed together the Rev. John Durham and Major Dameron, and led than escorted by a company of cavalry on a grand circuit of the county, that the people might be terrified by the sight of their chains. An ominous silence greeted them on every hand. Additional arrests were made by this troop and twenty-five more prisoners led into Hambright the next day." The jail was crowded, and the court house was used as a jail. Over a hundred and fifty men were confined in the court room. Rev. John Durham was everywhere among the crowd, laughing, joking and cheering the men. "Major Dameron, a jail never held so many honest men before," he said with a smile, as he looked over the crowd of his church members gathered from every quarter of the county. "Well, Doctor, you've got a quorum here of your church and you can call them to order for business." "That's a fact, isn't it?" "There's old Deacon Kline over there who looks like he wished he hadn't come! The Preacher walked over to the deacon. "What's the matter, brother Kline, you look pensive." The deacon laughed. "Yes, I don't like my bed. I'm used to feathers." "Well, they say they are going to give you feathers mixed with tar so you won't lose them so easily." "I'll have company, I reckon," said the deacon with a wink. "The funny thing, deacon, is that Major Dameron tells me there isn't a man in all the crowd of two hundred fifty arrested who ever went on a raid. It's too bad you old fellows have to pay for the follies of youth." "It is tough. But we can stand it, Preacher." They clasped hands. "Haven't smelled a coward anywhere have you, deacon?" "I've seen one or two a little fidgety, I thought. Cheer 'em up with a word, Preacher." Springing on the platform of the judge's desk he looked ever the crowd for a moment, and a cheer shook the building. "Boys, I don't believe there's a single coward in our ranks." Another cheer. "Just keep cool now and let our enemies do the talking. In ten days every man of you will be back at home at his work." "How will we get out with the writ suspended?" asked a man standing near. "That's the richest thing of all. A United States judge has just decided that the Governor of the state cannot suspend the rights of a citizen of the United States under the new Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution so recently rammed down our throats. Hogg is hoisted on his own petard. Our lawyers are now serving out writs of Habeas Corpus before this Federal judge under the Fourteenth Amendment, and you will be discharged in less than ten days unless there's a skunk among you. And I don't smell one anywhere." Again a cheer shook the building. An orderly walked up to the Preacher and handed him a note. "Read it!" the men crowded around. "Read it, Major Dameron, I'm dumb," said the Preacher. "A military order from the dirty rascal, Berry, commanding the mountain bummers, forbidding the Rev. John Durham, to speak during his imprisonment!" A roar of laughter followed this announcement. "That's cruel! It'll kill him!" cried Deacon Kline as he jabbed the Preacher in the ribs. In a few minutes, the Preacher was back in his place with five of the best singers from his church by his side. He began to sing the old hymns of Zion and every man in the room joined until the building quivered with melody. "Now a good old Yankee hymn, that suits this hour, written by an old Baptist preacher I met in Boston the other day!" cried the Preacher. "My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing!" Heavens, how they sang it, while the Preacher lined it off, stood above them beating time, and led in a clear mighty Voice! Again the orderly appeared with a note. "What is it now?" they cried on every side. Again Major Dameron announced "Military order No. 2, forbidding the Rev. John Durham to sing or induce anybody to sing while is prison." Another roar of laughter that broke into a cheer which made the glass rattle. When the soldier had disappeared, the Rev. John Durham ascended the platform, looked about him with a humourous twinkle in his eye, straightened himself to his full height and crowded like a rooster! A cheer shook the building to its foundations. Roar after roar of its defiant cadence swept across the square and made Haley and Perkins tremble as they looked at each other over their conference table with Berry. "What the devil's the matter now?" cried Haley. "Do you suppose it's a rescue?" whispered Perkins. "No, it's some new trick of that damned Preacher. I'll chain him in a room to himself," growled Berry. "Better not, Colonel. He's the pet of these white devils. Ye'd better let him alone." Berry accepted the advice. Five days later the prisoners were arraigned before the United States judge, Preston Rivers, at Independence. Not a scrap of evidence could be produced against them. Governor Hogg was present, with a flaming military escort. He held a stormy interview with Judge Rivers. "If you discharge these prisoners, you destroy the government of this state, sir!" thundered Hogg. "Are they not citizens of the United States? Does not the Fourteenth Amendment apply to a white man as well as a negro?" quietly asked the judge. "Yes, but they are conspirators against the Union. They are murderers and felons." "Then prove it in my court and I'll hand them back to you. They are entitled to a trial, under our Constitution." "I'll demand your removal by the President," shouted Hogg. "Get out of this room, or I'll remove you with the point of my boot!" thundered the judge with rising wrath. "You have suspended the writ of Habeas Corpus to win a political campaign. The Ku Klux Klan has broken up your Leagues. You are fighting for your life. But I'll tell you now, you can't suspend the Constitution of the United States while I'm a Federal judge in this state. I am not a henchman of yours to do your dirty campaign work. The election is but ten days off. Your scheme is plain enough. But if you want to keep these men in prison it will be done on sworn evidence of guilt and a warrant, not on your personal whim." The Governor cursed, raved and threatened in vain. Judge Rivers discharged every prisoner and warned Colonel Berry against the repetition of such arrests within his jurisdiction. When these prisoners were discharged, a great mass-meeting was called to give them a reception in the public square of Independence. A platform was hastily built in the square and that night five thousand excited people crowded past the stand, shook hands with the men and cheered till they were hoarse. The Governor watched the demonstration in helpless fury from his room in the hotel. The speaking began at nine o'clock. Every discordant element of the old South's furious political passions was now melted into harmonious unity. Whig and Democrat who had fought one another with relentless hatred sat side by side on that platform. Secessionist and Unionist now clasped hands. It was a White Man's Party, and against it stood in solid array the Black Man's Party, led by Simon Legree. Henceforth there could be but one issue, are you a White Man or a Negro? They declared there was but one question to be settled:— "Shall the future American be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto? These determined impassioned men believed that this question was more important than any theory of tariff or finance and that it was larger than the South, or even the nation, and held in its solution the brightest hopes of the progress of the human race. And they believed that they were ordained of God in this crisis to give this question its first authoritative answer. The state burst into a flame of excitement that fused in its white heat the whole Anglo-Saxon race. In vain Hogg marched and counter-marched his twenty thousand state troops. They only added fuel to the fire. If they arrested a man, he became forthwith a hero and was given an ovation. They sent bands of music and played at the jail doors, and the ladies filled the jail with every delicacy that could tempt the appetite or appeal to the senses. Hogg and Legree were in panic of fear with the certainty of defeat, exposure and a felon's cell before them. Two days before the election, the prayer meeting was held at eight o'clock in the Baptist church at Hambright. It was the usual mid-week service, but the attendance was unusually large. After the meeting, the Preacher, Major Dameron, and eleven men quietly walked back to the church and assembled in the pastor's study. The door opened at the rear of the church and could be approached by a side street. "Gentlemen," said Major Dameron, "I've asked you here to-night to deliver to you the most important order I have ever given, and to have Dr. Durham as our chaplain to aid me in impressing on you its great urgency." "We're ready for orders, Chief," said young Ambrose Kline, the deacon's son. "You are to call out every troop of the Klan in full force the night before the election. You are to visit every negro in the county, and warn every one as he values his life not to approach the polls at this election. Those who come, will be allowed to vote without molestation. All cowards will stay at home. Any man, black or white, who can be scared out of his ballot is not fit to have one. Back of every ballot is the red blood of the man that votes. The ballot is force. This is simply a test of manhood. It will be enough to show who is fit to rule the state. As the masters of the eleven township lodges of the Klan, you are the sole guardians of society to-day. When a civilised government has been restored, your work will be done." "We will do it, sir," cried Kline. "Let me say, men," said the Preacher, "that I heartily endorse the plan of your chief. See that the work is done thoroughly and it will be done for all time. In a sense this is fraud. But it is the fraud of war. The spy is a fraud, but we must use him when we fight. Is war justifiable? "It is too late now for us to discuss that question. We an in a war, the most ghastly and hellish ever waged, a war on women and children, the starving and the wounded, and that with sharpened swords. The Turk and Saracen once waged such a war. We must face it and fight it out. Shall we flinch?" "No! no!" came the passionate answer from every man. "You are asked to violate for the moment a statutory law. There is a higher law. You are the sworn officers of that higher law." The group of leaders left the church with enthusiasm and on the following night they carried out their instructions to the letter. The election was remarkably quiet. Thousands of soldiers were used at the polls by Hogg's orders. But they seemed to make no impression on the determined men who marched up between their files and put the ballots in the box. Legree's ticket was buried beneath an avalanche. The new "Conservative" party carried every county in the state save twelve and elected one hundred and six members of the new legislature out of a total of one hundred and twenty. The next day hundreds of carpet-bagger thieves fled to tie North, and Legree led the procession. Legree had on deposit in New York two millions of dollars, and the total amount of his part of the thefts he had engineered reached five millions. He opened an office on Wall Street, bought a seat in the Stock Exchange, and became one of the most daring and successful of a group of robbers who preyed on the industries of the nation. The new Legislature appointed a Fraud Commission which uncovered the infamies of the Legree régime, but every thief had escaped. They promptly impeached the Governor and removed him from office, and the old commonwealth once more lifted up her head and took her place in the ranks of civilised communities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI THE OLD AND THE NEW NEGRO Nelse was elated over the defeat and dissolution of the Leagues that had persecuted him with such malignant hatred. When the news of the election came he was still in bed suffering from his wounds. He had received an internal injury that threatened to prove fatal. "Dar now!" he cried, sitting up in bed, "Ain't I done tole you no kinky-headed niggers gwine ter run dis gov'ment!" "Keep still dar, ole man, you'll be faintin' ergin," worried Aunt Eve. "Na honey, I'se feelin' better. Gwine ter git up and meander down town en ax dem niggers how's de Ku Kluxes comin' on dese days." In spite of all Eye could say he crawled out of bed, fumbled into his clothes and started down town, leaning heavily on his cane. He had gone about a block, when he suddenly reeled and fell. Eve was watching him from the door, and was quickly by his side. He died that afternoon at three o'clock. He regained consciousness before the end and asked Eve for his banjo. He put it lovingly into the hands of Charlie Gaston who stood by the bed crying. "You keep 'er, honey. You lub 'er talk better'n any body in de worl', en 'member Nelse when you hear 'er moan en sigh. En when she talk short en sassy en make 'em all gin ter shuffle, dat's we too. Dat's me got back in 'er." Charlie Gaston rode with Aunt Eve to the cemetery. He walked back home through the fields with Dick. "I wouldn' cry 'bout er ole nigger!" said Dick looking into his reddened eyes. "Can't help it. He was my best friend." "Haint I wid you?" "Yes, but you ain't Nelse." "Well, I stan' by you des de same."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV A MODERN MIRACLE Mrs. Durham, the Doctor wants you," said Charlie when McLeod's footfall had died away. "Charlie, dear, why don't you call we 'Mama'—surely you love me a little wee bit, don't you?" she asked, taking the boy's hand tenderly in hers. "Yes'm," he replied hanging his head. "Then do say Mama. You don't know how good it would be in my ears." "I try to but it chokes me," he half whispered, glancing timidly up at her. "Let me call you Aunt Margaret, I always wanted an aunt and I think your name Margaret's so sweet," he shyly added. She kissed him and said, "All right, if that's all you will give me." She passed on into the library where the Preacher waited her. "My dear, I've just given young McLeod a piece of my mind. I wanted to say to you that you are entirely mistaken in his character. He's a bad egg. I know all the facts about his treachery. He's as smooth a liar as I've met in years." "With all his brute nature, there's some good in him," she persisted. "Well, it will stay in him. He will never let it get out." "All right, have your way about it for the time. We'll see who is right in the long run. Now I've a move pressing and tougher problem for your solution." "What is it?" "Dick." "What's he done this time?" "He steals everything he can get his hands on." "He is a puzzle." "He's the greatest liar I ever saw," she continued. "He simply will not tell the truth if he can think up a lie in time. I'd say run him off the place, but for Charlie. He seems to love the little scoundrel. I'm afraid his influence over Charlie will be vicious, but it would break the child's heart to drive him away. What shall we do with him?" The Preacher laughed. "I give it up, my dear, you've got beyond my depth now. I don't know whether he's got a soul. Certainly the very rudimentary foundations of morals seem lacking. I believe you could take a young ape and teach him quicker. I leave him with you. At present it's a domestic problem." "Thanks, that's so encouraging." Dick was a puzzle and no mistake about it. But to Charlie his rolling mischievous eyes, his cunning fingers and his wayward imagination were unfailing mountains of life. He found every bird's nest within two miles of town. He could track a rabbit almost as swiftly and surely as a hound. He could work like fury when he had a mind to, and loaf a half day over one row of the garden when he didn't want to work, which was his chronic condition. When the revival season set in for the negroes in the summer, the days of sorrow began for householders. Every negro in the county became absolutely worthless and remained so until the emotional insanity attending their meetings wore off. Aunt Mary, Mrs. Durham's cook, got salvation over again every summer with increasing power and increasing degeneration in her work. Some nights she got home at two o'clock and breakfast was not ready until nine. Some nights she didn't get home at all, and Mrs. Durham had to get breakfast herself. It was a hard time for Dick who had not yet experienced religion, and on whom fell the brunt of the extra work and Mrs. Durham's fretfulness besides. "I tell you what less do, Charlie!" he cried one day. "Less go down ter dat nigger chu'ch, en bus' up de meetin'! I'se gettin' tired er dis." "How'll you do it?" "I show you somefin'?" He reached under his shirt next to his skin, and pulled out Dr. Graham's sun glass. "Where'd you get that, Dick?" "Foun' it whar er man lef' it." He walled his eyes solemnly. "Des watch here when I turns 'im in de sun. I kin set dat pile er straw er fire wid it!" "You mustn't set the church afire!" warned Charlie. "Now, chile, but I git up in de gallery, en when ole Uncle Josh gins ter holler en bawl en r'ar en charge, I fling dat blaze er light right on his bal' haid, en I set him afire sho's you bawn!" "Dick, I wouldn't do, it," said Charlie, laughing in spite of himself. Charlie refused to accompany him. But Dick's mind was set on the necessity of this work of reform. So in the afternoon he slipped off without leave and quietly made his way into the gallery of the Negro Baptist church. The excitement was running high. Uncle Josh had preached one sermon an hour in length, and had called up the mourners. At least fifty had come forward. The benches had been cleared for five rows back from the pulpit to give plenty of room for the mourners to crawl over the floor, walk back and forth and shout when they "came through," and for their friends to fan them. This open place was covered with wheat straw to keep the mourners off the bare floor, and afford some sort of comfort for those far advanced in mourning, who went into trances and sometimes lay motionless for hours on their backs or flat on their faces. The mourners had kicked and shuffled this straw out to the edges and the floor was bare. Uncle Josh had sent two deacons out for more straw. In the meantime he was working himself up to another mighty climax of exhortation to move sinners to come forward. "Come on ter glory you po, po sinners, en flee ter de Lamb er God befo de flames er hell swaller you whole! At de last great day de Sperit 'll flash de light er his shinin' face on dis ole parch up sinful worl', en hit 'll ketch er fire in er minute, an de yearth 'll melt wid furvient heat! Whar 'll you be when den po tremblin' sinner? Whar 'll you be when de flame er de Sperit de smites de moon and de stars wid fire, en dey gin ter drap outten de sky en knock big holes in de burnin' yearth? Whar 'll you be when de rocks melt wit dat heat, en de sun hide his face in de black smoke dat rise fum de pit?" Moans and groans and shrieks, louder and louder filled the air. Uncle Josh paused a moment and looked for his deacons with the straw. They were just coming up the steps with a great armful over their heads. "What's de mattter wid you breddern! Fetch on dat wheat straw! Here's dese tremblin' souls gwine down inter de dames er hell des fur de lak er wheat straw!" The brethren hurried forward with the wheat straw, and just as they reached Uncle Josh standing perspiring in the midst of his groaning mourners, Dick flashed from the gallery a stream of dazzling light on the old man's face and held it steadily on his bald head. Josh was too astonished to move at first. He was simply paralysed with fear. It was all right to talk about the flame of the Spirit, but he wasn't exactly ready to run into it. Suddenly he clapped his hands on the top of his head and sprang straight up in the air yelling in a plain everyday profane voice, "God-der-mighty! What's dat?" The brethren holding the straw saw it and stood dumb with terror. The light disappeared from Uncle Josh's head and lit the straw in splendour on one of the deacon's shoulders. Aunt Mary's voice was heard above the mourners' din, clear, shrill and soul piercing. "G-l-o-r-y! G-1-o-r-y ter God! De flame er de Sperit! De judgment day! Yas Lawd, I'se here! Glory! Halleluyah!" Suddenly the straw an the deacon's back burst into flames! And pandemonium broke loose. A weak-minded sinner screamed, "De flames er Hell!" The mourners smelled the smoke and sprang from the door with white staring eyes. When they saw the fire and got their bearings they made for the open,—they jumped on each others' back and made for the door like madmen. Those nearest the windows sprang through, and when the lower part of the window was jammed, big buck negroes jumped on the backs of the lower crowd and plunged through the two upper sashes with a crash that added new terror to the panic. In two minutes the church was empty, and the yard full of crazy, shouting negroes. Dick stepped from the gallery into the crowd as the last ones emerged, ran up to the pulpit and stamped out the fire in the straw with his bare feet. He looked around to see if they had left anything valuable behind in the stampede, and sauntered leisurely out of the church. "Now dog-gone 'em let 'em yell!" he muttered to himself. When Uncle Josh sufficiently recovered his senses to think, and saw the church still standing, with not even a whiff of smoke to be seen, instead of the roaring furnace he had expected, he was amazed. He called his scattered deacons together and they went cautiously back to investigate. "Hit's no use in talkin' Bre'r Josh, dey sho wuz er fire!" cried one of the deacons. "Sho's de Lawd's in heaben. I feel it gittin' on my fingers fo' I drap dat straw!" said another. "Hit smite me fust right top er my haid!" whispered Uncle Josh in awe. They cautiously approached the pulpit and there in front of it lay the charred fragments of the burned straw pile. They gathered around it in awe-struck wonder. One of them touched it with his foot. "Doan do dat!" cried Uncle Josh, lifting his hand with authority. They drew back, Uncle Josh saw the immense power in that heap of charred straw. Some of it was a little damp and it had been only partly burned. "Dar's de mericle er de Sperit!" he solemnly declared. "Yas Lawd!" echoed a deacon. "Fetch de hammer, en de saw, a de nails; an de boards en build right dar en altar ter de Sperit!" were his prophetic commands. And they did. They got an old show case of glass, put the charred straw in it, and built an open box work around it just where it fell in front of the pulpit. Then a revival broke out that completely paralysed the industries of Campbell county. Every negro stopped work and went to that church. Uncle Josh didn't have to preach or to plead. They come in troops towards the magic altar, whose fame and mystery had thrilled every superstitious soul with its power. The benches were all moved out and the whole church floor given up to mourners. Uncle Josh had an easy time walking around just adding a few terrifying hints to trembling sinners, or helping to hold some strong sister when she had "come through," with so much glory in her bones that there was danger she would hurt somebody. After a week the matter became so serious the white people set in motion an investigation of the affair. Dick had thrown out a mysterious hint that he knew some things that were very funny. "Doan you tell nobody!" he would solemnly say to Charlie. And then he would lie down on the grass and roll and laugh. At length by dint of perseverance, and a bribe of a quarter, the Preacher induced Dick to explain the mystery. He did, and it broke up the meeting. Uncle Josh's fury knew no bounds. He was heart-broken at the sudden collapse of his revival, chagrined at the recollection of his own terror at the fire, and fearful of an avalanche of backsliders from the meeting among those who had professed even with the greatest glory. He demanded that the Preacher should turn Dick over to him for correction. The Preacher took a few hours to consider whether he should whip him himself or turn him over to Uncle Josh. Dick heard Uncle Josh's demand. Out behind the stable he and Charlie held a council of war. "You go see Miss Mar'get fur me, en git up close to her, en tell her taint right ter 'low no low down black nigger ter whip me!" "All right Dick, I will," agreed Charlie. "Case ef ole Josh beats me I gwine ter run away. I nebber git ober dat." Dick had threatened to run away often before when he wanted to force Charlie to do something for him. Once he had gone a mile out of town with his clothes tied in a bundle, and Charlie trudging after him begging him not to leave. The boy did his best to save Dick the humiliation of a whipping at the hands of Uncle Josh, but in vain. When Uncle Josh led him out to the stable lot, his face was not pleasant to look upon. There was a dangerous gleam in Dick's eye that boded no good to his enemy. "You imp er de debbil!" exclaimed Uncle Josh shaking his switch with unction. "I fool you good enough, you ole bal' headed ape!" answered Dick gritting his teeth defiantly. "I make you sing enudder chune fo I'se done wid you." "En if you does, nigger, you know what I gwine do fur you?" cried Dick rolling his eyes up at his enemy. "What kin you do, honey?" asked Uncle Josh, humouring his victim with the evident relish of a cat before his meal on a mouse. "Ef you hits me hard, I gwine ter burn you house down on you haid some night, en run erway des es sho es I kin stick er match to it," said Dick. "You is, is you?" thundered Josh with wrath. "Dat I is. En I burn yo ole chu'ch de same night." Uncle Josh was silent a moment. Dick's words had chilled his heart. He was afraid of him, but he was afraid to back down from what was now evidently his duty. So without further words he whipped him. Yet to save his life he could not hit him as hard as he thought he deserved. That night Dick disappeared from Hambright, and for weeks every evening at dusk the wistful face of Charlie Gaston could be seen on the big hill to the south of town vainly watching for somebody. He would always take something to eat in his pockets, and when he gave up his vigil he would place the food under a big shelving rock where they had often played together. But the birds and ground squirrels ate it. He would slip back the next day hoping to see Dick jump out of the cave and surprise him. And then at last he gave it up, sat down under the rock and cried. He knew Dick would grow to be a man somewhere out in the big world and never come back.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Book Two—Love's Dream</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III FLORA Hambright had changed but little in the eighteen years of peace that had followed the terrors of Legree's régime. The population had doubled, though but few houses had been built. The town had not grown from the development of industry, but for a very simple reason—the country people had moved into the town, seeking refuge from a new terror that was growing of late more and more a menace to a country home, the roving criminal negro. The birth of a girl baby was sure to make a father restless, and when the baby looked up into his face one day with the soft light of a maiden, he gave up his farm and moved to town. The most important development of these eighteen years was the complete alienation of the white and black races as compared with the old familiar trust of domestic life. When Legree finished his work as the master artificer of the Reconstruction Policy, he had dug a gulf between the races as deep as hell. It had never been bridged. The deed was done and it had crystallised into the solid rock that lies at the basis of society. It was done at a formative period, and it could no more be undone now than you could roll the universe back in its course. The younger generation of white men only knew the Negro as an enemy of his people in politics and society. He never came in contact with him except in menial service, in which the service rendered was becoming more and more trifling, and his habits more insolent. He had his separate schools, churches, preachers and teachers and his political leaders were the beneficiaries of Legree's legacies. With the Anglo-Saxon race guarding the door of marriage with fire and sword, the effort was being made to build a nation inside a nation of two antagonistic rices. No such thing had ever been done in the history of the human race, even under the development of the monarchial and aristocratic forms of society. How could it be done under the formulas of Democracy with Equality as the fundamental basis of law? And yet this was the programme of the age. Gaston was feeling blue from the reaction which followed his temptation by McLeod. His duty was clear the night before as he walked firmly homeward, recalling the tragedy of the past. Now in the cold light of day, the past seemed for away and unreal. The present was near, pressing, vital. He laid down a book he was trying to read, locked his office and strolled down town to see Tom Camp. The old soldier had come to be a sort oracle to him. His affection for the son of his Colonel was deep and abiding, and his extravagant flattery of his talents and future were so evidently sincere they always acted as a tonic. And he needed a tonic to-day. Tom was seated in a chair in his yard under a big cedar, working on a basket, and a little golden-haired girl was playing at his feet. It was his old home he had lost in Legree's day, but had got back through the help of General Worth, who came up one day and paid back Tom's gift of lightwood in gleaming yellow metal. His long hair and full beard were white now, and his eyes had a soft deep look that told of sorrows borne in patience and faith beyond the ken of the younger man. It was this look on Tom's face that held Gaston like a magnet when he was in trouble. "Tom, I'm blue and heartsick. I've come down to have you cheer me up a little." "You've got the blues? Well that is a joke!" cried Tom. "You, young and handsome, the best educated man in the county, the finest orator in the state, life all before you, and God fillin' the world to-day with sunshine and spring flowers, and all for you! You blue! That is a joke." And Tom's voice rang in hearty laughter. "Come here, Flora, and kiss me, you won't laugh at me, will you?" The child climbed up into his lap, slipped her little arms around his neck and hugged and him. "Now, once more, dearie, long and close and hard—oh! That's worth a pound of candy!" Again she squeezed his neck and kissed him, looking into his face with a smile. "I love you, Charlie," she said with quiet seriousness. "Do you, dear? Well, that makes me glad. If I can win the love of as pretty a little girl as you I'm not a failure, am I?" And he smoothed her curls. "Ain't she sweet?" cried Tom with pride as he laid aside his basket and looked at her with moistened eyes. "Tom, she's the sweetest child I ever saw." "Yes, she's God's last and best gift to me, to show me He still loved me. Talk about trouble. Man, you're a baby. You ain't cut your teeth yet. Wait till you've seen some things I've am. Wait till you've seen the light of the world go out, and staggerin' in the dark met the devil face to face, and looked him in the eye, and smelled the pit. And then feel him knock you down in it, and the red waves roll over you and smother you. I've been there." Tom paused and looked at Gaston. "You weren't here when I come to the end of the world, the time when that baby was born, and Annie died with the little red bundle sleepin' on her breast. The oldest girl was murdered by Legree's nigger soldiers. Then Annie give me that little gal. Lord, I was the happiest old fool that ever lived that day! And then when I looked into Annie's dead face, I went down, down, down! But I looked up from the bottom of the pit and I saw the light of them blue eyes and I heard her callin' me to take her. How I watched her and nursed her, a mother and a father to her, day and night, through the long years, and how them little fingers of hers got hold of my heart! Now, I bless the Lord for all His goodness and mercy to me. She will make it all right. She's going to be a lady and such a beauty! She's goin' to school now, and me and the General's goin' to take her ter college bye and bye, and she's goin' to marry some big handsome fellow like you, and her crippled grey haired daddy'll live in her house in his old age. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want." "Tom, you make me ashamed." "You ought to be, man, a youngster like you to talk about gettin' the blues. What's all your education for?" "Sometimes I think that only men like you have ever been educated." "G'long with your foolishness, boy. I ain't never had a show in this world. The nigger's been on my back since I first toddled into the world, and I reckon he'll ride me into the grave. They are my only rivals now making them baskets and they always undersell me." Gaston started as Tom uttered the last sentence. "With you, boy, it's all plain sailin'. You're the best looking chap in the county. I was a dandy when I was young. It does me good to look at you if you don't care nothin' about fine clothes. Then you're as sharp as a razor. There ain't a man in No'th Caliny that can stand up agin you on the stump. I've heard 'em all. You'll be the Governor of this state. That was always the climax of Tom's prophetic flattery. He could think of no grander end of a human life than to crown it in the Governor's Palace of North Carolina. He belonged to the old days when it was a bigger thing to be the Governor of a great state than to hold any office short of the Presidency,—when men resigned seats in the United States Senate to run for Governor, and when the national government was so puny a thing that the bankers of Europe refused to loan money on United States bonds unless countersigned by the State of Virginia. And that was not so long ago. The bankers sent that answer to Buchanan's Secretary of the Treasury. "Tom, you've lifted me out of the dumps. I owe you a doctor's fee," cried Gaston with enthusiasm as he placed Flora back on the grass and started to his office. "All I charge you is to come again. The old man's proud of his young friend. You make me feel like I'm somebody in the old world after all. And some day when you're great and rich and famous and the world's full of your name, I'll tell folks I know you like my own boy, and I'll brag about how many times you used to come to see me." "Hush, Tom, you make me feel silly," said Gaston as he warmly pressed the old fellow's hand. He went back toward his office with lighter step and more buoyant heart. His mind was as clear as the noonday sun that was now flooding the green fresh world with its splendour. He would stand by his own people. He would sink or swim with them. If poverty and failure were the result, let it be so. If success came, all the better. There were things more to be desired than gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X THE HEART OF A VILLAIN McLeod had developed into a man of undoubted power. He was but thirty-two years old, dictator of his party in the state. He had the fighting temperament which Southern people demand in their leaders. With this temperament he combined the skill of subtle diplomatic tact. He had no moral scruples of any kind. The problem of expediency alone interested him in ethics. McLeod's pet aversion was a preacher, especially a Baptist or a Methodist. His choicest oaths he reserved for them. He made a study of their weaknesses, and could tell dozens of stories to their discredit, many of them true. He had an instinct for finding their weak spots and holding them up to ridicule. He bought every book of militant infidelity he could find and memorised the bitterest of it. He took special pride in scoffing at religion before the young converts of Durham's church. He was endowed with a personal magnetism that fascinated the young as the hiss of a snake holds a bird. His serious work was politics and sensualism. In politics he was at his best. Here he was cunning, plausible, careful, brilliant and daring. He never lost his head in defeat or victory. He never forgot a friend, or forgave an enemy. Of his foe he asked no quarter and gave none. His ambitions were purely selfish. He meant to climb to the top. As to the means, the end would justify them. He preferred to associate with white people. But when it was necessary to win a negro, he never hesitated to go any length. The centre of the universe to his mind was A. McLeod. He was fond of saying to a crowd of youngsters whom he taught to play poker and drink whiskey, "Boys, I know the world. The great man is the man who gets there." He was generous with his money, and the boys called him a jolly good fellow. He used to say in explanation of this careless habit, "It won't do for an ordinary man to throw away money as I do. I play for big stakes. I'm not a spendthrift. I'm simply sowing seed. I can wait for the harvest." And when they would admire this overmuch he would warn them, "As a rule my advice is, Get money. Get it fairly and squarely if you can, but whatever you do,— get it. When you come right down to it, money's your first, last, best and only friend. Others promise well but when the scratch comes, they fail. Money never fails." A boy of fifteen asked him one day when he was mellow with liquor, "McLeod, which would you rather be, President of the United States or a big millionaire?" "Boys," he replied, smacking his lips, and running his tongue around his cheeks inside and softly caressing them with one hand, while he half closed his eyes, "They say old Simon Legree is worth fifty millions of dollars, and that his actual income is twenty per cent on that. They say he stole most of it, and that every dollar represents a broken life, and every cent of it could be painted red with the blood of his victims. Even so, I would rather be in Legree's shoes and have those millions a year than to be Almighty God with hosts of angels singing psalms to me through all eternity." And the shallow-pated satellites cheered this blasphemy with open-eyed wonder. The weakest side of his nature was that turned toward women. He was vain as a peacock, and the darling wish of his soul was to be a successful libertine. This was the secret of the cruelty back of his desire of boundless wealth. He had the intellectual forehead of his Scotch father, large, handsomely modelled features, nostrils that dilated and contracted widely, and the thick sensuous lips of his mother. His eyebrows were straight, thick and suggested undoubted force of intellect. His hair was a deep red, thick and coarse, but his moustache was finer and it was his special pride to point its delicately curved tips. His vanity was being stimulated just now by two opposite forces. He was in love, as deeply as such a nature could love, with Sallie Worth. Her continued rejection of his suit had wounded his vanity, but had roused all pugnacity of his nature to strengthen this apparent weakness. He had discovered recently that he exercised a potent influence over Mrs. Durham. The moment he was repulsed, his vanity turned for renewed strength toward her. He saw instantly the immense power even the slightest indiscretion on her part would give him over the Preacher's life. He knew that while he was not a demonstrative man, he loved his wife with intense devotion. He knew, too, that here was the Preacher's weakest spot. In his tireless devotion to his work, he had starved his wife's heart. He had noticed that she always called him "Dr. Durham" now, and that he had gradually fallen into the habit of calling her "Mrs. Durham." This had been fixed in their habits, perhaps by the change from housekeeping to living at the hotel. Since old Aunt Mary's death, Mrs. Durham had given up her struggle with the modern negro servants, closed her house, and they had boarded for several years. He saw that if he could entangle her name with his in the dirty gossip of village society, he could strike his enemy a mortal blow. He knew that she had grown more and more jealous of the crowds of silly women that always dog the heels of a powerful minister with flattery and open admiration. He determined to make the experiment. Mrs. Durham, while nine years his senior, did not look a day over thirty. Her face was as smooth and soft and round as a girl's, her figure as straight and full, and her every movement instinct with stored vital powers that had never been drawn upon. She was in a dangerous period of her mental development. She had been bitterly disappointed in life. Her loss of slaves and the ancestral prestige of great wealth had sent the steel shaft of a poisoned dagger into her soul. She was unreconciled to it. While she was passing through the anarchy of Legree's régime which followed the war, her unsatisfied maternal instincts absorbed her in the work of relieving the poor and the broken. But when the white race rose in its might and shook off this nightmare and order and a measure of prosperity had come, she had fallen back into brooding pessimism. She had reached the hour of that soul crisis when she felt life would almost in a moment slip from her grasp, and she asked herself the question, "Have I lived?" And she could not answer. She found herself asking the reason for things long accepted as fixed and eternal. What was good right and eternal? What was good, right, truth? And what made it good, right, or true? And she beat the wings of her proud woman's head against the bars that held her, until tired, and bleeding she was exhausted but unconquered. She was furious with McLeod for his open association with negro politicians. "Allan, in my soul, I am ashamed for you when I see you thus degrade your manhood." "Nonsense, Mrs. Durham," he replied, "the most beautiful flower grows in dirt, but the flower is not dirt." "Well, I knew you were vain, but that caps the climax!" "Isn't my figure true, whether you say I'm dog-fennel or a pink?" "No, you are not a flower. Will is the soul of man. The flower is ruled by laws outside itself. A man's will is creative. You can make law. You can walk with your head among the stars, and you choose to crawl in a ditch. I am out of patience with you." "But only for a purpose. You must judge by the end in view." "There's no need to stoop so low." "I assure you it is absolutely necessary to my aims in life. And they are high enough. I appreciate your interest in me, more than I dare to tell you. You have always been kind to me since I was a wild red-headed brute of a boy. And you have always been my supreme inspiration in work. While others have cursed and scoffed you smiled at me and your smile has warmed my heart in its blackest nights." She looked at him with a mother-like tenderness. "What ends could be high enough to justify such methods ?" "I hate poverty and squalour. It's been my fate. I've sworn to climb out of it, if I have to fight or buy my way through hell to do it. I dream of a palatial home, of soft white beds, grand banquet halls, and music and wine, and the faces of those I love near me. Besides, the work I am doing is the best for the state and the nation." "But how can you walk arm in arm with a big black negro, as they say you do, to get his vote?" "Simply because they represent 120,000 votes I need. You can't tell their colour when they get in the box. I use these fools as so many worms. My political creed is for public consumption only. I never allow anybody to impose on me. I don't allow even Allan McLeod to deceive me with a proper platform, or a lot of articulated wind. I'm not a preacher." She winced at that shot, blushed and looked at him curiously for a moment. "No, you are not a preacher. I wish you were a better man." "So do I, when I am with you," he answered in a low serious voice. "But I can't get over the sense of personal degradation involved in your association with negroes as your equal," she persisted. "The trouble is you're an unreconstructed rebel. Women never really forgive a social wrong." "I am unreconstructed," she snapped with pride. "And you thank God daily for it, don't you?" "Yes, I do. Human nature can't be reconstructed by the fiat of fools who tinker with laws," she cried. These thousands of black votes are here. They've got to be controlled. I'm doing the job." "You don't try to get rid of them." "Get rid of them? Ye gods, that would be a task! The Negro is the sentimental pet of the nation. Put him on a continent alone, and he will sink like an iron wedge to the bottomless pit of barbarism. But he is the ward of the Republic—our only orphan, chronic, incapable. That wardship is a grip of steel on the throat of the South. Back of it is an ocean of maudlin sentimental fools. I am simply making the most of the situation. I didn't make it to order. I'm just doing the best I can with the material in hand." "Why don't you come out like a man and defy this horde of fools?" "Martyrdom has become too cheap. The preachers have a hundred thousand missionaries now we are trying to support." "Allan, I thought you held below the rough surface of your nature high ideals,—you don't mean this." "What could one man do against these millions?" "Do!" she cried, her face ablaze. The history of the world is made up of the individuality of a few men. A little Yankee woman wrote a crude book. The single act of that woman's will caused the war, killed a million men, desolated and ruined the South, and changed the history of the world. The single dauntless personality of George Washington three times saved the colonies from surrender and created the Republic. I am surprised to hear a man of your brain and reading talk like that!" "When I am with you and hear your voice I have heroic impulses. You are the only human being with whom I would take the time to discuss this question. But the current is too strong. The other way is easier, and it serves my ends better. Besides, I am not sure it isn't better from every point of view. We've got the Negro here, and must educate him." "Hush! Tell that to somebody that hates you, not to me," she cried. "Don't you think we must educate them?" "No, I think it is a crime." "Would you leave them in ignorance, a threat to society ?" "Yes, until they can be moved. When I see these young negro men and women coming out of their schools and colleges well dressed, with their shallow veneer of an imitation culture, I feel like crying over the farce." "Surely, Mrs. Durham, you believe they are better fitted for life? "They are not. They are lifted out of their only possible sphere of menial service, and denied any career. It is simply inhuman. They are led to certain slaughter of soul and body at last. It is a horrible tragedy!" Allan looked at her, smiled, and replied, "I knew you were a bitter and brilliant woman but I didn't think you would go to such lengths even with your pet aversions." "It's not an aversion, or a prejudice, sir. It's a simple fact of history. Education increases the power of the brain to think and the heart to suffer. Sooner or later these educated negroes feel the clutch of the iron hand of the white man's unwritten laws on their throat. They have their choice between a suicide's grave or a prison cell. And the numbers who dare the grave and the prison cell daily increase. The South is kinder to the Negro when he is kept in his place." "You are a quarter of a century behind the times." "Am I so old?" she laughed. "The sentiment, not the woman. You are the most beautiful woman I ever saw." "I like all my boys to feel that way about me." "You don't class me quite with the rest, do you?" She blushed the slightest bit. "'No, I've always taken a peculiar interest in you. I have quarrelled with everybody who has hated and spoken evil of you. I have always believed you were capable of a high and noble life of great achievement." "And your faith in me has been my highest incentive to give the lie to my enemies and succeed. And I will. I will be the master of this state within two years. And I want you to remember that I lay it all at your feet. The world need not know it,—you know it." He spoke with intense earnestness. "But I don't want you to make such a success at the price of Negro equality. I feel a sense of unspeakable degradation for you when I hear your name hissed. At least I was your teacher once. Come Allan, give up Negro politics and devote yourself to an honourable career in law!" He shook his head with calm persistence. "No, this is my calling." "Then take a nobler one." "To succeed grandly is the only title to nobility here." "Is the Doctor on speaking terms with you now?" "Oh! yes, I joke him about his hide-bound Bourbonism, and he tells me I am all sorts of a villain. But we have made an agreement to hate one another in a polite sort of way as becomes a teacher in Israel and a statesman with responsibilities. By the way, I saw him driving to the Springs with a bevy of pretty girls a few hours ago." "Indeed, I didn't know it!" "Yes, he seemed to be having a royal time and to have renewed his youth." An angry flush came to her face and she made no reply. McLeod glanced at her furtively and smiled at this evidence that his shot had gone home. "Would you drive with me to the Springs? We will get there before this party starts back." She hesitated, and answered, "yes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII THE WAYS OF BOSTON When Helen Lowell reached Boston from her visit with Sallie Worth, she found her father in the midst of his political campaign. The Hon. Everett Lowell was the representative of Congress from the Boston Highlands district. His home was an old fashioned white Colonial house built during the American Revolution. He was not a man of great wealth, but well-to-do, a successful politician, enthusiastic student, a graduate of Harvard, and he had always made a specialty of championing the cause of the "freedmen." He was a chronic proposer of a military force bill for the South. His family was one of the proudest in America. He had a family tree five hundred years old—an unbroken line of unconquerable men who held liberty dearer than life. He believed in the heritage of good honest blood as he believed in blooded horses. His home was furnished in perfect taste, with beautiful old rosewood and mahogany stuff that had both character and history. On the walls hung the stately portraits of his ancestors representative of three hundred years of American life. He never confused his political theories about the abstract rights of the African with his personal choice of associates or his pride in his Anglo-Saxon blood. With him politics was one thing, society another. His pet hobby, which combined in one his philanthropic ideals and his practical politics, was of late a patronage he had extended to young George Harris, the bright mulatto son of Eliza and George Harris whose dramatic slave history had made their son famous at Harvard. This young negro was a speaker of fair ability and was accompanying Lowell on his campaign tours of the district, making speeches for his patron, who had obtained for him a clerk's position in the United States Custom House. Harris was quite a drawing card at these meetings. He had a natural aptitude for politics; modest, affable handsome, and almost white, he was a fine argument in himself to support Lowell's political theories, who used him for all he was worth as he had at the previous election. Harris had become a familiar figure at Lowell's home in the spacious library, where he had the free use of the books, and frequently he dined with the family, when there at dinner time hard at work on some political speech or some study for a piece of music. Lowell had met his daughter at the depot behind his pair of Kentucky thoroughbreds. This daughter, his only child, was his pride and joy. She was a blonde beauty, and her resemblance to her father was remarkable. He was a widower, and this lovely girl, at once the incarnation of his lost love and so fair a reflection of his being, had ruled him with absolute sway during the past few years. He was laughing like a boy at her coming. "Oh! My beauty, the sight of your face gives me new life!" he cried smiling with love and admiration. "You mustn't try to spoil me!" she laughed. "Did you really have a good time in Dixie?" he whispered. "Oh! Papa, such a time!" she exclaimed shutting her eyes as though she were trying to live it over again. "Really?" "Beaux, morning, noon and night,—dancing, moonlight rides, boats gliding along the beautiful river and mocking birds singing softly their love-song under the window all night!" "Well you did have romance," he declared. "Yes," she went on "and such people, such hospitality—oh! I feel as though I never had lived before." "My dear, you mustn't desert us all like that," he protested. "I can't help it, I'm a rebel now." "Then keep still till the campaign's over!" he warned in mock fear. "And the boys down there," she continued, "they are such boys! Time doesn't seem to be an object with them at all. Evidently they have never heard of our uplifting Yankee motto 'Time is money.' And such knightly deference! such charming old fashioned chivalrous ways!" "But, dear, isn't that a little out of date?" "How staid and proper and busy Boston seems! I know I am going to be depressed by it." "I know what's the matter with you!" he whistled. "What?" she slyly asked. "One of those boys." "I confess, Papa, he's as handsome as a prince." "What does he look like?" "He is tall, dark, with black hair, black eyes, slender, graceful, all fire and energy." "What's his name?" "St. Clare—Robert St. Clare. His father was away from home. He's a politician, I think." "'You don't say! St. Clare. Well of all the jokes! His father is my Democratic chum in the House—an old fire-eating Bourbon, but a capital fellow." "Did you ever see him?" "No, but I've had good times with his father. He used to own a hundred slaves. He's a royal fellow, and pretty well fixed in life for a Southern politician. I don't think though I ever saw his boy. Anything really serious?" "He hasn't said a word—but he's coming to see me next week." "Well things are moving, I must say!" "Yes, I pretended I must consult you, before telling him he could come. I didn't want to seem too anxious. I'm half afraid to let him wander about Boston much, there are too many girls here." Her father laughed proudly and looked at her. "I hope you will find him all your heart most desires, and my congratulations on your first love!" "It will be my last, too," she answered seriously. "Ah! you're too young and petty to say that!" "I mean it," she said earnestly with a smile trembling on her lips. Her father was silent and pressed her hand for an answer. As they entered the gate of the house, they met young Harris coming out with some books under his arm. He bowed gracefully to them and passed on. "Oh! Papa, I had forgotten all about your fad for that young negro!" "Well, what of it, dear" "You love me my very much, don't you?" she asked tenderly. "I'm going to ask you to be inconsistent, for my sake." "That's easy. I'm often that for nobody's sake. Consistency is only the terror of weak minds." "I'm going to ask you to keep that young negro out of the house when my Southern friends are here. After my sweetheart comes I expect Sallie and her mother. I wouldn't have either of them to meet him here in our library and especially in our dining-room for anything on earth!" "Well, you have joined the rebels, haven't you?" "You know I never did like negroes any way," she continued. "They always gave me the horrors. Young Harris is a scholarly gentleman, I know. He is good-looking, talented, and I've played his music for him sometimes to please you, but I can't get over that little kink in his hair, his big nostrils and full lips, and when he looks at me, it makes my flesh creep." "Certainly, my darling, you don't need to coax me. The Lowells, I suspect, know by this time what is due to a guest. When your guests come, our home and our time are theirs. If eating meat offends, we will live on herbs. I'll send Harris down to the other side of the district and keep him at work there until the end of the campaign. My slightest wish is law for him." "You see, Papa," she went on, "they never could understand that negro's easy ways around our house, and I know if he were to sit down at our table with them they would walk out of the dining-room with an excuse of illness and go home on the first train." "And yet," returned her father lifting her from the carriage, "their homes were full of negroes were they not?" "Yes, but they know their place. I've seen those beautiful Southern children kiss their old black 'Mammy.' It made me shudder, until I discovered they did it just as I kiss Fido." "And this a daughter of Boston, the home of Garrison and Sumner!" he exclaimed. "I've heard that Boston mobbed Garrison once," she observed. "Yes, and I doubt if we have canonised Sumner yet. All right. If you say so, I'll order a steam calliope stationed at the gate and hire a man to play Dixie for you!" She laughed, and ran up the steps. * * * * * * Sallie determined to keep the secret of her sorrow in her own heart. On the ocean voyage she had cried the whole first day, and then kissed her lover's picture, put it down in the bottom of her trunk, brushed the tears away and determined the world should not look an her suffering. She had written Helen of her lover's declaration, and of her happiness. She would find a good excuse for her sorrowful face in their separation. She knew he would write to her, for he had said so, and she had slipped the address into his hand as he left the car that night. At first she was puzzled to think what she could do about answering these letters so Helen would not suspect her trouble. Then she hit on the plan of writing to him every day, posting the letters herself and placing them in her own trunk instead of the post-box. "He will read them some day. They will relieve my heart," she sadly told herself. Helen met her on the pier with a cry of girlish joy, and the first word she uttered was, "Oh! Sallie, Bob loves me! He's been here two weeks, and he's just gone home. I have been in heaven. We are engaged!" "Then I'll kiss you again, Helen!"—She gave her another kiss. "And I've a big letter at home for you already! It's post-marked 'Hambright.' It came this morning. I know you will feast on it. If Bob don't write me faithfully I'll make him come here and live in Boston." When Sallie got this letter, she sat down in her room, and read and re-read its passionate words. There was a tone of bitterness and wounded pride in it. She struggled bravely to keep the tears back. Then the tone of the letter changed to tenderness and faith and infinite love that struggled in vain for utter ance. She kissed the name and sighed. "Now I must go down and chat and smile with Helen. She's so silly about her own love, if I talk about Bob she will forget I live."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV THE UNSPOKEN TERROR When Gaston reached Hambright the following day, and whispered to his mother the good news, he hastened to tell his friend Tom Camp. The young man's heart warmed toward the white-haired old soldier in this hour of his victory. With sparkling eyes, he told Tom of his stormy scene with the General, of its curious ending, and the hours he spent in heaven beneath the limbs of an old magnolia. Tom listened with rapture. "Ah, didn't I tell you, if you hung on you'd get her by-and-by? So you bearded the General in his den did you? I'll bet his eyes blazed when he seed you! He's got an awful temper when you rile him. You ought to seed him one day when our brigade was ordered into a charge where three concealed batteries was cross firin' and men was fallin' like wheat under the knife. Geeminy but didn't he cuss! He wouldn't take the order fust from the orderly, and sent to know if the Major-General meant it. I tell you us fellers that was layin' there in the grass listenin' to them bullets singin' thought he was the finest cusser that ever ripped an oath. "He reared and he charged, and he cussed, and he damned that man for tryin' to butcher his men, and he never moved till the third order came. That was the night ten thousand wounded men lay on the field, and me in the middle of 'em with a Minie ball in my shoulder. TOM CAMP. Portrait from life. Portrait of Tom Camp. The Yankees and our men was all mixed up together, and just after dark the full moon came up through the trees and you could see as plain as day. I begun to sing the old hymn, "There is a land of pure delight," and you ought to have heard them ten thousand wounded men sing! "While we was singing the General came through lookin' up his men. He seed me and said, 'Is that you, Tom Camp?' "I looked up at him, and he was crying like a child, and he went on from man to man cryin' and cussin' the fool that sent us into that hell-hole. The General's a rough man, if you rub his fur the wrong way, but his heart's all right. He's all gold I tell you!" "Well, I'm in for a tussle with him, Tom." "Shucks, man, you can beat him with one hand tied behind you if you've got his gal's heart. She's got his fire, and a gal as purty as she is can just about do what she pleases in this world." "I hope she can bring him around. I like the General. I'd much rather not fight him." "Where's Flora?" cried Tom looking around in alarm. "I saw her going toward the spring in the edge of the woods there a minute ago," replied Gaston. Tom sprang up and began to hop and jump down the path toward the spring with incredible rapidity. Flora was playing in the branch below the spring and Tom saw the form of a negro man passing over the opposite hill going along the spring path that led in that direction. "Was you talkin' with that nigger, Flora?" asked Tom holding his hand on his side and trying to recover his breath. "Yes, I said howdy, when he stopped to get a drink of water, and he give me a whistle," she replied with a pout of her pretty lips and a frown. Tom seized her by the arm and shook her. "Didn't I tell you to run every time you seed a nigger unless I was with you!" "Yes, but he wasn't hurtin' me and you are!" she cried bursting into tears. "I've a notion to whip you good for this!" Tom stormed. "Don't Tom, she won't do it any more, will, you Flora?" pleaded Gaston taking her in his arms and starting to the house with her. When they reached the house, Tom was still pale and trembling with excitement. "Lord, there's so many triflin' niggers loafin' round the county now stealing and doin' all sorts of devilment, I'm scared to death about that child. She don't seem any more afraid of 'em than she is of a cat." 'I don't believe anybody would hurt Flora, Tom,—she's such a little angel," said Gaston kissing the tears from the child's face. "She is cute—ain't she?" said Tom with pride. I've wished many a time lately I'd gone out West with them Yankee fellers that took such a likin' to me in the war. They told me that a poor white man had a chance out there, and that there wern't a nigger in twenty miles of their home. But then I lost my leg, how could I go? He sat dreaming with open eyes for a moment and continued, looking tenderly a Flora, "But, baby, don't you dare go nigh er nigger, or let one get nigh you no more 'n you would a rattlesnake!" "I won't Pappy! she cried with an incredulous smile at his warning of danger that made Tom's heart sick. She was all joy and laughter, full of health and bubbling life. She believed with a child's simple faith that all nature was as innocent as her own heart. Tom smoothed her curls and kissed her at least, and she slipped her arm around his neck and squeezed it tight. "Ain't she purty and sweet now?" he exclaimed. "Tom, you'll spoil her yet," warned Gaston as he smiled and took his leave, throwing a kiss to Flora as he passed through the little yard gate. Tom had built a fence close around his house when Flora was a baby to shut her in while he was at work. Two days later about five o'clock in the afternoon as Gaston sat in his office writing a letter to his sweetheart, his face aglow with love and the certainty that she was his, as he read and re-read her last glowing words he was startled by the sudden clang of the court house bell. At first he did not move, only looking up from his paper. Sometimes mischievous boys rang the bell and ran down the steps before any one could catch them. But the bell continued its swift stroke seeming to grow louder and wilder every moment. He saw a man rush across the square, and then the bell of the Methodist, and then of the Baptist churches joined their clamour to the alarm. He snapped the lid of his desk, snatched his hat and ran down the steps. As he reached the street, he heard the long piercing cry of a woman's voice, high, strenuous, quivering! "A lost child! A lost child!" What a cry! He was never so thrilled and awed by a human voice. In it was trembling all the anguish of every mother's broken heart transmitted through the centuries! At the court house door an excited group had gathered. A man was standing on the steps gesticulating wildly and telling the crowd all he knew about it. Over the din he caught the name, "Tom Camp's Flora!" He breathed hard, bit his lips and prayed instinctively. "Lord have mercy on the poor old man! It will kill him!" A great fear brooded over the hearts of the crowd, and soon the tumult was hushed into an awed silence. In Gaston's heart that fear became a horrible certainty from the first. Within a half hour a thousand white people were in the crowd. Gaston stood among them, cool and masterful, organising them in searching parties, and giving to each group the signals to be used. In a moment the white race had fused into a homogeneous mass of love, sympathy, hate, and revenge. The rich and the poor, the learned and the ignorant, the banker and the blacksmith, the great and the small, they were all one now. The sorrow of that old one-legged soldier was the sorrow of all, every heart beat with his, and his life was their life, and his child their child. But at the end of an hour there was not a negro among them! By some subtle instinct they had recognised the secret feelings and fears of the crowd and had disappeared. Had they been beasts of the field the gulf between them would not have been deeper. When Gaston reached Tom's house the crowd was divided into the groups agreed upon and a signal gun given to each. If the child was not dead when found two should be fired—if dead, but one. He sought Tom to be sure there was no mistake and that the child had not fallen asleep about the house. He found the old man shut up in his room kneeling in the middle of the floor praying. When Gaston laid his hand gently on his shoulder his lips ceased to move, and he looked at him in a dazed sort of way at first without speaking. "Oh!—it's you, Charlie!" he sighed. "Yes, Tom, tell me quick. Are you sure she is nowhere in the house?" "Sure!—Sure?" he cried in a helpless stare. "Yes, yes, I found her bonnet at the spring. I looked everywhere for an hour before I called the neighbours!" "Then I'm off with the searchers. The signal is two guns if they find her alive. One gun if she is dead. You will understand." "Yes, Charlie," answered the old soldier in a faraway tone of voice, "and don't forget to help me pray while you look for her." "I've tried already, Tom," he answered as he pressed his hand and left the house. All night long the search continued, and no signal gun was heard. Torches and lanterns gleamed from every field and wood, byway and hedge for miles in every direction. Through every hour of this awful night Tom Camp was in his room praying—his face now streaming with tears, now dry and white with the unspoken terror that could stop the beat of his heart. His white hair and snow-white beard were dishevelled, as he unconsciously tore them with his trembling hands. Now he was crying in an agony of intensity, "As thy servant of old wrestled with the angel of the Lord through the night, so, oh God, will I lie at Thy feet and wrestle and pray! I will not let Thee go until Thou bless me! Though I perish, let her live! I have lost all and praised Thee still. Lord, Thou canst not leave me desolate!" From the pain of his wound and the exhaustion of soul and body he fainted once with his lips still moving in prayer. For more than an hour he lay as one dead. When he revived, he looked at his clock and it was but an hour till dawn. Again he fell on his knees, and again the broken accents of his husky voice could be heard wrestling with God. Now he would beg and plead like a child, and then he would rise in the unconscious dignity of an immortal soul in combat with the powers of the infinite and his language was in the sublime speech of the old Hebrew seers! Just before the sun rose the signal gun pealed its message of life, ONE! TWO! in rapid succession. Tom sprang to his feet with blazing eyes. One! Two! echoed the guns from another hill, and fainter grew its repeated call from group to group of the searchers. "There! Glory to God!" He screamed at the top of his voice, the last note of his triumphant shout breaking into sobs. "God be praised! I knew they would find her—she's not dead, she's alive! alive! oh! my soul, lift up thy head!" The tramp of swift feet as heard at the door and Gaston told him with husky stammering voice, "She's alive Tom, but unconscious. I'll have her brought to the house. She was found just where your spring branch runs into the Flat Rock, not five hundred yards from here in those woods. Say where you are. We will bring her in a minute." Gaston bounded back to the scene. Tom paid no attention to his orders to stay at home, but sprang after him jumping and falling and scrambling up again as he followed. Before they knew it he was upon the excited tearful group that stood in a circle around the child's body. Gaston, who was standing on the opposite side from Tom's approach, saw him and shouted, "My God, men, stop him! Don't let him see her yet!" But Tom was too quick for them. He brushed aside the boy who caught at him, as though a feather, crying, "Stand back!" The circle of men fell away from the body and in a moment Tom stood over it transfixed with horror. Flora lay on the ground with her clothes torn to shreds and stained with blood. Her beautiful yellow curls were matted across her forehead in a dark red lump beside a wound where her skull had been crushed. The stone lay at her side, the crimson mark of her life showing on its jagged edges. With that stone the brute had tried to strike the death blow. She was lying on the edge of the hill with her head up the incline. It was too plain, the terrible crime that had been committed. The poor father sank beside her body with an inarticulate groan as though some one had crushed his head with an axe. He seemed dazed for a moment, and looking around he shouted hoarsely, "The doctor boys! The doctor quick! For God's sake, quick! She's not dead yet—we may save her—help—help!" he sank again to the ground limp and faint from pain and was soon insensible. Gaston gathered the child tenderly in his arms and carried her to the house. The men hastily made a stretcher and carried Tom behind him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V A THOUSAND-LEGGED BEAST While Gaston and the men were carrying Flora and Tom to the house, another searching party was formed. There were no women and children among than, only grim-visaged silent men, and a pair of little mild-eyed sharp-nosed blood-hounds. All the morning men were coming in from the country and joining this silent army of searchers. Doctor Graham came, looked long and gravely at Flora and turned a sad face toward Tom. "Now, doctor wait—don't say a word yet. I don't want to know the truth, if it's the worst. Don't kill me in a minute. Let me live as long as there's breath in her body—after that! well, that's the end—there's nothin after that!" The doctor started to speak. "Wait," pleaded Tom, "let me tell you something. I've been praying all night. I've seen God face to face. She can't die. He told me so—" He paused and his grip on the doctor's arm relaxed as though he were about to faint, but he rallied. The kindly old doctor said gently, "Sit down Tom." He tried to lead Tom away from the bed, but he held on like a bull dog. The child breathed heavily and moaned. Tom's face brightened. "She's comin' to, doctor,—thank God!" The doctor paid no more attention to him and went on with his work as best he could. Tom laid his tear-stained face close to hers, and murmured soothingly to her as he used to when she was a wee baby in his arms, "There, there, honey, it will be all right now! The doctor's here, and he'll do all he can! And what can't do, God will. The doctor'll save you. God will save you! He loves you. He loves me. I prayed all night. He heard me. I saw the shinin' glory of His face! He's only tryin' His poor old servant. The broken artery was found and tied and the bleeding stopped. When the wound on her head was dressed the doctor turned to Tom, "That wound is bad, but not necessarily fatal." "Praise God!" "Keep the house quiet and don't let her see a strange face once she regains consciousness," was his parting injunction. The next morning her breathing was regular, and pulse stronger, but feverish; and about seven o'clock she came out of her comatose state and regained consciousness. She spoke but once, and apparently at the sound of her own voice immediately went into a convulsion, clinching her little fists, screaming and calling to her father for help! When Tom first heard that awful cry and saw her terrified eyes and drawn face, he tried to cover his own eyes and stop his ears. Then he gathered the little convulsed body into his arms and crooned into her ears, "There, Pappy's baby, don't cry! Pappy's got you now. Nothin' can hurt you. There, there, nothin' shall come nigh you!" He covered her face with tears and kisses while he whispered and soothed her to sleep. When the noon train came up from Independence, General Worth arrived. Tom had asked Gaston to telegraph for him in his name. Tom eagerly grasped his hand. "General I knowed you'd come—you're a man to tie to. I never knowed you to fail me in your life. You're one of the smartest men in the world too. You never got us boys in a hole so deep you didn't pull us out"— "What can I do for you?" interrupted the General. "Ah, now's the worst of all, General. I'm in water too deep for me. My baby, the last one left on earth, the apple of my eye, all that holds my old achin' body to this world—she's—about—to—die! I can't let her. General, you must save her for me. I want more doctors. They say there's a great doctor at Independence. I want 'em all. Tell 'em it's a poor old one-legged soldier who's shot all to pieces and lost his wife and all his children—all but this one baby. And I can't lose her! They'll come if you ask 'em—" His voice broke. "I'll do it, Tom. I'll have them here on a special in three hours or maybe sooner," returned the General pressing his hand and hurrying to the telegraph office. The doctors arrived at three o'clock and held a consultation with Doctor Graham. They decided that the loss of blood had been so great that the only chance to save her was in the transfusion of blood. "I'll give her the blood, Tom," said Gaston quietly removing his cost and baring his arm. The old soldier looked up through grateful tears. "Next to the General, you're the best friend God ever give me, boy!" The General turned his face away and looked out of the window. The doctors immediately performed the operation, transfusing blood from Gaston into the child. The results did not seem to promise what they had hoped. Her fever rose steadily. She became conscious again and immediately went into the most fearful convulsions, breaking the torn artery a second time. Just as the sun sank behind the blue mountains' peaks in the west her heart fluttered and she was dead. Tom sat by the bed for two hours, looking, looking, looking with wide staring eyes at her white dead face. There was not the trace of a tear. His mouth was set in a hard cold way and he never moved or spoke. The Preacher tried to comfort Tom, who stared at him as though he did not recognise him at first, and then slowly began, "Go away, Preacher, I don't want to see or talk to you now. It's all a swindle and a lie. There is no God!" "Tom, Tom!" groaned the Preacher. "I tell you I mean it," he continued. "I don't want any more of God or His heaven. I don't want to see God. For if I should see Him, I'd shake my fist in His face and ask Him where His almighty power was when my poor little baby was screamin' for help while that damned black beast was tearin' her to pieces! Many and many a time I've praised God when I read the Bible there where it said, not a sparrow falleth to the ground without His knowledge, and the very hairs of our head are numbered. Well, where was He when my little bird was flutterin' her broken bleedin' wings in the claws of that stinkin' baboon,—damn him to everlastin' hell!—It's all a swindle I tell you!" The Preacher was watching him now with silent pity and tenderness. "What a lie it all is!" Tom repeated. "Scratch my name off the church roll. I ain't got many more days here, but I won't lie. I'm not a hypocrite. I'm going to meet God cursin' Him to His face!" The Preacher slipped his arm around the old soldier's neck, and smoothed the tangled hair back from his forehead as he said brokenly, "Tom, I love you! My whole soul is melted in sympathy and pity for you!" The stricken man looked up into the face of his friend, saw his tears and felt the warmth of his love flood his heart, and at last he burst into tears. "Oh! Preacher, Preacher! you're a good friend I know, but I'm done, I can't live any more! Every minute, day and night, I'll hear them awful screams—her a callin' me for help! I can see her lyin' out there in the woods all night alone moanin' and bleedin'!" His breast heaved and he paused as if in reverie. And then he sprang up, his face livid and convulsed with volcanic passions, that half strangled him while he shrieked, "Oh! if I only had him here before me now, and God Almighty would give me strength with these hands to tear his breast open and rip his heart out!—I—could—eat—it—like—a—wolf!" * * * * * * When they reached the cemetery the next day and the body was about to be lowered into the grave, Tom suddenly spied old Uncle Reuben Worth leaning on his spade by the edge of the crowd. Uncle Reuben was the grave digger of the town and the only negro present. "Wait!" said Tom raising his hand. "Don't put her in that grave! A nigger dug it. I can't stand it:" He turned to a group of old soldier comrades standing by and said, "Boys, humour an old broken man once more. You'll dig another grave for me, won't you? It won't take long. The folks can go home that don't want to stay. I ain't got no home to go to now but this graveyard." His comrades filled up the grave that Uncle Reuben had dug, and opened a new one on the other side of the graves where slept his other loved ones. Gaston took Tom to his home and stayed with him several hours trying to help him. He seemed to have settled into a stupor from which nothing could rouse him When at length the old man fell asleep, Gaston softly closed the door and returned to his office with a heavy heart. As he neared the centre of the town, he heard a murmur like the distant moaning of the wind in the hush that comes before a storm. It grew louder and louder and became articulate with occasional words that seemed far away and unreal. What could it be? He had never heard such a sound before. Now it became clearer and the murmur was the tread of a thousand feet and the clatter of horses' hoofs. Not a cry, or a shout, or a word. Silence and hurrying feet! Ah! he knew now. It was a searchers returning, a grim swaying voiceless mob with one black figure amid them. They were swarming into the court house square under the big oak where an informal trial was to be held. He rushed forward to protest against a lynching. He could just catch a glimpse of the negro's head swaying back and forth, protesting innocence in a singing monotone as though he were already half dead. He pushed his way roughly through the excited crowd, to the centre where Hose Norman, the leader, stood with one end of a rope in his hand and the other around the negro's neck. The negro turned his head quickly toward the movement made by the crowd as Gaston pressed forward. It was Dick! Dick recognised him at the same moment, leaped toward and fell at his feet crying and pleading as he held his feet and legs. "Save me, Charlie! I nebber done it! I nebber done it! For God's sake help me! Keep 'em off! Dey gwine burn me erlive!" Gaston turned to the crowd. "Men, there's not one among you that loved that old soldier and his girl as I did. But you must not do this crime. If this negro is guilty, we can prove it in that court house there, and he will pay the penalty with his life. Give him a fair trial"— "That's a lawyer talkin' now!" said a man in the crowd. "We know that tune. The lawyers has things their own way in a court house." A murmur of assent mingled with oaths ran through the crowd. "Fair trial !" sneered Hose Norman snatching Dick from the ground by the rope. "Look at the black devil's clothes splotched all over with her blood. We found him under a shelvin' rock where he'd got by wadin' up the branch a quarter of a mile to fool the dogs. We found his track in the sand some places where he missed the water and tracked him clear from where we found Flora to the cave he was lying in. Fair trial—hell! We're just waitin' for er can o' oil. You go back and read your law books—we'll tend ter this devil." The messenger came with the oil and the crowd moved forward. Hose shouted, "Down by Tom Camp's by his spring, down the spring branch to the Flat Rock where he killed her!" On the crowd moved, swaying back and forth with Gaston in their midst by Dick's side begging for a fair trial for him. A crowd that hurries and does not shout is a fearful thing. There is something inhuman in its uncanny silence. Gaston's voice sounded strained and discordant. They "IT WAS DICK!" Portrait from life. Portrait of Dick. paid no more attention to his protest than to the chirp of a cricket. They reached the spot where the child's body had been found. They tied the screaming, praying negro to a live pine and piled around his body a great heap of dead wood and saturated it with oil. And then they poured oil on his clothes. Gaston looked around him begging first one man then another to help him fight the crowd and rescue him. Not a hand was lifted, or a voice raised in protest. There was not a negro among them. Not only was no negro in that crowd, but there was not a cabin in all that county that would not have given shelter to that brute, though they knew him guilty of the crime charged against him. This was the one terrible fact that paralysed Gaston's efforts. Hose Norman stepped forward to apply a match and Gaston grasped his arm. "For God's sake, Hose, wait a minute!" he begged. "Don't disgrace our town, our county, our state, and our claims to humanity by this insane brutality. A beast wouldn't do this. You wouldn't kill a mad dog or a rattlesnake in such a way. If you will kill him, shoot him or knock him in the head with a rock,—don't burn him alive!" Hose glared at him and quietly remarked, "Are you done now? If you are, stand out of the way!" He struck the match and Dick uttered a scream. As Hose leaned forward with his match Gaston knocked him down, and a dozen stalwart men were upon him in a moment. "Knock the fool in the head!" one shouted. "Pin his arms behind him!" said another. Some one quickly pinioned his arms with a cord. He stood in helpless rage and pity, and as he saw the match applied, bowed his head and burst into tears. He looked up at the silent crowd standing there like voiceless ghosts with renewed wonder. Under the glare of the light and the tears the crowd seemed to melt into a great crawling swaying creature, half reptile half beast, half dragon half man, with a thousand legs and a thousand eyes, and ten thousand gleaming teeth, and with no ear to hear and no heart to pity! All they would grant him was the privilege of gathering Dick's ashes and charred bones for burial. * * * * * * The morning following the lynching, the Preacher hurried to Tom Camp's to see how he was bearing the strain. His door was wide open, the bureau drawers pulled out, ransacked, and some of their contents were lying on the floor. "Poor old fellow, I'm afraid he's gone crazy!" exclaimed the Preacher. He hurried to the cemetery. There he found Tom at the newly made grave. He had worked through the night and dug the grave open with his bare hands and pulled the coffin up out of the ground. He had broken his finger nails all off trying to open it and his fingers were bleeding. At last he had given up the effort to open the coffin, sat down beside it, and was arranging her toys he had made for her beside the box. He had brought a lot of her clothes, a pair of little shoes and stockings, and a bonnet, and he had placed these out carefully on top of the lid. He was talking to her. The Preacher lifted him gently and led him away, a hopeless madman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI THE BLACK PERIL The longer Gaston pondered over the tragic events of that lynching the more sinister and terrible became its meaning, and the deeper he was plunged in melancholy. Beyond all doubt, within his own memory, since the negroes under Legree's lead had drawn the colour line in politics, the races had been drifting steadily apart. The gulf was now impassable. Such crimes as Dick had committed, and for which he had paid such an awful penalty, were unknown absolutely under slavery, and were unknown for two years after the war. Their first appearance was under Legree's régime. Now, scarcely a day passed in the South without the record of such an atrocity, swiftly followed by a lynching, and lynching thus had become a habit for all grave crimes. Since McLeod's triumph in the state such crimes had increased with alarming rapidity. The encroachments of negroes upon public offices had been slow but resistless. Now there were nine hundred and fifty negro magistrates in the state elected for no reason except the colour of their skin. Feeling themselves intrenched behind state and Federal power, the insolence of a class of young negro men was becoming more and more intolerable. What would happen to these fools when once they roused that thousand-legged, thousand-eyed beast with its ten thousand teeth and nails! He had looked into its face, and he shuddered to recall the hour. He knew that this power of racial fury of the Anglo-Saxon when aroused was resistless, and that it would sweep its victims before its wrath like chaff before a whirlwind. And then he thought of the day fast coming when culture and wealth would give the African the courage of conscious strength and he would answer that soul piercing shriek of his kindred for help, and that other thousand-legged beast, now crouching in the shadows, would meet thousand legged beast around that beacon fire of a Godless revenge! More and more the impossible position of the Negro in America came home to his mind. He was fast being overwhelmed with the conviction that sooner or later we must squarely face the fact that two such races, counting millions in numbers, can not live together under a Democracy. He recalled the fact that there were more negroes in the United States than inhabitants in Mexico, the third republic of the world. Amalgamation simply meant Africanisation. The big nostrils, flat nose, massive jaw, protruding lip and kinky hair will register their animal marks over the proudest intellect and the rarest beauty of any other race. The rule that had no exception was that one drop of Negro blood makes a negro. What could be the outcome of it? What was his duty as a citizen and a member of civilised society? Since the scenes through which he had passed with Tom Camp and that mob the question was insistent and personal. It clouded his soul and weighed on him like the horrors of a nightmare. Again and again the fateful words the Preacher had dinned into his ears since childhood pressed upon him, "You can not build in a Democracy a nation inside a nation of two antagonistic races. The future American must be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto." His depression and brooding over the fearful events in which he had so recently taken part had tinged his life and all its hopes with sadness. He had reflected this in his letters to Sallie Worth without even mentioning the events. His heart was full of sickening foreboding. How could one love and be happy in a world haunted by such horrors! He had begged her to hasten her hour of final decision. He told her of his sense of loneliness and isolation, and of his inexpressible need of her love and presence in his daily life. Her answer had only intensified his moody feelings. She had written that her love grew stronger every day and his love more and more became necessary to her life, and yet she could not cloud its future with the anger of her father and the broken heart of her mother by an elopement. She feared such a shock would be fatal and all her life would be embittered by it. They must wait. She was using all her skill to win her father, but as yet without success. But she determined to win him, and it would be so. All this seemed so far away and shadowy to Gaston's eager restless soul. The letter had closed by saying she was preparing for another trip to Boston to visit Helen Lowell and that she should be absent at least a month. She asked that his next letter be addressed to Boston. Somehow Boston seemed just then out of the world on another planet, it was so far away and its people and their life so unreal to his imagination. But he sighed and turned resolutely to his work of preparation for an event in his life which he meant to make great in the history of the state. It was the meeting of the Democratic convention, as yet nearly two years in the future. He held a subordinate position in his party's councils, but defeat and ruin had taken the conceit out of the old line leaders and he knew that his day was drawing near. "I'll take my place among the leaders and masters of men," he told himself with quiet determination, "I will compel the General's respect; and if I can not win his consent, I will take her without it."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII EQUALITY WITH A RESERVATION The lynching at Hambright had stirred the whole nation into unusual indignant interest. It happened to be the climax of a series of such crimes committed in the South in rapid succession, and the death of this negro was reported with more than usual vividness by a young newspaper man of genius. A grand mass meeting was called in Cooper Union, New York, at which were gathered delegates from different cities and states to give emphasis and unity to the movement and issue an appeal to the national government. When Sallie Worth reached Boston, she found Helen Lowell at home alone. The Hon. Everett Lowell had made one of the speeches of his career at the mass meeting held in Faneuil Hall, and he was in New York where he had gone to make the principal address in the Cooper Union Convention of Negro sympathisers. George Harris had accompanied him, supremely fascinated by the eloquent and masterful appeal for human brotherhood he had heard him make in Boston. There was something pathetic in the dog-like worship this young negro gave to his brilliant patron. In his life in New England he had been shocked more than once by the brutal prejudices of the people against his race. His soul had been tried to the last of its powers of endurance at times. He found to his amazement that, when put to the test, the masses of the North had even deeper repugnance to the person of a Negro than the Southerners who grew up with him from the cradle. He had found himself cut off from every honourable way of earning his bread, gentleman and scholar though he was, and had looked into the river as he walked over the bridge to Cambridge one night with a well-nigh resistless impulse to end it all. But Lowell had cheered him, laughed his gloomy ideas to scorn, and more practical still, he had secured him a clerkship in the Custom House which settled the problem of bread. Others had failed him, but this man of trained powers had never failed him. He had taught him to lift up his head and look the world squarely in the face. Lowell was, to his vivid African imagination, the ideal man made in the image of God, calm in judgment, free from all superstitions and prejudices, a citizen of the world of human thought, a prince of that vast ethical aristocracy of free thinkers of all ages who knew no racial or conventional barriers between man and man. Harris had published a volume of poems which he had dedicated to Lowell, and his most inspiring verse was simply the outpouring of his soul in worship of this ideal man. He was his devoted worshipper for another and more powerful reason. In his daily intercourse with him in his library during his campaigns he had frequently met his beautiful daughter, and had fallen deeply and madly in love with her. This secret passion he had kept hidden in his sensitive soul. He had worshipped her from afar as though she had been a white-robed angel. To see her and be in the same house with her was all he asked. Now and then he had stood beside the piano and turned the music while she played and sang one of his new pieces, and he would live on that for month, eating his heart out with voiceless yearnings he dared not expose. In his music he made his greatest success. There was a fiery sweep to his passion, and a deep oriental rhythm in his cadence that held the imagination of his hearers in a spell. It is needless to say it was in this music he breathed his secret love. At first he had not dared to hope for the day when he could declare this secret or take his place in the list of her admirers and fight for his chance. But of late, a great hope had filled his soul and illumined the world. As he had listened to Lowell's impassioned appeals for human brotherhood, his scathing ridicule of pride and prejudice, and the poetic beauty of the language in which he proclaimed his own emancipation from all the laws of caste, the fiery eloquence with which he trampled upon all the barriers man had erected against his fellow man, his soul was thrilled into ecstasy with the conviction that this scholar and scientific thinker, at least, was a free man. He was sure that he had risen above the limitations of provincialisms, racial or national prejudices. He had begun to dream of the day he would ask this Godlike man for the privilege of addressing his daughter. The great meeting at Cooper Union had brought this dream to a sudden resolution. Lowell had outdone himself that night. With merciless invective he had denounced the inhuman barbarism of the South in these lynchings. The sea of eager faces had answered his appeals as water the breath of a storm. He felt its mighty reflex influence sweep back on his soul and lift him to greater heights. He demanded equality of man on every inch of this earth's soil. "I demand this perfect equality," he cried, "absolutely without reservation or subterfuge, both in form and essential reality. It is the life-blood of Democracy. It is the reason of our existence. Without this we are a living lie, a stench in the nostrils of God and humanity!" A cheer from a thousand negro throats rent the air as he thus closed. The crowd surged over the platform and for ten minutes it was impossible to restore order or continue the programme. Young Harris pressed his patron's hand and kissed it while tears of pride and gratitude rained down his face. This speech made a national sensation. It was printed in full in all the partisan papers where it was hoped capital might be made of it for the next political campaign, and the National Campaign Committee of which be was a member ordered a million copies of it printed for distribution among the negroes. When Lowell and Harris reached Boston, as they parted at the depot Harris said, "Will you be at home to-morrow, Mr. Lowell?" "Yes, why?" "I would like a talk with you in the morning on a matter of grave importance. May I call at nine o'clock?" "Certainly. Come right into the library. You'll find me there, George." That night as Lowell walked through his brilliantly lighted home, he felt a sense of glowing pride and strength. With his hands behind him he paced back and forth in his great library and out through the spacious hall with firm tread and flushed face. He felt he could look these great ancestors in the face to-night as they gazed down on him hm their heavy gold frames. They had called him to high ambitions and a strenuous life when his indolence had pleaded for ease and the dilettanteism of a fruitless dreaming. His father had cultivated his artistic tastes, dreamed and done nothing. But these grim-visaged, eagle-eyed ancestors had called him to a life of realities, and he had heard their voices. Yes, to-night his name was on a million lips. The door of the United States Senate was opening at his touch and mightier possibilities loomed in the future. He felt a sense of gratitude for the heritage of that stately old home and its inspiring memories. Its roots struck down into the soil of a thousand years, and spread beneath the ocean to that greater old world life. He felt his heart beat with pride that he was adding new honours to that family history, and adding to the soul-treasures his daughter's children would inherit. Seated in the library next morning Harris was nervous and embarrassed. He made two or three attempts to begin the subject but turned aside with some unimportant remark. "Well, George, what is the problem that makes you so grave this morning?" asked Lowell with kindly patronage. Harris felt that his hour had come, and he must face it. He leaned forward in his chair and looked steadily down at the rug, while he clasped both his hands firmly across his lap and spoke with great rapidity. "Mr. Lowell, I wish to say to you that you have taught me the greatest faith of life, faith in my fellow man without which there can be no faith in God. What I have suffered as a man as I have come in contact with the brutality with which my race is almost universally treated, God only can ever know. "The culture I have received has simply multiplied a thousandfold my capacity to suffer. But for the inspiration of your manhood I would have ended my life in the river. In you, I saw a great light. I saw a man really made in the image of God with mind and soul trained, with head erect, scorning the weak prejudices of caste, which dare to call the image of God clean or unclean in passion or pride. "I lifted up my head and said, one such man redeems a world from infamy. It's worth while to live in a world honoured by one such man, for he is the prophecy of more to come." He paused a moment, fidgeted with a piece of paper he had picked up from the table and seemed at a loss for a word. It never dawned on Lowell what he was driving at. He supposed, as a matter of course, he was referring to his great speeches and was going to ask for some promotion in a governmental department at Washington. "I'm proud to have been such on inspiration to you, George. You know how much I think of you. What is on your mind?" he asked at length. "I have hidden it from every human eye, sir, I am afraid to breath it aloud alone. I have only tried to sing it in song in an impersonal way. Your wonderful words of late have emboldened me to speak. It is this—I am madly, desperately in love with your daughter." Lowell sprang to his feet as though a bolt of lightning had suddenly shot down his backbone. He glared at the negro with wide dilated eyes and heaving breath as though he had been transformed into a leopard or tiger and was about to spring at his throat. Before answering, and with a gesture commanding silence, he walked rapidly to the library door and closed it. "And I have come to ask you," continued Harris ignoring his gesture, "if I may pay my addresses to her with your consent." "Harris, this is crazy nonsense. Such an idea is preposterous. I am amazed that it should ever have entered your head. Let this be the end of it here and now, if you have any desire to retain my friendship." Lowell said this with a scowl, and an emphasis of indignant rising inflection. The negro seemed stunned by this swift blow in his very teeth, that seemed to place him outside the pale of a human being. "Why is such a hope unreasonable, sir, to a man of your scientific mind?" "It is a question of taste," snapped Lowell. "Am I not a graduate of the same university with you? Did I not stand as high, and age for age, am I not your equal in culture?" "Granted. Nevertheless you are a negro, and I do not desire the infusion of your blood in my family." "But I have more of white than Negro blood, sir." "So much the worse. It is the mark of shame." "But it is the one drop of Negro blood at which your taste revolts, is it not?" "To be frank, it is." "Why is it an unpardonable sin in me that my ancestors were born under tropic skies where skin and hair were tanned and curled to suit the sun's fierce rays?" "All tropic races are not negroes, and your race has characteristics apart from accidents of climate that make it unique in the annals of man," rejoined Lowell. "And yet you demand perfect equality of man with man, absolutely in form and substance without reservation or subterfuge!" "Yes, political equality." "Politics is but a secondary phenomenon of society. You said absolute equality," protested Harris. "The question you broach is a question of taste, and the deeper social instincts of racial purity and self preservation. I care not what your culture, or your genius, or your position, I do not desire, and will not permit, a mixture of Negro blood in my family. The idea is nauseating, and to my daughter it would be repulsive beyond the power of words to express it!" "And yet," pleaded Harris, "you invited me to your home, introduced me to your daughter, seated me at your table, and used me in your appeal to your constituents, and now when I dare ask the privilege of seeking her hand in honourable marriage, you, the scholar, patriot, statesman and philosopher of Equality and Democracy, slam the door in my face and tell me that I am a negro! Is this fair or manly?" "I fail to see its unfairness." "It is amazing. You are a master of history and sociology. You know as clearly as I do that social intercourse is the only possible pathway to love. And you opened it to me with your own hand. Could I control the beat of my heart? There are some powers within us that are involuntary. You could have prevented my meeting your daughter as an equal. But all the will power of earth could not prevent my loving her, when once I had seen her, and spoken to her. The sound of the human voice, the touch of the human hand in social equality are the divine sacraments that open the mystery of love." "Social rights are one thing, political rights another," interrupted Lowell. "I deny it. If you are honest with yourself, you know it is not true. Politics is but a manifestation of society. Society rests on the family. The family is the unit of civilisation. The right to love and wed where one loves is the badge of fellowship in the order of humanity. The man who is denied this right in any society is not a member of it. He is outside any manifestation of its essential life. You had as well talk about the importance of clothes for a dead man, as political rights for such a pariah. You have classed him with the beasts of the field. As a human unit he does not exist for you." "Harris, it is utterly useless to argue a point like this," Lowell interrupted coldly. "This must be the end of our acquaintance. You must not enter my house again." "My God, sir, you can't kick me out of your house like this when you brought me to it, and made it an issue of life or death!" "I tell you again you are crazy. I have brought you here against her wishes. She left the house with her friend this morning to avoid seeing you. Your presence has always been repulsive to her, and with me it has been a political study, not a social pleasure." "I beg for only a desperate chance to overcome this feeling. Surely a man of your profound learning and genius can not sympathize with such prejudices? Let me try—let her decide the issue." "I decline to discuss the question any further." "I can't give up without a struggle!" the negro cried with desperation. Lowell rose with impatience. "Now you are getting to be simply a nuisance. To be perfectly plain with you, I haven't the slightest desire that my family with its proud record of a thousand years of history and achievement shall end in this stately old house in a brood of mulatto brats!" Harris winced and sprang to his feet trembling with passion. "I see," he sneered, "the soul of Simon Legree has at least become the soul of the nation. The South expresses the same luminous truth with a little more clumsy brutality. But their way is after all more merciful. The human body becomes unconscious at the touch of an oil-fed flame in sixty seconds. Your methods are more refined and more hellish in cruelty. You have trained my ears to hear eyes to see, hands to touch and heart to feel, that you might torture with the denial of every cry of body and soul and roast me in the flames of impossible desires for time and eternity!" "That will do now. There's the door!" thundered Lowell with a gesture of stern emphasis. "I happen to know the important fact that a man or woman of negro ancestry, though a century removed will suddenly breed back to a pure negro child, thick lipped, kinky headed, flat nosed, black skinned. One drop of your blood in my family could push it backward three thousand years in history. If you were able to win her consent, a thing unthinkable, I would do what old Virginius did in the Roman Forum, kill her with my own hand, rather than see her sink in your arms into the black waters of a Negroid life! Now go!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX THE NEW AMERICA Another year of struggle and suffering, hope and fear, Gaston had passed, and still he was no nearer the dream of realised love. If anything had changed, the General's pride had added new force to his determination that his daughter should not marry the man who had defied him. His chief reliance for Gaston's defeat was on time, and the broadening of Sallie's mind by extended travel. He had sent her abroad twice, and this year he sent her to spend another three months in Europe. These absences seemed only to intensify her longing for her lover. On her return the General would burst into a storm of rage at her persistence. She had ceased to give him any bitter answers, only smiling quietly and maintaining an ominous silence. He had a new cause now of dislike for the man of her choice. Gaston had become a man of acknowledged power in politics and was the leader of a group of radical young men who demanded the complete reorganisation of the Democratic party, the shelving of the old timers, among whom he was numbered, and the announcement of a radical programme upon the Negro issue. Radicalism of any sort he had always hated. Now, as advanced by this young upstart, it was doubly odious. The General had never given much time to his political duties, but his name was a power and he gave regularly to the campaign committee the largest cash contribution they received. He tried in a clumsy way to put Gaston off the State Executive Committee, but failed. He saw Gaston quietly laughing at him. Then he opened his pocket book and worked up a machine. It was a formidable power, and Gaston feared its influence in the coming convention. While this fight was in progress, and Sallie was in Europe, the destruction of the Maine in Havana harbour stilled the world into silence with the echo of its sullen roar. There was a moment's pause, and the nation lifted its great silk battle flags from the Capitol at Washington, and called for volunteers to wipe the empire of Spain from the map of the Western world. The war lasted but a hundred days, but in those hundred days was packed the harvest of centuries. War is always the crisis that flashes the search light into the souls of men and nations, revealing their unknown strength and weakness, and the changes that have been silently wrought in the years of peace. In these hundred days, statesmen who were giants suddenly shrivelled into pigmies and disappeared from the nation's life. Young men whose names were unknown became leaders of the republic and won immortal fame. We were afraid that our nation still lacked unity. The world said we were a mob of money-grubbers, and had lost our grasp of principle. The president called for 125,000 men to die for their flag, and next morning 800,000 were struggling for place in the line. We feared that religion might threaten the future with its bitter feud between the Roman Catholic and Protestant in a great crisis. We saw our Catholic regiments march forth to that war with screaming fife and throbbing drum and the flag of our country above them, going forth to fight an army that had been blessed by the Pope of Rome. The flag had become the common symbol of eternal justice, and the nation the organ through which all creeds and cults sought for righteousness. We feared the gulf between the rich and the poor had become impassable, and we saw the millionaire's son take his place in the ranks with the workingman. The first soldier wearing our uniform who fell before Santiago with a Spanish bullet in his breast, was an only son from a palatial home in New York, and by his side lay a cowboy from the West and a ploughboy from the South. Once more we showed the world that classes and clothes are but thin disguises that hide the eternal childhood of the soul. Sectionalism and disunity had been the most terrible realities in our national history. Our fathers had a poet leader whose soul dreamed a beautiful dream called E Pluribus Unum. But it had remained a dream. New England had threatened secession years before South Carolina in blind rage led the way. The Union was saved by a sacrifice of blood that appalled the world. And still millions feared the South might be false to her plighted honour at Appomattox. The ghost of Secession made and unmade the men and measures of a generation. Then came the trumpet call that put the South to the test of fire and blood. The world waked next morning to find for the first time in our history the dream of union a living fact. There was no North, no South,—but from the James to the Rio Grande the children of the Confederacy rushed with eager flushed faces to defend the flag their fathers had once fought. And God reserved in this hour for the South, land of ashes and tombs and tears, the pain and glory of the first offering of life on the altar of the new nation. Our first and only officer who fell dead on the deck of a warship, with the flag above him, was Worth Bagley, of North Carolina, the son of a Confederate soldier. The gallant youngster who stood on the bridge of the Merrimac, and between two towering mountains of flaming cannon, in the darkness of night blew up his ship and set a new standard of Anglo-Saxon daring, was the son of a Confederate soldier of North Carolina. The town of Hambright furnished a whole company of eighty-six men, a Captain, three Lieutenants, and a Major, who saw service in the war. When they were drawn up in the court house square under the old oak, the Preacher stood before them and called the roll from four browned parchments. They were Campbell county Confederate rosters. Every one of the eighty-six men was a child of the Confederacy. And the immortal company F, that was wiped out of existence at the battle of Gettysburg furnished more than half these children. "Ah, boys, blood will tell!" cried the Preacher, shaking hands with each man as they left. A single round from the guns, and it was over. The yellow flag of Spain, lit with the sunset splendour of a world empire, faded from the sky of the West. A new naval power had arisen to disturb the dreams of statesmen. The Oregon, that fierce leviathan of hammered steel had made her mark upon the globe. In a long black trail of smoke and ribbon of foam, she had circled the earth without a pause for breath. The thunder of her lips of steel over the shattered hulks of a European navy proclaimed the advent of a giant democracy that struck terror to the hearts of titled snobs. He who dreamed this monster of steel, felt her heart beat, saw her rush through foaming seas to victory, before the pick of a miner had struck the ore for her ribs from a mountain side, was a child of the Confederacy—that Confederacy whose desperate genius had sent the Alabama spinning round the globe in a whirlwind of fire. America united at last and invincible, waked to the consciousness of her resistless power. And, most marvellous of all, this hundred days of war had re-united the Anglo-Saxon race. This sudden union of the English speaking people in friendly alliance disturbed the equilibrium of the world, and confirmed the Anglo-Saxon in his title to the primacy of racial sway.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII A SPEECH THAT MADE HISTORY When General Worth received Gaston's brief and startling letter, the wires were hot between New York and Asheville for hours. His last message was a peremptory command to his daughter to join him immediately at Independence. When Sallie arrived at Oakwood the General was already there, and the storm broke in all its fury. At every bitter word she only quietly smiled, until the General was on the verge of collapse. Day after day he begged, pleaded, raged and finally took to hard swearing as he looked into her calm happy face. In the meantime McLeod and his henchman on the judge's bench had seen a new light. The excitement over the arrest of Gaston seemed to have fanned the flames of the Red Shirt movement into a conflagration. He was alarmed at its meaning. The judge heard a rumour that five thousand Red Shirts were mobilising at the foot of the Blue Ridge near Hambright, and that they were going to march across the mountains, into Asheville, demolish the jail, liberate Gaston, and hang the judge who had committed him without bail. The rumour was a fake, but he was not taking any chances. He issued an order releasing Gaston on his own recognisance, and left for a vacation. Gaston returned to Hambright showered with congratulatory telegrams from every quarter of the state. He received a brief note from Sallie saying the war was on but had not reached its final climax, as the General was now devoting his best energies to the Democratic convention which was to meet in ten days, when he expected to crush any "fool movement of young upstarts!" Gaston knew of his organisation but he was sure the number of delegates pledged to the General's machine was not enough to dominate the body, even if he could hold them in line. When this convention met at Raleigh, no body of representative men were ever more completely at sea as to the platform or policy upon which they would appeal to the people for the overthrow of an enemy. The coalition that conquered the state and held it with the grip of steel for four years was stronger than ever and was absolutely certain of victory. The enormous patronage of the Federal Government had been in their hands for four years, and with the state, county and municipal officers, a host of powerful leaders had been gathered around McLeod's daring personality. Apparently he was about to fasten the rule of the Negro and his allies on the state for a generation. When Gaston entered the convention hall he received an ovation, heartfelt and generous, but it did not reach the point of a disturbing element in the calculations of the three or four prominent candidates for Governor. General Worth had drilled his cohorts so thoroughly in opposition to him, that any sort of stampeding was out of the question. The platform committee was composed of seven leaders, among whom was Gaston. There was a long wrangle over the document, and at length when they reported, a sensation was created. For the first time since their triumph over Simon Legree the committee was divided, and, refusing to agree, submitted majority and minority reports. The committee stood five for the majority and two for the minority. Gaston and a daring young politician from the heart of the Black Belt signed the minority report. The majority report as submitted, was merely a rehash of the old platform on which they had been defeated by McLeod twice, with slight additional impeachment of the incapacity and corruption of the State Administration. The delegates from the Black Belt and the counties where the Red Shirts had been holding their noonday parades received it with silence. General Worth's machine cheered it vigourously, and gave a rousing reception to their chosen champion who made the presentation speech. When Gaston rose to offer and defend his minority report, a sudden hush fell on the sea of eager faces. A few men in the convention had heard him speak. All had heard he was an orator of power, and were anxious to see him. His leadership in the Revolution of Independence and his subsequent arrest and imprisonment had made him a famous man. "Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Convention:" he began with deliberate clear voice which spoke of greater reserve power than the words he uttered conveyed—"I move to substitute for this document of meaningless platitudes the following resolution on which to make this campaign." You could have heard a pin fall, as in ringing tones like the call of bugle to battle he read, "Whereas, it is impossible to build a state inside a state of two antagonistic races, And whereas, the future of North Carolina must therefore be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto, Resolved, that the hour has now come in our history to eliminate the Negro from our life and reestablish for all time the government of our fathers." The delegates from New Hanover, Craven, and Halifax counties, the great centres of the Black Belt, sprang on their seats with a roar of applause that shook the building, and pandemonium broke loose. When one great wave subsided another followed. It was ten minutes before order was restored while Gaston stood calmly surveying the storm. Just before him sat General Worth, pale and trembling with excitement. The audacity of those resolutions had swept him for a moment off his feet and back into the years of his own daring young manhood. He could not help admiring this challenge of the modern world to stand at the bar of elemental manhood and make good its right to existence. He was about to summon his messengers and rally his lieutenants when Gaston began to speak, and his first words chained his attention. While the tumult raised by his resolutions was in progress he lifted his eye toward the gallery and there just above him where it curved toward the platform sat his beautiful secret bride. His heart leaped. Her face was aflame with emotion, her eyes flashing with love and pride. She slyly touched with her lips the tip of her finger and blew a kiss across the intervening space. He smiled into her soul a look of gratitude, and with every nerve strung to its highest tension resumed his place by the speaker's stand. When the tumult died away he began a speech that fixed the history of a state for a thousand years. His resolutions had wrought the crowd to the highest pitch of excitement, and his words, clear, penetrating, and deliberate thrilled his hearers with electrical power. "Gentlemen:" he said, and the slightest whisper was hushed. "The history of man is a series of great pulse bears, whose flood overwhelms his future and fixes its life. Like the dammed torrent on a mountain side, it breaks the conservatism that holds it stagnant for generations and floods the world with its sweep. Theories, creeds, and institutions hallowed by age, are cast as rubbish on the scarred hills that mark its course. The old world is buried and a new one appears. "The Anglo-Saxon is entering the new century with the imperial crown of the ages on his brow and the sceptre of the infinite in his hands. "The Old South fought against the stars in their courses—the resistless tide of the rising consciousness of Nationality and World-Mission. The young South greets the new era and glories in its manhood. He joins his voice in the cheers of triumph which are ushering in this all-conquering Saxon. Our old men dreamed of local supremacy. We dream of the conquest of the globe. Threads of steel have knit state to state. Steam and electricity have silently transformed the face of the earth, annihilated time and space, and swept the ocean barriers from the path of man. The black steam shuttles of commerce have woven continent to continent. "We believe that God has raised up our race, as he ordained Israel of old, in this world-crisis to establish and maintain for weaker races, as a trust for civilisation, the principles of civil and religious Liberty and the forms of Constitutional Government. "In this hour of crisis, our flag has been raised over ten millions of semi-barbaric black men in the foulest slave pen of the Orient. Shall we repeat the farce of '67, reverse the order of nature, and make these black people our rulers? If not, why should the African here, who is not their equal, be allowed to imperil our life?" A whirlwind of applause shook the building. "A crisis approaches in the history of the human race. The world is stirred by its consciousness today. The nation must gird up her loins and show her right to live,—to master the future or be mastered in the struggle. New questions press upon us for solution. "Shall this grand old commonwealth lag behind and sink into the filth and degradation of a Negroid corruption in this solemn hour of the world?" "No! No!" screamed a thousand voices. "What is our condition to-day in the dawn of the twentieth century? If we attempt to move forward we are literally chained to the body of a festering Black Death! "Fifty of our great counties are again under the heel of the Negro, and the state is in his clutches. Our city governments are debauched by his vote. His insolence threatens our womanhood, and our children are beaten by negro toughs on the way to school while we pay his taxes. Shall we longer tolerate negro inspectors of white schools, and negroes in charge of white institutions? Shall we longer tolerate the arrest of white women by negro officers and their trial before negro magistrates? "Let the manhood of the Aryan race with its four thousand years of authentic history answer that question!" With blazing eyes, and voice that rang with the deep peal of defiant power, Gaston hurled that sentence like a thunder bolt into the souls of his two thousand hearers. The surging host sprang to their feet and shouted back an answer that made the earth tremble! Lifting his hand for silence he continued, "It is no longer a question of bad government. It is a question of impossible government. We lag behind the age dragging the decaying corpse to which we are chained. "Who shall deliver us from the body of this death? "Hear me, men of my race, Norman and Celt, Angle and Saxon, Dane and Frank, Huguenot and German martyr blood! "The hour has struck when we must rise in our might, break the chains that bind us to this corruption, strike down the Negro as a ruling power, and restore to our children their birthright, which we received, a priceless legacy, from our fathers. "I believe in God's call to our race to do His work in history. What other races failed to do, you wrought in this continental wilderness, fighting pestilence, hunger, cold, wild beasts, and savage hordes, until out of it all has grown the mightiest nation of the earth. "Is the Negro worthy to rule over you? "Ask history. The African has held one fourth of this globe for 3000 years. He has never taken one step in progress or rescued one jungle from the ape and the adder, except as the slave of a superior race. "In Hayti and San Domingo he rose in servile insurrection and butchered fifty thousand white men, women and children a hundred years ago. He has ruled these beautiful islands since. Did he make progress with the example of Aryan civilisation before him? No. But yesterday we received reports of the discovery of cannibalism in Hayti. "He has had one hundred years of trial in the Northern states of this Union with every facility of culture and progress, and he has not produced one man who has added a feather's weight to the progress of humanity. In an hour of madness the dominion of the ten great states of the South was given him without a struggle. A saturnalia of infamy followed. "Shall we return to this? You must answer. The corruption of his presence in our body politic is beyond the power of reckoning. We drove the Carpet-bagger from our midst, but the Scalawag, our native product, is always with us to fatten on this corruption and breed death to society. The Carpet-bagger was a wolf, the Scalawag is a hyena. The one was a highwayman, the other a sneak. "So long as the Negro is a factor in our political life, will violence and corruption stain our history. We can not afford longer to play with violence. We must remove the cause. "Suffrage in America has touched the lowest tide-mud of degradation. If our cities and our Southern civilisation are to be preserved, there must be a return to the sanity of the founders of this Republic. "A government of the wealth, virtue and intelligence of the community, by the debased and the criminal, is a relapse to elemental barbarism to which no race of freemen can submit. "Shall the future North Carolinian be an Anglo-Saxon or a Mulatto? That is the question before you. "Nations are made by men, not by paper constitutions and paper ballots. We are not free because we have a Constitution. We have a Constitution because our pioneer fathers who cleared the wilderness and dared the might of kings, were freemen. It was in their blood, the tutelage of generation on generation beyond the seas, the evolution of centuries of struggle and sacrifice. "If you can make men out of paper, then it is possible with a scratch of a pen in the hand of a madman to transform by its magic a million slaves into a million kings. "We grant the Negro the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness if he can be happy without exercising kingship over the Anglo-Saxon race, or dragging us down to his level. But if he can not find happiness except in lording it over a superior race, let him look for another world in which to rule. There is not room for both of us on this continent!" Again and again Gaston raised his hand to still the mad tumult of applause his words evoked. "And we will fight it out on this line, if it takes a hundred years, two hundred, five hundred, or a thousand. It took Spain eight hundred years to expel the Moors. When the time comes the Anglo-Saxon can do in one century what the Spaniard did in eight. "We have been congratulated on our self-restraint under the awful provocation of the past four years. There is a limit beyond which we dare not go, for at this point, self-restraint becomes pusillanimous and means the loss of manhood." He then reviewed with thrilling power the history of the state and the proud part played in the development of the Republic. He showed how this border wilderness of North Carolina became the cradle of American Democracy and the typical commonwealth of freemen. He played with the heart-strings of his hearers in this close personal history as a great master touches the strings of a harp. His voice was now low and quivering with the music of passion, and then soft and caressing. He would swing them from laughter to tears in a single sentence, and in the next, the lightning flash of a fierce invective drove into their hearts its keen blade so suddenly the vast crowd started as one man and winced at its power. Through it all he was conscious of two blue eyes swimming in tears looking down on him from the gallery. The crowd now had grown so entranced, and the torrent of his speech so rapid, they forgot to cheer and feared to cheer lest they should lose a word of the next sentence. They hung breathless on every flash of feeling from his face or eloquent gesture. "I am not talking of a vague theory of constructive dominion," he continued, "when I refer to the Negro supremacy under which our civilisation is being degraded. I use words in their plain meaning. Negro supremacy means the rule of a party in which negroes predominate and that means a Negro oligarchy. "I call your attention to one typical county of over forty thus degraded, the county of Craven, whose quaint old city was once the Capital of this commonwealth. What are the facts? The negro office-holders of Craven county include a Congressman, a member of the Legislature, a Register of Deeds, the City Attorney, the Coroner, two Deputy Sheriffs, two County Commissioners, a Member of the School Board, three Road Overseers, four Constables, twenty-seven Magistrates, three City Aldermen and four Policemen. There are sixty-two negro officials in this county of 12,000 inhabitants, and their member of the Legislature is a convicted felon. The white people represent ninety-five per cent of the wealth and intelligence of the community, and pay ninety-five per cent of its taxes and are voiceless in its government. "Would a county in Massachusetts submit to such infamy? No, ten thousand times, no! There is not a county in the North from Maine to California that would submit to it twenty-four hours. Will the children of Lexington, Concord and Bunker Hill demand such submission now from the children of Washington and Jefferson? No. The passions that obscured reason have subsided. The Anglo-Saxon race is united and has entered upon its world mission. "We will take from an unprofitable servant the ballot he has abused. To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken may even that which he hath. It is the law of nature. It is the law of God. "Yes, I confess it," he continued, "I am in a sense narrow and provincial. I love mine own people. Their past is mine, their present mine, their future is a divine trust. I hate the dish water of modern world-citizenship. A shallow cosmopolitanism is the mask of death for the individual. It is the froth of civilisation, as crime is its dregs. Race, and race pride, are the ordinances of life. The true citizen of the world loves his country. His country is a part of God's world. "So I confess I love my people. I love the South,—the stolid silent South, that for a generation has sneered at paper-made policies, and scorned public opinion. The South, old-fashioned, mediaeval, provincial, worshipping the dead, and raising men rather than making money, family loving, home building, tradition ridden. The South, cruel and cunning when fighting a treacherous foe, with brief volcanic bursts of wrath and vengeance. The South, eloquent, bombastic, romantic, chivalrous, lustful, proud, kind and hospitable. The South with her beautiful women and brave men. The South, generous and reckless, never knowing her own interest, but living her own life in her own way!—Yes, I love her! In my soul are all her sins and virtues. And with it all she is worthy to live. "The historian tells us that all things pass in time. Wolves whelp and stable in the palaces of dead kings and forgotten civilisations. Memphis, Thebes and Babylon are but names to-day. So New Orleans and New York may perish. African antiquarians may explore their ruins and speculate upon their life; but we may safely fix upon a thousand centuries of intervening time. On your shoulders now rests the burden of civilisation. We must face its responsibilities. For my part, I believe in your future. "The courage of the Celt, the nobility of the Norman, the vigour of the Viking, the energy of the Angle, the tenacity of the Saxon, the daring of the Dane, the gallantry of the Gaul, the freedom of the Frank, the earth-hunger of the Roman and the stoicism of the Spartan are all yours by the lineal heritage of blood, from sire and dame through hundreds of generations and through centuries of culture. "Will you halt now and surrender to a mob of ragged negroes led by white cowards who at the first clash of conflict will hide in sewers? "I ask you, my people, freemen, North Carolinians, to rise to-day and make good your right to live! The time for platitudes is past. Let us as men face the world and say what we mean. "This is a white man's government, conceived by white men, and maintained by white men through every year of its history,—and by the God of our Fathers it shall be ruled by white men until the Arch-angel shall call the end of time! "If this be treason, let them that hear it make the most of it. "From the eighth day of November we will not submit to Negro dominion another day, another hour, another moment! Back of every ballot is a bayonet, and the red blood of the man who holds it. Let cowards hear, and remember this! Man has never yet voted away his right to a revolution. "Citizen kings, I call you to the consciousness of your kingship!" Gaston closed and turned toward his seat, while the crowd hung breathless waiting for his next word. When they realised that he had finished, a rumble like the crash in midheaven of two storms rolled over the surging sea of men, broke against the girders of the roof like the thunder of the Hatteras surf lashed by a hurricane. Two thousand men went mad. With one common impulse they sprang to their feet screaming, shouting, cheering, shaking each other's hands, crying and laughing. With the sullen roar of crashing thunder another whirlwind of cheers swept the crowd, shook the earth, and pierced the sky with its challenge. Wave after wave of applause swept the building and flung their people, slow to anger, now terrible in wrath, were trembling with the pent-up passion and fury of years. What power could resist their wrath! Through it all Gaston sat silent behind the group of the majority of the platform committee, with eyes devouring a beautiful face bending toward him from the gallery. She was softly weeping with love and pride too deep for words. While the tumult was still raging, before he was conscious of his presence, General Worth's stalwart figure was bending over him, and grasping his hand. "My boy, I give it up. You have beaten me. I'm proud of you. I forgive everything for that speech. You can have my girl. The date you've fixed for the marriage suits me. Let us forget the past." Gaston pressed his hand muttering brokenly his thanks, and his soul sank within him at the thought of this proud old iron-willed warrior's anger if he discovered their secret marriage. The General turned toward the side of the platform; for he had seen the flash of Sallie's dress on the stairs of the balcony leading to the stage. He knew her keen eye had seen his surrender and his heart was hungry for the kiss of reconciliation that would restore their old perfect love. He met her at the foot of the stairs and she threw her arms impulsively around his neck. "Oh! Papa, dear! I am the happiest girl in the world. The two men of all men—the only two I love—are mine forever!" While the applause was still echoing and reechoing over the sea of surging men, and thousands of excited people were crowding the windows from the outside and blocking the streets in every direction clamouring for admittance, a tall man with grey beard and stentorian voice, sprang on the platform. It was General Worth's candidate for Governor. He had not consulted the General but he had an important motion to make. The crowd was stilled at last and his deep voice rang through the building, "Gentlemen, I move that the minority report offered by Charles Gaston"—again a thunder peal of applause—"be adopted as the platform by acclamation!" A storm of "ayes" burst from the throats of the delegates in a single breath like the crash of an explosion of dynamite. "And now that our eyes have seen the glory of the Lord, as we heard His messenger anointed to lead His people, I move that this convention nominate by acclamation for Governor—Charles Gaston!" Again two thousand men were on their feet shouting, cheering, shaking hands, hugging one another and weeping and yelling like maniacs. A speech had been made that changed the current of history, and fixed the status of life for millions of people.</field>
